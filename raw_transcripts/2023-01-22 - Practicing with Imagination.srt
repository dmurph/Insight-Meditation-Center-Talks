1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:08,899
so good good morning everyone can you hear me okay is it loud enough

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:16,859
and um thank you for being here to speak personally for myself I find

3
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:24,680
that really wonderful to meditate together in a group it's a different kind of uh

4
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:35,219
there's a different I don't know exactly the right word to use but a different kind of grounding a different kind of

5
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:42,000
kind of settleness that when the group of people sit together and of course that can be quite

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,440
wonderful for sometimes and it could also be difficult because it also highlights maybe how

7
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:56,399
Restless the mind is or how much you know impatience there might be and you know

8
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,559
ordinarily we wouldn't see that so clearly because

9
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:07,220
we might um just get up and

10
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,680
turn the TV on or do something to distract us go eat or something

11
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,380
and but here kind of like maybe because you're with other people there's a little bit more care to keep the

12
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:26,700
container to keep the stay within it and then it could clear out I'm really impatient or why does my

13
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:34,259
mind and mind is out of control they can't wait until this is over you know surely they they must have

14
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:41,520
slept through the Bell and so we get to see what the Mind does

15
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:49,320
you know and that that's a really one of the gifts of meditation is to see ourselves clearly both at what is

16
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:55,200
wonderful but also what is challenging for us so we can take really see it honestly and clearly

17
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:02,939
and find a way to work through it and um the topic I want to talk today

18
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:09,720
about today is the imagination and uh in our

19
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,180
the way I was kind of brought up in Buddhism first in Zen and also in vipassana

20
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:22,620
we were kind of like the anti-imagination people because imagination we're like the just

21
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:29,040
seeing things as they are people like just see things as they are directly the direct experience of what is

22
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,660
and Imagination is a way of losing touch with how things are directly it's like

23
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:41,940
superimposing some ideas a projection of some fantasy or something on a situation

24
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:48,060
that distorts it in some way and at least that's that's the way that I was kind of I came into this tradition

25
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,700
and uh and I'm grateful for that I'm grateful for how much it pulled the rug

26
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,739
from underneath or clarified how much fantasy I lived in

27
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:05,940
which was plenty and how much I projected artificially you know constructs on top of the others the

28
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:12,120
world and also on top of myself there's so many ways in which I imagined who I

29
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,220
was or imagined who I shouldn't be or measured myself against some imaginary

30
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:24,480
idea of what a person's going to be and so the imagination played a big role in having this this kind of practice that

31
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,599
constantly pointed that out that don't go there don't go there was actually very helpful for me

32
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:38,819
but it also limits our full Humanity that imagination is important and part

33
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:46,080
of human life it's so important that it's probably unimaginable without it

34
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,799
I think we're always imagining somehow even if you're um you know you go out for a walk on a

35
00:03:52,799 --> 00:04:00,120
cloudy day and you imagine what it would be like if it rained you know it might rain that's kind of imagination

36
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,340
and so you take an umbrella if you hadn't kind of that kind of idea

37
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:10,860
of imagination maybe you you wouldn't have gotten the umbrella or something

38
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:18,060
I don't know if that was a good example but uh my attempt so it turns out that in the teachings of

39
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:26,160
the Buddha there's a lot of different teachings about imagination however the English translators often

40
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,520
don't translate it that way they one of the words for that I'd like

41
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:38,040
to translate is Imagination they might translate as conceives and conceives I

42
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:46,139
don't know what imagination that evokes for you but conceives it feels to me a little

43
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:53,520
more conceptual like you have a concept you create what's delightful about conceives is it

44
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:00,540
has a connotation that you're inventing something you're CR brings something into birth you're conceiving something

45
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:08,160
maybe it is a fantasy doesn't really exist but um and then there's also a words

46
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:15,120
that uh sometimes translated as one regards you know regards what does that mean

47
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,280
um and but the the the Pali word is uh

48
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:26,160
has the word uh see or visualize in it some nepasity

49
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,460
and um and so but the way it's used if you see it kind of a kind of just like

50
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:38,460
to visualize or imagine so here's a Buddha's use of imagination

51
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,620
I'll give you an example and it's supposed to evoke your imagination

52
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:49,259
in a way that makes a point that maybe inspires you maybe gets you to think

53
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:54,539
about a different something in a different way and maybe points to Something in

54
00:05:54,539 --> 00:06:02,340
yourself or in human nature that that um is better better kind of conveyed

55
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:08,220
through an act of imagination than it is to tell you this in prose

56
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:17,639
just like matter-of-fact way so this is this is this has come from the Buddha that's uh I'll paraphrase it for but um

57
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:23,940
so at least in the time of the Buddha at least there was a great

58
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:30,240
God in the Heavenly Realms named Brahma and Brahma was kind of like the ruler of

59
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,940
all the gods of his realm and he had a great palace Majestic in

60
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:42,060
the sky somewhere and he had a majestic you know

61
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:47,819
a gust throne only person who's supposed to sit on

62
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:53,699
that Throne is Brahma himself well one day Brahma was off some other

63
00:06:53,699 --> 00:07:00,600
parts of the Heavenly realms doing what Brahma does and there was a little

64
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:06,060
ugly little runt of a troll and not that they had trolls in Ancient

65
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:12,419
India but the the Indian word is probably those of

66
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:18,960
you know Sanskrit yaksha so he came into the palace and came into

67
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,660
the Royal Court or the Divine court and jumped up on that throne

68
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:30,660
and this you don't do and so the other gods in the court started telling that you know you

69
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:37,259
shouldn't be up there you know that's only for Brahma please get down and he wouldn't get down

70
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:43,500
so a common thing to do and something so important is not being adhered to is to

71
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:49,139
get angry and so the voices went up and the other God said you have to get down you must

72
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:55,740
get down and and the more angry they were and the more Stern they were and offensive they were

73
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:01,680
the more that ugly little yaksha got bigger

74
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:09,360
and bigger and more beautiful and More Beautiful until he was sitting there huge and big

75
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:16,020
and radiant and Beautiful on the throne well this confused the court Gods to no

76
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:22,139
end so they went looking for Brahma and explained what was going on

77
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:30,780
and Brahma said I know what's happening so in a snap of his finger because he's a God he returned to his Palace

78
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:37,800
and he stood in front of this his own throne and he bowed deeply

79
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:43,140
to the yaksha and said nice to see you

80
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:50,040
we haven't seen each other for a long time and you're quite beautiful big and I

81
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:56,880
hope you're comfortable up there and anything I can do for you and as he kind of treated in that way

82
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:03,779
kindly generously with kind of hospitality at his own

83
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:11,160
place this Yorkshire started to shrink and shrink and get smaller and smaller and

84
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:16,980
smaller until finally poof he managed

85
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:22,560
so then the great God Brahma sat up back on his throne and explained to everyone

86
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,880
in the court this ugly little brunt of a troll

87
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:37,080
is an anger eating troll so if you come with

88
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,660
anger he'll eat it it nourishes him and he

89
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:49,560
grows and becomes bigger and bigger and bigger but if you don't offer anger then you're

90
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:56,160
not nourishing this challenging thing and it gets smaller and smaller and

91
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:03,480
smaller so that's the story so it's you know may it's a fable maybe

92
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:12,060
it happened back then but uh it's the to tell that story is uh evokes the act of imagination for

93
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:18,180
the audience and I think for some of us it's kind of evocative like what does this mean like

94
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:24,180
you can imagine it and all that and imagine these people angry and this person getting bigger and

95
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:31,620
and it's kind of a fable for careful what you do with your anger

96
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:37,440
because some of the some of who you are some of the challenging parts of you

97
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:43,080
if you are angry something grows in you

98
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:50,640
and probably none of you have an angry little runt of a troll inside of you but but you know you have something in

99
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:56,880
there and sometimes anger is self-fulfilling you would get angry and we get angry at

100
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,040
ourselves and we feel awful and bad and then we kind of get more angry and more

101
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:07,320
blame and upset and so uh this idea that there's

102
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:13,079
something that thrives in anger but that

103
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:18,480
diminishes and vanishes in kindness is I think you know it's a wonderful

104
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:25,579
little story and it's a story that I've used I've taught to children I've been invited to um

105
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:31,079
elementary schools to teach kids like just introduce kids say something Buddhist or something and I've told that

106
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:36,959
story and um

107
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:42,600
so um so yeah that's a kind of a use of

108
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:49,440
imagination you know harnessing it for the purposes of making some point and the Buddha is full of things like

109
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,140
that and uh and he uses them also for the purposes of supporting people's

110
00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:03,060
meditation practice he wanted he he encouraged people to use their imagination their memory

111
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:08,519
to recollect things that were inspired them

112
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:13,860
so there was an inspiration of gladness of joy of delight

113
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:19,200
that's associated with meditation practice and you know you don't want to overdo it

114
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,600
if you know sometimes you're kind of supposed to be miserable in meditation

115
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:30,240
um but not you're supposed to make yourself that way but but it just we're supposed to kind

116
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:37,980
of really meet ourselves as we are and some people are experts at running away and trying to avoid and fix and not

117
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:45,180
face what's going on but can we Face really the difficulties in our challenges and unresolved issues

118
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:50,760
can we Face them with a way that's inspired that we're glad to look at our

119
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:56,240
impatience even though I'm restless and want to bolt from meditation

120
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,860
wow is it some way that you can feel okay this is difficult but I'm inspired

121
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:08,579
I want to do this and so the Buddha uh encouraged people to call on their imagination for that

122
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:15,540
purpose so for example to imagine your own virtue

123
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:21,600
and if you have enough virtue that makes you inspired oh yeah you know I'm basically a good person

124
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:28,680
I haven't killed anyone lately and I haven't robbed any banks lately you know it's pretty good

125
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:35,480
unfortunately for this world it's pretty good because you know so much bad stuff happens

126
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:42,839
and um and so um or think about somebody else's virtue

127
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:48,000
that you know that you really inspires you that's think about something that makes you

128
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,300
happy um I know that I've sometimes been in meditation and struggled and then

129
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,639
there's been someone else on the retreat who sat so well

130
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:04,680
they just felt they're kind of simple almost selfless dedication just to be

131
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:11,279
there and practice all the time in a nice way and wow okay well if that person can do it I think I'll stay here

132
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:16,320
and so now my eyes I remember that person sit there okay keep going that's

133
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,360
an act of imagination of sorts and then for oh so there's a challenge

134
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:27,060
is called the five hindrances the five obstacles for meditation

135
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:32,940
of preoccupation with or addiction to things like sensual desire

136
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:40,560
ill will um freezing or becoming really stiff or

137
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:46,079
closed down inertia restlessness

138
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:51,720
and doubt and so the meditators have to work with this

139
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:58,139
the Buddha gave one set of of similes to describe what it's like

140
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:04,620
to you know to have these another set of similes for what it's like to not have

141
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:10,500
them and here he's using the imagination to give people and maybe in a a palpable

142
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:17,160
visceral sense feeling for what it's like when these aren't here

143
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:22,380
so we can recognize their absence so we can kind of look at the little opening

144
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:28,980
in our hearts that kind of show us well this is the way you know not to be caught by these

145
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:34,199
things so I'll uh so

146
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:39,959
um so freedom from addiction preoccupation

147
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:47,699
of essential desire is visualized and he used as the word visual visualize here

148
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:54,240
a person who has paid off a business loan when the business business has prospered

149
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,339
and you can now support their family isn't that nice

150
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:04,380
so I don't know if any of you have really been struggling under death I don't know what central desire

151
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:11,639
addiction to it is like how it's a death exactly but the freedom from that thing oh now I don't have this heaviness this

152
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:16,740
uh preoccupation this concern this constant nagging that I have to kind of

153
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:23,399
pay the debt back and freedom and again the word freedom

154
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:31,260
is an opera in a word that evokes something in the imagination uh freedom from ill will is visualized

155
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:38,339
as a person who is ill suffering terribly sick with no appetite and

156
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:44,040
weakened body who recovers and regains their appetite and bodily strength

157
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:50,399
some of you have probably been really sick and finally when you're well and the first time you can leave your house wow

158
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,920
I'm still weak but boy is it good to be in fresh air and kind of as delightful

159
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:02,160
finally we've relieved of ill will we carried the resentment for years and years people carry resentment

160
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:10,199
for a lifetime but then to find it finally lifts oh wow it's like that illness is gone

161
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:14,178
I hope I have nothing immunity

162
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:23,280
freedom from this kind of inertia stiffness usually called sloth and

163
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,500
torpor but uh kind of um resistance

164
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:35,460
is as a person is freed from prison and bondage

165
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:42,360
without any lost to Lost to their wealth kind of you know so when we're stuck in

166
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:47,820
some kind of heavy burden weighing down kind of mental state

167
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:52,760
it's kind of like being in prison so the freedom from prison

168
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:58,500
freedom from restlessness or agitation

169
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:05,520
a person who had been a slave dependent on others and unable to go wherever they

170
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,919
wish becomes a free person who is independent of others and is able to go

171
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:16,140
anywhere so agitation something that's not your

172
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:22,440
choice is kind of forcing you to be do things and be engaged and be busy and

173
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:29,520
involved and so agitations you know he feels like you're a slave of something and finally this other thing in you

174
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:37,380
you're independent of you're not caught by it freedom from doubt is visualized as a

175
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:42,480
person with many possessions and much wealth who manages to travel

176
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:48,200
through a desert to safety with no loss in property

177
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:53,280
so doubt somehow is like being in the desert it's dangerous place if you're

178
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,799
caught in doubt you don't act you don't protect things you don't take care of things you just don't know what to do I

179
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:05,760
guess and um so to finally be free from this being lost in the desert

180
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:12,960
so I don't know if those you know these are ancient similes so I don't know if these work for you but the principle I'm

181
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,059
trying to pass on here was the Buddha used the act of imagination and to try

182
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:25,140
to evoke that for people and there's kind of two general types of imagination the Buddha used or pointed

183
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:31,740
to the acts of imagination that he used different words to describe words to describe

184
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:39,059
uh one are the ones that are I I like to call uh recollective just to recollect

185
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:45,179
something that is from your world that you somehow have a connection to so

186
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:51,660
it's evoking something you're already familiar with hopefully none of you have been a slave

187
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:58,679
or been in prison but uh it's part of unfortunately part of our wider world

188
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:04,980
and we've had examples we've read about such things we know about such things exist so it's recollecting something

189
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:10,500
we've learned about in some ways the other form of imagination is

190
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:16,760
inventive and that is it has not doesn't really have much to do with the real world

191
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:26,120
except in terms of fantasy and um and one imagines things

192
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:32,880
so the recollective one that's used beneficial

193
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:39,720
has many purposes and I'll offer you one purpose for a Dharma practice

194
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:47,220
through another Act of imagination the recollective imagination is to help

195
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:55,520
the heart sing does your heart sing I haven't heard me here

196
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:02,460
um you know it's a it's a metaphor for something that I think for some of us

197
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:09,780
kind of just feels like there's a delight The Joy a lightness a kind of freedom of expression from our hearts

198
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:17,340
what a great thing for the heart to be this way and so this opening this kind of delight

199
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:24,620
so it makes the hearts or make the heart smile it's also you know again an act of imagination

200
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:31,380
um versus the ones that uh feel that uh feel like burdens

201
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:38,000
that feel like having heavy weight on your shoulders it feels like the world is closing in on you

202
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,940
and the and the the inventive ones the ones where we kind of

203
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:51,380
construct some kind of fantasy that is not really part of the real world

204
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:57,360
is where we often get in trouble so delusions of grandeur

205
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:04,559
you know that I'm better than everyone else or better than those people and that I think many people are one way

206
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:11,460
or others are just you know easy enough to fall into and that's that would be inventive you

207
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:18,780
know because it's creating something which doesn't really exist in the real world in a in the real non-human world

208
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:24,480
uh the non-inventive world and that is it's a comparison with other

209
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,720
people delusionary Grandeur is in contrast to other people I'm going to save everyone in the world

210
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,360
and um and um that's just an event invention of the Mind

211
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:41,700
that is usually a burden for other people too

212
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:49,020
the um so you know so what are the what are the

213
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:55,679
stories the imagination that we project on ourselves that diminishes us

214
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:01,380
so we imagine ourselves as being worse than others we imagine ourselves to be inadequate

215
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:08,460
we imagine ourselves to be somehow um you know

216
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:14,760
something or other it was so bad for me when I was quite Young when I was a member of like in or like in college

217
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:20,460
first year to a college that the only relief I could get sometimes

218
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:25,500
was uh to imagine that I was invisible to everybody

219
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:31,919
and so I'd go through campus kind of imagining no one could see me and so that was act imagination that gave me

220
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:37,080
some relief because the alternative was so worse you know that I was constantly comparing

221
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:42,659
myself as being less than worse than terrible or something I was somehow wrong

222
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:49,500
and um I didn't have to I didn't have to have a reason to be a wrong person I was just inherently wrong

223
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,780
so you know it was very relatively simple fantasy to have because it didn't

224
00:23:54,780 --> 00:24:01,080
have didn't require any proof and um so

225
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:08,700
it turns out that this famous teaching that Buddhism has about there is the the

226
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:15,360
the fantasy way in which it's presented as I say that carefully is a fantasy it's a

227
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:22,860
misunderstanding is that Buddha teaches there is no self have you heard that idea

228
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:30,380
he actually didn't teach it that way but what he did teach repeatedly

229
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:36,780
is the use of the word imagine ATI

230
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:42,980
that if you um to imagine

231
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:49,980
what's me what's myself and who I really am that is a problem

232
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:57,360
don't imagine yourself as a certain kind of self don't imagine

233
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:03,960
yourself as possessing certain qualities and activities don't imagine that you

234
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:09,120
are that you you know building yourself up in a particular way

235
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:16,880
so the the one of the main thrusts of this teachings is not to deny the self

236
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:23,880
it's also not in any kind of way to build itself up to invent the self

237
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:31,559
with the imagination don't imagine it and we have plenty of help in imagining

238
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:39,299
yourself there's people you know in the advertisement industry who are paid a

239
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:45,659
tremendous amount of money to trick us into imagining ourselves in

240
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:52,020
one way or the other imagining we're inadequate in some ways and would become adequate if we you know have a different

241
00:25:52,020 --> 00:26:00,360
color lipstick and um and so we're being fed this kind of into the imagination constantly

242
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:08,400
I think politicians do it sometimes the imagination is used to demonize the enemy or demonize people

243
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:16,080
who are the opposition and they're using our capacity for imagination to construct to invent the

244
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:22,559
other in a way that's deleterious and so this thing about imagining a self

245
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:30,000
Imagining the self of others is such a dangerous thing the internalized imagination that other

246
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,220
people project racism that sometimes is is an imagination that's projected on

247
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:40,679
people and then some people that internalize it

248
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:47,460
some people adopt it they believe it and also both sides of the racism divide

249
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:54,840
and it's it's an act of imagination it's an invention of some kind of concept idea that then unfortunately has a

250
00:26:54,840 --> 00:27:02,880
tremendous reality in how people treat each other and so the teachings of around self and

251
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:09,679
non-self has a lot to do with don't imagine a self

252
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:18,000
and as we learn to notice this inventive way in which the mind

253
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:25,799
has these ideas fantasies condemnations

254
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:32,640
ideas of who I am when I'm supposed to be what I am in relationship with other people who I am that otherwise other

255
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,559
people see me um

256
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:43,320
as we kind of have fantasies sometimes says compensation for a lot of suffering

257
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:50,640
we have that I mean some of the delusion of grandeur is a compensation or delusion you know maybe not delusions

258
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,299
of grandeur but delusions of fantasies of you know

259
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:03,299
um you know wonderful things

260
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:09,480
you know how often are sexual fantasies about sex and how much is it about some kind of compensation for just feeling an

261
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:17,279
adequate and trying to fantasize some wonderful situation where it's kind of like a Utopia or a connection and with

262
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:24,419
someone else so part of what we do in mindfulness

263
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:33,059
is in fact to start becoming sensitive and aware of how this constructive imaginary use

264
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:39,179
of the Mind operates and it might help to appreciate that

265
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:45,720
there are useful ways of using the imagination and they're really harmful ways of using it

266
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:51,480
and because if it's all if it's just imagination that's kind of pushed away like the way it was when I was a new

267
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:58,559
student then your part of you is kind of a healthy part of our human functioning is

268
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:04,320
not included in the practice but maybe there's an appropriate way to

269
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:11,279
use the imagination to bring us to a time and place

270
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:16,919
where we are free of it to use imagination to inspire us to

271
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:23,580
practice to use the imagination to feel or sense where the opening is to Greater

272
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:30,720
peace and greater subtleness and greater freedom and we use it only to the extent that

273
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,240
it's helpful we don't try to use it as a sledgehammer to break through the door

274
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:42,600
to the other side you know you know not desperately trying to do something we use it to say I'm

275
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:47,640
desperate now let me imagine that my awaren my my

276
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:56,360
breathing is like a soft massage and I'm going to massage my desperation

277
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,740
I've used um I love water

278
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:07,980
I've been out you know I grew up in a culture where we're close to the water on the water a lot

279
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:15,539
and so the idea of the Waves brushing up against the sand beach is

280
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:20,700
such a welcome homecoming for me so to sit in meditation imagine the

281
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:26,039
breathing is like waves coming and going up on the sand and then if I feel

282
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:32,760
you know something's really hard for me to be with than to imagine that's with those waves washing over allows me to

283
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:38,580
stay present for the difficulty and keep it really simple it's just a nice way of using

284
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:45,000
imagination helps me to be with difficulty rather than just kind of restless and

285
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,460
agitated about it I also partly I think because of how

286
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:56,240
much time I spent on water um

287
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:03,000
there's something about water it's going off into the Horizon and then the sky

288
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,419
and the space that goes up forever that one of the I feel very sometimes in

289
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:16,880
meditation I would imagine with my eyes closed that I'm looking out

290
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:22,799
into the deep universe the dark deep Universe kind of

291
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:27,899
spaciously going out to know and for me because of my background that's a really

292
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:33,659
comforting image I don't think for some people it wouldn't be that way but for me it's

293
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:39,899
just like oh it actually helped me feel at home in this universe and um

294
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:45,539
when I was like even when I was a little kid like you know eight nine years old and laying in bed I would have kind of

295
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:52,500
just spontaneously I would have this sense that I was looking out into the universe and I was home

296
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:57,539
and um and so to this day occasionally if I find myself kind of

297
00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:03,659
you know my mind is a little bit kind of

298
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:09,600
not cooperating and it just doesn't seem like it's a big deal it's not like I have to go do some

299
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:16,140
deep looking at my mind just okay it's enough let me just kind of look into the

300
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:24,020
universe now with my eyes closed and then things get peaceful and quiet for me it's an act of imagination

301
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:32,700
so how do you use your imagination I think that probably most of you do

302
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:39,779
and if you don't realize that it there's a danger that often your

303
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:45,360
imagination is using you in ways that don't support you

304
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:50,399
that gives you uh projects into the future of fantasies and ideas of the

305
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:56,580
future that uh you know it's all going to be catastrophes

306
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:02,399
catastrophe thinking or we use our imagination to reconstruct

307
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:07,740
the past and I've certainly done that held some

308
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:14,179
kind of resentment or annoyance towards someone because you know I had imagined

309
00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:19,919
what really happened only to find out later when I talked to the person

310
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:29,360
it was nothing like I'd imagined nothing and I had this is you know

311
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:36,779
annoyance irritation or something or towards someone that had no basis in reality

312
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:42,600
isn't that embarrassing and I said wow this mind of mine that

313
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,700
has this capacity to you know to imagine a past that never was there but and I

314
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:55,679
live as if it did luckily nowadays I know to always check I've learned very well what my mind is

315
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:02,159
able to construct and I can see it happening now and this is one of the gifts of meditation is to

316
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:07,919
really to be able to be present enough to watch thoughts images ideas arise in

317
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:14,760
the mind and track it and see it well enough to understand what it is and not

318
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:21,599
be fooled by it to put a question mark next to it and say well maybe let's go check it out

319
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:28,158
let me ask the person and um

320
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:34,500
you know and you said the other day we were together you said you know you're pretty lousy

321
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:41,280
is that what you said or maybe I'd say it better you know when we were together last last time as I

322
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:47,339
left you said something I couldn't quite hear you have a little bit of hard of hearing which is true

323
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:54,980
and uh you know what did you say so that's a nice way of saying it right oh I said you're lovely

324
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:02,339
yeah and so you know I was living in a fantasy and that meant and story about

325
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:08,060
what you know how they were treating me and all their different wrongs that's happened to me

326
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:13,380
so I hope that this talk I mean nice if it inspired you

327
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:19,079
but I hope this talk um uh evokes a curiosity and interest

328
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:25,800
through you in how you live in the world of imagination

329
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:32,579
and how can it be done in a way that supports you in in your life and helps

330
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:37,980
you in a healthy appropriate way and how is it that the imagination is

331
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:44,040
not helpful how does it a burden how does it kind of put you in prison how does it limit your life

332
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:49,140
how does how does it really weigh you down and for the Buddha

333
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:55,079
a lot of one of the kind of um Gathering points

334
00:35:55,079 --> 00:36:00,960
for a lot of Burden a lot of suffering is all the ways that we all the

335
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:08,838
imagination that's used to construct to invent a sense of self and idea of self

336
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,760
and you don't have to be too concerned about this idea that there's not supposed to be any self

337
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:22,140
but then when you do Dharma practice you are supposed to be concerned about how we are inventing a self imagining

338
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:27,660
yourself and become more and more wise about how this works

339
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:33,000
and then the wonderful spiritual question

340
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:41,099
is who are you when you're not imagining Who You Are

341
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:47,460
then who are you or to say it even more powerful I think

342
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:53,900
who are you when you don't answer that question with a thought

343
00:36:54,900 --> 00:37:00,960
then who and even better probably from a Buddhist

344
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,960
point of view is not who are you

345
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:15,119
but what is here what is left here

346
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:20,820
when you're not imagining what is here is left

347
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:26,820
when you don't use thoughts to tell you because even even this innocent use of

348
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:32,940
and who are you might actually limit something powerful and when you don't

349
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:39,900
let that limit you then what what is here what is what manifests itself What flows

350
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:47,900
what comes so use your imagination well

351
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:53,579
thank you so we have a couple of minutes and

352
00:37:53,579 --> 00:38:00,240
um if somebody anyone wants to ask a question or a comment and then when I finish here those you want to come with

353
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:05,820
me out to the parking lot afterwards we can have a conversation out there with our masks off

354
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:13,220
and just continue this or something else but yes anybody any anyone now wants to say anything

355
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,020
foreign

356
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:30,480
talking about this imagination especially for the future I tend to

357
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:36,119
think of it as planning right and I think as long as I don't get

358
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:42,420
attached to the one way of possible future right then I think

359
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:47,820
there's not I don't see anything wrong with it right like I also can imagine several

360
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:54,599
possible Futures and probable Futures and unprobable futures and me and if I'm

361
00:38:54,599 --> 00:39:01,859
not attached to say what I thought was probable future like in your case you thought this person going to say this

362
00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:07,320
but they said that I'm not seeing it as a way of kind of like something wrong I

363
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:15,660
did and I should stop doing that and instead I say I just shouldn't be attaching myself to this what I thought

364
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:24,180
was probable future but there's nothing wrong with it I don't see like why like that's why I think seeing things clearly

365
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:32,099
right I'm not imagining it we have limited set of words here like English is a kind of funny language to be to be

366
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:38,400
present here and now wisely includes being aware of the future and

367
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:44,579
what might happen and includes what happened in the past the present moment here and now it doesn't have to exclude

368
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:50,339
a concern for the past and the present and um and that's a wise part of life to

369
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:58,619
plan ahead to think ahead and imagine what might happen and prepare for contingency plans bring the umbrella

370
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:04,440
you know or something and uh you know my life I I have a very full life

371
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:10,079
and so um I need to take time to think in the future this is what's going to happen

372
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:17,579
this is happening and okay if I'm going to do them I better do some things now first and get ready and let's organize

373
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:23,880
things and set up and and you know let people like in my career you know Dharma

374
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:29,220
teachers like me we often have to plan two years in advance

375
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:35,760
uh so everything can be done you know everything works no it coordinated with everybody else so I can show up and tell

376
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,900
people to be in the present

377
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:46,280
that's great to bind you

378
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:57,780
so um I have a question regarding uh contemplative practice in general

379
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:05,880
um because in other religions um their prayers it's a form of content

380
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:11,040
contemplative practice but um in Buddhism we have meditation we have

381
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:16,700
different lineage right different traditions but what do to you is the key difference

382
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:22,260
between this contemplative practice and others and there's some framework like

383
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:28,140
taking in some sort of faith-based practice in other religions it could

384
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:35,400
keep it close to your mouth um is the key difference is whether you you talk about emergence basically

385
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:42,119
be there and see things emerge right don't limit yourself to one possibility but there are other

386
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:48,599
um um religious people who

387
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:55,320
follow the you know who sorry um the the key difference to some some

388
00:41:55,320 --> 00:42:03,380
people say the key difference is whether you allow that emergence or that contemplative practice lead you to

389
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:09,480
open-mindedness or you are enforcing your own belief right which could be

390
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:16,260
problematic for the world so I think the broader question is what's unique about this practice and this contemplative

391
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:22,260
practice versus others and why is it better or or maybe it's not better or

392
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:29,760
yeah yeah thank you it's a it's a it's a I think it's a reasonable and a good question but I'm not really qualified to

393
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,920
to talk about other people's practices uh you know and and uh and I certainly

394
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:41,040
not interested in talking about it in a way that makes one better than the other you know that I think uh different

395
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:49,619
religions have a whole world system a whole philosophy or view of view of life and logic that things make sense in

396
00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:56,220
their world view and their kind of whole thing and so you ask what is the purpose and are you are you that purpose that

397
00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:03,780
they want to that they're offering and that world view that that purpose is within does that work for me

398
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:09,480
so in Buddhism we have a kind of a world view we have a purpose within that world view

399
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:15,180
and um it I don't think necessarily has to work for everybody else but uh you

400
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:21,960
know it you know so you have to and then and so if you're interested in this important question you're asking I think

401
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:28,920
it's for you to answer really but you have to go and study each one well enough to be able to compare and see is

402
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:35,160
it apples and oranges or is it different kinds of apples sorry and the reason I ask this question

403
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:40,980
is I'm trying to deal with because my my family my husband I'm more leaning

404
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:47,460
towards my hearing is hard and the best thing to do if you hold it uh horizontally so it's like that and

405
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:53,339
really importantly so the reason I asked that question is that it's a um it's in

406
00:43:53,339 --> 00:44:00,839
my own personal life I am leaning toward this tradition and this practice but for

407
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:07,380
my family they're more CR they're Christian they have their Christian belief and how do I reconcile that and

408
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:13,920
how do I convince my husband to come do my practice because kind of sound it

409
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:20,480
has to be split into two anyway yeah after we can tell however there's

410
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:27,300
imagine there's two things is how do you reconcile the two practices but also how

411
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:32,880
do you have harmony with your family and and your kids yes yeah how do you

412
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:38,700
how do you how are you in harmony so this is an important question and and so there's different ways of answering your

413
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:44,280
question one is at the terms in with the terms

414
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:49,980
that you offered another way which you didn't ask but which is the orientation of this

415
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:55,020
practice is um what's happening in you

416
00:44:55,020 --> 00:45:00,180
emotionally deep down that's the source of this question and you don't have to

417
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:07,140
answer now but uh what happens if you practice with that fear or that distress

418
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:13,460
and if the fear goes away how do you answer the question then

419
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:20,700
and so but if the fear Remains the answer the the the rational answer to

420
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:25,920
the question might not really be addressing what's deep down inside

421
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:32,760
and so the interest here with our practice is always to go deep and what's the what's the depths here and can we

422
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:39,900
clarify that before we clarify some of the things that are that are you know not quite as deep

423
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:45,960
um so I don't know if that's a satisfying answer for you but that would be the approach here and

424
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:51,200
and then and then you're in a better position to ask to answer the question yourself

425
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:58,440
okay so thank you so uh in one announcement and that is

426
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:05,400
that um it's been you know for at IMC here the

427
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:11,520
pandemic in a sense began as in something that affected us on a Saturday

428
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:18,180
when we were going to uh one day Meditation Retreat here people showed up

429
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:23,700
and we'd already that evening not before just decided that we can't beat you know we're quarantined now where we can't

430
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:32,220
meet so people showed up and we sat out outside the here and talked for a while and and um and then we closed we are

431
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:40,380
closed and that was the that was it and I don't think we've had a really a day long here for IMC since then

432
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:45,599
anyway we're having one of the first ones uh Saturday

433
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:52,380
so it's you know three years and uh so don Neal is teaching a

434
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:57,900
day-long Meditation Retreat I think it's on the seven factors of Awakening there's always that right there's a

435
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:06,200
flyer there's Flyers out there on the counter yeah looking beautiful flyer and now what's the time for it

436
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:17,280
9 30 9 30 to 4 30 and uh again people are wearing masks but you're welcome to

437
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:23,040
come and if you would like to come here and and um and Don's a great teacher and

438
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:29,520
so it I think it should be you know things were starting to open up and people are more comfortable all this and

439
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:34,880
I mean I suspect that a good number of you are comfortable to be here without masks

440
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:41,880
some of you would never come here without masks but so for those of you who are comfortable

441
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:49,200
not wearing masks I want to thank you for wearing masks and doing it carefully I think it's a gift and I just I think

442
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:55,440
it helps this kind of environment that we're in to uh to be able to meditate in a way that makes people's

443
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:01,440
be able to let go more deep more deeply and so in a few minutes you can take a

444
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:08,220
chair folding chair out there in the parking lot if you want to meet and because some of us are going to meet out there maybe partly if you're at all

445
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:14,280
inclined it'd be great if you turn to somewhere next to you and just said hello to them and welcome them even if this is your first time you can welcome

446
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:19,039
