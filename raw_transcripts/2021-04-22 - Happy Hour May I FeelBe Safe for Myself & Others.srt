3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:22,080
able to come together in this way even though we are

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,160
separate in space and maybe even in time for those who are listening later on

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,520
audio drama but we come together to practice we come together to practice so

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:40,399
this makes me also happy to see your faces on zoom yay gift to me

7
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:48,480
so so for our practice together today um the theme i'd like to invite us

8
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:55,360
to explore is um is this so in the practice

9
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,199
of meta cultivating loving-kindness metta

10
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:10,400
there are four traditional phrases and we offer them during happy hour and

11
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,680
they go something like this and there are different variations of them with by different teachers etc but basically

12
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,400
they go something like this may you may i be safe or may i feel safe

13
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,400
may i be happy may i be healthy may i have ease and then could be may you be safe

14
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,119
may you feel safe happy healthy ease so safe happy healthy ease

15
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:43,280
so the first one had the first wish the first cultivation having to do with with safety with feeling safe with being

16
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:50,640
safe offering safety second one with um second wish with mental happiness

17
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,719
and then the second the third with the physical happiness which is health and the last one overall ease

18
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:02,159
in life taking care of oneself happily um

19
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:09,119
how once how one's life flows so

20
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:17,440
tonight i'd like to focus on the first wish which is safety one of

21
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:24,319
safety and sometimes that appears actually as an odd one

22
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:32,080
i remember the first years of my practice i could get the yeah may i may you

23
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,000
may they be say may they be happy and healthy and have ease yeah especially the happy and

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,160
healthy one i got yep sure it's the wish but safety i wasn't quite sure and then some

25
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:53,200
teachers also put it in the order to be the second or the third after happy and healthy whereas i think

26
00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:00,720
traditionally it's actually the first one so so why safety what's

27
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,280
what's why is this safety important let's explore that a little bit

28
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,879
so i'll share from my own experience that

29
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:19,360
years later when i was doing intense retreat practice it occurred to me and i was playing with

30
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,400
the orders and saying them in different order just exploring these sentences these

31
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,120
phrases these ways of cultivating meta

32
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:37,200
i realized that actually feeling safe or being safe is the precursor

33
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,440
of all the other ones until you feel safe until you are safe

34
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:51,040
there's a sense of basic sense of safety those other happinesses

35
00:03:51,040 --> 00:04:00,000
physical mental ease they can't really happen really safety is is the basic one

36
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,740
is the basic need for safety almost if we thought of the um

37
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:14,959
[Music] maslow's hierarchy of needs you know it's very basic sense of having shelter and

38
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:22,160
food and just kind of the safety is very very basic very basic um

39
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:29,840
and also there is other psychological research with with bulbies attachment theory

40
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,680
that's safety when we feel safe there's a sense of safety that

41
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,960
for many of us starts with our relationship our parental relationship with our moms and the sense

42
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:50,880
of safety ah then all those other happinesses physical mental um get laid on top so

43
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:58,720
this wish for safety that we cultivate may i be safe may i feel safe may you be safe may i may you

44
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,080
feel safe again there are different versions of that i'll talk about that in a moment

45
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,520
this wish for safety cultivating or feeling into safety is really really

46
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,360
important really important and

47
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:23,520
often when we're practicing the sense of safety if we feel safe if our hearts feel safe it's really

48
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:31,120
hard to concentrate if you're sitting in an environment and if you're feeling scared it's really hard for the heart

49
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:38,639
to settle for the mind to settle and have any level of concentration or samadhi or stillness

50
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:45,199
there will be a lot of agitation if there is in safety so it's an important one to really bring attention to to bring

51
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,800
awareness to and cultivate in our wish in our turning our mind our

52
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:57,680
hearts to it just another thing i wanted to say before we start practicing and exploring

53
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:06,240
is sometimes the extended um phrases may i be safe may i feel safe

54
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:14,160
from inner and outer harm inner and outer harm and then inner harm

55
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,880
is what is how we harm ourselves through our thoughts our actions

56
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,960
emotions basically the three poisonous roots greed hatred and confusion

57
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:33,039
that take our own safety away in our own heart

58
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:40,720
and then there is external safety may i feel safe from outer arm and another aspect i want

59
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:49,759
to bring in is can we be safe can we offer safety to others

60
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:56,880
can we be a safe person for others that's really important

61
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:03,360
so that they're not scared of us they're not afraid of us

62
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:11,280
may i be safe may i be a safe haven may i be safe for others

63
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:18,639
may i be safe may others feel safe in my presence so that can be another aspect

64
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:26,160
another way that we can explore this first beautiful phrase of meta

65
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,880
so so i've spoken plenty tonight about this

66
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:40,639
safety thing let's practice together so i invite you to land

67
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,680
in your meditation posture

68
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:52,639
ah see how the sense of safety

69
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:59,840
what do you need you need to shift and move

70
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:06,800
you need to lie down if you need a blanket to wrap yourself in or a shawl and now i

71
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,000
feel cold okay so here i'm gonna take care of myself

72
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:20,479
what do you feel what do you need what do you need right now ah

73
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:27,120
to tap into to feel into

74
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,159
sense of containment contentment safety

75
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,399
at this present moment can the heart

76
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,839
relax

77
00:08:53,440 --> 00:09:09,839
and relaxing softening the body

78
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:28,000
landing relaxing into the muscles

79
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:51,839
with your sit bones to your feet your legs

80
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:04,720
feeling a sense of safety that the cushion the chair is supporting you

81
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:11,519
the laws of gravity are not suddenly going to change

82
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:22,399
that you fall if there's a sense of safety trust relying

83
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:28,640
that yes the chair the cushion holds you

84
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,839
and it's going to continue to hold your sense of safety

85
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,959
in being held

86
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:47,839
in the law of gravity lawful nature

87
00:10:48,480 --> 00:11:01,839
of the law of gravity letting your body relax into it

88
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,720
and if thoughts are rising ruminations

89
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:12,720
can we let go [Music] release trusting that

90
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,639
if they're important enough they'll come back trusting that right now we don't need to

91
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,320
be thinking this do we really

92
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,480
letting go ah releasing

93
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,920
landing in the cocoon the safety the ease

94
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:47,760
of this moment just as it is however it is it doesn't

95
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,839
need to be different

96
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:31,560
letting the breath be received in the lower abdomen one breath at a

97
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,650
[Music]

98
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,839
time

99
00:15:53,360 --> 00:16:00,079
letting the awareness loving awareness receive each breath calming soothing

100
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:09,839
settling one breath at a time

101
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,559
as the breath is breathed in

102
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,720
can we acknowledge that in this moment

103
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:44,000
there's a roof over our head indoors

104
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:53,840
ah there's a safety from the elements

105
00:19:54,160 --> 00:20:00,080
from the rain the cold the sun whatever might be happening

106
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:07,840
where you are

107
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:12,158
feeling yourself wherever you're sitting

108
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:19,520
acknowledging safety from the elements

109
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,640
with each breath perceived in the

110
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,840
abdomen

111
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:25,760
now if you would conjure up someone in whose presence

112
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:33,520
you feel safe you can be yourself you feel safe

113
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:41,679
either someone from your life someone living or even deceased is okay

114
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:48,400
as long as no grief arises or an archetype

115
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,159
the buddha kuan yin or archetype from any other religion

116
00:22:54,159 --> 00:23:09,840
or theology that works for you just feeling safe the presence of this being this person

117
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:25,279
conjuring up their presence as clearly as possible for you

118
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:37,840
then notice how your body your heart can relax feel safe

119
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,919
gently drop in the phrase may i feel

120
00:24:44,840 --> 00:25:01,840
safe may i feel safe

121
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,640
if the feelings of lack of safety come up fear perhaps worry

122
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:17,840
self-judgment in this practice can we offer those

123
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:25,840
thoughts emotion safety let your fear feel safe it doesn't have

124
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:39,840
to go away or be squashed ah or the worry

125
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:46,559
or anything else any other thoughts or emotions that are rising

126
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:55,360
offering safety through and through no part left out

127
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:10,399
may i feel safe may i be safe from inner harm

128
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:20,240
offering safety to every part of yourself

129
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:35,840
see what happens be curious

130
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:54,240
just as this compassionate being that you conjured up this kind presence in your life wants

131
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:00,720
you to be safe wishes you safety can we wish it for

132
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:09,279
ourselves as a sharing a blessing so showering ourselves with a blessing

133
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:16,799
fully well knowing that life is uncertain of course and yet we cultivate our heart

134
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:27,840
in wishing well and offering a gift of goodwill

135
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,240
may i feel safe may i be safe

136
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,840
from inner and outer harm

137
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:51,150
may this being who is me who shows up in this way in this body and this mind this

138
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:55,840
[Music] conditioning

139
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:08,240
may there is her may their heart feel safe

140
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:16,880
may their body feel safe whatever the circumstances of life

141
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:27,679
may there be sense of inner goodness and safety lack of fear fearlessness

142
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:51,840
trust that supports all goodness blossom

143
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:05,840
now if you wish you're welcome to bring in the other phrases of mitta after the one for safety or to stay with

144
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,320
safety

145
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:19,360

and may i be safe for others

164
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:59,839
hey

165
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,119
and for the last moment of this practice

166
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:26,720
we offer ourselves safety for however this practice period was

167
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:33,040
whether there was sleepiness distractions instead of judging ourselves bereading

168
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:40,880
ourselves can we offer safety to our heart to our minds and appreciation thank you

172

[Music]

173
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,838
thanks everyone for your practice

174
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:46,800
so so much to explore in this theme of safety what a rich theme

00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,880
so we have some time love to invite you what did you discover

180
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:26,078
so what did you discover friend please

181
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:33,599
i've always been confused by this concept of safety within the

182
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:40,240
meta group and uh you're acknowledging your own initial confusion

183
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:45,760
sort of helped lead me into wondering about it as i was

184
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:53,920
exploring it and i was struck by how powerful it was to me as i

185
00:39:53,920 --> 00:40:00,079
uh thought about uh two two men who when i was a young man who

186
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:08,560
had been uh both of whom have been important to me as mentors and um one dead now and the other i just

187
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:14,160
don't know if he's still living and being being with the two of them it

188
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:21,280
was a um i'm much older than they were when they were important to me as a young person

189
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:27,839
but being shoulder to shoulder with them in recollection and feeling

190
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:34,560
was uh really really comforting to me and it also

191
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:42,160
made me recognize that later in my life when i was able to play the role that

192
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:47,760
they played for me with other young men i drew a lot of that from them though

193
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:55,280
not largely conscious of it but that sense of safety just like a sense of danger can be passed

194
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:02,000
down and spread out in ways that are untraceable

195
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:10,079
thank you thank you fred thank you

196
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:18,839
for for your eloquent description of

197
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:25,680
this receiving of safety and then passing it on as a

198
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:32,720
gift what a gift thank you so much guitar please

199
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:38,160
i've been always finding that safety is a key piece to all of the meta and until i

200
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:43,440
reckoned with this it was impossible for me to have any access to the other pieces and

201
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:50,319
i learned again during this session that sometimes it it didn't help me to think of people

202
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:56,079
at all not at all and i do know that some cultures and

203
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:03,838
mine included who has been mass traumatized there is sometimes a level of

204
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,240
hyper vigilance and innate um

205
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:14,640
lack of safety that it's it's not reflected in one's life you can do all

206
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:20,640
kinds of courageous things and people would never know but only through meditation and those um

207
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:25,920
explorations i mean i recognize that i relate to a lot of things in my life through fear and i

208
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:31,040
would have never understood that and um interestingly what occurred to me

209
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:38,800
i was popping a candy in my mouth during the meditation and it happened to have the flavor of an ice cream i had it as a child

210
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:46,400
and that recollection somehow provided safety but no no other thing and i don't definitely

211
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,520
didn't expect that and um also related to that i've been

212
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:58,000
the way i've been dealing with this notion that i just described and that i've known about for a while sort of how

213
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,839
how it can be difficult to feel safe at a very very elemental level i've been trying to add

214
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:10,960
to my meta practice to make myself safe for my fear

215
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:17,520
and um just adding that peace and saying my fear can be a safe place i can be a

216
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:22,800
safe place for my fear even though i would have never even years ago characterized this lack of

217
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:28,560
safety as fear fear is way too big a word it's much more subtle than that but

218
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:33,920
again it's it's sort of how i feel i relate to many things in my life if i'm really honest

219
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:41,520
so that makes sense a bit convoluted oh absolutely made very clear sense

220
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:48,240
thank you so much for sharing yes of course and beautiful practice of offering

221
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:53,599
safety to your fear beautiful what what a beautiful way to acknowledge it and to

222
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:59,920
work with it offering safety to yourself and the fear and also i'm just delighted

223
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:08,000
so much modita for this serendipitous discovery of of popping this this candy and

224
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,079
and oh it's like proust and then madeline right it's it it just brought in back

225
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:19,760
this sense of safety and actually one um one invitation i would have

226
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:27,359
especially knowing that your your mother tongue is not english is to practice

227
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:32,560
offering your fear safety and offering yourself safety

228
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:39,680
in your mother tongue and and i know it's for me it's been transformative saying the phrases and

229
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:45,839
farsi like this sense of safety that i had when i was a child with my grandmother and my mother was like oh my

230
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:51,839
wow is powerful and something that you tapped into with with this with this candy flavor

231
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:58,560
opens that up beautiful yeah thank you guitar thank you

232
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:06,640
yeah so letting me share yeah thank you for sharing so powerful yeah thanks to both of you

233
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:12,160
for sharing your insights powerful

234
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:19,680
so let us turn to holding each other with safety

235
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:26,720
and offering safety this is an important part of tonight's practice offering safety to others offering

236
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:31,760
safety to others how can we listen offering safety to others this is an

237
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:37,599
important practice people please please if you can stay if you have to go you have commitments

238
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:43,520
but if you can't stay how can you show up and offer safety to someone else how does it look

239
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:50,079
like what does it see feel like to do that and and then notice what it feels like for others to

240
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:58,400
be doing that for you so let's start with 15 seconds of silent offering safety

241
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:06,079
may you be safe may you be safe people you'll be in a small group with and then share what you discovered and

242
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:12,880
listen with offering safety i think this can be very interesting so let's let's practice

243
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:21,040
together let's practice together in this way so creating the breakout rooms

244
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:28,319
and opening them they are open here we go okay

245
