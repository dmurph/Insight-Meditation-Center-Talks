1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:08,080
I thought we would start with a slightly guided sit and then move into

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:15,880
a little discussion so finding your comfortable a

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:24,599
comfortable posture comfortable way to just uh land in the moment here wherever

4
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:27,880
you're touching

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,920
whatever brings rest whatever brings some

6
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,878
ease coming to this

7
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,000
moment feeling that sense of aliveness that comes

8
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:06,600
can come when we just

9
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,798
allow a little bit of being

10
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:16,759
heess just arriving

11
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:49,960
and if you wish receiving that little

12
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:57,240
relaxation or that nice feeling that comes when there's an

13
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,560
exhale and it ends

14
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:11,280
and the muscles and the bones maybe respond indirectly by just

15
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,480
giving you a sense of

16
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:20,080
ah this is

17
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,640
nice this is comfortable

18
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,800
and along with this Comfort there may be all sorts of other

19
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,040
activities of the mind of the

20
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,400
body and they Co they can coexist exist they can be here as

21
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:19,360
well but for just these few moments giving a little a little weight to that feeling

22
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,599
of ah this is nice just being here in

23
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:28,599
community now

24
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:36,480
letting the breath do what it does on its own

25
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:06,879
and when we're here sitting together breathing together in silence together

26
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,280
for the most part it's like we participate in

27
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:18,560
something that's going on that's all

28
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,880
about a sense of

29
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,520
balance a sense of calm

30
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,960
the body breathing we participate in this amazing

31
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,638
Miracle of the body just

32
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:56,479
breathing we don't have to do so much to participate in the body

33
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,600
breathing always have to this just

34
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:17,440
sense enjoy that little feeling that comes when the fresh

35
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:24,479
air enters and we can let go into

36
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:30,600
that release that happens with the exhale

37
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:39,160
for just a few minutes here we participate in this Miracle of

38
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:53,120
Life or we can it's an invitation all of

39
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,639
this for

40
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:52,479
this way to participate in your breathing is a way of being a caretaker

41
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,319
for your inner life

42
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:10,000
it's a very sacred process to take care

43
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,280
inside of what's going on inside how it

44
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:23,319
is what needs care what needs

45
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,160
attention caring with just a simple notice noticing of

46
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,240
oh this is so right

47
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:46,280
now and if we do that while we're resting and

48
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:55,080
participating in the broad relaxed Rhythm of Life of

49
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,960
breathing it's like that's the context the bigger

50
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:11,080
context around what we may

51
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:18,759
notice in terms of thinking in terms

52
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,520
of

53
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,440
emotions body

54
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:44,039
things there's a big context all the way around and Beyond

55
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,040
within that offers a sort of

56
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:02,440
care caretaking for

57
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:42,800
the sounds that come people still

58
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:54,279
arriving it's just like us arriving again with breathing

59
00:09:54,279 --> 00:10:00,920
easing sensing sitting

60
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,600
calming and holding it

61
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,320
all for

62
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,240
for for

63
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:36,320
part participating in what's

64
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:49,519
here allowing what's here to be here taking it

65
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:59,000
in carefully caringly sweetly

66
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:14,720
every sound sensation comes as a contact it appears and it

67
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,040
moves changes and Fades

68
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,560
away every touch

69
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:35,120
sensation has that first moment when it's

70
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:49,079
sensed every breath every scent that

71
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:52,880
comes is also

72
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:04,480
touched sight objects come and they

73
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:18,079
move and things come in the mind the same

74
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,800
way they first

75
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,639
appear there can be some involvement with

76
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,360
them or

77
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:44,040
not there could be so much resting relaxing

78
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:51,759
context maybe even sweetness of the Silence of sharing this silence together

79
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:54,199
here in

80
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:04,480
community that whatever comes whatever

81
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:14,360
sensation at the level of those senses comes and exists in that big

82
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,800
context that we're participating

83
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:29,839
in that we're breathing with

84
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,279
very respectfully very

85
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:59,319
tenderly offering a kind gaze

86
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,759
to whatever arises

87
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,880
for for

88
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,760
for

89
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:31,679
for

90
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:09,679
for

91
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:40,360
and how we make contact with what

92
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:46,000
arises how we make contact with what

93
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:53,600
comes how we tend in our

94
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:59,000
attention makes a big difference

95
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:16,279
we can care for it be a caretaker from a very calm

96
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:25,080
place that we can participate inside in our breathing if it's available

97
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,919
we can give give a lot of

98
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:43,799
room to whatever arises our mindfulness is very

99
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:52,440
flexible mindfulness can look at things from very far away if that's what's best if that's

100
00:21:52,440 --> 00:22:01,720
what's most caring or mindful could get very

101
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:11,960
close how can you see and

102
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:24,960
sense in a way that allows you to participate in the peaceful broad

103
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:31,120
context of being here just just being

104
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:40,520
here with all this space and all this calm

105
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:27,600
maybe even enjoying

106
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:35,399
enjoying what's good here breathing

107
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,760
together being

108
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,039
together can be even

109
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:59,440
stabilizing a stabilizing Stillness

110
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,759
can be even a little

111
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:15,960
pleasurable to show us how to help us see the how we attend to

112
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,360
things how we

113
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
notice

114
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
for

115
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,320
e for

116
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,240
for for

117
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,080
for for

118
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000

good morning again and welcome to IMC I know Jill has an announcement and best I

120
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,960
believe

121
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:23,440
good morning uh my name is Jill and um I sometimes help make sure the potlucks

122
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:29,519
are pulled together on the last Sunday of the month so everyone is welcome to

123
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:34,600
join whether you have brought something to share or not and the only thing we

124
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:41,880
need to do is when our um Talk is finished today um you'd give us a little

125
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:48,320
bit of time to pull things together in the kitchen before you go right out there and then we'll gather um in a

126
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:54,880
circle and say a few words about our gathering today before we eat so uh

127
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:01,200
welcome all and our our teacher is Francisco Gable

128
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:07,600
thank you welcome back Francisco thank you very much it's great to be

129
00:32:08,639 --> 00:32:16,600
here thank you for meditating together so today I thought I would talk

130
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:23,200
a little bit about um 12 ways that we 12 new ways that we might be able to look

131
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:32,760
at ourselves see ourselves or on the CP of a group of 12 new months so that's

132
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:38,919
always used to feel I don't really think of it this way but it used to feel like a new beginning and it's kind of a new

133
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:44,799
beginning time although it's uh here in Buddhism our Buddhism things are always

134
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:52,200
in a beginning since it's beginningless time and endings are included in

135
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:59,399
that but these 12 ways come from a list called the liberative dependent

136
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:06,760
arising and um it's a list that uh like I said allows us to

137
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:14,039
see ourselves so they're about you these are 12 ways that are about you ways that

138
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:19,200
we could uncover for ourselves I'm going to talk about these

139
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:25,039
um conditions these 12 conditions and I'm going to talk about them in a way

140
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:31,159
that I'm going to be looking at another list of 12 things don't worry there's not I'm not going to

141
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:37,799
just be listing things and you don't have to think of the 12 and the other 12 um this is just to give you the little

142
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:45,000
framework of uh of how what I'm going to be looking at um these 12 conditions

143
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:51,240
are are considered beautiful conditions because they're different from the the

144
00:33:51,240 --> 00:34:00,200
conditions that are looked at that cause suffering these are conditions that lead to Liberation and and knowledge of

145
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:09,398
Liberation and uh the other list leads to well sorrow lamentation pain anguish

146
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:15,760
and duka so not so happy but that list is very important the list of dependent

147
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:24,599
arising because the list allows us to deconstruct and take apart all the different ways that human

148
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:31,679
beings suffer and create suffering and get stuck in Loops of suffering

149
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:39,560
spinnings of suffering so they're very important because suffering is

150
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:49,040
um is uh is kind of endemic to human being and um but it's not a given it's

151
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:55,040
not a given at all the Buddha in um his Enlightenment

152
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,079
there was a quot um small discourse and uh that's considered to be a very old

153
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:10,440
discourse called quarrels and disputes in this little collection called The Book of AIDS and uh in it he

154
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:15,960
talked about the quarrels and disputes that he saw everywhere in

155
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:22,320
society and all the sorrow and lamentation all around him everywhere he

156
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:29,640
looked there was an opportunity to see anguish and pain

157
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:38,240
and this is very humanizing for me how the Buddha looked at that and saw the

158
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:45,880
opportunity to do something about it by the starting first of

159
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:51,200
all with what sounds like a dramatic expression but pulling the arrow out of

160
00:35:51,200 --> 00:36:00,640
his own heart and pulling the arrow out of his own heart allowed him to have health

161
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:06,200
ultimate health health from suffering and this is the view that he

162
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:14,760
took out to the world he saw Enlightenment as an opportunity to to do this deep healing

163
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:21,520
work there might be some of the most sacred work that we do this caretaking for this in our

164
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:29,680
life These inner lives and that instead of some

165
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:37,960
grandiose Enlightenment that may come and that comes in a certain way but

166
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:45,800
this path points to this Liberation that's that's maybe better to call a

167
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:53,480
maturation sometimes Liberation can be a little um can be approached in a little magical

168
00:36:53,480 --> 00:37:01,520
thinking kind of a way how people go about liberation and this instead is is

169
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,079
very here in this body in this

170
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:12,720
mind for this human being for our

171
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:18,599
communities for our broader communities and for the whole

172
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:26,400
world so that's the that's really the intention of uh of

173
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:32,319
looking at conditions and creating conditions that lead to this maturation

174
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:39,560
to this Liberation and um we were given these things we have these teachings I find I

175
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:46,280
think it's glorious to me that we have these teachings that show us how we

176
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:51,640
can create conditions that lead

177
00:37:51,640 --> 00:38:00,760
to happiness joy deep States of bliss samadi

178
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:09,400
bliss profound ways of seeing deeply inside of ourselves of this mind to

179
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:18,280
learn how this mind can be absolutely free of all the things that lead to that

180
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:25,560
path of Anguish so the first conditions are

181
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:32,079
especially exciting to talk talk about um here at this point at this end of the

182
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:38,319
year as we're looking at a new year these darkest of

183
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:44,040
days here in the north not in the South where some of our friends

184
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:50,040
are but as we look to start a new perhaps and we start a new all the time

185
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:55,800
so it's not just the new year we start a new all the time in practice every set

186
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:03,400
every time we connect to the breath is a new beginning in the Buddhist teachings the

187
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:09,960
early Buddhist teachings that I base my um my talk my thoughts on for this

188
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:17,480
talk so the the list goes like this the liberative liberative dependent arising

189
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:26,280
it starts with having a good look at Dua what I've been talking about the pain the unsatisfactoriness of

190
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:31,359
life and then from there we are invited to

191
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:36,480
create these sex next necessary conditions and we can do so by looking

192
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:44,319
at pain and suffering that's what's really interesting to me that if we stop and

193
00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:50,480
really take a look and a caring understanding of what causes our

194
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:58,520
suffering these wholesome beneficial good beautiful conditions arise

195
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:04,359
that's the interaction of all these teachings so it starts with Dua then we

196
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:09,920
move to the condition of Faith then gladness then

197
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:17,640
Joy then Tranquility then happiness then concentration or

198
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:27,359
samade so that's called the gladness pentad it's all about being glad gladdening the mind and

199
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:34,920
the being that then allows the remainder conditions to where Insight really

200
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:40,440
begins to go forth toward Liberation the next

201
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:45,119
condition is knowledge and vision of things as they

202
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:52,520
are then there's a condition of disenchantment that's not the greatest translation for what really happens

203
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:59,880
there then dispassion then Liberation and then knowledge of

204
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:07,640
Liberation so this dooka that I've been talking about that can be translated in so many

205
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:17,240
ways as unsatisfactoriness as pain dread whatever really hurts uh from

206
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:23,200
human existence so these this gladness pentad

207
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:30,000
is telling us hey if you stop and look if you just

208
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:36,119
pause if you really give yourself the time to see this Dua see what is it

209
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:43,000
that's causing dooka for you here and now who is the little lawyer of the

210
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:49,480
Mind who's in controlled that's doing this that's

211
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:55,400
behind this Dua if we stop and look at that

212
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:04,359
sincerely we come to faith and faith is uh in early Buddhism not a not seen as a

213
00:42:04,359 --> 00:42:10,240
belief system to believe something to trust but it's more about not believing

214
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:18,240
it's about no longer believing in that mud that muckety mud of

215
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:24,640
pain because one of the things one of the ways that Dua works is

216
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:32,240
that it reflects our challenge just back to us as us we are our

217
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:39,280
challenge we are that suffering so faith is is not believing

218
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:46,079
that anymore not using that as a reflection and it's called Faith it's

219
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:51,720
also can be seen as confidence because it gives a purpose

220
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:58,480
and a direction oh there is another way there is something else other than

221
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:06,200
being identified with my suffering identified

222
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:14,839
with all the streams that lead to to those things that are really

223
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:19,800
stressful are really difficult for human

224
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:25,079
beings so faith is a is a Joyful Joyful

225
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:33,280
condition and these are conditions that we they're called conditions because we can foster them we can adopt them we can

226
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:40,119
know them and create conditions to let them be in place the condition for Faith

227
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:45,480
to arise is to Simply

228
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:52,640
notice there is suffering here who is suffering what is the

229
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:58,319
suffering and right there we're walking the path we're walking the path and we

230
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:04,079
have a purpose and a direction and we can take this

231
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:11,319
path and that already begins to liven things up because we're out of that mud

232
00:44:11,319 --> 00:44:16,480
it's not the only way to just be reflecting back all the streams of

233
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:23,920
everything that is moving through the the daily mind the non-c

234
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:29,920
contemplative mind these are contemplative conditions not

235
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:37,839
worldly in a way things so moving out of the stream

236
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:44,680
of the worldly things which could be called the karmic stream moving into the Dharma stream the

237
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:50,800
stream of the teachings or the beautiful Karma which is what the

238
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:57,520
Dharma is called in the anient ancient teachings so Faith once we have this uh

239
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:04,040
purpose this directions and this stands immediately brings can being

240
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:10,400
bring on gladness gladness is this kind of

241
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:16,079
biological imperative that happens once you we say okay I'm going to do a little

242
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:24,920
house cleaning here I'm not going to really believe that I'm not really going to just be all

243
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:31,000
of that that which is leading to suffering whatever that may

244
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:37,599
be and we stop believing the resentments the cynicisms the

245
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:45,839
anxiety all the attitudes that are not really

246
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:52,559
helping the cyclical things that keep cycling through the mind so there's

247
00:45:52,559 --> 00:46:00,079
gladness because suddenly there is a standing with something else and it's like a biological imperative when we

248
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:06,160
turn to looking inside and and doing something about this this's this

249
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:12,960
biological imperative and now we're in the Dharma stream and this is the beginning of this

250
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:19,400
gladness pentad that's moving toward greater greater greater Joy greater

251
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:24,520
greater Stillness greater greater stabilizing of Mind stabilizing

252
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:28,839
Stillness of concentration

253
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:38,960
and so that condition of gladness can progress the more we are

254
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:45,359
sincere with what's there with what keeps coming up the more sincerity we

255
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:51,280
have with that we begin to look at the fuel of

256
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:56,920
those those uh those emotions that

257
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:03,680
aren't working those emotions that kind of keep us tra in more of the same

258
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:10,000
emotions in more of the same reactive circles there's a fuel there that's

259
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:18,640
fueling that the tradition calls that clinging there's a fuel that behind that

260
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:24,558
fire that burns in the anger in the

261
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:32,480
fear and we we ask what is that fuel we can ask what is that fuel and that puts

262
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:42,920
us on the path to Joy believe it or not because our joy is trapped a lot by

263
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:49,960
this by this other fire the fire

264
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:57,920
of of the vement emotions because Joy has another fire

265
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:05,359
the more joy we have we experience that fire of Joy the

266
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:11,839
fire of Joy gives light it doesn't burn us it doesn't burn us

267
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:17,440
into a burned wood piece the fire of of

268
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:23,359
Joy brings light to see to understand to know better to know

269
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:31,400
more to take in more of the goodness that is arising once we're in these

270
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:35,078
these wholesome contemplative

271
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:46,680
conditions but it starts with that sincere look what is what is that that's causing

272
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:53,960
that fuel in me to to be sad to be

273
00:48:53,960 --> 00:49:01,200
worried to be upset to be confused to be buried in this in

274
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:09,240
this feeling because if we ask if we just stop and ask we're walking the

275
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:15,920
path it takes a sincere look a supported look we have to be

276
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:23,640
careful about how we do this of course we're doing this in the context of

277
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:30,040
contemplation we're doing this in a context to feel reassured that we're on this big path

278
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:37,240
we're on this ancient path we're supported by many things in each moment

279
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:44,000
when we participate in the moment with the intention of participating in the

280
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:55,040
moment because we have to be respectful of our inner life of what hurts of who's

281
00:49:55,640 --> 00:50:01,480
hurt in order to come to these this condition of

282
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:08,319
Joy so Joy is this uh light

283
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:16,400
arising very effervescent possibility that's here now can be here

284
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:22,400
now in your body in your being

285
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:32,079
somewhere and the more we clean keep cleaning the house keep working on

286
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:39,640
what's calling our attention we're if we're listening to what's calling our

287
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:48,960
attention then the next condition is tranquility and Tranquility is like a

288
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:55,520
landing on dry ground we've now landed if you visualize

289
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:01,160
gladness as uh if you'll allow me a little maybe silly

290
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:09,079
metaphor as if um you're you're going to a stream to take up dip in on a very hot

291
00:51:09,079 --> 00:51:14,799
day maybe one of these streams in Santa Cruz by our Retreat Center inside

292
00:51:14,799 --> 00:51:22,119
retreat center and um you know you're going to the stream with your friend or with

293
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:28,760
family and so you become glad you're going there you're going to you you're looking forward to this there's a

294
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:34,720
gladness there's this biological imperative that happens that takes you there and keeps you going to the

295
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:41,280
destination and then you see your stream and then you walk down to the

296
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:49,240
stream and you jump into the stream and that Joy at being refreshed at being

297
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:56,000
feeling that aliveness of that comes when we jump into a stream when we're warm and we're looking forward to a

298
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:03,440
little s and a dip that feeling that happiness that full body sensation that's how Joy the

299
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:10,520
condition of Joy manifests and then when we step out of the stream because we've done our swim

300
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:15,799
and we sit on the bank and we're on dry

301
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:20,920
ground then we are experiencing

302
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:27,920
Tranquility the condition of Tranquility so Tranquility is

303
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:33,480
very stabilizing very much the landing of

304
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:40,599
all the rising of the energy of joy and gladness and then

305
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:46,920
Landing to see and to know

306
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:53,079
tranquility and Tranquility can offer something really wonderful

307
00:52:53,079 --> 00:53:00,640
to that what was that f all with Tranquility we can see into the

308
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:05,720
craving that was behind that clinging that

309
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:12,960
grasping Tranquility allows us to see into that grasping and ask and know

310
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:22,559
about what what is pulling me what is coming together in me to form that way of

311
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:28,960
being so the visibility is increasing to see further

312
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:36,359
into what how is this is it that this grasping is forming how is it that this

313
00:53:36,359 --> 00:53:42,480
compulsion is forming so we can it's very beneficial

314
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:48,160
to have Tranquility to be able to take in

315
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:54,280
what's what's there because there it's really amazing

316
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:59,359
if some this quality that human beings have it's almost like

317
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:06,000
uh like I heard this teacher say once that uh it's looking right back at

318
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:12,240
you that which needs our attention that which would benefit from

319
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:21,760
our attention if we pause and are tranquil is looking

320
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:28,319
right back at us right back

321
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:33,960
and we can choose to engage with it or not we have a lot of choices that's what

322
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:43,480
this practice is all about choosing choosing to look how to look to look

323
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:50,359
with tranquil eyes spacious eyes that give a lot of room to what's

324
00:54:50,359 --> 00:54:55,960
there because many things we got to be a little careful not

325
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:01,000
every everything needs us to go right into

326
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:06,760
it we we we want to be respectful of our inner

327
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:14,040
life and caring of our inner life caring of this called of

328
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:21,520
attention it's a call to attention that we can look at with

329
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:28,000
Tranquility so that it Tranquility calms the

330
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:34,319
craving begins continues that settling process that

331
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:40,640
allows a pleasurable feeling a wholesome contemplative pleasurable feeling that

332
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:46,000
reassures us re assures us a lot because we need

333
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:52,280
reassurance in order to be able to to take a good

334
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:59,440
close look to things we're not

335
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:05,880
alone this is not a solitary

336
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:13,680
path we're very reassured with the conditions in place

337
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:19,920
that offer that so from

338
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:27,559
Tranquility that dry ground finally we move to happiness

339
00:56:27,559 --> 00:56:34,119
isn't that nice Tran gladness Joy tranquility and

340
00:56:34,119 --> 00:56:39,200
happiness so we're looking at Dua through these eyes with this

341
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:47,039
support it's not about suffering at all this path this is

342
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:54,119
a joyful path this is a very very very joyful path this is a very happy path it

343
00:56:54,119 --> 00:57:00,960
is telling us these conditions that it is happy to do this it is happy

344
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:07,160
to be sincere with myself about what do I

345
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:12,839
need it is good because there's this be feedback

346
00:57:12,839 --> 00:57:20,319
system that keeps letting us know that that this is good with these conditions we see that very clearly there is

347
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:25,559
happiness available after these this

348
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:32,480
contact with the forces of clinging the forces of becoming the

349
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:39,880
forced becoming the highly attached becoming the

350
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:45,319
clinging there's a release there's a release of of our life force that's

351
00:57:45,319 --> 00:57:53,000
coming to the four with all of this and then we have Happiness and

352
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:58,960
happiness in contrast to Joy I always always used to get confused used by these things like what is joy and and

353
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:05,920
what is happiness they all sound like the same thing you look in the dictionary and sometimes they refer to each other

354
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:16,240
tautologically happiness is if Joy was this fully embodied sensation of exuberance and and

355
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:25,319
connection with the water and the whole body vibrating alive happy happiness is a

356
00:58:25,319 --> 00:58:31,839
more settled embodied feeling happiness is actually available all the

357
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:38,480
time because our body is in a state of well-being if it's breathing and if it's

358
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:45,559
not too sick but even if it's sick and I have been very very sick in

359
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:51,520
my life for about 20 years with pretty severe conditions and i' learned through

360
00:58:51,520 --> 00:59:00,200
those uh illnesses um that there is a lot of well-being in the body as long as

361
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:07,520
the body is breathing and processing itself in its natural

362
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:16,839
way the body is full of well-being so that well-being is available to us and it becomes more more clear if we turn

363
00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:22,359
and cultivate this condition for ourselves so there's

364
00:59:22,359 --> 00:59:28,480
happiness and then happiness moves into the really sweet

365
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:33,920
state of samade of concentration because if we're happy

366
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:40,839
we're watching we can begin to watch what takes us out of this happiness very

367
00:59:40,839 --> 00:59:47,599
clearly and we can see the forces of unpleasantness that are always a part of

368
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:53,000
experience because our mind is always categorizing things as pleasant and

369
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:58,200
unpleasant and in happiness we have now land and did were on the dry ground and

370
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:07,000
we have have this ability to take a better look at oh I can really connect

371
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:14,480
and take that cling to that unpleasantness or I

372
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:21,599
cannot so it's an information field that keeps us really able to see more and

373
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:27,240
choose more to stay more in that

374
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:36,319
stabilizing calmness because that stabilizing calmness increases and becomes really pleasurable to be still

375
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:43,440
and single with everything so we if we're back in that stream it's like we

376
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:50,720
pulled out of the ground and um in the state of

377
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:57,720
Happiness this unification of the whole environment begins to Happ happen and we

378
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:03,520
are one with this environment so it's a singleness of

379
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:10,200
focus it's not really a concentration it's a kind of a coming together

380
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:18,079
that's full of tremendous potential for more ability to

381
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:27,319
see and to feel good and to keep meditating more and to keep looking at

382
01:01:27,319 --> 01:01:32,920
this Dua these arisings of

383
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:40,640
Dua and there's a harmonizing it's not a technical word but there's a

384
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:48,119
real cozy feeling of at homeness when we've cultivated this

385
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:53,920
Samar this condition of somebody we've created all the conditions to come to this

386
01:01:53,920 --> 01:02:00,799
togetherness then we are able to sense the contact of

387
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:10,839
things and contact is just when a sound comes and we sense it when

388
01:02:10,839 --> 01:02:18,200
a sensation in the through the nose comes we sense it when the mind a

389
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:25,240
thought comes we sense it so in Samari we're sensing all the six

390
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:32,839
senses coming but they get integrated because we are with one with everything

391
01:02:32,839 --> 01:02:39,440
and there's something really interesting about somebody because it's usually tied to a lot of easy breathing the breath

392
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:46,760
becomes very very very easeful and very even almost

393
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:51,880
non-existent and um the diaphragm in our

394
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:57,319
body is connect unifies the whole body this is big sheet in the middle of our

395
01:02:57,319 --> 01:03:03,000
body and when we're at one with the breath everything is Unified in the

396
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:10,559
entire body and that's the some of the sensation of what somebody is like and

397
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:15,680
this is useful for continuing our ability to

398
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:22,480
see ability to know ability to understand what we're

399
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:29,680
sensing ability to keep seeing in a fresh way what

400
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:36,319
is what needs caretaking how to car take more how to

401
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:42,839
do it even more and more because it's good it's

402
01:03:42,839 --> 01:03:48,079
beautiful to take good look inside and

403
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:56,279
try to support healing somebody heals somebody brings us together and it

404
01:03:56,279 --> 01:04:02,400
gives us a momentum to move forward and then we're moving forward to

405
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:08,920
um to the Insight now begins real insight in the next condition the next

406
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:17,200
condition is knowledge and vision of things as they are this is when the process of insight begins when we to

407
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:24,680
begin to go take a deeper look at how things are forming at an closer level

408
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:30,160
inside and this is a radical shift because if

409
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:35,880
we stop you've heard if you've heard this myth of Copus pushing Boulders up

410
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:45,359
the hill that's kind of a little bit the the way that Dua Works in life Dua

411
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:53,160
Works in life we keep pushing the same Boulders sometimes we're pushing many different Boulders up the hill

412
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:59,920
again and then that's all we're doing pushing the same Boulders up the hill

413
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:06,880
again and again and these conditions are allowing us to see that um wait a minute they

414
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:14,480
they we can just let the B Boulders run down the hill fall down the hill and we don't have to keep pushing the

415
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:23,680
boulders there is a choice they don't have to we don't have to keep pushing the same Stories the same paradigms the

416
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:31,920
same set of ideas the same views the same fears or the same hopes

417
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:38,359
even there's a whole other way of being that doesn't involve any of

418
01:05:38,359 --> 01:05:45,079
that and so in knowledge and vision of things as they are we're just taking the samade

419
01:05:45,079 --> 01:05:52,559
and turning to everything that arises from the six

420
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:59,160
senses a touch comes and we can connect to it and we connect to

421
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:07,760
it directly and deeply to sense and get to know its n nature because every sense

422
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:13,680
contact every mind contact every sight contact every smell

423
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:23,480
contact every sound every object of the eye has this amazing similar thing it

424
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:29,799
has this quality of coming and going so it's not

425
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:36,200
constant and so we're invited to make this radical shift this is not normal

426
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:42,039
life we're invited to make a radical shift to look at the Miracle of

427
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:49,319
Life very closely the life movement the life

428
01:06:49,319 --> 01:06:57,400
heat that comes through all the sensations that we can sense and know and we make the shift to step into

429
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:05,240
this internal world of insight and it's very revelatory because

430
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:12,920
what's revealed is that there is a continuous movement to

431
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:19,920
everything so there it doesn't make sense to cling if we cling we

432
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:28,240
suffer clinging doesn't make sense because it's everything's moving there's nothing to cling to so we trust being in

433
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:36,520
another state of being that's flowing and we also see that the victim

434
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:42,279
the person the experiencer the doer all those different postures that we can

435
01:07:42,279 --> 01:07:47,680
take that we do take in our life that also is

436
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:56,039
flowing and we keep if we keep looking at that we see that that's empty

437
01:07:56,039 --> 01:08:03,319
and that's how Liberation begins we can sense all of this we know

438
01:08:03,319 --> 01:08:10,000
this directly these are not ideas to believe in or to trust we sense it very

439
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:19,480
directly so it's all shifting and so if it's all shifting if it's all truly empty as we

440
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:26,719
step closer to the Miracle of Life we're not detaching from it then

441
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:33,238
we get this very confident posture that can be called a condition of

442
01:08:33,239 --> 01:08:38,560
disenchantment not the greatest translation but it's better to see it as

443
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:45,560
the condition to say enough already I can say enough already to to everything

444
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:52,798
to anything because I can sense another the truth of the matter the truth of the

445
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:59,199
matter is that that things will let go that suffering is not

446
01:08:59,199 --> 01:09:04,359
true that Dua is not true not that suffering is

447
01:09:04,359 --> 01:09:11,440
true but if we cling we suffer so we see into this suffering

448
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:16,838
thing from a whole other angle kind of like from this internal world we can see

449
01:09:16,839 --> 01:09:22,120
into this suffering that that is part of

450
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:30,480
life and so we're opening big time the door to Liberation to really having this

451
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:38,158
mature stance to see into how things form how we

452
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:43,960
are and so disenchantment is noticing that we're

453
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:49,359
gripping to things noticing that there is a

454
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:55,679
grip and then dispassion is can be which we like which is better to call Faith in

455
01:09:55,679 --> 01:10:05,600
away this passion is then allowing the process of things

456
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:11,480
appearing as they are and not labeling

457
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:19,280
them this enchantment this passion can blend into this form where see everything that arises a sound

458
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:24,800
arises we don't really just leave it alone the sound arises and it's got a

459
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:31,679
label to it ambulance fire truck don't like it but a

460
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:39,199
sound can just arise and just arise just appear just take a form without a naming

461
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:45,120
or a knowing it and in life we mix these things up

462
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:50,880
and so everything has a label and then it's fixed into the label that's the

463
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:59,760
conceptual framework of how the perceptual process works everything that we recognize we can get a label but it

464
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:08,440
doesn't have to be so when we're in this realm this nice soft realm of softening

465
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:14,640
down and looking with a very supported way at how things are the more that we

466
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:20,760
let things just be as they appear the more we're loosening that

467
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:26,120
grip that our mind has on this is this way

468
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:33,760
I am this way they are this way he is this way this is this way that's how

469
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:39,159
this is this concept is true that concept is not

470
01:11:39,159 --> 01:11:44,600
true not to dismiss or try to come to a truth statement that things are not how

471
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:50,120
they are or some truth statement about anything it's just to see how they are operating in

472
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:55,280
here how holding on so fixedly to my

473
01:11:55,280 --> 01:12:00,320
story of me as it

474
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:07,639
is my continuous story because what's sad about this whole thing is that it

475
01:12:07,639 --> 01:12:15,199
repeats itself it's kind of like we keep repeating many many of the same same

476
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:20,719
narratives again and again and if we

477
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:28,159
distinguish the the concepts that we have as opposed to just the flow of the

478
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:33,320
nature of how things come there's just a things just appear

479
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:39,320
this thought appears and it can just be an appearance it doesn't have to be a

480
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:47,360
bad thought so we this teasing part that we do when we're in doing

481
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:54,880
Insight creates this fading away it's like the Rope a it's like a rope that's

482
01:12:54,880 --> 01:13:00,880
hold holding tying a sailboat to to to to the edge it's like the Rope

483
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:06,120
the sailboat's tied to this rope and in fading away and allowing things to be

484
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:12,159
part of the nature of how they are more and more and see the connection to how

485
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:19,280
that reduces our suffering how that reduces to how we keep ourselves entrapped in the same ways of

486
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:25,760
being when we when that Fades away the Rope releases

487
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:31,280
and sets the sailboat free to sail

488
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:41,360
because we are actually not meant to be tied up a boat a sailboat is meant to

489
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:48,120
sail just like our being is meant to be who you

490
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:57,600
are your true Essence not the narrative lives only

491
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:03,920
something much much much more free so there's a way to let

492
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:11,199
things ideas be Concepts be and there's a way to let things just appear and then

493
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:17,440
there's something right in between what happens when there's

494
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:26,320
neither when it's just being here who are you who who can you

495
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:35,040
be when we're not the play of the same characters in the

496
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:41,400
same stories that's what

497
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:48,480
we're unveiling letting our most deep Essence

498
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:55,520
to flow out of us without all of the constructed

499
01:14:55,520 --> 01:15:02,880
activity that we're in that is a part of us and that we then

500
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:10,080
do we don't have to just be a constructing fabricating machine of everything we've inherited from

501
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:16,920
societies and familial lines and and that then we keep reproducing

502
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:24,600
ourselves this path is showing us that there's some other way if we allow

503
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:30,480
these things to deconstruct so

504
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:41,080
Liberation is when the constructions cease when all our narratives all of our

505
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:49,120
ways of Habitual patterns of attachment habitual patterns of clinging

506
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:56,320
stop when we can stop them and it's very cool because the

507
01:15:56,320 --> 01:16:03,000
being that is not full of Habitual patterns full of the constructed ways of

508
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:09,239
being is a being that is responsive it's not a being that is

509
01:16:09,239 --> 01:16:18,120
reactive it's a be being that has arms open wide to everything and everyone and

510
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:25,280
anything and that's Liberation Liberation is seeing being in

511
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:32,400
the tradition as the unconstructed the not fabricated for

512
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:39,480
this reason because when we're not fabricating the same play of life which

513
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:47,159
is a bit of a tragic play in a sense if you think that repeating the same three

514
01:16:47,159 --> 01:16:53,360
acts again and again is not tragic um it's not

515
01:16:53,360 --> 01:17:01,639
necessarily happy the same repetition of things so stepping out of that

516
01:17:01,639 --> 01:17:10,880
entirely is Liberation not leaving any traces

517
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:17,199
behind and then the final piece is to knowledge is knowledge of

518
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:22,800
Liberation because the Buddha like I said did not was not interested in

519
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:29,880
some wonderful enlightenment only some amazing Awakening that may

520
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:36,360
come that comes but what would you like more to know

521
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:44,880
that you can be mature and at peace or to have a lot of

522
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:50,679
flashy Oneness with the universe Cosmic Consciousness I'm not sure what these

523
01:17:50,679 --> 01:17:57,520
things are these things may come but for the Buddha it seemed to be an emphasis on Liberation and knowledge of

524
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:04,199
Liberation knowing how suffering ends a much more human activity to know

525
01:18:04,199 --> 01:18:10,320
how suffering ends because then we can do something for

526
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:17,199
ourselves and why do this do this because maybe suffering has

527
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:23,320
run its course for some people maybe they're you do want to say enough we do

528
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:28,440
enough to suffering we may also do this out of a certain

529
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:35,320
love maybe a certain love for that doesn't want suffering

530
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:44,198
anymore maybe a certain love that also doesn't want suffering for other people either so we do it for

531
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:53,280
others and that may be the last one of the final instructions of the

532
01:18:53,280 --> 01:19:00,679
Buddha go for forth for the welfare of the many for the happiness of the many for

533
01:19:00,679 --> 01:19:08,760
the goodness of the many so why do

534
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:14,960
this we do this for the betterment of our

535
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:23,080
community for the betterment of this community the maturing of this community so that this community can do

536
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:31,080
it for the rest of the world as as well and may it be so for the all of you
