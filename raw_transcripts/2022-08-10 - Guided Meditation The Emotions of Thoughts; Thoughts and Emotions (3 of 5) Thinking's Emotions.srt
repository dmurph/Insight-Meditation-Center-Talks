1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,639
so good morning

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,919
and i find myself

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,960
unexpectedly kind of quiet and without

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:26,160
easy access to words but they don't they're they're here so

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,920
so one of the very interesting

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,920
things to realize about oneself is that

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,239
we're not in any fixed way who we are

8
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:52,160
that who we are is changeable and changing in context and situations

9
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:59,680
and also who we are as a question mark you know who are we do we really know who we are

10
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,840
from day to day minute to minute year to year

11
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,680
to begin and one of the things about some of us

12
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:18,080
is that we might have a place within maybe our thinking

13
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:26,680
that or feeling or some somatic experience that we most associate with who we are

14
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,520
and when that is thinking or when that is emotions but especially

15
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:40,240
thinking that we might limit ourselves by identifying with ourselves in a

16
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,600
particular way like this is who i am and so for example

17
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:53,600
i think i said this a couple of days ago that i find that how i think privately to myself

18
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,439
is differently than how i would talk out loud to myself it's like a different part of the brain

19
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:05,439
almost that's working and so i'm accessing different things i speak different languages

20
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:11,120
and and i'm a little different personality uh or a little different

21
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,440
connection to different parts of myself depending on the languages i speak it's almost like a little different self

22
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,040
and i've known people who spoke two different languages and

23
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,239
their personality to me was dramatically different in each one

24
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,760
and so i'm saying this as we look at our thinking or mindful our

25
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,040
thinking that we have to be very sensitive that we don't overly identify

26
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:46,160
with the thinker with the way that we're thinking because then we might overly believe in

27
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,160
or participate in or be burdened by the particular thoughts that

28
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,239
the thinker has or the particular attitudes that come along with our thinking

29
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,440
or the particular emotions that the thinking is part of

30
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:10,959
the ecology that it's part of so um

31
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,000
so what i'd like to suggest today is uh for those of you who are willing

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,239
you can ignore it if you'd like but to spend this meditation period more as an exercise

33
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:28,560
than as a meditation and it's an exercise which maybe won't help you be as calm and centered as

34
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,480
maybe can be in meditation but uh you'll learn something about yourself

35
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:41,200
that will support your ability to be mindful to be to meditate much better in the future i hope so it's

36
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:47,360
kind of a little stepping aside for a moment to do an exercise for the ongoing

37
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,840
growth here and that is to begin noticing

38
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,040
aspects of your thinking that the thinking phenomena the thinking

39
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,159
process that normally you don't notice and in particular

40
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:10,239
to notice um the mood the emotional

41
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:16,880
emotionality of the thinking what emotions do thinking come with what emotions they come out of

42
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,160
and if you pay careful attention to your thinking what is the attitude that's behind the

43
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:30,080
words or the images you have the ideas you're thinking about what is the mood what is the emotional

44
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:38,320
quality of it is it apprehensive and afraid is it harsh judgmental is it kind and supportive

45
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,320
compassionate how is it but then the more difficult part of the

46
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,000
exercise may be whatever you notice it to be

47
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,600
if it's not particularly supportive for you doesn't maybe particularly supportive

48
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,759
for meditation call upon a different part of your thinking mind

49
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:07,199
and think in ways that are supportive for meditation

50
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,320
and there's two ways to do it either think

51
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,520
kind generous thoughts be compassionate

52
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:24,680
the other is to offer yourself meditation instruction

53
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:31,440
think instructions think about okay now do this not do that but do it in a gentle non

54
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,639
harsh way with a very different attitude than the unhelpful attitude you've noticed at

55
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,759
your that's part of your thinking process there's not necessarily meaning that

56
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:48,479
you're jettison how you're thinking or pushing it away the attitude but you're bringing in

57
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:54,240
something else into the ecology of the mind and maybe you're disidentifying

58
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,080
with the usual thinking mind that you have that doesn't have to be you

59
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:08,000
the authority of how it feels and its attitudes are just an attitude and a and a feeling and uh

60
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
emotion it's not like this is the truth this is really what's happening

61
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:23,120
so so we'll see how it goes so taking a meditation posture

62
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:32,280
and gently closing your eyes

63
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:43,879
and it's still valuable to settle in for this exercise so taking a few long slow deep breaths

64
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,520
as you exhale relax and settle

65
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,160
breathing in relaxing

66
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,639
breathing in and feeling your whole body

67
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,599
letting your breathing return to normal and spend a couple of minutes

68
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:50,240
gently relaxing the body the face the shoulders the chest

69
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,479
the heart center the belly

70
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:56,000
and then another couple of minutes of just being simple and

71
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,720
centering yourself on the breathing allowing more things to just settle and

72
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,720
quiet being here

73
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,519
and now if you would like to do this exercise

74
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:41,680
allow yourself to think rather than letting go of thoughts

75
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:48,640
as they occur just let them be and let yourself that let the mind think

76
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,920
and notice some of the qualities of that thinking

77
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,839
is it fast or slow

78
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:14,200
is there a lot of energy to think or is it kind of calm thinking

79
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:10,839
are you thinking more in words or thinking more in images or a combination

80
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,959
and as you're thinking are you strongly pulled into the world

81
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,720
of thinking or can you

82
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,600
track yourself thinking can you be aware of

83
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,959
the momentum of thinking

84
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,600
aware of what you're thinking about

85
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,760
aware of how you're thinking

86
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,680
does your thinking have a location is it centered somewhere in the head or

87
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,440
the heart in the forehead and the brain

88
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,040
back of the brain front of the brain

89
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:23,040
the eyes if it's imagery

90
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,440
are the images centered in front of you

91
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,639
hmm

92
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:12,120
and then as you're sitting here become aware of

93
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,320
any emotion connected to your thinking

94
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:27,519
maybe there's a mood or emotional attitude with which it's expressed or in the

95
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:34,880
middle of it or maybe it's propelled by an emotion

96
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,839
what emotion or emotions are connected to your thinking

97
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:16,160
sometimes the emotion can be identified by feeling the pressure to think

98
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:23,839
is there any pressure to think and if there is is there an emotion connected to that

99
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:53,440
sometimes the emotionality might be like the atmosphere or the weather that

100
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:00,800
surrounds a person walking on the countryside

101
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,640
you're thinking might be surrounded by an atmosphere of an emotion

102
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,720
mood attitude

103
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,839
the emotion might be subtle just a hint

104
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:35,000
or might be quite loud even predominating

105
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:06,799
sometimes the fuel or pressure to think comes from the emotions

106
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,679
associated with thinking

107
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,000
and if the emotions connected to your thinking

108
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,840
doesn't feel supportive for meditation

109
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:18,880
or feels like it's the emote their thinking is and the emotions are

110
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,360
you identify with it more than necessary

111
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:31,360
see if you can now think in a different way

112
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:39,559
almost like you're calling upon a different person to speak

113
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:45,679
leaving the other one alone but gently

114
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,720
maybe kindly

115
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:56,720
lovingly say words about yourself and for yourself here that are

116
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,760
supportive and

117
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,840
kind

118
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,080
say supportive words that

119
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:24,799
direct the mind the attention to do the meditation practice

120
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:31,600
of mindfulness if you want to be mindful of the emotions

121
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:37,360
it's like you're stepping back and with a soft supportive voice

122
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:43,280
encouraging yourself with the words or ideas of

123
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:51,400
just just feel the emotions where are the emotions felt in the body

124
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:09,120
are the emotions somehow dynamic and processes

125
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:17,840
are they vibrating or changing or shifting in any way

126
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,720
where in your body do you feel your emotions

127
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:38,799
so without that kind of instructions those kinds of thoughts direct your mindfulness

128
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:47,120
to be present for this other part of you that's doing the thinking

129
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:54,240
the automatic thinking and the conscious intentional thinking

130
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:00,720
that you do let that be relaxed easeful

131
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,600
no pressure

132
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:12,159
but an alternative to being identified with your old way of

133
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,159
thinking

134
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:11,200
and now as we come to the end of the sitting

135
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:20,278
call upon a voice the inner way of thinking or imagining

136
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,520
that taps into your capacity for goodwill

137
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:33,360
well-wishing of others perhaps your kindness perhaps your

138
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:40,559
generosity perhaps your love and compassion

139
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:49,279
and imagine that your attention now goes out into the world and concentric

140
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:57,520
circles from where you're sitting the people near you people in neighborhoods and counties

141
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:03,440
provinces outwards across the

142
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,080
the continent you're in and around the globe

143
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:17,679
and think some thoughts with an inner voice

144
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,960
say words of well-wishing

145
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,080
speak from your heart quietly silently

146
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,840
your care your

147
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,120
well-wishing for others

148
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:48,080
and experiment with a voice with an inner thinking inner way of being

149
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:55,200
that brings forth some of the best qualities that might be

150
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,000
available right now

151
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:20,080
may all beings be happy

152
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,880
may all beings be safe

153
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:33,279
may all beings be peaceful

154
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:39,240
and may all beings be free

155
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:51,449
[Music]

156
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,840
thank you

157
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:12,799
and while i'm um drinking some water here transitioning for the talk

158
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:19,600
if some of you'd like to put a few words in the chat about if there's if that exercise was useful

159
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,960
for you if you discovered or learned something about yourself in that process

160
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,600
be kind of nice to read a little bit of that before i give the talk

161
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,840
thank you

162
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,720
yes if i talk and no one's there am i really talking

163
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:20,799
it's a question for our minds when we talk to ourselves who's there

164
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:26,799
so thank you very much for those of you who wrote comments in the chat and

165
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:32,880
about what this was like to do that exercise we just did and [Music]

166
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:40,320
not surprisingly i think there was a fair number of people who had mentioned anxiety and fear

167
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:47,279
it's very common to have fear or anxiety apprehension be the drive for thinking

168
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:52,640
especially if thinking is a lot to do about planning and spend a lot of time planning planning

169
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:59,919
tends to be fear based not always sometimes it's sometimes it's delight based

170
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:05,600
so you know if people if meditators get the message that all they're supposed to do

171
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:11,040
is let go of their thoughts and go back to their breathing that can be a very nice instructions and

172
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:18,878
very helpful sometimes to keep it that simple but it also is a way of dismissing thinking

173
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:24,000
and not really bringing a lot of mindfulness to this whole process of thinking

174
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,480
ideally in this mindfulness practice we're doing we're learning how to bring a kind of a

175
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:37,280
clear clarity of attention and care and respect to all aspects of

176
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:42,800
our lives and to keep letting go of something and not really take time to really get to

177
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:49,839
know it is a kind of disrespect it isn't we're not inspecting it and again and again

178
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:55,520
and um so there comes a time when we want to really turn our attention to the

179
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:02,240
thinking mind itself and be mindful of that and maybe it where maybe even the meditation becomes

180
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:08,640
not thinking meditation the sense of actively thinking and contemplating something but thinking meditation in the sense

181
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:14,560
that um the thinking is the object of the quiet attentive mindfulness we're

182
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:20,000
doing just like we would bring quiet attentive mindfulness to breathing

183
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,760
and then it's not about breathing exactly but it's about being present and for it

184
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,960
so being present for thinking but maybe without participating in the

185
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,320
thoughts and there's a lot to discover in that world of thinking

186
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:42,560
and without discovering it about seeing the how it works our thinking what drives it

187
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:48,160
what how we're pulled into it the energy in it the how we identify with it

188
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:55,040
the thinking well those things will operate in thinking anyway and some people get confused about

189
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:01,359
why do i keep thinking same thing or why do i always feeling the same way or

190
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:08,880
some people won't understand the teachings about not self in buddhism

191
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,079
because they're so strongly identified with our thinking i think therefore i am

192
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:21,040
and who am i if i'm not thinking it says that's the locus that's the center of it all but to be able to step back

193
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:26,400
and watch it and see it and realize that the watcher is not the

194
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:33,119
thinker and and if we're able to step back far enough if that the watcher can be do

195
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:39,040
more quietly silently or doing it from a different place

196
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:45,680
and um so one of the things to discover is that

197
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:51,599
certain emotions are the fuel for our thinking they're the they provide the pressure to keep

198
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:56,880
thinking the same thing over and over again and if that's the case

199
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:02,400
then it's really valuable to do a mindfulness of emotions to respect

200
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,760
the emotions get to know it more deeply practice with it and some people know how to practice

201
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:14,720
mindfulness of emotions when emotions are kind of their own thing but when emotions are kind of embedded

202
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:21,200
in our thinking uh it's more subtle or or we don't really take time to look at

203
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:26,320
it and one reason not to look at it is that if we think we are

204
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:33,760
the thoughts we are the thinker and who we are is observing say

205
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:40,400
with the world it doesn't occur to us to turn around and look at the observer look at the

206
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:46,079
thinker because the thinker is the one that's looking not the one that's being looked at

207
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:51,680
and so we might miss a whole bunch of aspects of our inner life because of the

208
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:57,920
of not having that ability to look back on what we think is the self you know who we are

209
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,119
over time we start being much more relaxed about having the central locus a

210
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:10,400
central coagulated center this is who i am

211
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:16,320
we are something of course but we don't have to have any stress and contraction compaction

212
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:22,560
around that self often has to do with our thinking sometimes it has to do with some people

213
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:28,160
are more emotionally based and some people are more somatically based but

214
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:33,200
all these places are valuable but we don't have to be based in them we don't have to be

215
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:40,160
centered in them as if that's who we are the idea is to be more fluid and inclusive holistic

216
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:46,800
include it all so if we're not blinded

217
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,400
by our thinking so we can't look at thinking if we could turn around and look at it

218
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,839
and if we see the emotions there the moods then we could do mindfulness of the

219
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:05,599
emotion so say for example there's a lot of future thinking that's driven by anxiety the anxiety

220
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:11,280
comes with some authority some power some sense of alarm that we have to do

221
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,320
something we have something has to go on and so we get pulled in seduced in in a

222
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:23,359
sense to have those thoughts problem solving fixing imagining all the possibilities so maybe we can

223
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:30,560
become safer or something but it can be so repetitive over and over and over again

224
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,400
but if you turn around and feel the anxiety and for some people that never taken

225
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,520
time never felt it was you know possible or of interest to turn

226
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:47,119
around and feel the anxiety in the body to help the anxiety feel

227
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:54,400
safe help give space for the anxiety to be there so that it's almost as if the thinking

228
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,839
is the signpost for the anxiety it's the messenger and we stay with the

229
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:04,880
messenger and we don't read the message and the message is the emotions that are

230
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:11,440
there and so we might practice with the emotions the other thing that we might notice

231
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,640
when he starts noticing the emotions of the thinking is that

232
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:24,319
having the thoughts is one thing the thing the thoughts we have influence us in one way

233
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:31,280
but the emotions might influence us in different way sometimes the primary influence on the

234
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:36,800
ongoing mood and concerns we have might be the underlying emotion

235
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,800
not the content of the thoughts itself

236
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:47,680
then but then certain certain emotions they influence the kind of thoughts we

237
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:53,280
have so fear thoughts might produce thoughts of

238
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,800
danger if they all the possible dangers we might run into anger thoughts

239
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:05,119
and a mood of anger move of aversion might predispose us

240
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:11,839
to have thoughts about all the things that are wrong and and what we don't like

241
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:17,040
if the underlying mood is one of desire we might be thinking

242
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:23,920
fantasies of desire looking for things we want and can have so the underlying mood can affect the

243
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:30,240
kind of thoughts we have and motivations we have and um and so

244
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:36,480
and then when we have those thoughts that are you know shaped by the emotion they in

245
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:43,200
return will feed back on those emotions there's a feedback loop that goes on feedback circle

246
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:50,000
and um and so we can get caught in these circles and spend all day sometimes if

247
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,160
they're not very powerful and you know not too much suffering in them

248
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:03,440
they can just continue all day especially if we identify with it if we take it oh this is who i am

249
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,880
if we've done this for so long that this is normal

250
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:14,160
it's become the normal thing so normal becomes invisible to us isn't that's how everything is and how it's

251
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:20,160
supposed to be this is the order of the universe is to have you know these kinds of thoughts or have

252
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:26,560
these kinds of mood and this is you know so normal um

253
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:33,760
maybe there's no normal for this mind of ours it's a dynamic fluid

254
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:40,480
uh process that the more free we are the more we can kind of surf and

255
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,680
navigate it all and not be unduly influenced or caused by any of it

256
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:52,400
but respectful for all of it and and so this ability

257
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,680
to look at the underlying mood emotion tone

258
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:04,640
of how of our thinking is eye-opening for some people it's kind of revolutionary

259
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:12,079
it's like the missing link for some people it can be quite disturbing for some people because it upsets what's normal

260
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:17,839
it reveals things sometimes that you know we haven't admitted before

261
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:24,079
but in the short term it could be a little bit disorienting but in the long term

262
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:30,800
this is the way to find some real inner stability some real ability to be creative and

263
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:37,680
present and let the best of who we are give it a chance to surface and come

264
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:44,000
in a way it can't if we're over over identified

265
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,839
with a particular mood attitude of thinking that

266
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:55,440
we don't even know is there sometimes or or we so strongly think this is normal

267
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:01,920
that we're kind of caught in its grip with enough care with mindfulness

268
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:09,680
practice all the grips relax not automatically but i want to

269
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:16,079
encourage you to to have confidence that this practice leads to the

270
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:21,200
de-gripping the relaxing the clinging that

271
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:26,240
goes on in the mind and

272
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:31,839
so and perhaps today

273
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:37,440
you can spend the day kind of looking at this through the day what are the emotions

274
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:44,480
that seem to be behind your thoughts that you have and see if you can

275
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:51,680
almost like you're speaking in a different language see if you can call upon a different part of the mind

276
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:56,880
and start thinking a different way not pushing away or denying the fact

277
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:02,720
that you maybe are thinking with a lot of fear anxiety or whatever it might be for you

278
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:10,160
but simply see if you can find on the side of that somewhere else a place of confidence or generosity or

279
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:18,079
kindness or maybe even humor

280
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:23,760
playfulness all kinds of possibilities but uh see today whether you can kind of

281
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:29,280
shift and change and pay attention to your mind and find if there's different ways of

282
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:34,960
thinking and and in the process begin to de-identify

283
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:41,680
with one particular way and as you de-identify

284
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:50,720
you might become a greater observer of it all

285
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,799
so thank you very much and um

286
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,838
i look forward to continuing tomorrow
