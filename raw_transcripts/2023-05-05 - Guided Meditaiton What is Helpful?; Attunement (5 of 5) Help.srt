1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:03,680
warm greetings

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,820
in Cloudy kind of a little bit wet

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,279
California here we've had unseasonable amount of

4
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:24,140
light rain through the week and clouds and cool weather

5
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:32,480
and I like it quite a bit yeah maybe for my

6
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:39,300
left over from my native town in Norway where I was

7
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:47,000
born Bergen where it rains quite a bit cloudy quite a bit

8
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,039
so my friends there are many motivations

9
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,280
for meditating but the ones that Buddhism somehow holds

10
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:06,960
up as Central to the Buddhist Enterprise could all be subsumed under the

11
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,960
expression benefit we are meditating practicing Buddhism to

12
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,600
benefit and who are we benefiting everyone

13
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,640
the Buddha said that a wise person is concerned with benefiting oneself

14
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,759
benefiting others benefiting self and others and benefiting the whole world

15
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,799
and uh it's kind of comprehensive and there's not choosing one or the other to

16
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,960
just benefit yourself just benefit others but there's a integrated whole

17
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:47,000
that is the domain of wise reflection and wise and motivation

18
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:52,439
and uh and if your motivation is to serve

19
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:58,860
others to benefit others when we sit down to meditate

20
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,560
one of the important ways to prepare ourselves to bring benefits to

21
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,739
the world is in fact to benefit ourselves it's important to do this it's important

22
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:16,319
to shed layers of reactivity and stress that we carry

23
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,780
it's important to shed layers of clinging and attachments and anxieties

24
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:27,420
that we carry because the more these are shed the more that not only are we available to

25
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:33,180
benefit the world but our very way of being in the world is beneficial

26
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:40,980
when people experience someone who feel who is calm who is uh seems to have no fear

27
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:47,180
someone who has no obstacles to their kindness and their love

28
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:55,200
and we benefit ours we benefit ourselves and bring forth what's beautiful within us those qualities then are available

29
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,480
for the world as well so when we sit down to meditate

30
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:08,220
one of the options you have and completion will do today is to orient the meditation from the

31
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:14,819
very beginning with a question what is beneficial for me

32
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:22,319
here and now let's not just go ahead and just meditate in roads just meditate because I'm

33
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:28,620
supposed to and I have a technique to do I have a way of practicing and I'll just do it because that's what I do

34
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:35,640
but rather take some time at the beginning to reflect how am I right now what's happening for

35
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:42,239
me and given what's happening how I am what would be beneficial what would be a

36
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,400
beneficial way to meditate and that there's layers of answering

37
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:53,400
that question one is to ask the questions in the point of view of your body

38
00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:00,620
what's a better beneficial way to establish a posture for meditation

39
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:06,959
Maybe there's a deep need for rest and relaxation

40
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:15,180
maybe there's a deep need for strength maybe there's a deep need for

41
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:21,060
um to kind of really feel embodied and feel connected here in this body so that with

42
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,460
the body we can feel connected to the world around us and different postures support these

43
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:32,580
different things so to be a little bit conscious about what posture is useful for you

44
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,039
in small ways it might change from day to day

45
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:47,060
then you might ask what is beneficial for your heart

46
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:54,419
maybe it's taking time to acknowledge what's happening emotionally and with you

47
00:04:54,419 --> 00:05:03,360
not to overlook it or try to Barrel through it maybe there's a some

48
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:10,020
tender loving care of some kind that your inner life could benefit from

49
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:15,560
meta kindness compassion

50
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:21,800
maybe your heart needs some honesty

51
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:28,139
sometimes truth-telling is the greatest need that some sometimes we have

52
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:35,520
to really acknowledge how we are what's happening in a clear and Unapologetic way

53
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:42,539
just oh it's like this something in the heart can settle sometimes when our situation ourselves

54
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:46,039
are really acknowledged

55
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:54,840
even to acknowledge that I'm afraid or acknowledge I'm depressed or acknowledged that I'm angry

56
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:01,020
that's a truth-telling that's often that's needed if we want to kind of start being bringing benefit to

57
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:08,160
ourselves and to the world because when it's honest then we can kind of find our way with it

58
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:16,199
what's beneficial for this mind maybe how we meditate is important for

59
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:23,900
the mind and the Heart to not strive or not to measure or not compare ourselves

60
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:30,960
to maybe it's helpful to be Fearless when we meditate

61
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:37,500
or un interruptible

62
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:44,580
undiscourageable even if there's this discouragement or to not let it get in the way even though

63
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:54,419
there is anxiety not let it get in the way so sitting here and just asking yourself

64
00:06:54,419 --> 00:07:00,060
oh what way would what way of meditating right now would be beneficial

65
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:07,800
given everything and then meditating that way

66
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,080
or starting that way sometimes starting for just a few

67
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:20,520
minutes and then settling into the basic meditation practice sometimes just doing it longer

68
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:29,300
but what happens to you when you begin your meditation with a question what would be beneficial right now

69
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,520
in how to meditate and then proceed from there

70
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,479
now be quiet now as we meditate for the next minutes

71
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,560
foreign

72
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,940
okay

73
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:02,360
foreign

74
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:55,100
and as we come to the end of the sitting

75
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:07,799
to take in the idea that if we want to benefit others

76
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:14,120
spiritually or dharmically

77
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:23,419
we can do more if we have benefited ourselves spiritually or dharmically

78
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:30,600
and if we don't want to benefit others but only ourselves

79
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:36,799
if we're benefiting ourselves in the Dharma spiritually

80
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:44,539
we will somehow or other benefit others anyway

81
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:51,500
our own spiritual benefit our own dharmic benefit

82
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:59,039
is integrally linked to the welfare of others

83
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:04,500
for one thing the more we dharmically benefit ourselves

84
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:11,940
spiritually benefit ourselves the more we know what

85
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:18,840
dharmic benefit can be the more we can be attuned

86
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,360
to that possibility for other people as well

87
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:32,640
maybe people more than material help or emotional help

88
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,279
what goes deepest Into the Heart Is dharm is dharmic help spiritual help

89
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:45,419
something that touches a home inside of us that's deeper

90
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:50,360
than our emotional life our cognitive life

91
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:02,159
it may it be that as we navigate and walk this path of the Dharma

92
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:07,980
may it be that we do so to benefit ourselves to benefit others

93
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:14,658
to benefit self and others and to benefit the whole world

94
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:22,320
they are deepening deepening connection

95
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:29,159
to the dharmic life to the spiritual life be a support

96
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:36,720
for the welfare and happiness of all beings may all beings be happy

97
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:44,840
may all beings be safe may all beings be peaceful

98
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:54,440
and may all beings know freedom freedom from suffering

99
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,120
and find it in their hearts

100
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:12,799
[Music]

101
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,220
thank you

102
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,600
all right

103
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:06,840
so thank you so we come to the last of these five

104
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:14,039
talks on Attunement and so the with the acronym touch

105
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:19,620
there's thinking thinking well thinking carefully about

106
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:26,419
the suffering we encounter because the Attunement we're talking about is the Attunement that allows

107
00:32:26,419 --> 00:32:33,600
a meaningful important effective compassion healthy compassion to come

108
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:40,799
forth into our care for the world so before we're ready for compassion we

109
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:46,679
want to be attuned to the suffering and that can take some reflection and thinking

110
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:54,240
we want to be open to it willing to experience it and this willingness is openness to it is a profound thing

111
00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:00,120
because it's part of the movement towards freedom freedom from resistance freedom from

112
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:05,220
picking things up freedom from blocking or

113
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:11,700
becoming the cut so free we're like an open window and everything can pass through without touching the window without

114
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:18,200
affecting the window breaking the glass being upright

115
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,799
stable strong undefeated

116
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:29,940
uncollapsed just fully present not assertive not withdrawing but a strong

117
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:35,279
sense of presence for with suffering we're encountering

118
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:40,740
and then communicating with people to really to be in conversation with them

119
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:46,019
and find out better what's going on don't assume we know don't assume we know what's needed

120
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:50,778
but to find out be in communication get the information

121
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:59,279
and then today the age of touch is help important part of of compassion is to

122
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:05,279
help to do something to alleviate the suffering in oneself and others and in

123
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:10,740
the whole world and um but uh as a kind of building

124
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:15,960
block to become compassionate and two real compassionate action

125
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:23,220
um the help that I'm going to talk about today is a little bit more maybe more modest or a stepping stone towards more

126
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:32,398
more full uh compassionate action to uh to help you want to be able to ask

127
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:41,398
the question what is helpful here what is beneficial and um and in all directions what is

128
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:48,179
beneficial for oneself because if we leave ourselves too much out of the equation

129
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:54,060
then we will um we can actually cause harm to ourselves and to others if we don't

130
00:34:54,060 --> 00:35:02,099
carefully bring careful attention to our motivations our emotions our feelings our reaction to situation and just feel

131
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:08,760
like we're obligated to help someone with uh and we're supposed to be altruistic and not care for ourselves at

132
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:14,839
all we actually can be so disconnected from ourselves that inadvertently

133
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:21,599
unhelpful things will come out of us we say things we express things we we feel

134
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:27,720
kind of we actually discover where maybe feel you know there's anger in trying to help someone because we don't really

135
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:35,520
want to but we feel like we should and so what is helpful for ourselves in

136
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:41,700
this situation um and and this you know really questioning ourselves is very important

137
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:47,700
also because with compassionate action some people will live under uh rules of

138
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:53,880
obligation and the duty and shoulds that uh are

139
00:35:53,880 --> 00:36:01,740
kind of authoritarian and kind of override any careful attention and and can exhaust people part of the

140
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:08,760
compassion fatigue can sometimes come from the sense of obligation that I have to do this I have to do this

141
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:17,280
and so to really question that is what is beneficial here for me um and because when I'm in benefit

142
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,560
especially spiritually benefited dharmically benefited and become settled

143
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:29,220
and peaceful and calm and have a nice presence then not only can we act better

144
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:34,380
but the action that we do conveys something important

145
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:40,140
many times the medium is the message if we do things because we're helping

146
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:46,800
someone because we're anxious and we're trying to you know assuage our fear or motivated by fear that'll have a very

147
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:53,520
different message to people than if we are calm and settled and we don't act from fear but we act with great

148
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:59,099
energy great Passion or something but we're calm and settled and present and

149
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:06,500
clearly kind of connected to the person we're doing it and the way that we can't be if we're being motivated by fear

150
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:11,880
and my what what is help of her oneself is to check in with oneself

151
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:18,720
and and understand what motivates us to be helpful because if we're motivating uh motivated

152
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:25,859
to help others because we're not really caring for them but if we really look carefully we're just trying to

153
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:30,900
get comfortable for ourselves we want to create a nice identity for ourselves we

154
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:37,140
want to be able to show the world that we're a good person and and we're more driven

155
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:42,300
by that than we are by the helping the other people

156
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:48,839
and all those other kind of those kinds of motivations for ourselves are not spiritually beneficial not dharmically

157
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:54,720
beneficial and naturally can cause kind of long-term harm sometimes even

158
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:02,339
but so to really check in what is really helpful and the more we practice the more we can answer that question in some

159
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:07,740
ways it's really deep or really full or concerned for our long-term happiness

160
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:14,520
and Welfare not the short term just making ourselves comfortable and um

161
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:19,980
so with that there's a reference point then we can ask what is helpful for the other person

162
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:28,260
remember we're talking about being attuned to the people and um and what it and what is helpful

163
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:34,859
uh if the other person is an important thing to question and not bring the wrong kind of help some people want to

164
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:40,800
be left alone they want to figure things out themselves they just want a companion they some people just want to

165
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:46,140
be seen and known in their struggles but they don't necessarily want someone to

166
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:53,760
come to support them and Aid them and fix things the problems for them so what is supportive for others and

167
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,760
occasionally people who do want to get help from other people that's not actually spiritually helpful

168
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:06,960
for them maybe it represents some way of always being kind of helpless and looking to others to be the savior

169
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:12,839
and so at some point we want to stop being the savior because people need to grow up people need to learn how to

170
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:19,440
stand their own two feet and to always come into the rescue is not really beneficial for others

171
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:27,420
to be uncaring is not beneficial but to be caring and allow someone to grow up is is good

172
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:33,300
and this other on one hand we we want to ask what's beneficial for ourselves what's beneficial for others

173
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:39,180
and this in this category of help here is also to ask because we're trying to

174
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:46,500
be attuned what form of help is attuned to myself

175
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:52,940
and as attuned to the person there so someone is having some challenge

176
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:58,740
say that uh they are late for late to go

177
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:04,740
someplace and maybe they have a flat tire and they don't know how to fix a flat tire

178
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:10,140
so on the surface just seems like what's best is to help them you know replace

179
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:15,180
put in the spare for them because maybe you know how to do it and that's nice

180
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:22,079
but maybe you don't have a clue how to put on a spare tire so it's not helpful to go and help them

181
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:27,359
with a tire then what might be helpful is to call someone who does

182
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:33,000
find some other kind of help and um or maybe there's you know the

183
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,280
person may be configured out there's no place to call maybe there's no cell phone you're in the desert you can't

184
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:44,099
help uh with it so what's attuned with what you can do and what this need is

185
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:49,320
and maybe what you can do is bring them water you realize they've been struggling for some time it's hot in the

186
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:55,619
desert and so you bring them water maybe you bring them some food to eat and say here take a break and let's let's uh

187
00:40:55,619 --> 00:41:01,800
maybe you'll it looks like you need to drink and be settled a little bit and you can go back to it then

188
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:08,520
so there's an example of kind of what can I do that's appropriate for me and sometimes

189
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:14,400
like someone who's a a you know completely devoted introvert

190
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,619
sometimes they're just sitting on the Park Bench or something and accompanying them someplace to where they're

191
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:26,400
challenged and it doesn't you know not to be involved so much in conversation and fixing but just accompanying you

192
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,619
have the ability to be calm and centered and present and um and I've gone just to

193
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:37,260
sit with people um you know and be quiet and let them do

194
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:45,300
what they needed to do but they felt that there was some support quietly in the room uh or if you're a devoted extrovert and

195
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:51,599
you love to sing it might be that singing a song for the person

196
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:58,800
um is the right thing and I don't think that anybody wants me to sing exactly but uh but there are people who are

197
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:06,900
saying I knew I knew a chaplain who was in the hospital with someone who was dying in the emergency room it was kind

198
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:14,339
of a tragic death and the person was quite upset discouraged angry and had turned into

199
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:19,920
the turned her face into the wall and uh was was unresponsive to anybody

200
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:26,280
coming and to the chaplain just started singing a song and uh in the course of the song the

201
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:33,720
person kind of softened and opened up and turned around and then started to engage the chaplain

202
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:39,780
and um so what is the right way what's what's attuned to oneself what what we

203
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:45,780
can bring how do we help this person how do we help the person for what they

204
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:51,599
can receive some people are not able to help to receive what seems like the logical

205
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:57,300
obvious help that should be done uh they feel uh it's too they feel they

206
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:03,839
feel put put upon they feel it's too assertive people have entered their space too much they feel like they know

207
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:10,560
because then they feel obligated some cultures it's a deep sense of obligation that comes with helping people receiving

208
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:16,500
help and so it's difficult to kind of step into their in their zone so to

209
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:22,980
that's where the communication is important what will this person what does this person want to receive what

210
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:30,140
can they receive what when their end and um so um

211
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:35,460
you know so what kind of communication what kind maybe some people you know as

212
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:42,720
I said they just they just want to be quiet together with someone else someone else wants to join in a song

213
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:48,960
if someone came to me in the emergency and wanted to care for me and chances are expecting me to sing a song with

214
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:56,760
them is not really going to be you know be so helpful for me so this question of being attuned

215
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:04,319
it means questioning and considering all the factors that should be that are going that are in place to know how to

216
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:09,359
help what would be helpful here given oneself given the other person

217
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:15,660
given the situation with the Assumption and this I think is a really good assumption to go by

218
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:21,900
is that there are any given time there are many ways to help

219
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:28,079
not just one and if we are rushing into that one way that we think is the right

220
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:35,339
way then I know there's a good chance we're going to miss what the situation is really about the total situation

221
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:41,220
that includes oneself so uh touch

222
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:47,520
think open openness uprightness

223
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:52,680
communication and help all places where we do it we do

224
00:44:52,680 --> 00:45:00,200

ongoing way of dealing with the theme so far this year of how to be with challenges and now we're kind of
