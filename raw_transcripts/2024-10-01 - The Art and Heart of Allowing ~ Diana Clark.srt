00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:05,918
good evening welcome welcome

2
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:16,559
everybody so tonight I want to talk a little bit about this idea that mindfulness practice is about

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,199
allowing but when I was thinking about it I was think like allowing that

4
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:28,400
doesn't sound so interesting it doesn't sound so much fun it doesn't sound like

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:35,520
okay this is something that's going to find make me happy and make all my life run perfectly or something like that

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:42,280
whereas mindfulness you know at least it has that potential for something right something new and

7
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:48,399
different it turns out that uh mindfulness is so much about

8
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:54,480
allowing not so much about going out there manipulating and make everything be fine and perfect so that our life

9
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,320
runs perfectly because if you could do that you would not be here on a Monday night

10
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,159
right you would be out there making your life run perfectly there's this way which we

11
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:12,360
don't even notice and certainly I didn't notice that we are so often maybe even

12
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:19,040
most often in a subtle or an obvious way saying no no no no no

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:26,439
no air conditioner is too cold it was a little bit too warm earlier or uh it

14
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:32,159
should be quieter in the whole nope you know nope that should be uh we should have a longer sit we should have a

15
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,880
shorter sit or you know whatever it is there's this little way in which we're

16
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:45,079
always say no to whatever we're experiencing it somehow needs to be

17
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:50,439
different and I mean of course this is in obvious ways but also there's like so

18
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:57,079
many ways in which this is really subtle the way that we shows way this shows

19
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:02,640
up and when we start noticing all the way in which we're saying

20
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:09,599
no and instead we allow I'm not going to say that we have to say yes but just the

21
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:15,080
kind of the softening the no things really can

22
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,400
transform and can change will change will

23
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:27,160
transform in ways that uh can really make a difference for our lives move us

24
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:33,879
towards greater and greater freedom and ease so mindfulness practice is asking us can

25
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:39,120
we in some ways kind of like align with the present

26
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,760
moment can we align with the reality of the present moment what's happening is

27
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,879
what's happening doesn't matter whether we like it or don't like it doesn't matter

28
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:57,879
whether we are um obviously or very subtly trying to say no or yes I want

29
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:02,959
some more I hope this doesn't end ever I mean that's what's happening is

30
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:09,720
what's happening and it turns out that whether we allow it or not doesn't make

31
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,239
that much of a difference I'm saying that much of a

32
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:23,799
difference because there's a way the stronger there were saying no please go away if it's regards our experience you

33
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:30,319
know the experience that we're having the longer it'll stay

34
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:35,519
we've heard this expression right what we resist persists turns out this is

35
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:42,040
true much do our shagrin right that's exactly what uh we don't want I'm going

36
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:49,280
to talk a little bit about this but this idea of mindfulness is I like this kind of expression like aligning with the

37
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:56,799
reality of the moment when it's puts that way it sounds like oh okay of course like why why

38
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:03,640
wouldn't I align with reality I don't want to be hallucinating I don't want to be completely delusional I I do want to

39
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:10,599
align with the reality of the moment but there's this way in which we are so

40
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:16,919
often maybe we could say hallucinate that's a strong word but there's this way in which we have an

41
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:22,360
idea about how things should [Music]

42
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:29,840
be this notion completely in our mind 100% in our minds it should be like this

43
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:36,320
and how it should be usually is related to the word comfortable it should be comfortable in

44
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,680
some kind of way and then what happens is we take this idea and we overlay it

45
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:48,400
on top the actual experience and it never fits

46
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,840
perfectly and then we like no no no it should match this thing that I made up

47
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:00,360
rather than how things actually are I've talked about this idea in a number of different ways so

48
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,080
this idea of allowing is to soften this idea of of

49
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:12,280
how we think things should be and tune into become sensitive to how things

50
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:19,080
actually are how things actually are and you might think well wait I'm

51
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:26,319
doing that all the time of course I am are you really I really tuned into how things

52
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:32,639
actually are maybe there's so much of this subtle of uh yeah but I don't want

53
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,919
to so mindfulness practice and I would say and we could even maybe even expand

54
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:44,280
this so much we would say Buddhist practice is about

55
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:52,680
allowing because that's related to whether allowing is related to not clinging which is related to

56
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,919
Freedom suffering is clinging so there's this way what can we

57
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:03,800
like this allowing the present moment is just this simple simple recognition of what is

58
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:09,400
here what's happening this

59
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:15,319
non-judgmental openness to the experience whether it's Pleasant or

60
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:21,639
unpleasant or neutral just this way of non-judgmental openness like instead of

61
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:28,440
like this barrier like I want things to be the way that I want having me some openness maybe we

62
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:34,680
might even say just welcoming experiences instead of like you know slamming the door in their face like oh

63
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,840
okay here's where it is come on in you might you know join the party you

64
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:46,479
know that kind of an experience allowing the present moment

65
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:52,560
is also this way in which we're relaxing resistance in fact resistance might be

66
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,919
so familiar with us that we don't even notice that we're doing it we just notice that we're exhausted at the end

67
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:05,800
of the day or that we have so much tension because there's this way in which we are saying no maybe the body is

68
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:13,280
saying no even if the mind isn't overtly saying that we could say that um allowing the

69
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,479
present moment is a way in which we're creating space we're allowing the

70
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:25,400
present moment to be the way that it is and for it to unfold the way it's going to unfold instead of us kind of like

71
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,879
pushing and prodding and manipulating and trying to make it to be be something

72
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:36,840
instead we're allowing it how it is this means that we're putting down

73
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:42,960
the urge at least for that moment to manipulate things and to make them

74
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,000
different can we're like oh yeah it's like

75
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:54,639
this so in this way we're shifting our relationship to experience shifting our

76
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:00,800
relationship away from one that is um you know trying to make sure that we're

77
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,919
comfortable at all times which you know is not a of course we are I want to

78
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:11,080
humanize this like of course we want to be comfortable of course we

79
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,159
do but it turns out that just chasing Comfort isn't going to lead us to

80
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:22,800
greater and greater Freedom instead it's going to lead us to just following our ingrained patterns more and more and

81
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,360
more until they get more and more ingrained and then there's a if that

82
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:36,640
doesn't bring you just like of ease and freedom then you're going to be going more and more away from ease and

83
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:43,200
freedom so we're shifting our relationship so rather than like tensing up or Contracting or trying to get more

84
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,880
or less there's this kind of opening up and just

85
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:55,600
noticing and maybe we're noticing with a flavor of kindness like oh hello or

86
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,880
noticing with a sense of curiosity like what really is going on on

87
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:08,360
here so it doesn't mean that we're pretending like things aren't terrible

88
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:14,959
when they are terrible it's not I I I mentioned this I think was it last week I don't

89
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:22,120
remember that I heard somebody say this and I thought it's just really caught my attention this idea of like the ways in

90
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:28,959
which we Gaslight ourselves the way that we're like oh it's not so bad get over it we're saying

91
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:34,720
when it is bad we're not trying to pretend like things sometimes aren't

92
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:41,760
awful they are awful sometimes this is the truth of The Human Experience it's also the first Noble

93
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,360
Truth right there is suffering there is Dua and there's some and sometimes there

94
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:54,640
can be a relief like yeah this sucks this is not what I want I wouldn't want this on anybody sometimes there can be a

95
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,360
relief of just like okay I'm acknowledging what it is for just for

96
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:06,720
that moment it doesn't mean that we're not going to take care of things and I'm

97
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:13,600
also talking about allowing in the present moment I'm not saying that we're just to be passive and to allow all the

98
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:20,200
terrible injustices and oppression and all the awful things that are happening in the world that's not what I'm talking

99
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:27,240
about I'm talking about just allowing this moment this

100
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:34,720
moment this moment our present moment experience I'm pointing to experience

101
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:42,360
that we are having and when we do this there's a way

102
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,760
that we're bringing a attitude or quality of

103
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,959
Freedom into that moment this is what Freedom Is Right

104
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:58,880
Freedom isn't that you ride a unicorn and a rainbow cloud or you know

105
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:05,320
something silly like that its freedom is still living a life still having a human

106
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:11,120
body and yet it's not a problem all the difficulties that arise

107
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:17,320
all the um seemingly barriers or things like this they're not problems they're

108
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:22,920
just what's arising next and so there's a way in which

109
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:29,560
allowing is bringing a flavor of Freedom an attitude of Liberation into this

110
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:35,440
experience right now instead of having this idea like okay yeah there'll be Liberation you

111
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,639
know I don't know when but it'll be later sometime later this activity of allowing is to

112
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:49,000
bring it into here and now because freedom is not being pushed around by

113
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,600
our experience Liberation is to stop making problems out of

114
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:01,800
things I didn't I didn't word that quite right Liberation is where there are things don't aren't problems they just

115
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:10,680
are they just are and so there's this way in

116
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:17,000
which allowing allows us to not only bring this quality of Liberation into

117
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:24,240
our experience but it also allows this quality of ease we often don't notice how much we

118
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:30,959
are like resisting as I said earlier but that resisting it shows up as tension

119
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,399
and it shows up as a like a contraction in the mind and in the body in the mind

120
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,519
of like oh I got to get this I you know get go away I'm I'm trying to you know

121
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:48,000
get this thing here and that shows up as you know when I'm talking about it my shoulders go up

122
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,240
and my hands come together this is how I kind of experience it when I'm really trying to you know get something and

123
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:02,199
make everything go away there's this feeling of tightness so allowing is allowing

124
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:08,360
a yeah okay I can just be I don't have to brace myself I don't have to armor

125
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:15,839
myself about what's uh happening and so this way like there is

126
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:23,440
less and less agitation which is just you know a more pleasant

127
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:34,120
experience and there's this way in which if we're not if we have this

128
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:40,800
idea like okay allowing the present moment experience it highlights how much we are not doing

129
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:47,279
that as I've been talking about and then noticing how much we are not allowing

130
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:54,440
the present moment experience to be just as it is highlights how much we are

131
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:01,120
identified with wanting things a particular way our sense of self our

132
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:07,480
identities is intimately tied up with how we want things to

133
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:12,800
go there's a way in which I talked about we have these expectations that we

134
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:19,680
overlay on top of our experience these expectations they arise out of a sense

135
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:25,920
of our self who we take ourselves to be how we understand what it means to have

136
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:33,120
a good life how we understand our interpretation of what it means to be

137
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:40,320
anything to be a parent to be a sibling to be a caretaker to be an employee to

138
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,639
be an employer all these types of things they get tied up into our

139
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:55,320
expectations which then translate into our not being present for whatever is arising instead we're trying to express

140
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:02,440
our sense of self and make something happen in a way that aligns with our

141
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,880
ideas for example we could say somebody was in the role of a meditation

142
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,399
teacher and they could sit down to meditate in front of a room of people

143
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:22,000
and they might discover like their mind they were like trying to solve something that happened earlier and they got to

144
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,560
take care of and then there's this idea like oh my goodness I'm supposed to be a meditation teacher I shouldn't do that

145
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:36,800
this is terrible and there's this all this way in which just was something that just naturally arose all of a

146
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:43,279
sudden becomes into a big problem it has to go away it would be something very different than like oh yeah okay of

147
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:48,920
course the mind's busy because there was not too long ago just a lot of trying to

148
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:55,319
solve something that needed to be taken care of there's this way in which we don't

149
00:15:55,319 --> 00:16:02,440
even notice how these different rules that we have influence our relationship to what's

150
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:10,480
happening but there's this way that I also want to highlight that allowing

151
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,279
present moment experience is transformational it's not just a way to

152
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:21,199
have greater ease it's

153
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:26,560
transformational and there's this way when we are allowing the present moment

154
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:35,040
to be just as it is and we're observing watching

155
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:41,079
allowing it allows that experience Whatever It Is racing thoughts

156
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:48,880
difficulties in the knee trying to remember what was the fourth thing on the grocery list you know whatever it is

157
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:57,279
that's showing up it allows it to transform that experience to

158
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:02,319
transform if we're not Tangled Up in it then it's just going to unfold and do

159
00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:09,400
what it's going to do next when we get tangled up in it then you know we're trying to manipulate it and massage it

160
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:16,319
and to manufacture it or to be some particular way but if we are able to

161
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:22,640
just allow it to be then it will unfold and transform

162
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:30,039
itself it will evolve it will change it will be different

163
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:36,960
the intensity will maybe get greater maybe get less maybe it will completely disappear we

164
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:44,120
don't know and there's something about just being present and noticing that

165
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:50,200
change that transformation of experience that highlights a few things for

166
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:55,799
us that we like viscerally understand it's not an intellectual understanding

167
00:17:55,799 --> 00:18:03,280
one we realize oh that experience wasn't as

168
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:11,880
substantial as I thought it was it has some insubstantiality it just

169
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:19,159
changed whereas perhaps we were thinking like no it's this big heavy black box

170
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:25,200
that we can't see into or something like this right or it felt like it was uh

171
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:33,799
weighed us down but then when we we start to see a change we realize oh it wasn't as

172
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:42,480
solid as I was kind of relating to it as it wasn't as fixed as I thought it was

173
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:50,039
it wasn't as impenetrable in fact it's like different

174
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:55,200
now and there's this way in which noticing the

175
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:02,799
insubstantiality of these experiences they are coming and going going and changing really changes our relationship

176
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:08,760
to them but not only to that to

177
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:16,000
everything when we start to notice oh yeah this sense of self is insubstantial

178
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,520
also it's always changing just like those those experiences are there are always

179
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:30,960
changing and then when there's this noticing of the insubstantiality of it and the way that it's always changing

180
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,720
there's just a way in which there's just naturally happens less clinging less

181
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,600
holding on because it just stops making sense to hold on to

182
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:48,039
something because it's like things are like slip through our

183
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:55,200
fingers the wait I want that experience but you know that experience is already changed and but then we we're trying to

184
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:01,000
like make it be that experience again or or uh we want another experience that

185
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,720
we're not having and we can't quite grasp onto that

186
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:13,400
either so allowing provides the opportunity permits the observation the

187
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:21,880
witnessing the seeing the experiencing how experiences shift change evolve and

188
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,559
have a quality of insubstantiality to

189
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:35,120
them and also helps us this if we're allowing and then we're like uh uh

190
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:42,120
seeing how experiences are shifting and changing and evolving it also highlights

191
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:49,880
H we don't have to control everything things will do what they do

192
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:55,280
whether we're there or not and there's something about this to

193
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:03,120
see this again and again oh we don't have to control it if things actually will unfold in the

194
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:09,360
way they're going to unfold humans we want to control things this is another way our sense of self

195
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,559
shows up as wanting to control things and make them go a certain way that's

196
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:19,720
related to right this idea of laying expectations on top but when we start to

197
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:25,760
allow things to be we notice that they start to change that's the nature of everything to

198
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:32,880
change we'll see it happen we also realize oh yeah actually the way it

199
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,600
changed I didn't imagine that but maybe it's even better than what we were

200
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:44,360
thinking and so it allows us to like step away from this secret desire to be

201
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:51,039
the master of the universe allows us to maybe put down this sense of what's up

202
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:57,240
to me to make everything right instead we're just noticing oh

203
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:03,640
yeah okay I I don't have to be in the middle of it sometimes we want to be in the middle

204
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:12,120
of it and thinking that in fact we're at the center of everything but it can be a relief like oh yeah I don't need to make

205
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:19,559
everything happen just the way that I want them to be and there's a way that when we are

206
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:25,880
trying to make things to be a certain way it's because we are looking at them as problems has to be

207
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:31,679
fixed but if we're allow if we're just allowing them to be they're no longer

208
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:39,640
problems what a relief it is to not have so many problems you know just the whole notion of a

209
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:48,880
problem I want to say if I'm going to talk a little bit more about this but before I I go there I want to say what

210
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,400
are some of the pitfalls of this idea of like you know this whole notion of just

211
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:00,240
allowing the present moment one is we can have this idea of

212
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:06,520
like okay I'm supposed to allow things to be and then there's this cold

213
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:13,640
Detachment like I don't care you know there's this this it's a way of kind of

214
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:20,240
uh it's a slight type of aversion and that's not what I'm being what's being pointed to what's being

215
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,520
pointed to is like no to be there and maybe with some kindness and

216
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:30,679
some curiosity but there can be this way in which we might think oh I have to be

217
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:38,240
cold I have to be completely detached that's not what's being pointed to here it's not about Detachment maybe

218
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,679
there's no clinging but that's not the same as

219
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:48,919
Detachment or there might be this way this the Good meditator

220
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:56,720
syndrome might arise this idea that we have this um idealized idea of what a

221
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,880
good meditator should look look like and then there's a way in which that creates

222
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:09,039
this unnecessary pressure and creates some this criticism of ourself and then

223
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:15,400
there's a way that uh we start to become not so interested in what's actually

224
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:21,679
happening but become interested in how we look how we look to ourselves or how we look to others and then we have a

225
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,720
whole different relationship or a whole different uh orientation towards what's

226
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:34,120
happening so there was my might be some of that pitfalls but what are some of these supports for allowing the present

227
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:39,360
moment and the way that it um is

228
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:48,519
transformational courage courage to move into the

229
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:55,559
unknown often we're not allowing things because we don't know what's going to unfold I'm talking about allowing things

230
00:24:55,559 --> 00:25:03,919
to unfold but that means we have to recognize it may unfold in a way that we

231
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:10,000
hadn't anticipated that we hadn't imagined yet and this requires a certain

232
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,440
amount of Courage which often we don't want to do there's this often we have

233
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:21,240
this you know um we don't want to recognize the

234
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:28,000
unpredictability of things we want to think like oh yeah okay I I know how this is going to go or

235
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,279
we want want to be with the familiar and there's a certain uneasiness that shows up if we're just going to allow things

236
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:39,799
to unfold the way they're allow the present moment to unfold the way it's going to

237
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:45,880
unfold so this requires some courage and some

238
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:53,080
trust that if we're not in there trying to control things that somehow everything isn't going

239
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:59,840
to explode or implode or disappear or I don't know what's going to happen it

240
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:06,360
requires a certain amount of Courage which maybe it also requires a

241
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:12,480
certain willingness to be uncomfortable if we're going to allow

242
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:20,159
the present moment to be the present moment sometimes is uncomfortable can we be okay with

243
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:26,600
that can we be okay with that can we be in a body that's

244
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:32,720
uncomfortable it's the reality of the moment and this sometimes you know we

245
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:38,520
feel like no no no no no I I can't do this but right you know any spiritual

246
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:44,960
practice any practice actually that's going to um Point our life in a little bit different direction than just

247
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:50,520
following our preferences by definition has discomfort as part of

248
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:57,240
it so this idea of allowing is going to require some willingness to be

249
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:03,600
uncomfortable it's also going to require that we like cultivate some

250
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:10,960
spaciousness cultivating some spaciousness like observing experience without immediately jumping on it and

251
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:17,159
identifying with it or judging it or something like this but can we have some spaciousness which we might also say is

252
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:22,679
a type of equinity type of ease

253
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:33,440
maybe or maybe there's a way that um we can cultivate this

254
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:40,399
uh approach to uh uncomfortable experiences or to whatever might be

255
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:47,000
happening in this uh present moment this approach away from this idea okay I got

256
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,720
to get rid of things that I don't like or I got to get more of the things that

257
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:58,919
I do like and instead to shift our relationship

258
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:05,880
what if we like uh think about is just we're just shifting the relationship rather than getting rid of and getting

259
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:13,760
more of no we're just shifting our relationship to the present moment experience allowing is a way in which

260
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:20,960
we're just for this moment we're going to allow so it's not a forceful

261
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:27,399
elimination of any attachments we have but instead it's maybe just loosening

262
00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:32,519
any grip we have on our

263
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:41,519
preferences so this idea of um maybe befriending our

264
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:46,960
experience instead of turning the present moment experience into the enemy

265
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:53,720
is there a way that we can befriend it this way of this

266
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:03,360
allowing and then it turns out if we're able to do this things move

267
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:11,159
towards greater freedom and ease may not be the way that you

268
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:20,399
prefer it may not be in a way that's immediately uh clear like how that

269
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:29,360
is but there's a way that the there is this movement towards greater freedom

270
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:35,399
that can start with us just being tuned into what's actually happening in this present

271
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:41,640
moment and again I'm talking about just this moment I'm not talking about

272
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:47,799
allowing all the terrible stuff that has happening in the world this your

273
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:55,240
experience that you're having right then your experience I'm not talking about ideas we have about how the world should

274
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:04,559
be I'm just talking about feeling the pressure of whatever you're sitting on against the body the experience of the

275
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:10,200
body breathing the experience of having sounds the experience of feeling the

276
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:19,480
cold air coming out of there during the when the air conditioner is on can you allow that

277
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:25,200
experience which is this way of allowing this sense of Freedom into this

278
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:32,440
moment and then of course you might ask okay Diana that sounds nice but uh how do we even do all these types of

279
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:38,120
things mindfulness practice and loving kindness

280
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:44,519
practice these are ways in which we just again and again return to what the

281
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:50,360
experience is with some warm-heartedness that's all that's being asked for

282
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:54,559
us this is the way in which we

283
00:30:55,399 --> 00:31:02,880
can allow freedom to arise can allow Liberation peace and

284
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,559
ease to arise in the present

285
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:14,200
moment so I'll end there and I'll open it up to see if there are some questions

286
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:18,799
or comments thank you

287
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:36,399
so for someone like a recovering alcoholic in a 12-step group couldn't

288
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:41,919
kind of a heartfelt no you know couldn't that come in handy like to keep from

289
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,240
losing his sobriety for

290
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:55,320
example yes and especially if they feel they allow that experience of a no right

291
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:01,240
yeah yeah so you're right I'm not I'm I'm pointing to allowing our experience

292
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:06,399
in the present moment and there is a way in which if they are in soety they

293
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:12,279
really don't want to also right they don't want to lose their spy there also is a way in which they you know have

294
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:17,919
this uh addiction as well but yes of course we need

295
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:23,919
to I'm not saying say yes to everything I'm saying allowing whatever our

296
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:29,519
experience is but I mean someone feels P if the experiences a pull toward the

297
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:35,919
drink and that's just say no no no you know is that is what you're talking

298
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:41,279
about it's a I think I if we're we're very close on what we're talking about with something's a little bit different

299
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:46,960
it's maybe like to allow like oh yeah okay here's that experience I really

300
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:54,399
want to drink I really want to drink and to feel that really want to and then

301
00:32:54,399 --> 00:33:01,519
you'll see that that oh I really want to and allow it to arise and go away this is not easy I'm not saying this is easy

302
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:07,760
but it's a way in which we're saying no I don't want to and then we start to kind of like deny our experience and then as soon as we start to deny our

303
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:13,279
experience it starts to get easier and easier to get disconnected from ourselves and then go do things that

304
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:20,600
aren't helpful so there's a way in which to feel it best we can to like feel the

305
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:27,919
urge and notice how it gets stronger and stronger and stronger and then it will eventually dissipate

306
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:33,440
and but I'm thinking in terms of like damage control right so you know couldn't that no be the difference

307
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,919
between having the drink and not in that moment you know just yeah of course of course right damage control is important

308
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:45,760
too but I think what's uh allows one to say no often is just to feel like oh

309
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:52,720
this urge is here and this is and I don't want to do this sense of I'm working on my sobriety and so here's the

310
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:59,360
urge and one way to be with the urge is just to acknowledge it and not act on

311
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:09,600
it MH somebody else have a comment or

312
00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:24,320
question thank thank you um so so one of

313
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:30,599
the things I I struggle with is physical pain you know and

314
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:38,520
um the act of being in the body can both accentuate that pain but

315
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:45,158
give me a Mains to feel it and and kind of let it go right so I think the Buddha

316
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:50,240
suffered from gout or I've heard that before I don't know if that's true and he had a bad back he talked about his

317
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:57,359
back hurting yeah so I'd love to you know hear more about that and how this

318
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:03,480
idea aide of letting whatever it is that we're feeling of

319
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:10,440
being whatever Spiritual Beings going through a human experience or whatever uh can can help us with that

320
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:18,640
because I I certainly you know I wake up some days and it's just like oh my God this is miserable right but I don't um

321
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:24,680
you know want to let it just uh stop me right and so you know sometimes I sit

322
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:31,359
here and I you know will go through and during the meditation you know stretch

323
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:37,839
my foot deal with whatever it is you know try try to just kind of see almost kind of medit not meditate on the pain

324
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:45,280
but you know meditate on how I can feel it and let it go feel it and let it go so anyway just you know would love some

325
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,480
thoughts on that if you know others go through the same thing yeah I would say there's a few things that we can do when

326
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:56,359
there's a lot of physical pain and like to uh the allowing it to be there is um

327
00:35:56,359 --> 00:36:01,720
sometimes I like to talk about it and we can zoom way out and that is to have a

328
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:09,400
sense of like for example there's a a pain in the foot and there's I can feel the pressure

329
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:14,760
of uh the chair or the cushion against the body I can hear the sound of uh

330
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:20,200
whatever sounds there are so and to kind of like open up our awareness to uh

331
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:26,079
notice a number of things that can be a little bit hard because when there's a pain there's a way in which we kind of

332
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:32,040
like tend to collapse into it and becomes like you know the only thing that we're focusing on so then I would

333
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:38,040
say to like one way we might be allowing that experience is we then uh notice for

334
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:43,599
example I'll just pain in the foot and we can bring some uh kindness and

335
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:49,560
curiosity and the Curiosity can take the form of is this like a stabbing or is it

336
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:57,040
a throbbing is it uh moving around or is it like just in one place

337
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:04,640
is it a a diffuse area or is it a really precise area you know like a prick or

338
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:10,119
like something so just bringing some curiosity to it and then this it becomes

339
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:15,240
uh our meditation and it's not that we have to find all the answers it's about kind of

340
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:22,160
like shifting our relationship is to bring some curiosity to it because that is the the reality of the moment there

341
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:29,480
is this uncomfortableness so you can zoom out notice other things besides that

342
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:35,480
experience zoom in just get curious about the particulars and use adjectives

343
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:42,040
that are descriptive not uh necessarily like mental words it's yeah just like focus on the

344
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:47,280
adjectives and a third is um if it feels

345
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,480
that this sometimes works for different people at different times is to

346
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:58,160
intentionally uh bring your attention to something that's neutral again again and

347
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:04,839
again neutral sometimes is like maybe the lips touching or uh what the hands

348
00:38:04,839 --> 00:38:10,480
are touching or maybe what the feet are touching and sometimes even to just to

349
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:16,640
notice you could even just like lips hands

350
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:21,680
feet lips hands feet sometimes maybe like the pressure against the body can

351
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:27,920
be a good one too and maybe like even that speed just to go from one thing to the next those are the real of the

352
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:33,319
present moment as well but it's a way to give the mind like a some breather

353
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:38,880
because it can be really hard it's very taxing right to be with a discomfort so

354
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:44,760
those are some things I'm offering of you know how to kind of like be with the reality of the moment when the reality

355
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:51,760
of the moment is a lot of discomfort and pain thank

356
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,440
you thanks

357
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:07,200
so where I struggle with the idea of allowing

358
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:14,400
is oh can you hear me um

359
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,920
yes so the struggle I think uh with

360
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,760
allowing is when a difficult thought or a

361
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:33,640
difficult sensation or ult emotion arises I'll put on a smile and say

362
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:40,599
you're absolutely allowed to be here and I'll generate some feelings of kindness

363
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:47,839
and uh perhaps fake the appearance of

364
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:53,440
allowing uh in the same way that uh if a guest arrived at my house and I said

365
00:39:53,440 --> 00:40:03,400
welcome and I'm holding a baseball bat behind my back um there's still a deep rooted

366
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:08,760
no even when I pretend that I'm kind and compassionate and welcoming and allowing

367
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:14,760
and you know I'm trying to allow but really really deep that real subtle

368
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:19,920
sense is I'm only doing this to get rid of you nice nice that you recognize that

369
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:26,319
and so that that's not that that's not

370
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:31,640
budging so this is fantastic that you recognize this this turns out to be so

371
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:39,720
common that we don't even know that we're doing this so can you allow not

372
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:52,480
allowing not allowing feels like this it feels like holding a baseball bat behind my back what I'm saying come on it but I

373
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:58,800
really don't want it to be here can you allow not allowing

374
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:08,800
yes but that seems like business as

375
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:16,160
usual allowing not allowing might be what I'm already doing had I not been practicing any of this not allowing

376
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:21,920
might be my default State and so if I allow not

377
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,760
allowing that's just my Baseline I see in the absence of any practice I see

378
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:33,400
I think the difference is that uh without a practice that's maybe what we're doing we're just not allowing but

379
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:40,240
we're not aware that we're doing and what I'm what I'm pointing to just being aware not allowing feels like this not

380
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:46,040
allowing is I can see I've done certainly a lot of this this like this

381
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:53,240
sense of like I'll be mindful of this and then not recognizing in order that it'll go away right this kind

382
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:58,960
of but instead just to recognize oh yeah there's that little thing

383
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:05,280
underneath that's wanting it to go away just as you're describing so maybe what I'm pointing to is the recognition that

384
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:11,720
you're doing that's helpful yeah thank you you're welcome and somebody right behind you has a

385
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:17,240
comment it's all it's almost like embracing that you

386
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:24,559
have the bat behind your back acknowledging acknowledging it there's a b behind my back and it feels

387
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:29,599
like this and that's the allowing yeah but and this part and it feels like this

388
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:36,520
so just notice yeah yeah and I think the

389
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:42,119
feeling is the part that maybe we want to go away and that's the part that

390
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:47,640
you're allowing and you have to embrace that

391
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:54,400
and like one of the things I do is when that's coming and it's too strong and I

392
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,920
don't want to feel that pain of the emot or whatever is going on I think to

393
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:06,920
myself oh this is a pity party for one and go yeah but this is real this is

394
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:13,519
what I'm feeling and so being in that present moment but

395
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:22,040
not than judging it does that make sense H so you're saying when you notice

396
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:27,440
that you're again when you notice that you're not allowing is that right then

397
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:33,440
you're then you tell yourself no when I notice that I am allowing but then I want like he was saying to make it go

398
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:40,599
away okay I'm allowing it but that's enough and number one like because now I'm feeling sorry for myself or I'm you

399
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:46,960
know this is not helpful right but it is because the pity party is the part of

400
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,200
the not allowing the allowing does that make any

401
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:57,160
sense we on the surface it looks like a We're Alone we're trying to convince our

402
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:03,760
elves that we're allowing but we're not really think this is what he was

403
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:10,240
pointing to we start to notice actually we're not not allowing and that's what that's the

404
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:16,160
present moment experience not allowing so I got I didn't quite

405
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:22,880
understand the pity party part please no I was gon to try to do an

406
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,920
alliteration but I can't on the spot here

407
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:34,440
like you could get stuck there without allowing that it's not allowing though

408
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:40,839
oh I'm sorry so allowing the non- allowing so if I am allowing all this

409
00:44:40,839 --> 00:44:47,920
emotion and and I don't have the pity party part

410
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:58,119
right it feels as if I'm oh wo is me

411
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:04,079
I don't know how to explain that oh so maybe the sense if we're going to allow like just something that's very

412
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:09,319
uncomfortable to uncomfortable emotion maybe there's a feeling like this is too

413
00:45:09,319 --> 00:45:16,520
much uh I'm just going to make this up too much sadness or grief or anger or whatever like this here's the thing

414
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:24,599
things like this if we are just allowing they arise and pass

415
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:32,400
away but they come back do they they don't come back exactly the

416
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:38,280
same they come back a little bit different you are a little bit different because now you have a little bit more

417
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:43,599
confidence cuz you you've seen that happen and it's never exactly the same

418
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:49,839
it's just the mind that's telling you like no don't go there you know you've been there before but it turns out it's

419
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:56,240
the way forward it's absolutely 100% The Way Forward things unfold on their own they

420
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:01,520
want to it's only when we're tangled up with them that they and we slap a label

421
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:07,040
on them that they seem like that they're the same but I'm not saying this is easy

422
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:14,000
and I'm not saying this is fast that you just do it once and then you know these emotional difficulties go away I am

423
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:21,920
saying this is a way for transformation absolutely thank you you're

424
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:27,160
welcome oh we're a little bit after time thank you

425
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:32,520
I wish you all a good rest of the evening thank you
