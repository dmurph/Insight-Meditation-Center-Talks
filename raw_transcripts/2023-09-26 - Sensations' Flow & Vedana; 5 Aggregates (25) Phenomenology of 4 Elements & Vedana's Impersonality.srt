1
00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:07,259
readings friends good morning afternoon evening whatever

2
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:14,099
your time zone might be wonderful to be with you and to um

3
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:21,080
practice together as we are as we all join from different places in the world

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,939
um so this week we are exploring um

5
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:34,020
the five Aggregates the five kandas which is one of the important teachings

6
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:40,140
um of the Buddha and and a way for us to

7
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:48,899
consider the constituents of our experience of reality to be experienced

8
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:55,020
with the Gestalt of these five Aggregates these five heaps that's

9
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:03,000
really the way the word Aggregates can make sense because they come and they they can join together so yesterday we

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,200
started with a form um the body form internal external

11
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:17,540
and um today was touching to form a bit and then continue with with the second one

12
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:23,040
being vedana or feeling tone so

13
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:31,080
so let us meditate together and uh and I'll share Reflections afterwards

14
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:36,119
so let's arrive now let's arrive in this

15
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:42,079
body In This Moment In Time

16
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:55,740
humming together different parts of this

17
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:01,920
Planet this precious Planet coming together

18
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,460
with wholeheartedness

19
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:24,860
feeling this body this sitting breathing human body

20
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,900
connected to the Earth

21
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,920
feeling our sit bones sensations of

22
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,640
contact

23
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:21,080
and becoming curious about Sensations

24
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,580
of hardness heaviness pressure

25
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:44,000
heat and cold

26
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,500
it's often hard to tell where our sit bones or bottom begins and

27
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:04,640
chair and vice versa the cushion begins

28
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:13,200
however we can have this this Sensations

29
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,299
spread these vibrations

30
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:29,880
or the concept of the bottom and the cushion breaks down

31
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,000
it's just Sensations raw Sensations

32
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:56,120
so many Sensations in our feet and our legs

33
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,660
vibrations pressure

34
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,040
do you notice Heat

35
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:33,479
the entire lower body feet the legs sit bones

36
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:38,120
Awash and Sensations

37
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,460
and

38
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:08,599
including the upper body in the face chest neck shoulders

39
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:26,060
relaxing relaxing and receiving this flow this

40
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,960
waterfall of Sensations

41
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:35,960
quite awesome

42
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:45,620
pausing breaking a break to notice to receive

43
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,479
this miracle

44
00:06:52,860 --> 00:07:00,080
low Sensations here there everywhere

45
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:06,319
wherever they call your attention

46
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:25,580
resting enjoying sea of Sensations

47
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,940
rest in it

48
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:19,639
and the sensations of this thing called the breath or breathing included

49
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:26,060
known experienced as a flow of Sensations

50
00:09:54,420 --> 00:10:00,779
and allowing awareness to know to be tethered

51
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:04,700
in the flow of Sensations

52
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:16,399
both to better see perceive understand

53
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:22,920
and also for this dream of thoughts to settle a

54
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:28,560
bit so the heart the mind can become more

55
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:35,000
stable in our learning in our observation

56
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:46,339
let the flow of Sensations throughout the body knowing this have premising

57
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,560
relax and receive

58
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,600
vibrations pressure

59
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,920
love hate coolness

60
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,720
asked for this

61
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:22,560
period of the in-breath can we make

62
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,639
the sensations

63
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:38,540
of the body primary

64
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:44,579
really receiving this giving it our complete

65
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:49,760
tension just during this Ingress

66
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,560
and then renewing a resolve

67
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:04,620
for just this Opera completely dedicated devoted to knowing

68
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:12,660
the sensations of the body throughout during this out breath

69
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:20,540
just this and then renewing our intention our dedication again

70
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,399
one in breath out breath at a time

71
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:33,240
heroic dedication but just for a tiny

72
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:39,019
bit of time and then renewing and then renewing

73
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:05,959
I need packets of heroic dedication strung together

74
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,180
just this in-breath Justice out breath

75
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:53,899
just for the duration not this in breath so

76
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,139
or the out breath

77
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:44,580
as awareness perceives

78
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:55,080
the flow of Sensations let us now so open to knowing

79
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:04,799
whether there is whether a sensation that is known as

80
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,340
pleasant

81
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,179
or unpleasant

82
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:21,660
and if it's neither then it's neither Pleasant nor unpleasant the third

83
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:31,039
category become aware become sensitive to how

84
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:36,020
the mind is labeling

85
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:43,940
is perceiving given Sensations

86
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:57,539
and don't let it be so effortful trying to categorize every sensation let it be

87
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:00,080
relaxed

88
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:09,600
as your knowing Sensations still come to you you'll all of a sudden you're see oh

89
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:15,679
yeah that's Pleasant that's unpleasant

90
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:21,559
it's neither

91
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:27,140
becoming sensitive sensitized to know in this way

92
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:34,400
to know your experience your Human Experience

93
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,919
in this particular way

94
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:03,679
Pleasant unpleasant neither

95
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,820
there may also be sounds

96
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:43,100
that are known and whether they're Pleasant unpleasant or neither

97
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:57,299
as well as mental objects thoughts streaming through are they Pleasant unpleasant or neither notice notice

98
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:05,760
how the mind is relating to them labeling them they're vedana their feelings Pleasant

99
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,960
unpleasant neutral

100
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:58,980
really turning into this overlay of pleasant unpleasant or neutral

101
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:02,900
for the flow of experience

102
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,700
and how it impacts

103
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:16,940
colors or experience these labelings

104
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,299
as we keep tuning

105
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:36,799
as we keep tuning into knowing

106
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:45,620
feeling tone vedana Pleasant unpleasant or neither

107
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:54,620
star two notice it everywhere starts to pop up

108
00:28:56,659 --> 00:29:01,520
reconstructing the nature of our experience

109
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:56,539
and as we bring this meditation to a cause together

110
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:10,380
bowing and releasing whatever it was or wasn't

111
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:16,080
without judgment and only with appreciation

112
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:22,080
that we have brought ourselves with wholeheartedness

113
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:30,080
to plant seeds and trusting that they were

114
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:37,620
come to fruition in their own time not our time

115
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:44,880
May our practice together be of benefit to all beings everywhere including

116
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,940
myself may all beings be happy and free

117
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,980
thank you for your practice everyone

118
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:56,820
greetings all lovely to be with you in this moment in time

119
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:04,140
always makes my heart just so happy but technology allows us to come together

120
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:09,360
from so many different places and yet we come

121
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,240
together it's so sweet so sweet

122
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,910
so this week as we are exploring the

123
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:26,340
[Music] um the the five Aggregates the five condos

124
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:33,000
these five constituents of our experienced the Gestalt

125
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:39,120
of which really creates our reality what we consider our Human Experience or

126
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:47,039
human reality is made up of these five nothing else which is quite profound what the Buddha

127
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:55,200
has included in the five and it's not just what the Buddha has included but but really as you as a human being

128
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:01,320
yourself it's not so much a teaching to to like something to take on faith but

129
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:08,580
any stretch at all it's not to take these five condos as Faith but just to experience for yourself yeah these are

130
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:16,019
my the five constituents of my experience it's pretty wild when you really pay attention it's just this it's

131
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:22,860
just it's just this so we started yesterday with introduction and we had some time also

132
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:28,860
to to uh talk about um form Rupa

133
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:34,559
um and and there was a piece left over that I wanted to cover today

134
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:41,960
um before talking more about vadana so so with the discussions with the teachings on Rupa and form

135
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:47,519
uh often it is related relayed through the four elements and I talked about

136
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:53,039
four elements inside four elements outside as these elements I talked about

137
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:58,320
that enter so there's one way that this teaching is is relayed in terms of

138
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:06,000
elements inside elements outside and I talked about that and and that we are Stardust remember and there is a second

139
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,480
way that this teaching can be uh related to these four elements and that is in a

140
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:18,720
phenomenological way which is through the first person experience not in terms of what's inside what's outside this

141
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:23,940
this physical science uh conception of the world what's inside what's outside

142
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:31,020
but through the phenomena terminological lens of our experience which is our

143
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:36,599
first person experience of being human beside because that's really all we know

144
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:42,480
we um we can assert what's in the world but it's really through our lens it's

145
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:50,638
through our conception and perception so another way to relate to form is is for

146
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,980
example for the body is through our Sensations is through the flow of our

147
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:03,540
Sensations that we sense our experience of the word and of course if we were another animal another being our

148
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:10,260
sensation of the world our perception of the world would be very very different and and

149
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:16,440
um there's this wonderful book that came out uh last year I believe

150
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:24,780
um uh it's um it's by Ed young and it's called an immense World many maybe one

151
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:32,180
of you is familiar can put it in chat and this book beautifully talks about different animals having different um

152
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:38,900
given their perception given their their sensory uh system their sensory

153
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:44,099
apparatus they have a very different perception of the word umweld of the

154
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:51,980
world so given that we're human our phenomena analogical experience of the world this is a particular way

155
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:59,880
so so for us for example uh in our bodies there are mechanoreceptors The

156
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:05,880
receptors that detect stimuli such as touch and pressure and vibration that's

157
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:11,220
our experience you know there's really no experience of hand or leg or breath

158
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:18,240
it's really these these mechanoreceptors as well as the nociceptors that

159
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:23,520
um are receptors specializing in detecting pain and noxious stimuli such

160
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:28,680
as in the in both throughout the body including the skin muscles and organs as

161
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:35,579
well as thermoreceptors of course the cold receptors and warm receptors that we have throughout our bodies and

162
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:40,859
proprio receptors that inform us what the position of our body and body parts

163
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:46,980
are and baroreceptors detect changes in blood pressure Etc so

164
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:55,020
through many many receptors many receptors that we have so the phenomenological experience of

165
00:36:55,020 --> 00:37:01,800
this world this is really the the four elements practice is also taught through

166
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:07,320
the What's called the 12 characteristics method and the 12 characteristics method

167
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:15,599
is just sensing these raw Sensations pushing heat cold heaviness lightness

168
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:21,900
these are the characteristics that I'm naming uh there are 12 characteristics they're in the visudi Maga the path of

169
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:29,099
purification teaching a thousand page book I think somewhere behind me it's that middle one the the thickest one so

170
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:36,180
it's another way to experience or practice the four elements practiced through this phenomenological way of

171
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:42,540
knowing the world so so I wanted to bring that in because sometimes the four elements practice is

172
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:49,160
only taught as inside outside and the elements but actually this these 12 characteristics through their our

173
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:56,520
phenomenology of our experience is is a very important way it's also taught through these 12 characteristics and and

174
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:06,660
just the raw Sensations that that we have so so and and we can tune into the uh

175
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:12,060
constitution of our experience again the concept of body and leg and arm all of

176
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:18,300
that drops away when we just experience it through these Sensations when the

177
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:25,140
mind gets very concentrated in fact it starts to feel like just points in space it's there's no location there's no it's

178
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:31,680
just Sensations in space now this other important constitution of

179
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:37,920
our experience which is vedana feeling tone which I invited you to turn towards today

180
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:43,859
is um is is a fundamentally important uh

181
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:51,359
aspect of our experience um and we often miss it it's so important that

182
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:58,740
we often miss it and we actually uh miss it in the fall in in this way I miss it in that we something is Pleasant or

183
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:05,000
unpleasant and then we just we take it to be that and then

184
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,800
the Mind develops a preference for it like it don't like it hate it make it go

185
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:16,740
away and then narrative start we get into these Loops of thinking and thought

186
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:23,460
whereas a very very powerful tool

187
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:28,500
is to Simply notice that a stimuli

188
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:35,820
the mind is labeling it as Pleasant unpleasant or neither and this

189
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:41,820
neither this third category by the way some people try to keep looking for the neutral oh is this neutral is not

190
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:48,960
neutral well if it's neither Pleasant nor unpleasant then it's just neither is that neither category so I've had some

191
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,720
practitioners get a little uh wound up by this third category it's it's simpler

192
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:01,500
than you think but when you tune into seeing the the uh how the mind is

193
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:08,779
labeling stimulus as either Pleasant or unpleasant

194
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:15,960
it can lead to not getting wound up by it not getting

195
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:22,920
tripped by it so um and also there are many aspects to this

196
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:28,099
practice to the value to it one is

197
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:37,920
sometimes for example we hear say a a loud noise right and the mind labels

198
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,960
that noise that sound let's say that sound as unpleasant okay so these are

199
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:49,380
happening very very quickly in succession every mind month sound arises there's contact with the sound that

200
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:57,720
awareness makes contact with the sound and and uh this labeling of of

201
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:04,140
unpleasant arises so Pasa is contact arises and then vedana which is this

202
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:09,300
labeling the Mind labels in the particular way given the mood it's in

203
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:16,619
given all the previous history we have had Etc it's very so so these labels these vedanas are kind of Laden with

204
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:23,760
with causes and conditions um so the Mind labels in a particular way and then

205
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:31,920
if we don't we don't usually notice that so much but then what happens after that labeling is like oh I don't like it then

206
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:39,480
pushing starts I don't like this then then uh we cling we push it away cling

207
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:47,099
to not liking it and make it go away Etc et cetera Etc so an amazing practice is

208
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:54,020
especially if you notice that you are in a doom Loop in a loop

209
00:41:54,020 --> 00:42:00,480
just notice what just noticed the vedana of of what it's just unpleasant it's

210
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:07,800
just unpleasant maybe even oh sweetheart it's just unpleasant can I be with the

211
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:13,020
unpleasant it's just unpleasant vedana is just unpleasant fade enough

212
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:22,440
and this practice is so powerful so powerful to completely unhook unhook the

213
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:28,260
the selfing the me mind the mind getting all tied up like it's it's awful I don't

214
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:34,260
like it I hate it make it go away it's just unpleasant feeling tone

215
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:39,599
dear um try this practice for yourself it's

216
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:46,260
really powerful it can happen with anything any stimulus sounds Sensations uh pain

217
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:51,300
in the body is just unpleasant deer it's just unpleasant feeling tone even bring

218
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:57,720
the word vedanine because it brings more specificity it's just uh unpleasant fade

219
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:03,180
enough it's just unpleasant fate enough that's all unpleasant

220
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:09,720
um it's so powerful it's really the way that not self-teaching impersonality can

221
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:16,440
come in in a very subtle way not in this heady way of it's impersonal but it's like it's just unpleasant it's that's

222
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:21,900
all it is it's just unpleasant so so um

223
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:27,660
what this is a one practical way that you can practice with the with vedanta

224
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:34,740
similarly if it's Pleasant if you find yourself really wanting wanting something more and more and more notice

225
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:40,160
sweetheart it's it's just Pleasant Veda now I'm just

226
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:45,380
lusting after Pleasant vedana maybe if you're

227
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:52,319
daydreaming and you're lost in thought and Castles in the Air oh sweetheart it's just Pleasant it's just Pleasant

228
00:43:52,319 --> 00:44:00,180
fate enough and also notice this is the last thing I say as an invitation for you to uh to

229
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:06,420
practice with vedanta today v-e-d-a-n-a feeling tone Pleasant

230
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:13,020
unpleasant and neither is malleable it's not inherent to the

231
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:20,640
stimulus it's not inherent to the stimulus so for example uh a sound of a

232
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,740
bell uh can sound really Pleasant um

233
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:32,339
and or or it can if if or can sound very unpleasant and actually it can switch

234
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:38,579
back and forth and back and forth It's not inherent in the sound of the Bell

235
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:44,520
um it's really how our mind given the state and expectations and all of that

236
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:50,760
that cluster of of of all these five condos really the especially the mental

237
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:56,400
phenomena is is labeling it labeling in a particular result so here see how how

238
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:03,180
flexible really it is it's not fixed um and that brings a sense of Freedom

239
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:09,359
that also brings a sense of impersonality it's not personal it's just oh how this mind and this

240
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:17,760
particular moment given all these cause and conditions that keep changing and shifting and moving uh label this

241
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,800
um this phenomena in a particular way oh sound Pleasant sound unpleasant I notice

242
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:30,319
sounds because the sounds are one of the easiest wine wants to um uh to ascribe meaning to

243
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:36,660
ascribe uh vedanta but Sensations too Sensations as well

244
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:43,619
um but only as only the I may maybe I'll just make one exception no keyceptors

245
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:49,079
when no conceptors in the body detect pain or noxious stimuli there is a

246
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:55,260
tendency there they tend to uh inherently feel unpleasant but even them

247
00:45:55,260 --> 00:46:02,520
even them when their mind is really concentrated I I know I've had experiences where sense of pain actually

248
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:07,800
can even feel wow this is like fireworks in the body there's pain everywhere but

249
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:12,859
the sensation is so interesting the mind is so concentrated that even this

250
00:46:12,859 --> 00:46:19,200
quote-unquote unpleasant sensation can can feel quote unquote Pleasant because

251
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:26,000
mind is so concentrated and has so much peace and curiosity about it okay so

252
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:32,460
thank you so much for your practice for your interest and we will continue with

253
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:40,020
the five Aggregates tomorrow so please pay attention to vedana today and a whole world will will uh reveal itself

254
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:44,599
to you be well tomorrow
