1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,120
so

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,719
a warm hello to all of you and welcome to

3
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,920
our meditation together

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:25,199
one of the qualities that this whole series of

5
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:32,719
practices on anapanasati this mindfulness of breathing and probably all forms of buddhist practice

6
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,760
that one of the things one of the goals of practice

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:44,800
if i can speak about that way is to have confidence in the practice

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:53,600
and to have tremendous confidence in the practice that um it it's really worthwhile

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,840
to just settle in to do the meditation to do the mindfulness

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,640
to do the dharma practice in all its different forms that

11
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:16,880
and uh people who have practiced for a long time that confidence is said to become unshakable

12
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:24,640
and so to practice with confidence regardless of whether

13
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:31,200
particular meditation session that you're doing you feel like you've met never meditated before you're

14
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:39,280
a raw beginner or if you feel like wow i'm really

15
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:48,398
meditating well today that from the point of view of confidence it doesn't really matter

16
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:55,200
whether you're a beginner or an experienced practitioner or whether you feel stumbling along one day and cruising

17
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,360
along the next day what matters the most is that you have confidence in the practice and you

18
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,560
settle down and do it day in and day out through the ups and

19
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,239
the downs that there's real confidence that this is worthwhile this

20
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:18,319
is a kind of has great meaning and purpose and

21
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:24,879
homecoming or something so

22
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:37,840
to enter into a meditation posture

23
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:50,640
and to gently close your eyes

24
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,319
and to spend a little bit of time

25
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:07,840
exploring your body and your posture to see if you can make small adjustments

26
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,239
so the posture is a confident posture

27
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:23,760
even if you don't feel confident can you assume a confident posture for some people that's sitting

28
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:33,840
up a little bit straighter or feeling a little bit more grounded

29
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:47,599
maybe it's having the chest a little bit more open and expensive

30
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:54,799
and then as you exhale to relax your body

31
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,840
relax the muscles of your face

32
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:29,840
softening releasing the shoulders

33
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:43,199
maybe there's a release that can happen in the heart area

34
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:49,600
maybe there's a softening in the belly releasing of the holding any holding in

35
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:57,840
the belly

36
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:09,919
and then look around your body and see if you can find some part of your body

37
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,160
that you associate with confidence

38
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,880
maybe there's a feeling of confidence that's available now

39
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:29,120
or simply a place that if you were to be confident that's where it lives for you

40
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:36,160
maybe for some people it's the hands or the feet

41
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,800
some people in the belly or the chest some people just a broad feeling

42
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:53,840
throughout the torso where does confidence live in you

43
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,440
and perhaps in reference to this location for

44
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:14,400
confidence maybe in reference to whatever confidence you have

45
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:22,880
however small it might be to begin breathing together

46
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:30,638
with confidence breathing with your confidence

47
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,680
being confident with your breathing

48
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:51,039
perhaps having some confidence in the practice of mindfulness of

49
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,520
breathing

50
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:05,439
where the confidence is in the practice not in what you're experiencing

51
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:15,599
no need to look for validation or doing it right or

52
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,160
experiencing some particular state

53
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:34,400
what's important is the simple continuity of the practice

54
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:45,840
one breath after the other

55
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:58,240
no need to strain or push or with a

56
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:04,800
mindfulness being confident in an open-handed

57
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:13,840
mindfulness relaxed receptive awareness

58
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,759
with a confidence in it that you're ready always ready to begin

59
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:28,560
again with your breathing mindfulness of breathing

60
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:41,518
a confidence where it doesn't matter so much that you wandered off and thought it only matters that you begin again

61
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,079
and again

62
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:55,839
and a confidence

63
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,959
of hanging in there one breath after the other

64
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:09,839
that that's all you need to do now for this meditation

65
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,920
gently lovingly continuously

66
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:23,040
confident in the simplicity of practicing mindfulness

67
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:37,839
awareness of the body breathing

68
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,839
so

69
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,720
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

70
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,799
to evoke again the idea of confidence

71
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:02,240
confidence can be a strength that we bring to the important things of

72
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:09,120
our life and one of the important things is our

73
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,159
care for the world around us

74
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:24,480
our generosity our good will our compassion our love

75
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,679
and to have enough confidence in these things

76
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:37,200
that we bring forth our care our compassion

77
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,639
her love even when it's difficult

78
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:52,559
enough confidence that we don't get distracted from it easily

79
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,720
thinking that other things are more important

80
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:08,480
to be confident in our capacity to look upon other the others and look upon

81
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,960
the world

82
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:22,080
with our kindness friendliness our good will

83
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:35,840
and perhaps there's a way that meditating clarifies what is important

84
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:42,080
so that we let go of some of the things that

85
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:49,840
are not so useful to have at the center of our preoccupation our concern

86
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:56,640
and so there's room for compassion and may it be that our practice of

87
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,679
meditation supports us in being able to walk

88
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:07,600
through this world be in this world confidently

89
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:14,960
confident in our kindness our care our compassion

90
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,759
confident in the value of friendliness

91
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:26,480
may it be that this practice we do supports the welfare and happiness of

92
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:35,360
all beings everywhere may all beings be happy

93
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:46,080
may all beings be safe may all beings

94
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,760
be peaceful and may all beings everywhere

95
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:59,840
be free

96
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,799
[Music]

97
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:02,398
so my friends we come to the end of this

98
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:08,799
series of talks on mindfulness of breathing

99
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:14,080
relying on the classic teachings on this practice given by the

100
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:20,080
buddha long time ago the heart of it is the 16 steps of

101
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:25,520
mindfulness of breathing and the instructions go on beyond those

102
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:31,760
16 steps to describe the process by which mindfulness of breathing

103
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:38,720
leads to full awakening and i had a teacher

104
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:45,279
in japan with a zen teacher i practiced with there who said that all of buddhism

105
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:52,399
can be revealed through mindfulness of breathing focusing on the breathing

106
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:59,039
and uh it's a uh when the buddha that they all the best

107
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:04,960
records we have of what meditation practice the buddha himself did

108
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:11,919
he explained he did mindfulness of breathing he would sometimes as a fully awakened being

109
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:18,159
he would go off into the forest for two weeks four weeks at a time

110
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:25,120
to to be on retreat and before he went or after he came back

111
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:31,440
he would explain that what he was doing was practicing mindfulness of breathing

112
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:39,279
so it isn't only a practice to bring us to awakening enlightenment it's also a practice to do after

113
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:44,480
enlightenment and uh and maybe the enlightenment is

114
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:49,679
just kind of a maybe it's not you know certainly

115
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:55,679
important but maybe that's not really the point maybe the point is to continue

116
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:03,200
practicing before awakening practice after awakening practice having

117
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:09,120
confidence some people there are some schools of buddhism where they say that enlightenment or awakening whatever it

118
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:15,480
might be in their at school they emphasize what it really is it's a

119
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:22,480
confirmation of the practice that now we really know this is what the practice is the

120
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:29,360
practice is good it works it's this is what you know this is uh so there's a very clear

121
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:35,039
confidence in the practice itself and certainly buddhist practice can be more than

122
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:42,880
mindfulness or breathing but um but uh

123
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:50,559
the to have confidence in the practice you do and and and that that is one of the

124
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:57,279
signs of maturing and developing in this meditation practice rather than measuring success by states

125
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:02,960
of meditation states of concentration states of calm or states of insight

126
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:09,120
whatever it might be i don't want to dismiss the value of those but more important

127
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:14,320
is this unshakable confidence that this practice is worth doing

128
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:20,320
really to trust it and one of the great gifts that mindfulness practice has given to me

129
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:28,880
that is that um uh is that um i have this kind of real trust

130
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,559
that uh in just being mindful in the practice of mindfulness practice of showing up and being aware

131
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:41,679
of what's happening now and there's certainly plenty of times that i run into difficult situations situations where i

132
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:48,799
don't quite know how to find my way through and understand what's happening but i trust even those situations that

133
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:57,519
to be mindful and there's a sense of direction and purpose and grounding and orientation and

134
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:05,200
and uh and um and a sense of safety where i don't get swept up in the drama

135
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:11,200
of the moment or the concerns anxieties of the situation perhaps

136
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:19,040
because i have this deep trust that things will work out when there's a strong mindfulness just

137
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:25,839
come back to it and practice now it doesn't mean it's only mindful but mindfulness then reveals

138
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:33,839
the way forward sooner or later and that i don't seem to go wrong by

139
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:39,520
pausing by stopping to look and be present and see what's really going on here and

140
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:46,000
what's happening in me what's happening outside and it i don't go wrong by coming back

141
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,800
and just breathing some of you have done yoga classes where the common instructions from the yoga teacher or

142
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,240
observation is is you know you're holding your breath you know don't hold your breath

143
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:03,680
or something that sometimes the straining of doing a posture so people hold their breath then

144
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:09,839
and the yoga teachers like you to keep it relaxed loose breath as you go and that's really good advice for all of

145
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:16,000
life and and so to one of the possibilities of mindfulness of

146
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,760
breathing practice is that it becomes second nature to be aware of

147
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,440
your breathing and how you're breathing and where the breathing is constricted or held and

148
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,560
uh and come back to a relaxed breath the fluid breathing

149
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:37,599
an easeful breath makes a huge difference because it kind of reorients

150
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:42,640
or resets the psychology the emotionality the mind itself

151
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:50,160
because when the mind is real when the breathing is relaxed it's actually harder to cling or grasp

152
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:55,599
or contract around things it's kind of a little bit protection i think i think of it as a lubricant

153
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:00,800
of the mind lubricant of the heart keeps it fluid and

154
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:08,400
moving and not rusted the um the um and then uh

155
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:15,920
you know there's a wonderful the rhythm of breathing in and out and that rhythm is a protection from getting caught up

156
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:23,599
and fixated on our preoccupations our concerns our fears and if we're not fixated we get often a

157
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:29,280
more realistic uh understanding a bigger better view of

158
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:35,920
what's going on than if we get caught up in the middle of our preoccupations

159
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:41,520
so mindfulness of breathing is always useful i think sometimes there's some people

160
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:47,200
who don't find it particularly like their their favorite or most effective practice for themselves and

161
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:53,920
there are other wonderful practices to do but these weeks that we've been doing this mindfulness of breathing

162
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:59,440
i want to emphasize that it is a wonderful practice for many many people

163
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:06,320
and that as we sink into it and develop it and grow in it that one of the primary qualities

164
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:13,359
eventually is a real confidence in it a real confidence in practice

165
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:21,119
where it's um the um we just do it in day in and day out

166
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:29,839
and i believe and that's my kind of reading of the classic instruction of 16 steps

167
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:38,160
that most of those steps has the expression um i

168
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:45,599
i will breathe in i will train training i will

169
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:53,920
breathe out in the midst of everything whatever is going on in the 16 steps i train to breathe in i train to breathe

170
00:37:53,920 --> 00:38:00,320
out and this intentionality this dedication i'd like to say this love of just kind

171
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:06,480
of breathing in the middle of it no matter what no nothing is worth getting so caught up

172
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:13,680
in that we can't just stay on the floating on the river of breathing

173
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:19,599
we can't stay in the with the lubricant with the ease with the relaxation that mindfulness of breathing can

174
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:26,880
provide and it makes life so much easier and in the buddhist terminology it helps

175
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:33,040
it to be a life that's freer

176
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:41,040
uh freer more liberated more easeful more open and then available for more

177
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:47,040
wisdom to see more clearly what's here we have this amazing capacity for wisdom and insight

178
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:52,400
and seeing that can come in the wake of

179
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:59,119
relaxed open subtle experience with the breathing breathing in and breathing out

180
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:04,560
so i hope i think this is uh the 76

181
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:10,400
second maybe um session we've had on mindfulness of

182
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:16,560
breathing and we've done it since the beginning of the year it's a quite a journey i hope that this

183
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:23,359
has been meaningful for you supportive for you and kind of opened up or pointed to you some of the value and

184
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:29,359
richness that can come with mindfulness of breathing and some of the 16 steps or you know the

185
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:34,480
topics of the steps are relevant for other forms of meditation practice as well

186
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:42,640
and um and it's given you uh new perspectives on yourself and and maybe even pointed to

187
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:48,800
dimensions of your inner life that you haven't really thought about before or focused on or

188
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:54,000
seen before and and maybe it's uh has supported you and

189
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:01,440
developed you and and um so

190
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:09,119
thank you for letting me share all this these months but mindfulness of breathing it is i would say that it's uh my

191
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:16,160
primary practice and for meditation and going around daily life i've been doing mindfulness of breathing

192
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:22,960
since i was probably 20 years old and uh so for decades and i find it still to

193
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:28,240
this day a fantastic wonderful practice and so it's not the only practice i do

194
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:34,400
because mindfulness includes everything it's part of the beauty of mindfulness to be all-inclusive

195
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:40,880
but breathing is at the center of it all and it's a wonderful center

196
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:48,640
so um thank you and uh we'll continue on monday with a new

197
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:55,280
topic i haven't decided quite what we're going to do and there's a small chance that on monday

198
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:03,119
that i'll be in a different location and then here with the maybe with wi-fi

199
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:08,800
that's a little bit weak as i was told it was slow so we'll see how this goes if i'm there

200
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:16,480
i don't know it's 50 50 chance i'll be here or be in this other location and um and

201
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:24,160
but we'll do some topic next week that does feel a little bit like a follow-up maybe from this whole series

202
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:32,560
so i hope you have a wonderful weekend and and thank you for the opportunity to
