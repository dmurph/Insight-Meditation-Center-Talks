1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,120
so I'd like to start uh let's talk with a little story emphasis on

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:14,480
story it's a it's you know one of these stories that uh you know it has a it comes from the

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:21,600
suas and it has a teaching point which will become abundantly clear I think but

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,199
I'd like to build on it and this story comes from

5
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,520
um the dega Naya the long discourses at the Buddha if that matters it doesn't

6
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,640
matter so much but so there was this uh individual his

7
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,320
name was piasy and he wasn't a follower of the Buddha and in fact he had he was a I'm

8
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:50,960
not sure if he was a teacher or if he belonged to a different community that had different views had different ideas

9
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,800
than the Buddha and one particular view that he had that he was really uh espousing and

10
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:05,799
teaching was there are no consequences to actions doesn't matter what you do you

11
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:12,880
can do good things and you know maybe something good will happen maybe not you can do bad things maybe something bad

12
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:19,840
will happen maybe not it doesn't matter you can do whatever you want you know maybe like today that

13
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,040
sounds a little bit silly but I think that there are parts of our Lives we think like oh it doesn't matter I'll do

14
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:33,960
this there will be no consequences to this small thing thinking these thoughts that are filled

15
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:40,640
with hatred or something or or oh it doesn't matter that I don't when the

16
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:47,119
cashier makes a mistake and gives me too much money it doesn't matter that I don't give the extra money back or

17
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:55,360
whatever it is there's ways and sometimes we think that oh yeah it doesn't matter but this person piy and the Su is

18
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:03,680
saying nothing has any consequences and if we think about this this is you know 2600 years ago before

19
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,039
there was science or even investigation and so there was this was a real

20
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:17,800
question this was alive like why do why are things the way that they are how did I get here where are we

21
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,599
going you like this was a real legitimate question and so one was like it doesn't

22
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:29,080
matter and you could see cuz they might say well I told lies all day yesterday and nothing bad happened to me so they

23
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:35,760
might think doesn't matter so piy says it doesn't matter and then

24
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,560
there's this follower of the Buddha his name is kasapa and he has a different View and

25
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:48,200
he asks um and he says to P say why are you why are you like holding on to this

26
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:54,200
view like okay maybe you might have it but why are you really holding on to this

27
00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:02,280
View and pasy says I'm not able to give it up I'm not able to give up this View

28
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:09,360
and kasapa says why and piasy says from for as long from

29
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,400
my own birth onwards for a long time I have been repeating this view making it

30
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,440
a firm habit it's just habit just to I just this is the way that I view the

31
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:28,319
world and that's that's just the way I view it and then py continues he says and

32
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:34,959
King bity knows that I have these views and if I were to let go of them people

33
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:41,200
would think that I was foolish or you know he's like concerned about his reputation he's known as somebody who has these views and he doesn't want to

34
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,680
change them because what will his friends think if he has a different view or not

35
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:53,079
his friends you know other people that are influential or somehow this is not so different than

36
00:03:53,079 --> 00:04:00,760
today right this way in which we want to hold on to these views because we belong to a community and

37
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:07,560
that Community has those views so if we were to give up those views then people would talk and maybe we even get kicked

38
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,879
out or would have to leave I'm just making up these scenarios but where we can see where this is relevant to us

39
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:19,000
today I and I appreciate you know these are thousands of years ago this is they're talking about

40
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,240
this and so kasaas says well some people

41
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,360
um can understand things with the use of a simile let me offer a simile why you

42
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,400
might not want to hold on to this view so much and then this suta is a

43
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:42,520
collection of all kinds of similes that uh kasapa gives to py I'm just going to share this

44
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:51,039
one so kasapa starts by saying in the distant past a long time ago so this is

45
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:56,240
kind of like saying once upon a time there was a country and the

46
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:03,039
population was afflicted by famine and so there were two people one was a

47
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:11,560
wise person one was a not wise we might say foolish person and they both of them said we are

48
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:19,039
friends so let us as friends go together we'll leave this country and see if we can find some wealth or somehow bring

49
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:26,039
something back to support our community our family so let's go together and find

50
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:34,840
something hopefully will help and so they in turned so they left and

51
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:40,400
then after some time they came to this kind the Su is described as a vacant

52
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:47,639
pile so I'm thinking of it as an empty lot and there was this pile of hemp on

53
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:55,759
the ground you like this plant you know hemp just a big pile of hemp on the ground and the wise one told the not so

54
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:01,280
wise one oh let's uh take this and we can bring it back let's you know put

55
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:07,080
this load this up on our shoulders or back as much as we can carry and we'll bring this

56
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,759
back because there was nobody else around for whatever reason this is like abandoned clearly

57
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:18,039
abandoned so it turns out not to be so easy to get it on their backs and but

58
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:25,479
they do put on their back and they keep on walking and then um they come to a

59
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:30,680
village and they're walking on this Village and there they saw abandoned on

60
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:38,599
the ground nobody around clearly abandoned some hemp thread so hemp that

61
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:43,880
had been treated and turned into thread and the Wise One say oh what good

62
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:52,639
luck for us here's hemp thread which is finer which is you know one more step in the treatment of it or let's take

63
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:59,520
this so the wise one he puts down the hemp and makes a figures out how to

64
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,720
carry the hemp thread and puts that on his back but then the the um the foolish

65
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,560
one says yeah I've already taken the hemp I I've bound it up firmly and it

66
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:19,080
was kind of a hassle to put on and car I'm just going to keep it so then they walk further on and then

67
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:25,400
they come to this uh pile of again completely abandoned hemp cloth right we

68
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:31,120
know where this is going right so this cloth is even further developed and the

69
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,680
wise one says oh this is even finer I'm going to put down the thread and pick up

70
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:42,280
the cloth somebody's already weaved this into cloth I'm going to carry this puts

71
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:48,039
it on his back the other person said no I'm carrying this hemp it's been heavy

72
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:54,840
it was hard to get on and I'm just going to keep on carrying it this is actually Diana's addition that saying it was

73
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:00,960
Heavy it's just in my mind like carried all this is heavy doesn't actually say that in the Su

74
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:07,360
but so then um they walk further on and then they see raw cotton which is a

75
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,879
little bit smoother than hemp you know how this is going to go right the wise person's going to take off the hemp

76
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:19,080
cloth and put on the Cotton unwise one say no I'm going to keep this hemp on my

77
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:24,639
back so raw cotton and then they find cotton thread and then cotton cloth so

78
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:31,039
you know this the wise one is taking off putting on taking off putting on and then it comes to copper and then silver

79
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:39,919
and then gold come upon this pile of gold this is a story right so they come on a pile of gold and the wise one says

80
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:46,720
wow there's this large amount of gold it's a supreme and massive

81
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:53,959
treasure you should drop the hemp I'm going to drop the silver which he had you know picked up along the way and

82
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:59,399
together we can take the the gold and we'll go back to our country and we'll

83
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:05,399
be able to support people with this but unwise when says well I've

84
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:11,959
taken this hemp I put it on my back I don't really want to let it go I'm just going to keep on carrying

85
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:17,480
this so the two returned to the country one carrying a bunch of gold the other

86
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:26,160
one carrying a bunch of hemp and the person that returned home with the person uh was carrying the gold he his

87
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,680
family and everybody just received him and they were so delighted oh my goodness this is perfect this is great

88
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:37,440
thank you so much you've made a really big difference and the wise one he was

89
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:44,680
delighted by this that he could support them that he was able to you know through this Traves and these Journeys

90
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:50,040
to come back and to bring something but then the unwise person

91
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:57,000
said oh well here's some EMP and they weren't so glad to see him and he wasn't

92
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,760
as delighted in fact he felt kind of sad sad because he wasn't able to support his family the ways that the gold the

93
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,839
person who had picked up the gold was so then so kasaba is telling the

94
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:16,399
story to py and kasaba interprets the the Sim he says py you should give up

95
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:22,680
this view that there are no consequences to actions let it not increase your own

96
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:28,800
suffering and vexation like the person who carried the

97
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,040
hand and who is firmly determined to not take the gold treasure right so kasapa

98
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:39,320
is not leaving anything to interpretation he's being very explicit don't be like the person who didn't take

99
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:47,120
the gold and py says no I'm not willing to give up this view because I've often

100
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,680
taught this view to others so not only has it been a habit not only does he

101
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:59,240
have this reputation but he's taught it to others so he's so like uh intertwined

102
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:05,639
with it and he says everyone knows me as being a follower of this view so not

103
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:12,880
only is he holding on to it tightly he's holding on to the identity I'm the person that has this view there's no

104
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,680
consequences to actions and then kasapa gives a whole

105
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:24,920
bunch of other assoles some of them are you know colorful and crazy stories and

106
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:31,959
I'm not going to give all of these maybe at another suit another talk I'll give like one more of or something but but py

107
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:38,079
he just refuses to budge no matter with kasapa he's saying you know this you'll

108
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:43,320
reduce your suffering if you can loosen your grip on this view he's not saying

109
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:50,000
that you have to completely get rid of the view he's saying just don't hold on to it you might have this view but just

110
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,639
stop the kind of the clinging to it so then at the end uh kasapa is like

111
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:02,880
well you know I don't know what to do I've given all these similes and you're not going to change your mind I'm sorry

112
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,720
and py says oh actually I changed my mind way back then but I wanted to see how many

113
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:15,040
different similes you could come up with so and I wanted to see like could

114
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,920
you have how much wisdom you had could you do this and and kasapa said well I

115
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:27,480
don't know kasapa now I don't remember exactly what he said but it's something like well don't hold on to these

116
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,760
views so it's kind of playful right there's this playfulness there but

117
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:39,800
something I like about this uh story is this idea of sometimes we hold on to

118
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:49,320
things even though there might be something that makes sense to us but it's not easy to change our

119
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:56,880
views it's not easy to have a different idea about things or

120
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,320
it's not even easy to let lessen our grip on

121
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:08,079
views so maybe I'll say just a little bit about like what are

122
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,320
views maybe it's obvious what they are but maybe uh one way to think about it

123
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:20,560
is it's a it's something like a private private in that it's like

124
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:27,519
internal maybe a little bit partially hidden it's not something that we speak explicitly most often but this private

125
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,720
idea about our experiences like what we experience like

126
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,079
how we interact with the world and we're trying to make meaning out of them or

127
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:43,480
we're trying to um make ourselves feel better in some

128
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:49,079
kind of way but I I appreciate that uh one

129
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:54,880
person a Buddhist scholar he was talking about how like views are kind of like

130
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:01,079
memes they're like something that just kind of get repeated and repeated and repeated and through their repetition

131
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:06,600
they start to like maybe even proliferate their like little derivations of them and something that's

132
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:12,800
you know catchy and just goes around and around and and the purpose of the view

133
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,160
is actually just to replicate itself just to have more of the

134
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,959
same in some ways kind of like memes are like this right that go viral on the internet right they sometimes the

135
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:30,680
purpose is just to I don't know what the purpose is actually

136
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,800
so there's this way that views they gather this strength they have this they

137
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:44,720
maybe I could even say the clinging to them becomes even stronger the more we adhere to them and this word

138
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,199
adhere refers to both maybe the way that we like this View and we're supporting

139
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:55,720
it as much as the opposite the more we dislike a view the stronger it gets to

140
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:01,440
in our mind it's just the getting tangled up with it I either through liking or disliking kind of encourages

141
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,440
this clinging instead of like okay there's this view it seems like there might not

142
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,839
be consequences to actions because I know somebody who did terrible things

143
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:19,079
and they're they their life didn't seem so terrible so maybe there aren't

144
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:25,920
consequences to actions but there's a way we can say well maybe there aren't instead of

145
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,120
saying because this happened I know don't tell me otherwise I have this View

146
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:38,920
and everybody else is wrong instead just to say well you know it it makes sense to me but I'm not

147
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:45,240
sure but there's something about when we doing this holding on to view that often

148
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:51,480
we don't recognize it's a little bit subtle but it has a big impact on us and

149
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:58,199
that is there's always a little bit of this agitation clinging itself only arises

150
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:06,240
when there's agitation then clinging gives rise to more agitation but there's something about views clinging to views

151
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:12,160
that in particular is because there's this way in which we if we're clinging we're

152
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,959
saying this is true and anything that uh negates this

153
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:24,639
is wrong this is true and everything else is wrong when we say that there's a way in

154
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:30,519
which we're trying to say make something permanent

155
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:37,920
this is infallible it's always like this and we like to make things

156
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:44,160
permanent because the world isn't permanent

157
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:50,800
and it feels uncomfortable sometimes we wish there a place where we could

158
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,720
land just rest and like okay this I can count on 100% of the time we're always

159
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:03,679
looking for that it doesn't exist so we make it up in our

160
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:10,360
minds it's just a thought it's like this it can never be

161
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,678
otherwise this is what humans do we always do and we need to do this it's

162
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:23,319
part of maturation of development of becoming an adult is a uh taking on

163
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:30,080
views and then discarding ones that don't work and taking on new ones so I'm not saying that we never can have views

164
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,720
right now I'm pointing to the holding on to them the insistence of saying this is

165
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:42,840
true is always true and everything else is wrong so there's this little bit of this

166
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:48,840
agitation because things aren't permanent and yet we're trying to like always find

167
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:55,360
something permanent but not only that when we are sometimes holding on to

168
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,480
saying this is true piy maybe was saying that there are no consequences to

169
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:06,320
actions and he wasn't willing to give up that view because maybe there's this

170
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:14,760
uh little sense of delight I know I know I know you guys

171
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,880
don't know I know I got it I got it yeah

172
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:25,280
you guys clearly don't know but I do there's sometimes this sense of like

173
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:32,000
this righteousness or this uh you know me versus the world US versus them we

174
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,600
got it you guys don't there's this tiny bit of like oh

175
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:44,120
yeah look at us look at us look at me there's a little bit of delight that

176
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:50,159
happens in that but then we start to discover oh yeah we have to keep on

177
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:57,400
propping that up this idea that uh I'm different than and better than everybody else and it requires constant

178
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:03,600
maintenance constant maintenance and this is subtle this is not something obvious but this

179
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:10,240
is subtle we have to discard everything that might refute our view and make sure

180
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:18,000
that everybody knows that we know this and all this right there's this real agitation associated with

181
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:24,559
this so this leads to more like craving and clinging and we just find ourselves

182
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:31,159
in this Loop maybe I'll slip in here that uh

183
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:38,000
today's Martin Luther King Day we're kind of like honoring Martin Luther King and I'm thinking about views and Martin

184
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:45,240
Luther King one way not saying it's the only way or the best way but one way we could

185
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:51,840
consider some of the beautiful things that he had to offer the world or some different

186
00:19:52,559 --> 00:20:00,120
views so it's like beautiful like he had the courage to say I everybody else is

187
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:07,039
thinking this way I think that racism is okay violence is

188
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:14,520
okay thinking that love and care that doesn't matter so much it's a beautiful

189
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:20,440
thing to so he he had some conviction he definitely

190
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:26,679
did but he was sharing them in a way that I don't know it feels like they

191
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:35,480
were had a Flavor of Love and care as opposed to hey look at me look at what I have and what you guys don't

192
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:42,080
have so Martin Luther King also talking about

193
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,200
views and the Buddha talked about views in a little

194
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:54,240
bit different way than kasapa did and for me one thing that's

195
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,919
noteworthy is there's this one sua this uh scripture the early Buddhist

196
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:05,080
literature it's the if we were to look at like how the PO Canon you know kind

197
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:11,520
of like the Buddhist lit I'm going like this with my hands it's probably even bigger than this but uh the very uh

198
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:17,279
first of the sutas is the if they're organized in a particular way so first

199
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:23,559
not first in terms of the first teaching ever given but just when they got combined and put into books one that's

200
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:30,720
the first one is all about views it's is brah the Brahma Jala suta

201
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:40,039
it's a there's all kinds of stuff in this there's a lot lot of things in this but IT addresses the topic of views and

202
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:45,679
Buddha is you know saying you people of course they have these these ideas they

203
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:52,120
want to know the answers how did we get here what happens after we

204
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:57,200
die what is the nature of this experience that's different than daily

205
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,880
life experience is there is there something else and of course these have to be

206
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,320
views because we don't know what happened before we got

207
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:18,880
here and we don't know what happens after we die so the Buddha he's pointing out that

208
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:25,679
humans are always asking these type of views and and instead of like kasapa who

209
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:32,720
was saying well you know put down the hemp and take eventually you know pick up gold the Buddha is saying well

210
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:40,080
actually maybe you don't need to pick up any views maybe there's just a you know

211
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:46,640
views arise and then they pass away it's we hold this when it's helpful and we put it down when it's not helpful we

212
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:53,640
pick this other one it's helpful gravity thinking that about gravity that's helpful most of the

213
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:59,799
time I'm not sure I can think of a time and when it isn't but

214
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:07,279
so in this uh the Brahma Jala in the Su the Buddha um talks about 602 different

215
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:13,279
views there's you know outlined and I'm going to go through all 62 no just

216
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:18,919
kidding can you imagine but we can uh summarize them but

217
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:24,360
here I think is something that's really important he's going through all these

218
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:29,880
62 views he talks about um

219
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:38,080
the content of them what they are about maybe I'll just give a little overview what they are about the question of this

220
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:43,640
the nature of the self or the soul or some

221
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:49,960
Essence is there that some people have this view that both the soul the essence

222
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:57,600
and the universe are Eternal they just will never end they just last forever

223
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:03,240
and ever ever some you know religious teachings that have this idea or there's

224
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:10,200
some uh idea well there's partially Eternal some things will last forever and other things won't heaven will last

225
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:16,799
forever hell will last forever but maybe beings won't last forever maybe some

226
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:22,320
things will or some things don't or maybe there's this sense of

227
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:29,159
well this universe or this existence is it finite or is it infinite does it have

228
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:37,240
edges does it end anywhere the universe or is it just

229
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:44,799
infinite and some people will say well it is finite and some people will say it's

230
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:50,559
infinite and there or maybe they're saying some people are saying doesn't matter just things just arise out of

231
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:58,760
pure chance it doesn't matter whether it is or isn't it's just a chance it

232
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:06,080
we don't have to assign what happened before maybe just arose this moment maybe it'll end in the next

233
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:12,799
moment but for me this is the uh favorite group of there's a number of of

234
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:19,039
views and these are views that are um espoused or given by the eel

235
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:24,200
wigglers these like these eels that wiggle it's because these are people

236
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:29,240
that like vacillate like well maybe it's this or maybe it's that or I'm not sure

237
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:37,000
but I want to say a little bit more about this it's because that they actually knew that they didn't

238
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:44,720
know but they didn't want to admit that they didn't know so they were like afraid to lie and

239
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:51,320
say yes I do know or they didn't want to be attached to their views so they were trying to say oh it's like this or it's

240
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:58,799
like that or it's not really like anything they were just trying to not say any views or they were afraid that

241
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:05,919
others might discover that they didn't know even though so they were trying to just be

242
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:13,399
evasive so that's a another group of views there's a whole number of views that are kind of around that and then

243
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:20,799
there's theories about the future what happens after death and theories about nibana what is

244
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:26,919
nibana what is Awakening what is a Enlightenment so those are kind of the

245
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:34,320
categories and there 62 in these different category but for me what's interesting

246
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:40,960
is that the Buddha he outlines all these maybe in a little systematic Manner and

247
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:48,960
then he does not give a 63r view he

248
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:55,480
doesn't he just says there's all these views and then he kind of like turns

249
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:05,120
away from the whole idea of the content into the views whether it's about the past or the future or what happens after

250
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,600
death he's more saying he says well where do these views come from why do we

251
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:15,840
have them and here's something I think is very interesting when I first read this

252
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:25,360
I was very interested in this of the 62 20 of these come from meditative

253
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:30,600
experiences and there's this way we might think that oh my mind was when it

254
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:38,159
was quiet it came up with this view so it must be clear must be true because my

255
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:43,200
mind was quite it happened while I was on Retreat and there's this way that we can

256
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:51,039
hold on to it this is true and everything else is wrong we ascribe some uh particular meaning to it because of

257
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:56,519
the conditions in which it [Music] arose it might be

258
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:02,840
true but it might also not be true for those of you who've been on

259
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:09,480
Retreats you know that um you meet with teachers regularly and you describe some of your uh what's happening in your

260
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:15,760
meditative experiences and there have been more than once where something would happen I thought oh my gosh wow

261
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:21,760
this must mean x y and z i March into the teacher's office X Y and Z happened

262
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:29,250
and they're like really why don't you describe that then when I describe what happened they're like

263
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:36,080
[Laughter] no this is not uncommon so the Buddha is pointing out

264
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:42,240
even you know with some of the views that arise from our meditation practices don't cling to those

265
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,960
either but he's also pointing out well some of these views that we have are due

266
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:55,720
to just reasoning that somebody just kind of like we creates a view through reasoning

267
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:01,679
we kind investigate it and inquire and just through our own intelligence say

268
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:10,799
Well it must be that beings um don't survive after death or

269
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:17,000
don't exist after death because no nobody's ever come back to me that has died and said hi here I am I'm actually

270
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,399
dead but I'm coming back and because they've all disappeared that must mean that they all disappear or something

271
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:29,720
right this is a logical thing to say when the budha is saying don't cling to

272
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:36,960
those views either so he's pointing to I think even in modern times this is relatable like

273
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:43,120
we might think that yeah well maybe some religious views we won't hold on to but

274
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:48,480
these other ones we will because they seem rational or because I had this

275
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:54,200
meditative experience he saying don't cling to

276
00:29:54,200 --> 00:30:02,159
views and instead he's saying that that there's this uh said look at what causes

277
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:07,880
views to arise they arise from experiences that we

278
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:13,279
have that is and we could use this word Vena too some of you might know this

279
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:18,640
like something is Pleasant or unpleasant or neither Pleasant or unpleasant and if

280
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:24,519
it's pleasant we have this view like oh this is good and I want more and there's a

281
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:31,519
little bit of craving that shows up or this is bad it's unpleasant I don't want it I want less there's a little bit of

282
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:37,158
pushing which is the same thing as craving just kind of like the flip side of

283
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:42,919
it so he's saying that you know our whole life is with these experiences

284
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:48,320
things that are Pleasant things that are unpleasant and things that are neither Pleasant nor unpleasant and those that

285
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:53,720
are neither unpleasant nor unpleasant we tend to not even notice we tend to just

286
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:59,000
kind of like ignore those not always but we tend to

287
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,960
but the Buddha saying why don't you examine this experience more

288
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:12,960
closely really they look at it more closely what's

289
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,600
happening and see that they're not as satisfying as we

290
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:25,080
think sometimes we are holding on to things because they're bring delight and

291
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:31,440
I'll say also the flip side there's a way in which if we're really trying to push it away that's a type of holding on

292
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:39,200
to just getting tangled up with it so this there's this way that

293
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:46,440
experiences do bring happiness and joy because they do fulfill our

294
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:52,960
desires of course they do of course they do there's nothing wrong with

295
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:58,919
this but if we were to examine it more closely we would notice is

296
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:03,720
that things are not completely

297
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:10,399
satisfactory if we had this desire for chocolate ice cream and we ate chocolate

298
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:16,320
ice cream like okay I've had enough but there will be a time later in

299
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:22,399
your life when you'll want chocolate ice cream again things aren't like completely

300
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:28,000
satisfactory or then we start to eat the chocolate ice cream we start to discover oh my God

301
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I have this sugar buzz and it makes me feel uncomfortable or I oh it's so cold I have a brain freeze or you know

302
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,679
whatever it is it's not 100% completely

303
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:46,480
satisfactory and if we can notice that we can appreciate the pleasure it

304
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:52,960
brings Without Really holding on without kind of like setting off this whole chain of

305
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,080
craving because craving leads to clinging

306
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,440
and clinging often is clinging to a view sometimes that view is a view of a

307
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:10,240
self I'll talk about that at another time but there's a way in which these are all

308
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:16,960
related but instead if we were to notice that things

309
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:22,000
arise and they pass away they're not

310
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,720
completely satisfactory in the way that we would want them to be

311
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:36,840
and not only that they don't have this permanent sub substance they're not like always the same not always reliably

312
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:43,200
there if we were to notice those things about our experiences then we'd be able

313
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:51,679
to hold those experiences more lightly and we wouldn't be attached to

314
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:58,399
them and we wouldn't be making these views from them that we often get attached to to

315
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:04,799
also so our experiences are giving the kind of like the fuel for the views But

316
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:10,800
It's Perfectly Natural of course it is and we need views to move through the

317
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:19,118
world but can can we not hold on to them tightly and can we notice which views

318
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:24,480
lead to more freedom which views lead to less

319
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,839
Freedom which ones bring more more openness and spaciousness and ease in

320
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:34,119
our life and which ones

321
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,560
don't is there a way and what is this way like to hold views lightly what does

322
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:47,000
that mean for I'm going like this with my hands I'm opening with my Palms uh

323
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:55,158
open what would it be like to not say to everybody around you what your views

324
00:34:55,240 --> 00:35:01,359
are sometimes we spend time with family members for example and they have different

325
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:07,520
views what would it be like just to pay attention to them acknowledge them love

326
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:13,760
them care for them and let them have different views instead of saying well you know

327
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:20,280
actually it should be this or you you know it's that way or something like this that's one way to hold views

328
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:28,040
lightly is you know because as soon as we start uh sharing them with others in a way

329
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:33,119
that often sets up a me versus you and I know better and you should change your

330
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,720
mind it's kind of like implicit in

331
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,079
there or maybe what their views what they are saying makes us feel

332
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:49,160
uncomfortable because we think it's really wrong or maybe they're pointing

333
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:55,839
to something that's we don't like to see about ourself and it feels uncomfortable

334
00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:00,920
so just to help ease that sense of uncomfortableness we say well no

335
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:09,560
actually the view here here's how it is just to like kind like change the topic and make the shift the energy

336
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:14,680
some again I'm not saying you can't ever talk about your views but there can be a

337
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:22,319
way in which we think sometimes with family members that we have to uh just tell them no actually my view is this

338
00:36:22,319 --> 00:36:28,720
and what if we didn't what if we didn't have to

339
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:35,880
or what if we said I don't know this is my current thinking because of XY and z

340
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:41,280
or what if we said well can you tell me why what what uh what led you to have

341
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:47,760
this View and open up a conversation and then there can be some intimacy and a way

342
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:55,800
forward and you know something about this instead of this clinging to views

343
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:02,319
which does doesn't lead to freedom and Buddha talks about how

344
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:08,079
there's um beings humans partly the way that we're defined

345
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:13,119
is by what we're attached to what we're holding on

346
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:20,240
to if we think that uh I'm just making this up if we think like football is the answer to everything then it we'll just

347
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:26,359
be one that's talks about football wears football clothes and uses football analogies for everything and talks about

348
00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:32,520
you the coaches the players I don't know all these types of things and so we'll be known as oh yeah

349
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:39,880
that's the person who likes football but what if we're not attached

350
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:45,960
to anything again I'm not saying that we

351
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:51,359
don't have views or ideas because that's that's not how to live one's life I'm

352
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:58,200
just saying not to be holding on to it attached to it and the Buddha is pointing to our

353
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:04,599
huts and Buddhas those people who are completely awakened aren't attached to

354
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:09,839
anything so they're not defined in the usual way that we might

355
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:15,880
Define someone like the contents of our minds right spill out in our Behavior

356
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:22,359
our words our dress places we go places we don't go you know all these

357
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:27,560
things but what it what would it be like to not be

358
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:35,440
defined because we're not holding on and this is the Buddha's answer to

359
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,480
this question well what happens after death to somebody who is completely

360
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,838
awakened say well we can't Define

361
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:52,920
them this is tricky I'm not going to pretend like I understand this completely but there's something I like

362
00:38:52,920 --> 00:39:00,119
about this I like that it's this pointing to how we limmit things when we are saying

363
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:06,440
nope it's this way because we're saying well it's not this way it's this

364
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:14,359
way what if to say you know I don't know maybe that's

365
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,920
okay so to not hold on to

366
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:27,680
views and if we find ourselves not able to put down the view

367
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:34,240
maybe we can recognize that oh yeah this is hemp I have on my back and like here's some hemp cloth it's a little bit

368
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:39,960
more refined I think I'll carry this something like

369
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:47,040
that I think I'll end there and I'll open it up to some questions and

370
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:54,560
comments this idea of holding on to views not holding on to

371
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,400
views

372
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:14,119
thank you that was great um s reminds me of something I

373
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:19,760
heard about Einstein that he was a pacifist during the first world war but

374
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:26,640
then he escaped Nazi aggression came to America and he advocated going to war

375
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:33,560
against the axis and a lot of people from the Press challenged him and said well you're

376
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:38,800
inconsistent um thought you were a pacifist and he said uh something like I

377
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:44,720
have updated my view based on new

378
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:50,760
evidence and I always thought that was that was wonderful flexibility

379
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:59,400
yeah right and there's a lot it's fascinating when now social media allows us to um just get our own views that

380
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:05,720
support our uh get have evidence that supports our views right and just like not even come into contact with other

381
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:11,839
views other evidence but yeah thank you Phil yeah right to update our views with

382
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:17,760
new evidence new

383
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:28,240
data anybody else have a comment oh Nancy like there

384
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:38,079
thanks Diana um you were talking about uh people who say that they don't see

385
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:44,560
consequences for some things that go bad or there may or may not be

386
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:50,280
consequences and um visual perception of what

387
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:57,000
consequences are are not always where it is though right aren't the consequences

388
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:03,760
really internal and so evaluating those by

389
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,880
external uh views and what's happening with other people isn't really

390
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:14,599
in a very accurate way of judging I would agree I would agree if

391
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:19,640
we're just looking from the outside right we could say well they seem happy

392
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:25,160
even though they did all these terrible things but we don't really know what's going on inside of them yeah yeah thank you

393
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,160
Nancy

394
00:42:41,319 --> 00:42:48,520
okay so thank you thank you all for your attention and wish you safe travels as

395
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:55,880
you go home and know maybe we can think about uh the views there's a view of uh

396
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:03,559
maybe supporting one another or being the change we want to see in the world this type of thing something that's to

397
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:12,200
hold on to but not tightly or openly or softly something like this thank

398
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,960
you
