00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,279
Welcome to our meditation

2
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:14,759
session and to begin with a ritual of

3
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:19,960
posture maybe with a homecoming of

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:29,519
posture maybe with the attention on posture being an expression of care care

5
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:37,200
for your body care for yourself and so assuming a supportive

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,960
posture for

7
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:48,680
meditation giving yourself a little bit of time to make the even subtle

8
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:58,640
adjustments in how your hands are your arms your legs your feet

9
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:08,040
subtle adjustments to the maybe even the back of the

10
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,600
neck there is a kind of up alertness or

11
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:22,000
a wakefulness that can happen in the back of the neck as the neck elongates a little bit

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,040
or comes back a teeny bit with a little bit more space created

13
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,920
between the last vertebrae and the

14
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,270
skull reorienting oneself from

15
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:50,479
[Music] concerns that have nothing to do with here and

16
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:58,240
now to a ritual of settling into here and

17
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,560
now gently closing the

18
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:20,480
eyes and gently pausing at the end of the

19
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,640
exhale just momentary to feel the body's

20
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:31,680
urge the physical urge maybe very Gent gental calm urge to

21
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,040
breathe in and give into

22
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:43,360
that and ride the inhale let the

23
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:50,840
inhale the movement and expansions of the chest the

24
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:57,760
belly let it touch you from the inside out

25
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,080
to the degree to which air fills your lungs as you breathe

26
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:14,439
in let that feeling of becoming gently full and

27
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,680
expansive appear for you fully as you breathe

28
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:35,760
in and as you exhale to relax your

29
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,840
body to soften

30
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:09,799
breathing in and becoming aware of the thinking

31
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:17,238
mind not what you're thinking about but the sensations and

32
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,160
feelings embedded in that thinking

33
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:31,400
mind as you exhale

34
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,759
soften Relax The Thinking

35
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:54,520
mind if thinking are like waves on the surface of

36
00:04:55,039 --> 00:05:00,199
water let the winds die down in the mind

37
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:08,400
a quieting of your thoughts and the softening on the

38
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:13,240
exhale a stilling of the

39
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,319
Waves as the surface of the water spreads wide and

40
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:30,520
calm the Mind becomes expansive and calm

41
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,440
and then centering yourself on

42
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:05,560
breathing as as if perhaps breathing is a

43
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:14,720
refuge breathing is a a place

44
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,560
that protects

45
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:31,319
you from The Winds of the Mind the storms of the Mind

46
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:47,319
breathing maybe almost like the the calm in the middle of all

47
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
things

48
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,520
for for

49
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:25,120
and as you accompany your

50
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:31,800
breathing as you become one with with your

51
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,560
breathing is there any

52
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:46,399
wellbeing any pleasure

53
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,839
Delight any Joy or happiness

54
00:08:53,839 --> 00:09:01,480
however modest it might be that Som so that somehow is

55
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:07,079
associated with this

56
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,360
meditation and let that become

57
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:36,759
The Gentle Wind or the

58
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:44,000
gentle absorption of

59
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:53,079
water like water is absorbed in a sponge let that

60
00:09:53,320 --> 00:10:01,320
wellbeing slowly spread get absorbed throughout your body

61
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:08,560
not so much trying too

62
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:19,600
much just

63
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:29,000
gently breathing breathing with the well-being

64
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:43,240
where the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out connecting to breathing sustaining

65
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,680
attention is a

66
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:57,279
gentle massage wind

67
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,240
water that spreads

68
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:10,040
into your body

69
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:17,120
expanding field of

70
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:28,040
wellbeing to which gives you a kind of attitude of

71
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:33,320
yes yes yes to being present

72
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
here

73
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
for

74
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
for

75
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
for

76
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

77
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
for

78
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
for

79
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
for

80
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,959
for for

81
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:56,360
feeling whatever well-being is present for a few minutes put aside any

82
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,839
resistance to feeling well-being

83
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:06,959
take the risk to feel some degree of

84
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:15,558
well-being so well-being accompanies you your

85
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:23,000
practice and if there's some ways that you feel challenged emotionally or physically or

86
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:30,120
socially if that challenge seems to be standing in the way of well-being

87
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:39,360
let the them accompany each other like the two flat hands Palms come

88
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:45,559
together in angel in

89
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,799
bowing and if it supports your well-being and joy

90
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:05,240
have a little half smile on your lips your

91
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,760
mouth letting well-being

92
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,559
enjoy be massaged be worked into

93
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:27,520
everything your whole being gently

94
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
slowly

95
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
for

96
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
for

97
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
for

98
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
for

99
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
for

100
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
for

101
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
for

102
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,520
for for

103
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:34,519
and then as we come to the end of this

104
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:41,360
sitting some care self-care goes

105
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:48,639
into the end of meditation just as there's care and going into

106
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:59,960
it might first begin by a gentle recognition

107
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:08,120
of what is going well for you through the

108
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:18,240
meditation and that could be a very modest criteria what's going

109
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,600
well maybe you're a little more

110
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:30,159
settled maybe there's more self-awareness

111
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:38,679
some understanding of yourself maybe there's more

112
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:45,480
calm maybe there is some form of meditative

113
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:55,600
well-being and whatever benefit that has come let it register in your body in

114
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:01,399
your heart in your mind take it

115
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:10,520
in some people use the metaphor drinking drink it in or taste it with

116
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,159
your whole

117
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:26,679
being when there's something good that's happened in the Dharma it's invaluable to appreciate

118
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:31,720
it without appropriating

119
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:38,000
it without holding on to it

120
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:47,679
or appropriating it to build up another form of self just

121
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:54,440
appreciate and that appreciation that benefit of the

122
00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:01,000
well-being can expand and grow if we open ourselves

123
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:08,120
up to in a way to share it with all beings almost like we're going to give

124
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:14,880
it away let everyone else share or receive

125
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:23,000
my calm I'm not going to hold on to it I'm not going to cling to it

126
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,960
please let it spread for me out into the world as a gift

127
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:37,240
may this calm well-being Insight

128
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:43,039
understanding be shared for the welfare and happiness of

129
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:48,278
everyone may all beings be

130
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:54,840
happy may all beings be

131
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,240
safe may all beings be

132
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:06,760
peaceful may all beings be

133
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:13,680
[Music]

134
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:30,159
free thank you

135
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,158
for e

136
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:51,279
so good morning everyone and good day welcome and um

137
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,679
so welcome to this talk this is the fifth talk on the first

138
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:23,799
jna and um uh continuing talk on a wider series

139
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:32,000
on the samadi and um uh samadi as I've often said is a state

140
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:40,080
of being it's not a particular mental activity of being concentrated or

141
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:47,039
hyperfocused and um and so uh it's a state of being that we enter

142
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:53,799
into and um and as such it's a radically different way of experiencing ourselves

143
00:29:53,799 --> 00:30:00,080
unusual we're always in some State and uh even the expression in English that

144
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:06,760
person's boy is that person in a state is usually meant that they're kind of something's really unusual about them or

145
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:13,600
odd about them and um but we're always in some kind of state and uh

146
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:18,760
unfortunately we take some of our states we're in as being normal and ordinary

147
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:24,880
that doesn't just how it is um but often there's we're fragmented

148
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:31,120
we're stressed we're de-stressed we're pre occupied we caught in things and

149
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:37,559
that feels normal and there's certain attitudes or even emotions which persist that can

150
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:42,880
feel like this is this is just life as it should be because that's what we're used

151
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:51,159
to but when we let go when we let things fall away all the extra all the

152
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:58,960
unnecessary activity of mind even the unnecessary activity of heart uh even unne activities of the

153
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,080
body and let all that Fall Away uh in a

154
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:14,399
at least metaphorically uh up upright uh uh position stance way of

155
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:20,559
being uh what we're left with can be a state of well-being state of confidence

156
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:27,120
a state of it's just it's it's enough just to be alive it can be there's no no

157
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:36,320
tendency to want to judge it or interpret it as being something is wrong or inadequate or it just uh things

158
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:44,559
things become better and better it just feels good to be alive good to be here and uh it's a state of

159
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:52,120
well-being so that's one of my definitions of samadi is a state profound state of well-being in which we

160
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:58,840
feel immersed and so uh the first jna is uh

161
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:03,960
represents a very particular kind of samade uh there's other many forms of

162
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:10,039
samade of immersions and but the particular one that is very very significant and

163
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:16,960
powerful and can be a game Cher for some people uh in the ancient Buddhist

164
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:24,519
tradition the Buddha said that uh once a person is in in the first

165
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:30,399
jna in that sense of well-being and peace and and letting go of so many

166
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:35,880
attachments that um it's kind of the first taste of what it's like to be

167
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:41,919
awakened to be free and some people might even uh confuse it with full

168
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:47,440
Liberation Buddhist Liberation because it's so so special and so nice but it

169
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,600
gives us a first taste it can be quite inspiring oh this is possible it's

170
00:32:52,600 --> 00:33:01,240
possible to have this who would have known that such a thorough feeling of wellbe being of uh that feels like a

171
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:08,760
homecoming were possible there are plenty of people who will say have said that this is not

172
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:15,080
possible to uh to have this level of Som and well-being but there is it is

173
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:21,240
definitely possible so in this first jna uh the

174
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:27,919
state is one that's often characterized by the five genic factors that I talked about yesterday

175
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:35,799
and um so there are the initial application of mind the sustained application of Mind of attention there

176
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:42,799
is the uh Joy my translation of the word po

177
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:48,559
word pity P TI and there is happiness my translation

178
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:57,240
of the PO word Suka s u k ha a and um and then there is um said to be

179
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:05,039
some overall um State this that state of uh of absorption of immersion that's say

180
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:10,040
characterized as I'm I'm calling it becoming one sometimes called

181
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:15,320
one-pointedness sometimes called unification and

182
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:23,280
um and uh and so those all kind of come together and uh in the first J there's

183
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:29,800
the various uh strengths by which it can occur it can be very m mild and so mild

184
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:36,679
that the difference between the approach State and the Janna is not so clear uh

185
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:44,200
kind of uh we slide back and forth between them even but other times it's quite strong and it's very clear this is

186
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:50,919
you know now we're in a new territory and um and and the degree of

187
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:56,839
strength that it has has a lot to do with the degree of Joy the strength of

188
00:34:56,839 --> 00:35:05,720
the pity and uh there can be a range of um strengths to it um there's uh in the

189
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:12,680
classic teachings there's five degrees or ways that that pity This Joy can be

190
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:19,880
experienced I find it kind of inspiring to hear this list of all the possible ways you don't have to have them all but

191
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:26,119
it's sometimes it's nice to know that these are in the range the stronger forms of it people can get sometimes

192
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:32,640
afraid of it or scared like wow this is intense so the first one is minor so

193
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:38,599
it's just a subtle maybe subtle or minor it's not like uh something that's so

194
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:45,560
dramatically different than what a joy or U that one has in daily

195
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:52,079
life another one is momentary that uh it's uh it just seems like it's Sparkles

196
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:57,160
it comes it comes and goes maybe with every uh breath that comes and

197
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:02,960
disappears appears comes and disappears um it uh it just there for a moment it

198
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:09,800
kind of sparkles or Sparks someplace uh then there is um uh

199
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:17,800
something called showering and uh and this is where there it feels like there's a shower of of um

200
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:22,880
water pouring through Us in some way a flow pouring through us moving through

201
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:31,720
us um it's stream that's moving through us uh maybe a um uh you know like sand

202
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:38,760
going through a um hourglass it just be where where at the thin Edge Of The Hourglass and just moves flows and flows

203
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:45,720
something as streams going and that stream can be quite intense sometimes and it might go in different directions

204
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:52,319
it might go um you know up the spine up the head it might go down into the feet

205
00:36:52,319 --> 00:37:00,359
um the different things and sometimes when it gets too intense the sense of the Stream this um of it

206
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:06,119
um that uh sometimes people find it helpful to relax the body even more so

207
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:11,200
the stream becomes softer and wider and sometimes people even kind of uh

208
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:21,560
redirect it if so it's more grounding like down down the feet and um and then there is

209
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,160
um the um uh something called

210
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:34,079
um uplifting the joy and now this is quite

211
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:39,440
inspiring and this is kind of almost like people feel they get very light sometimes they feel they're like they're

212
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:45,440
being lifted up and sometimes actually the posture uh will change because the

213
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:54,359
this lifting up sometimes straightens out the spine and and it's like the re everything's alert and present but uh

214
00:37:54,359 --> 00:38:00,760
you know it can feel like we're lifted off the cushion even because everything's so light and inspiring

215
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:08,559
and and uh it's kind of you know Wonderful to experience and then there's

216
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:16,160
pervading the um the showering sometimes can be quite intense uh I've had the

217
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:22,400
experience of it's feeling feeling like huge cascading uh waves so just kind of like

218
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:28,160
you could feel the wave coming and then crashing down and um and sometimes I've

219
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:35,160
had it after meditation and when it happens I have to stop what I'm doing uh just kind of just pause and wait for

220
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:42,240
this wave to Crest and break and pass um so there's all kinds of very

221
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:50,400
unusual things that can happen with the intensity of it mostly when people are in Retreat and um but the one that I uh

222
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,440
that uh I uh like is this last one called

223
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:03,760
pervading and this is the instruction the Buddha gives is to let this well-being This Joy spread and that's

224
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,960
the only instruction he gives as I said yesterday is to let it spread Let It Be

225
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:14,359
suffused almost like uh with every breath there's a massage that spreads it

226
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:19,920
for further and further every breath is like the wind the the air of a Bellows

227
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,359
letting it fire warmth to get warmer and warmer and let it spread so it's not

228
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:33,000
there's no bottlenecks for it there's no place that gets contracted there's no tension in the body in which the flow is

229
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,920
blocked uh which can cause little bit of challenges for people just relax and so

230
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:45,160
it's it's a continual relaxation continual opening opening to the

231
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:50,560
well-being feel it fully and that uh that's kind of

232
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:56,160
continued Letting Go continue falling away and that prepares a person for the

233
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:02,000
second J which which we'll talk about in the next when might pick up

234
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,240
again and um and

235
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:14,760
uh and so built into this so what tends to happen when that first jna gets

236
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:22,599
strong is that um the the joy Factor can predominate but the happiness

237
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:29,400
factor is still there as well and so these two together they're kind of like a combination of joy and happiness that

238
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:35,520
arise together but it is possible to also distinguish them and um and the

239
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:42,240
distinction is that the happiness is more um I like the word sublime it's

240
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:49,359
more calm it's more settled it's more content content uh whereas the the pity has kind

241
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:55,200
of the mind is a little bit brightened and excited by it um with the happiness

242
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:01,200
the Mind actually quiets that even more there's a pervasive feeling of

243
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:08,680
well-being more than a pervasive feeling of inspiration or little bit of excited

244
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:17,960
Joy so uh these are the five factors and uh they can be very minor and and you

245
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:24,160
don't but and you don't have to be in Janna to have these present and there's

246
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:30,480
an art to recognizing uh even if they're here very subtle in an ordinary mind

247
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:38,400
where you're maybe somewhat distracted preoccupied there's a way of discovering that these are already here in some way

248
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:47,160
and um and you're allowed to feel it to support you to to um to uh get absorbed

249
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:53,920
to get into the meditation to let for temporarily let your everyday concerns

250
00:41:53,920 --> 00:42:00,920
preoccupations uh uh uh Fall Away and the it's that sometimes called the

251
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:08,400
happiness that leads to more happiness the joy that leads to more joy is to feel even the subtle feelings of calm or

252
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:14,160
well-being that begins to come as you meditate there's an art not to cling to

253
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:19,760
it not to try to make something happen but to register and let it kind of be

254
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:28,040
massaged or o open to it and supports you to let go of

255
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:35,200
your everyday orientations preoccupations just to be

256
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:43,000
here so um next week I'll be back at uh the retreat center and uh

257
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,480
IRC uh for some more private event we're doing down there and then uh I'll be

258
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:57,160
back in uh the following week and Matthew Bren silver will be coming next week and uh I think that'll be quite

259
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:04,319
refreshing to have him uh as an interlude and uh and then I'll be back

260
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:09,440
and then we'll following week we'll do the second J and the idea is to spend a

261
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:16,319
week on the next three so so that you can have some sense of what these are

262
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:23,160
about and I thank you for attending and listening and practicing together and I

263
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:28,240
very much look forward to being back in about 10 days 9 10

264
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:34,359
days so thank you and um
