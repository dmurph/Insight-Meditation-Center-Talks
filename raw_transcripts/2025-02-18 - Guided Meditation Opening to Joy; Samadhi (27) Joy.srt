1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:11,040
hello everyone and welcome and for this uh morning's

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:18,960
meditation um to repeat that for this week we

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,720
are engaged in the aspect of samadi which is not

4
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,920
considered samadi quite yet but is approaching

5
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:36,480
somebody and uh and um it's a fairly

6
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:43,559
common to think of samadi as a state of absorption uh another uh word that maybe

7
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:50,800
works better for some people a state of immersion and uh I think since ancient

8
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,199
times and uh sometime times in the modern world I listen to people talk

9
00:00:56,199 --> 00:01:02,039
about their meditation it seems like people come up with this metaphor spontaneously on their own without

10
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,320
knowing the anything about the tradition that sometimes immersion in

11
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:16,360
somat can feel a little bit like uh taking a comfortable safe dip uh

12
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:22,880
under water in a maybe a cool refreshing or warm pool of

13
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,240
water and kind of floating and then sinking a little bit and getting

14
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,640
completely saturated and absorbed immersed and then coming out of somebody

15
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:39,960
is kind of like rising up and the head comes out of it and um and so right now

16
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:48,640
we're approaching and um and uh and um slowly they approach we

17
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,560
get closer and closer and so uh one of the aspects of

18
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:02,680
the approach is uh to begin Gathering Together so that we're really involved

19
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:10,440
with the meditation practice uh more than anything else that uh the strong Tendencies to be

20
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:17,840
distracted the strong Tendencies to be U preoccupied um the strong tendenci is to

21
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,680
be reactive and be involved in for and against experience in some reactive way

22
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,680
has abated has quieted for a time being so that we're fully absorbed like we

23
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,400
would if we were completely absorbed in reading a wonderful book or uh watching

24
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:44,360
some wonderful uh show or activity or or if we're involved in some kind of

25
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:51,440
uh game or sport or um craft or

26
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:58,480
musical playing music in some way that uh it somehow it pulls our attention so

27
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:07,920
completely that other things in the world fall away and we're just here for this and so uh and so it's harder to do

28
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,319
this with meditation because we're not doing you know obviously something that

29
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:19,000
normally we would consider interesting and the breath doesn't seem like it would be so

30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,720
interesting what's interesting is not the breath in and of itself but rather

31
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:34,080
uh what begins to happen in the Gathering the centering of attention the comment of attention the the the um

32
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:41,159
intimacy of attention uh the the lightness and ease of attention

33
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:47,480
and there's a feedback system where the more that we're uh gathered around something like

34
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:52,720
the breathing and absorbed in it it has an influence on the rest of us it has

35
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,840
influence that where think things get gathered and settled and calmed and um

36
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,360
absorbed and it can feel really good and a relief to not be pulled away and

37
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,599
fragmented by thoughts and so this starting to recognize this process this

38
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,840
feedback loop of this gathering this influence that uh being focused has

39
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,000
being centered has that uh and using that as an encouragement to keep

40
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,479
Gathering keep Gathering so that's the approach part

41
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:32,199
and um and um and the hindrances might still be at

42
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:37,320
play but now we know there's another game in town we know there's something

43
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:44,880
with the as we get into the approach it's kind of like maybe we see where we're going or we have a clear sense or

44
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,960
feeling for there's something really good here and so there's a a more easier

45
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,600
way like let's stay let's come back let's keep in a flow let's keep uh

46
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:02,840
massaging it and staying here and here and here and

47
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:10,199
um so um so uh yesterday talked about this

48
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:16,400
connecting and sustaining attention and um and then last week was

49
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:23,960
pleasure and to bring these together that uh as we uh looking for the signs

50
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:30,039
of somat the symptoms the feedback loop the pleasure begins to feel little bit

51
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:35,840
like Joy Delight a gladness a

52
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,880
um a sense of kind of not just pleasure but a sense of

53
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:47,800
well-being and so I'll offer you some guidance and maybe this can be the

54
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,199
orientation as we um continue exploring these

55
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:59,960
different uh inner capacities we have that are get getting gathered and

56
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:06,599
organized and oriented towards somebody and uh we're organizing the

57
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:16,759
mind we're organizing our mental life our heart life we're organizing it so it's really here in this loving way um

58
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:23,880
immersed in some immersed in love

59
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:30,000
maybe so to assume a meditation Pro posture

60
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,800
and to gently close the

61
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:44,560
eyes and to take a few long slow deep breaths and relaxing on the exhale

62
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:22,160
and then letting the breathing return to normal begin now to sit here

63
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,720
quietly without

64
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,440
meditating to to sit here quietly and do

65
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,680
nothing and if you do anything if you start thinking about things or reacting

66
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:50,479
to things or reacting to this instructions that's doing

67
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,479
something how simple can you allow yourself to

68
00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:01,960
be if doing anything in might be

69
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:13,240
relaxing the tendency to do to think to

70
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:25,400
react and one of the characteristics one of the things that arise is when we get

71
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:32,640
simpler and simpler doing less and less and less is a natural capacity to be

72
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:39,839
aware to be present here and now is left

73
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:46,720
there not an active intentional

74
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:53,920
attention but a receptive quiet almost

75
00:08:53,920 --> 00:09:01,440
natural way of knowing sensing being aware

76
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:14,639
in a way that we're kind of capacity for attention is always there when we're

77
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,519
awake and it can stand out in the Highlight if we do

78
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:27,800
nothing letting go just being

79
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:41,800
and doing this not doing

80
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:49,839
is as it works for you don't have a high standard but notice as you do nothing do

81
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:57,760
little very little some way in which awareness it can be present without you

82
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,560
doing awareness present moment

83
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,200
awareness maybe an awareness which is very

84
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,160
light maybe an awareness which is little bit more spacious little

85
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:32,519
spacious open receptive that

86
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:13,399
and then as you exhale to settle the

87
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:20,920
awareness into the settling spot of

88
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:31,240
breathing to allow the centering spot of breathing

89
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,000
to be in the middle of this very light open

90
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,880
awareness and as you breathe and as you just be doing very

91
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:03,720
little feel feel your way into your body to

92
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:10,440
feel whatever pleasure whatever rightness or

93
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:16,399
relief there is in this Simplicity of just sitting here in

94
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:35,399
meditation maybe the awareness a simple non-doing awareness can have a global

95
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:40,600
reach to feel in the body where there's

96
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:49,040
pleasure or contentment or

97
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,240
Comfort or a feeling of calm or suling

98
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:14,880
and without doing much just a little bit more than doing

99
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:25,720
nothing let there be a gentle massage with awareness gentle returning and entering

100
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:32,000
and being in the middle of it all

101
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:48,839
breathing connecting awareness to the

102
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,839
inhale connecting awareness to the

103
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,079
exhale e

104
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:58,120
connecting and sustaining with the inhale as if maybe the inhale

105
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,040
touches the ability to sense and feel

106
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:15,560
inhale and this exhale is a touching into

107
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:22,199
awareness rather than you doing the

108
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:30,000
awareness awareness is quiet it's more like

109
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,920
the breathing touches awareness and you stay

110
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,639
open to experience the whole

111
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:52,319
inhale sustaining the whole exhale

112
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:33,040
centered or breathing the peripheral

113
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:40,880
awareness can receive whatever pleasure calm

114
00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:47,600
contentment there might be with sitting

115
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:57,000
here with your breathing sitting here aware

116
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:34,600
alert enough to the experience of breathing that you're likely to notice

117
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,720
if the Mind begins to think and wonder

118
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:52,480
off and if it does use that as a reminder

119
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,840
to connect to breathing stay with the

120
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,840
breathing e

121
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,000
you might allow there to be a little

122
00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:02,320
smile add a little bit of joy joy to the

123
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,600
pleasure a gentle

124
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,200
yes to settling in

125
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:22,759
here to breathing at the center

126
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:37,799
surrounded by some feeling of pleasure or

127
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,720
Joy however small that

128
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,679
is e

129
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:50,919
maybe the inhale is a connecting to the process of

130
00:20:51,559 --> 00:21:00,600
breathing and the exhale is sustaining the whole length of the exale

131
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:10,919
exhale while you relax into a wider feeling of

132
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:16,679
well-being associated with the Simplicity of

133
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:21,760
being here

134
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
meditating

135
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

136
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
for

137
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

138
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
for

139
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,440
e for

140
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:54,320
and as you're sitting meditating can you do Le less can you

141
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:00,080
relax let go of anything not needed for

142
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,200
meditation let go of anything not about

143
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:16,200
meditation soften relax anything that keeps

144
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:24,600
you at a distance from being settled here in your

145
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,158
body breathing

146
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,120
a calming of the Mind and

147
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:59,799
Body a feeling of contentment or calm or

148
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:05,840
simple pleasure that's here as we come to the

149
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,360
end of the

150
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:21,840
meditation maybe as be as we started to do almost

151
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,480
nothing just just enough awareness to be centered

152
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,559
here in the experience of

153
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:48,520
breathing and to feel as with the end of the

154
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:57,480
meditation whatever is Pleasant whatever you enjoy

155
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,799
and maybe you can appreciate that you may took this time

156
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:15,159
to practice to sit here and appreciate it with a small

157
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:21,279
smile turning up the corners of your mouth just a little

158
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:27,360
bit with an attitude of yes here

159
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:35,039
and if it's easy enough allowing some joy to

160
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:42,559
arise the joy of

161
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:48,679
practicing being a little bit more connected a little calmer

162
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:59,039
settled allowing you to yourself to feel Joy or Del

163
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,320
light or

164
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:13,880
appreciation a kind of appreciation that brings a smile at least to the

165
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:24,960
heart and as we come to the end May It Be

166
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:36,240
that we gaze upon the world with a smile in our

167
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,519
eyes a sparkle

168
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:47,440
delight and then we see other people with

169
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:56,360
appreciation many people do not often are not often seen

170
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:02,120
with appreciation with Delight with

171
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:11,640
joy and it's a gift we can give others is to not be in a hurry to speak

172
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:19,200
or to get what you want or to make something happen but to use the ability to be

173
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:27,440
present quietly to appreciate others

174
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:35,240
to gaze upon others with a simple

175
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:45,320
joy the joy of at least having our hearts

176
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:50,600
open and caring for everyone we meet

177
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:57,039
we're so lucky when we have care and appreciation

178
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:03,000
and compassion for others

179
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:11,640
love and may it be that this practice we

180
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:19,960
do supports the welfare and happiness of Others May all beings be

181

on uh samadi the topic I want to talk about

189
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:03,639
now is joy and with that in mind I want to express my joy and my appreciation my gratitude

190
00:32:03,639 --> 00:32:11,000
for all the people who made donations to our save the children fundraising drive and

191
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,799
um the uh the little meter on the save the children's

192
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:25,559
page for IMC shows us uh more than 90% there to those somewhat arbitrary goal

193
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:32,440
that we set and um so I'm quite inspired and delighted and happy that uh this

194
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:40,240
community came forward so much and to offer so it's close to $70,000 there and

195
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:46,159
uh we're actually raised more because of a donation that came in uh indirectly

196
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:51,919
not to the through that particular page on Save the window save save the

197
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:58,039
children so um and some of you if you would still like to make a donation it's

198
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:05,080
a a donation well well offered and and inspiring to have done it together and

199
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:10,679
kind of the some total of what we're doing here is quite impressive it's um

200
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:17,600
it makes a kind of a loud statement for some of us of what a community can do is when we come together to do good things

201
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:24,000
in the world so thank you so you'll find information about it on the IMCA

202
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:33,039
website and then so um joy joy as part of

203
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:40,480
meditation um now it's not so easy to feel Joy I mean it's uh uh when people

204
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,880
come to meditation they often will begin because of some challenge they have

205
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:52,240
maybe the suffering they have um difficulty they have that um they can't

206
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:58,000
just sit down and smile and feel Joy um but at some point as the as we

207
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,799
learn mindfulness learn how to be present for our experience uh it's phenomenal that we have a practice that

208
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:11,638
can meet our suffering and that can meet our sadness our grief our anger and we could do it that practice of mindfulness

209
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:16,919
does it effectively and it's a very significant way of not being caught by

210
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:22,320
the emotions while at the same time developing the capacity to hold them in

211
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:28,000
a beneficial way we're not being driven around or controlled by emot our

212
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,280
emotions but we're also not uh avoiding them so this whole process of

213
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:41,919
mindfulness is such a good foundation um and as mindfulness develops then at some point um the

214
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:48,480
capacity to be present grows and it becomes a time maybe to begin

215
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:55,358
appreciating that mindfulness can partner with some with a a kind of a

216
00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:00,880
steady stable calm Focus uh really staying here in the

217
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:06,040
present moment some people call call a certain kind of

218
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:12,560
concentration um um suade uh momentary suade where we're really here Moment by

219
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:19,359
moment and you can really feel a shift sometimes when we feel now I'm really

220
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:24,839
here and um I'm not being pulled off this way and that way anymore now the

221
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:32,599
whole system is is uh um settled enough clicked in enough that um

222
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:38,640
that uh I'm I'm just going to be in the flow of the present moment um and that

223
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:45,720
can bring so much delight and joy especially if it's been a long time coming that we've been working with the

224
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:53,440
reactivity and the strong preoccupation of the mind and bringing the Mind back and waking up again and again at some

225
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,920
point it doesn't become so much work to be present anymore we're here

226
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:05,640
and even the most experienced meditators have to begin again at the beginning even the experienced meditators will sit

227
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:13,760
down and their mind will be preoccupied and it feels like they're beginners again and um the difference between in a

228
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:20,400
sense I like to think that we're all beginners uh just some of us are experienced beginners and the difference

229
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:26,440
between a a raw beginner and experienced beginner is that um experienced beginner

230
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:32,280
kind of knows the Terr knows to recognize what's important to recognize what to be present

231
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:38,760
for and um and someone who's a noest to meditation might not know that yet and

232
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:45,839
so when we start kind of bringing in samade as a partner to mindfulness uh we're going further into

233
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:54,839
recognizing what is important what is useful to notice in the present moment so it's not a complete random uh uh kind

234
00:36:54,839 --> 00:37:05,400
of uh choicelessness about what we're being present for um the um uh there is a uh

235
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:12,240
a because if we do that then the old habits in mind actually gives priority to certain things it's not we're not

236
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:21,560
really choiceless but when we really settle deep uh and uh then at some point

237
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:28,119
um the um um the we start noticing

238
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:35,040
that it feels good to meditate there's a more calm there's more subtleness the mind is not so much in out of

239
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:40,880
control and um and as we developed a sama want to started recognizing some of

240
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:46,319
the good factors that began growing and developing and one of those is the

241
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:52,520
ability to stay present and uh and one of those forms for somat is what I

242
00:37:52,520 --> 00:38:02,040
talked about yesterday this connecting attention and sustaining that there's a gentle kind of um stay there stay there

243
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:08,560
there so we're not ready yet to really click into the present moment but we're we're there close enough we just stay

244
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:14,400
there stay there and it can be kind of delightful it can be very pleasant um

245
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:21,800
almost as it's Pleasant to get a massage it's Pleasant to massage the mind the attention the present moment uh stay

246
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:28,800
there be here be here and then um as we as uh the

247
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:35,280
meditation develops uh part of the landscape we want to become familiar with is that

248
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:41,000
whatever kind of pleasure there is uh with it and uh and the word pleasure as

249
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:48,079
I said last week involves a wide range of of Good Feelings uh sometimes it's a

250
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:53,480
feel kind of a sense of beauty a sweetness that's present sometimes it's

251
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:59,720
more clear physical kind of strong flow of pleasure meure of tingling of delight

252
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:06,319
that moves through some parts of the body and um and one of the and some of

253
00:39:06,319 --> 00:39:13,000
it has a little more of an emotional quality and one of the things that becomes invaluable as we're approaching

254
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,960
the immersion samade approach approaching and getting immersed in the world of

255
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:27,839
samade is to feel Joy and the poly word is pi which is a p i TI

256
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:33,200
and um and it's um I've seen sometimes that it's uh

257
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:39,000
translated as a thrill there's a kind of little bit of little bit kind of a

258
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,560
joyful excitement uh that's there and um and uh

259
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:50,319
so it's represented by a smile uh sometimes with a smile there's

260
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:55,880
kind of a little bit of energy there awakens and and becomes strong maybe

261
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:02,480
kind of Sparkle in the eyes and maybe the cheeks and the in the head uh

262
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:08,760
there's a kind of a kind of a feeling of delight and kind of energized Delight

263
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:16,160
kind of an enthusiasm yes um we're here to practice uh there's

264
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:23,240
um in that enthusias that yes that delight and joy can be kind of soft and

265
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:30,200
sweet and it it could also be kind of quite uh strong at

266
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:35,800
times uh it's kind of like the the u a

267
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:41,240
um the the connecting and sustaining staying there with experience becomes a

268
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:48,800
little bit like blowing on a fire and the Fire gets stronger and stronger that staying there staying there with the

269
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,880
with the breathing the focus of attention this uh

270
00:40:53,880 --> 00:41:00,800
connecting applying attention and then sustaining it um is a gentle kind of blowing that lets

271
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:07,000
that Joy arise the The Joy This Joy is considered

272
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:13,440
to be in the tradition to be a little bit more mental in contrast to another

273
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:20,280
form of well-being that uh comes into play when we go into samade which is uh

274
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:27,520
I call happiness and um it's one that's not it's it's more

275
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:34,640
Sublime it's more settled and so often It's associated being a little more physical but it's because the little bit

276
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:42,520
of mental excitement thrill that involves joy quiets down becomes quieter

277
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:47,760
and then we feel a kind of a settle calm peaceful kind of happiness that feels

278
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:55,240
very still uh the joy has a little bit of movement or excitement in it that um

279
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:00,720
this deeper happiness doesn't have and these two can coexist but these are

280
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:06,480
kind of elements of this Gathering Together the we're Gathering Together

281
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:14,960
these good qualities and now emotionally we're Gathering our emotional life the good good the goodness that's there with

282
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:20,319
our inspiration and practice the goodness of the intention of why we're

283
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:27,760
practicing the goodness of the purpose the goodness of our how we offer ourselves in the practice the

284
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:34,440
self-respect the care maybe the love for ourselves that grows as we do this practice there's all this kind of

285
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:41,760
gathering of goodness that's here that is being collected to be present in a

286
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:47,720
very simple way to be present almost as if we're doing very close to nothing but

287
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:54,920
we're engaged we're fully here and um and at some point this fully here this

288
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:01,000
engagement begins having a life of its own and um and sometimes the effort to

289
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:08,000
practice doesn't does not feel like we're doing nothing but it feels like I'm not doing it now the practice is

290
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,920
carrying me now the practice is flowing and we're here connecting sustaining and

291
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:21,000
this Joy uh of practice the pleasure of practice begins carrying us begins move

292
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:27,920
flowing us it's kind of like we've we've stepped onto the the moving sidewalk and

293
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:36,400
uh and we're walking walking and it's getting and then we suddenly step onto that moving you know conveyor belt and

294
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:41,520
um and and we can stop walking because now we're being carried Along by it and

295
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:47,040
so at some point uh the uh as we gather as we feel allow ourselves to connect to

296
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:55,000
all this it clicks in and we're we're being being practiced rather than doing the practice and for this to happen

297
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:03,240
there is this uh uh organizing Gathering um of ourselves unifying of it

298
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:11,960
of those things that we know are part of this process of samade so there is a a a

299
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:18,839
selectivity not to push anything away not to deny and put blinders on zat is

300
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:24,040
the opposite it's the releasing of blinders but then also of beginning to

301
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:30,720
take in the the pleasure the goodness of the practice here and

302
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:36,240
now we're allowed to feel Joy in this practice not only we allowed that the

303
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:41,680
joy itself is uh uh and then happiness these

304
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:51,079
qualities is what begins to allow it's it's part of the approach to the wonderful sweet uh Lake

305
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:56,359
that we're going to go dipping into that immerse ourselves in um these are the

306
00:44:56,359 --> 00:45:02,000
qualities that come into play if we chase them if we try to engineer them

307
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,559
then uh we get in the way if we have a strong expectation we're forcing it it

308
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:14,520
gets in the way it's the pleasure of not forcing anything the pleasure of not

309
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:20,160
chasing the that's part of the pleasure of this samama it allows us to settle in

310
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:26,800
allows something to come into play and uh puts us on the conveyor belt that uh

311
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:33,599
that um maybe in the airport where the San

312
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:40,880
Francisco airport has see all these you know moving sidewalks we can stand on it takes us to the plane so we're going

313
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:49,240
this and then we'll at some point there some we're in the plane so I hope this makes sense and um

314
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:55,960
and I certainly hope that for those of you who your direct experience isn't the same of what I'm talking about that you

315
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:01,960
don't lose heart that um uh that the great joy of this

316
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:07,040
practice is that the practice puts us in the middle of our life as it is uh and

317
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:12,200
then we find our way with that with mindfulness and and um I've had a lot of

318
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:19,240
joy in the practice by oddly enough by having a practice that connects me in a

319
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:27,040
useful significant way to my personal difficulties so um so even there we we

320
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:33,400
can find a certain kind of pleasure so thank you very much so uh

321
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:40,480
you might today as you go through your day um uh see if you can find more

322
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,920
joy uh Avail yourself of the joy that's here there's more probably more

323
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,599
opportunities to feel Joy if you slow down look around then you usually allow

324
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:57,599
yourself to feel see what happens if you spend a day allowing yourself

325
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:05,640
to feel the simple joys of life here and now thank you
