1
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:10,519
so hello everyone and warm

2
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:17,640
greetings and warm greetings in a cold world it's a little bit cold I'm wearing

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:24,320
a sweater but uh a world that's full of War

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:31,960
violence hostility in all directions

5
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:43,559
and no Direction you look probably you don't see it so here we are warm greetings in a

6
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:49,640
cold world and one of the things that we're called on to

7
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:58,320
do in this challenging world that we live in is to not be

8
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:07,200
afraid and this maybe is a tall order a huge

9
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,720
challenge but if we're afraid the the more that we're afraid

10
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,360
the more that we cannot help make this a warm World a Caring

11
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:27,840
World the more that we cannot be agents of change in our

12
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,719
households in our neighborhoods hoods in our towns work spreading

13
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,600
outwards fear

14
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,680
interferes fear tears

15
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:55,640
apart so one of the tasks of practice is to learn to sit with fear so that we're

16
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:03,798
not afraid and that is a maybe needs a little

17
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,078
unpacking I think we can assume that we'll be

18
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,040
afraid or say it differently we can assume that we will

19
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:22,160
be uh there'll be occasions when fear fear will be present for

20
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,760
us some of the fear is appropriate and healthy and some of it is

21
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:36,200
not regardless of what it is the practice of

22
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:42,920
mindfulness is to sit in the middle of it and not be afraid not be

23
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:52,000
afraid have fear but not be defined by the fear have fear and know how to study the

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,760
fear to learn the lessons of fear

25
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:05,360
without becoming Frozen or becoming indifferent or becoming

26
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:11,680
removed so as we sit this meditation

27
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:21,720
here how would you where would you go within how would you be

28
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:31,599
within if you were in a meditating in a place that has no fear

29
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,840
where you are not afraid where mindfulness Is Not Afraid there might be

30
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,760
fear in you but you're not defined by the fear

31
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:51,280
what is that place that's free of fear in the midst of your

32
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:58,360
fear so whether you feel fear now or not what is that place where is that

33
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:05,519
resting place that ref Refuge that place of strength that place of

34
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:12,000
non-fear with which you can meet whatever fear comes

35
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,359
your way so that's the question that's the

36
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:23,320
contemplative suggestion for the contemplative exp exploration for this

37
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,600
sitting so to assume a meditation

38
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:34,759
posture and gently close your

39
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:45,758
eyes and as you're sitting here as you are to

40
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:57,000
relax let the shoulders release

41
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:07,240
soften let's let the shoulders release to the pull of

42
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,319
gravity relax the

43
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,080
belly relax the

44
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,479
hands

45
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:47,000
and relax the face soften around the eyes the

46
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,199
cheeks the

47
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,479
mouth

48
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,880
and to see if you can let the relaxation go deeper gently take some long slow deep

49
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:20,120
breaths and the exhale as long as it's comfortable long

50
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:26,440
extended exhale in which you relax the

51
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,919
body release tension and

52
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
holding

53
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:13,840
and then letting your breathing return to

54
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:23,120
normal and continue relaxing softening this

55
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,560
time relaxing the thinking

56
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:35,560
mind softening the tensions and pressures agitations of the

57
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
Mind

58
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:14,639
as if the mind is a rough sea as you relax let the surface of the

59
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,319
sea quiet down and spread wide and

60
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,280
peacefully letting the waves become

61
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
quiet

62
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,440
and then within your body relaxing the

63
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:05,079
heart relaxing the emotions you you have if if they're fluttering or agitated

64
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:10,000
or feeling fragile or V

65
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,480
vulnerable or there's any feeling of

66
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:31,120
distress not to make it go away

67
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:40,200
make a room for it all to settle to relax almost as if it's

68
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,040
allowed to relax into

69
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
itself

70
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
for

71
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,079
and then sitting quietly settling on the body's

72
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,760
experience of

73
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:07,000
breathing as if the experience of breathing provides a gentle

74
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:14,920
reassurance here [Music] now you are safe things are

75
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,839
okay in the moment sitting

76
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,680
here it's okay to relax further with every

77
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
breath

78
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
for

79
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:21,160
and now can you

80
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:27,880
find or imagine place

81
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:34,040
within maybe deep in your body or deep in your

82
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,560
mind that is free of

83
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:52,320
fear if you're anxious or afraid maybe deeper than the fear you

84
00:12:53,160 --> 00:13:00,959
have at the center of all things a place of rest of Peace of

85
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:09,040
calm of clarity we're knowing being

86
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:15,639
aware is to be aware with an awareness that has no fear

87
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:24,560
in it just aware it might be aware of

88
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:33,959
fear it might know this spar within you but that

89
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:39,199
knowing is done from a place of

90
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:47,000
safety that knowing is

91
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,560
courageous courageously without

92
00:13:53,160 --> 00:14:00,759
fear where is that place within

93
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:06,639
where there is no

94
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:20,680
fear where you can know all things

95
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:35,120
fearlessly and it might not be all or nothing it might be a matter of

96
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:41,560
degree where you get closer and closer to the place where there's less

97
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:49,480
and less fear in how you're mindful how you're

98
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
present

99
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600

120
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:16,799
hostility just let it relax as if it

121
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,840
relaxes in the gentle

122
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:30,039
warmth of this peaceful Caring Place Within

123

for

129
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,799
and then as we come to the end of this

130
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:28,840
sitting to see if you can relax more deeply whatever you're holding on

131
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:36,120
to or whatever is holding on to you let it

132
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:41,520
soften relax for you to settle into a deeper

133
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,120
place of

134
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:55,240
knowing knowing that has no

135
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:03,240
fear has no identification with

136
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:18,880
anything but from which from where comes care and

137
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:25,760
compassion that tenderness of love and

138
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:33,880
respect an ability to gaze upon all things

139
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:40,799
kindly as if all things

140
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,600
warrant attention

141
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:06,720
knowing knowing in a way that lets all tensions begin to

142
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:24,440
relax and for to whatever degree you can rest in this knowing that has no fear no

143
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:29,520
hostility no identification with anything

144
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:36,640
or whatever degree you can imagine such a place of openness and

145
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:49,360
Clarity let that be the source of wishing this world

146
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,039
well may all

147
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:02,279
beings be free of

148
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:12,398
hostility may all beings be free of

149
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:23,200
violence may all beings be free of

150
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:29,440
Affliction and harm

151
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:38,120
may all beings [Music] know that there are people in this world

152
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,158
who care for

153
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,360
them who wish them no

154
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:59,399
harm may all beings be happy

155
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:10,720
may all beings and people be peaceful and

156
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:21,080
free and may we contribute to that

157
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,320
possibility

158
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,460
[Music]

159
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,519
thank

160
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,320
you

161
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,240
e

162
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:06,120
so I want to start this morning with two quotes from the

163
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:14,440
Buddha the first is go forth for the welfare and happiness of

164
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:20,760
the world so this call to benefit the world

165
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:26,159
that we live in

166
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:32,639
however he this uh instructions from the Buddha

167
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:40,278
is meant for people who can go into the world with enough

168
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:47,240
self personal Liberation enough self under knowing that they can go into the

169
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:55,039
world without causing any harm and they know and can

170
00:31:55,039 --> 00:32:03,480
recognize what harm is and the impact of harm and and uh they freed themselves from

171
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:12,039
any tendency to act in ways that are harmful to themselves or

172
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:18,799
others they can go into the world peacefully as promoters of

173
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:28,279
Peace the so this is a tall order but I think

174
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:33,880
that the direction the Buddha is pointing us to is to become people who

175
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:41,840
can go forth for the welfare and happiness of the world and in doing so there's a second

176
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,880
quote among types of beneficent conduct

177
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,720
beneficial conduct among the best is

178
00:32:52,720 --> 00:33:00,639
promoting settling and establishing an une ethical person in ethical

179
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:09,399
Behavior so that's quite a statement that uh the best conduct is is

180
00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:15,159
uh not just being ethical yourself and maybe not even going forth

181
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:22,159
for the welfare of others in a kind of way of you know just helping them out in a

182
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:30,919
sense but for the Buddha the best conduct best thing you can do is establish an unethical person uh in in

183
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:36,799
ethics in ethical Behavior so you know I don't fully

184
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:44,799
understand the statement and implications of it and and how Universal we should understand it but I'm inspired

185
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:50,639
by this statement and I'm inspired that it's one thing to help another

186
00:33:50,639 --> 00:33:58,960
person uh and another thing to to

187
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:05,279
have someone learn to be unethical to be ethical so they don't go around then

188
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:12,200
harming many people it's possible that in a certain kind of way that this is much more uh

189
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:18,679
beneficial in the long term is to support and develop and encourage

190
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:23,800
greater ethical behavior in this life in this world of ours and I know that when

191
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:30,599
I was young teenager that um I I I wasn't

192
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:36,240
unethical mostly because maybe a lack of imagination it

193
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:42,280
wasn't I was an ethical person but I just didn't I just wasn't had had no

194
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:49,480
orientation that way to be unethical and um and but well I thought

195
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:54,919
that people the idea of Ethics to me was kind of uh superficial kind of being

196
00:34:54,919 --> 00:35:00,640
excessively sweet or or um I kind of um

197
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:06,440
look down upon people who were referred to as ethical as somehow being sometimes

198
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:12,359
being hypocritical sometimes being too too artificially sweet or

199
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:17,599
something and one of the big changes for me in coming to Buddhism was coming to

200
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:24,240
have a deep appreciation for uh behavior and ways of being and discovering

201
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:32,640
sources within uh that are the Wellspring of non-harming living in a nonharming

202
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:40,119
way and that uh part of why I'm a Buddhist teacher is to be able to convey that to people and spread that deep

203
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:46,079
sense of peace that can come from this inner place that is really has an ethical

204
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:51,520
quality the the uh Buddhist path of Liberation is an ethical path of

205
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:58,319
Liberation an ethic enlightened person is an ethical person there's no

206
00:35:58,319 --> 00:36:05,119
no doubt that this is what the Buddha taught but what does it mean to be an ethical

207
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:13,359
person the Buddha as I said in this statement here talked about establishing an unethical person in ethical

208
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:20,800
Behavior elsewhere he talks about um uh there's what's

209
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:27,839
beautiful and then there's what's more beautiful than beautiful and what is beautiful

210
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:32,920
is being ethical oneself and what is more

211
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:38,200
beautiful is than then that beauty is uh

212
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:43,640
encouraging or inciting or maybe that's the wrong word being a

213
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:50,440
catalyst uh for other people to become ethical so here there's this call to go

214
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:56,839
forth for the benefit of the world is uh also there's includes in that the the

215
00:36:56,839 --> 00:37:03,119
call to speak up to act up to to try to change the world and change how people

216
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:08,480
are not to convert them to Buddhism not to

217
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:18,440
uh believe in in religious truths of any kind but to believe in to understand to

218
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:25,200
appreciate um the value of non-harming nonhostility non-

219
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:32,880
greed um and uh and not just to believe in it but to really understand be

220
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:40,359
motivated from the inside out to live this way now there's a reason why the Buddha

221
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:48,760
emphasized this uh that's very different he lived in a very different world than we live in uh for in that world there

222
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:54,319
were no elections to uh try to get the

223
00:37:54,319 --> 00:38:00,839
government that you like to kind of run the show or fix things the way they should be fixed there was no there were

224
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:07,680
no economic systems wide systems that uh that needed to be changed there was no

225
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:13,880
capitalism or socialism operating and there was no way to have these huge

226
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:20,760
impacts on the economic systems we live in so that they could be more Equitable and more uh

227
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:26,760
supportive there was no um you know there were no nonprofits there were no

228
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:32,960
there's it was very simple world the one of the main organizations back in time

229
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:39,960
of the Buddha were the Kings the monarchs who uh ruled with often Iron

230
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:45,960
Fists um they were quite comfortable with killing people on the spot if there was any

231
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:52,160
disagreement and so for someone to protest back then someone to go and say

232
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:58,640
to the king and you should stop the War uh that meant was off with your head there was you can't you couldn't really

233
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:03,680
do it back then and there was no sense that you could do something but the

234
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:12,839
Buddha did speak up and he spoke up in ways that were sometimes not direct uh when he uh talked to Kings uh

235
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:21,079
he would not tell them directly but he would tell stories uh in the form of myths of how things were in the ancient

236
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:26,480
world and uh and one of them had to do with a king in the ancient world who

237
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:32,839
wanted to perform a big sacrifice so they could be benefited in some way and

238
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:39,599
um and uh and so in this myth the minister who hears about this big

239
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:47,960
sacrifice uh tells the the king your Majesty's country is beset by

240
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:53,760
thieves and is ravaged villes Villages and towns are destroyed the countryside

241
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:59,839
is infested with uh robbers if your majesty were to tax this

242
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:05,440
region he going to tax it to be able to do a big sacrifice that would be the wrong thing

243
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:11,760
to do suppose your majesty were to think I will get rid of this plague of robbers

244
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:17,839
by executions and imprisonments and or by confiscation threats and

245
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:24,520
banishment the plague would not be properly ended those who survived would later

246
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:29,760
harm your Majesty's Realm so if you go around using violence to

247
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:36,559
get your way then sooner or later the people who survive will come back and harm

248
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:43,720
you however with with a following plan you can completely eliminate the plague

249
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:50,280
to those in the Kingdom who are engaged in cultivating crops and Rising cattle let

250
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:56,720
your majesty distribute grain and fodder to those in train trade give capital to

251
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,880
those in government service assign proper living wages then those people

252
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:07,359
being intent on their own occupations will not harm the kingdom your Majesty's

253
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:14,079
revenues will will be great the land will be tranquil and not beset by thieves and the people with joy in their

254
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:21,119
hearts will play with their children and will dwell in open houses not locked

255
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:27,480
up it's so painful to read this ancient admonition when we had have you know

256
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:34,680
million children or more in Gaza who cannot go outside cannot be play in the

257
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:41,839
streets now who are hearing constant bombing all around

258
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:47,200
them children who are dying what are those children going to

259
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:53,079
grow up to be the ones that survive they're going to be scarred you know and

260
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:59,119
in the first couple of decades in the 1990s and early 2000s when I was

261
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:05,280
teaching uh I met people who were elderly who uh as children had gone

262
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,319
through World War II uh in various all kinds of different

263
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:17,040
capacities um uh some were not just children but also adults and uh horrific

264
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:22,319
things they'd seen and experienced as uh uh in the bombings of London the

265
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:30,160
bombings of Dresden the um the holoc cost the concentration caps and um and

266
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:35,440
what struck me a few different things was um the horror of it and how long it

267
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:42,359
lasted for people and uh and impacted them even when they were just the toddlers or

268
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:50,920
couldn't even speak and babies being carried in shelters and bombing around them um uh it seemed to have affected

269
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:59,000
them for their life and they come on these Retreats having to deal with these deep uh conditions that they were grown

270
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:08,800
up with so to um to plan for a better future to be

271
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:14,160
careful and this is the difficult work when the Buddha says establish unethical

272
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:21,960
people in being ethical I'll read it a little more exactly

273
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:28,079
um

274
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:46,240
so what is beautiful abstaining from killing abstaining from taking what is not

275
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:53,240
giving given abstaining from sexual misconduct abstaining from speaking falsely abstaining from speaking

276
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:58,480
divisively abstaining from speaking harshly abstaining from speaking

277
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:07,960
pointlessly abstaining from being avaricious abstaining from hostility Asain abstaining from wrong

278
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:14,319
View and what is more beautiful than beautiful what is better than

279
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:21,240
beautiful abstaining from killing and prompting others to abstain from killing

280
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:28,520
abstaining from taking what is not given and prompting others to abstain from taking what is not given abstain and so

281
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:35,160
forth all of these this is a very different world that the Buddha wants to live in than a

282
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:43,280
world where people live in opposition to each other this takes a to do what the Buddha is saying is really difficult in

283
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:48,920
a sense it's easier to be in opposition it's harder to approach people in such a

284
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:56,800
way that you prompt them to change how they live is it possible is it realistic

285
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:02,880
is it uh uh unreasonable to do this given the level of pain and Challenge

286
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:11,760
and violence that we live certainly the Buddha prefers advocacy like this over

287
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:18,079
oppositional behaviors he uh when he wants people to

288
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:23,280
avoid divisive speech the unhealthy unethical device of

289
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:29,280
speech um he calls this a speech which divides those who are united and stirs

290
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:35,880
up those who are already divided spoken by a person who loves

291
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:41,680
factionalism Delights factionalism enjoys factionalism speaks

292
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:49,480
to create factions um and for people who want to

293
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:55,359
abstain in order to abstain from uh divisive speech the Buddha emphasizes

294
00:45:55,359 --> 00:46:01,839
creating and perpetuating social Unity

295
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:08,160
um uniting those who are divided support those who are already United and speak

296
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:14,680
to create Harmony so this is an explicit call to

297
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:19,920
make a difference in the world to heal social Discord and

298
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:25,280
divisiveness it's not shy away from the challenging work of uniting those who

299
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,800
are divided

300
00:46:31,319 --> 00:46:36,839
engaged in three actions are those acting for the welfare of many people

301
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:45,000
the happiness of many people and the benefit welfare and happiness of many people what three they prompt them in

302
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:52,760
physical acts of Concord verbal acts of Concord mental acts of

303
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:58,880
concordion so the Buddha was not trying to change social institutions because there

304
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:04,480
were none back then in the way that we understand it and uh but what the Buddha lived in

305
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:10,440
was a world where people had personal connections uh and that's where

306
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:16,480
information traveled for the most part because there was nothing no writing there was no TV there was no radio It

307
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:22,640
All Happened orally when people connected to each other and so the world of human connectivity how we connect to

308
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:28,200
each other was a rich world of where social change could

309
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:34,559
occur and in a sense we've come closer to that in our modern world where this

310
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:44,280
phenomenal degree of social media and communication that we have that we've never had before in um spreading so far

311
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:49,400
this is a world where hostility is being promoted this is a world where perhaps

312
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:57,640
we can find a way to promote peace I'm very happy happy that for this

313
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:03,880
that we can use YouTube for these 7 a.m. sittings I don't know all that goes on

314
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:09,760
on YouTube but uh I've heard that it's not so good a good part of it there's um

315
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:15,040
some people have suggested we shouldn't be here it's somehow unethical to even be using

316
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:21,079
YouTube but uh for me this is a platform in which

317
00:48:21,079 --> 00:48:26,480
to try to encourage all of us myself included

318
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:32,079
to live a more ethical life a life of not harming not just a life of being

319
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:37,800
peaceful and distressed but a life of being social change agents for the

320
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:43,599
better so we do the very difficult work work of creating Concord and

321
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:50,000
