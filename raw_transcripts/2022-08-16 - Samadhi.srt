1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:08,639
so again welcome welcome everybody it's nice to practice together

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:14,799
after especially some of us right practicing on our own for these years during the pandemic it's nice to come

3
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:21,840
together so thank you thank you as well as thank you to the people on the other side of that camera

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:30,359
or on youtube also quite something right that kind of imc has really grown

5
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,120
so tonight i'd like to talk a little bit more or continue on this series that i'm

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,800
doing about the seven factors of awakening you wouldn't be surprised if i said

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,879
there were seven factors and i'm going to talk about number six

8
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:56,079
so i've done the first five and so the seven factors awakening are

9
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:02,480
mindfulness investigation energy joy tranquility

10
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:09,439
tonight i'm going to talk about samadhi and the next one after this is equanimity

11
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:15,680
so i'm using this polyword samadhi i'll spend some time this evening

12
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,840
unpacking that and what does it mean and maybe why i'm not using the

13
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:29,439
an english word that's often used one one reason is i like the sound of

14
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:36,000
this word samadhi it kind of has that feeling somebody

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,039
it's kind of this soft spacious maybe expensive experience

16
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,720
so the seven factors of awakening they have these kind of energizing factors

17
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,799
and we have tranquilizing factors and then mindfulness which is in between

18
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:01,439
so samadhi is part of the tranquilizing it's the with tranquility samadhi and

19
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,560
equanimity with the investigation energy and joy

20
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,760
being a little bit more energetic so it gives a little clue

21
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,840
about what samadhi means for now i'm going to use this uh

22
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:25,040
definition it's uh when the mind and body feel unified

23
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:33,599
settled and steady and there's a sense of well-being

24
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,599
unified subtle steady with a sense of well-being

25
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:47,760
and the sense of well-being sometimes can be really powerful or it can be really subtle

26
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,319
and i'll talk about this a little bit but one thing before i talk about maybe a

27
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:00,000
little bit more of a description of how it is or how we might cultivate it

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,080
i'll talk a little bit about why should we bother why should we even

29
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,159
you know be concerned with think about practice with learn about whatever might be this

30
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:19,840
idea of samadhi and we might say that samadhi prepares

31
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:27,920
the mind it creates the conditions it helps prepares the mind for some letting go

32
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,280
and for some deep letting go and it also prepares a mind for some

33
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:40,319
deep understanding so about this understanding and the letting go they often go together

34
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:46,879
this practice this tradition really emphasizes it's with we have these greater understandings

35
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,920
that it just naturally happens that the clinging the craving starts to diminish

36
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:58,640
as we start to understand and see how clinging and craving

37
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:07,280
is a way that doesn't lead to greater happiness it's not a source of lasting happiness

38
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,640
and so samadhi is a way when there's some settledness and steadiness we can

39
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:18,560
see a little this little bit more clearly in exactly the same way

40
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,840
in which if there were a telescope and we wanted to see something that

41
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,120
maybe it's not so clear not so obvious up in the sky it's really helpful to stick this

42
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,520
telescope on a tripod so we might think of samadi as this type of tripod

43
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,800
that enables to see things that we wouldn't be able to see otherwise

44
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:47,280
and one of the first insights that we have with our mindfulness practice

45
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,040
is oh my gosh my mind is out of control i didn't realize how much my mind is

46
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,720
like scattered and distracted and does everything except what i want it to do

47
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,320
this is you know i think all of us have this experience when we start a meditation practice

48
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,160
specifically a mindfulness practice

49
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:16,800
and so as the mind starts to get more and more still as they're a little bit more samadhi

50
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:23,759
then we start to see that oh this what seemed like was this just this

51
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:30,479
out of control mind this experience that's filled with thoughts and plans

52
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:36,479
and ideas and fantasies all these types of things

53
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:43,039
as the mind starts to get more still we can penetrate through these

54
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:49,759
which seems like maybe a solid way in which the mind works

55
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:57,360
and we can see oh actually these things are arising and passing they come and they go

56
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,960
sometimes really quickly sometimes really in a longer duration sometimes they seem

57
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,000
like they're flickering sometimes they feel like they're just moving like sludge

58
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,400
but with this samadhi we start to see different characteristics of our experience beyond

59
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:23,600
uh seems like i'm never present and this seeing this this inconstancy

60
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,639
allows some of this letting go allows some of this

61
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,880
softening and lessening of any clinging that we might

62
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,160
be doing so this is the direction in which our

63
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:48,160
practice goes is with towards greater and greater stillness and peace and sense of well-being

64
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,680
and so we can use this as a guidepost too with our practice

65
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:01,280
as we explore different ways of practicing as we learn new things is there a way in which we can

66
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:09,680
use this experiences and ideas of steadiness and stability and well-being

67
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,800
as a way to kind of direct the direction we want to go with our practice how do we know with

68
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:22,240
what we're doing is working or not working or is worth persevering with or not just something

69
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,599
that headed towards samadhi

70
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:35,440
so somebody involves is this kind of feeling unified so it

71
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:41,759
involves the whole mind and the whole body in fact this distinction between body

72
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:48,160
and mind starts to blur and in some states even goes away

73
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,280
so it's this real sense of collectedness unification

74
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,639
also this non-distraction we might say where things just are

75
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:05,840
like settling down you know i've heard andrea fella maybe some of you have to use this uh simile

76
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:13,280
of a snow globe you shake it up right and all the glitter goes but then you just put it down and things just start

77
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:19,360
to settle in the same way when the samadhi is present it's small it's kind of like

78
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:26,160
this settling process and one way that's nice of thinking about it as maybe like

79
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:33,279
a as a snow globe is that instead of somebody being this on or off

80
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,279
switch this idea you either have it or you don't we can kind of think like well does it

81
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:45,920
feel like the shaking is happening or does it feel like this settling is happening

82
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,040
so it's more like this recognition that there's it's a spectrum

83
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,640
right so samadhi is going towards calming is going towards settling

84
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:03,200
it's not is it there yes or no it's just one end of the spectrum of

85
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,839
the amount of busyness and distraction we might have

86
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:18,399
so this so we might think of samadhi then as this sliding scale or a continuum of a

87
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:25,920
spectrum and we might with our practice gently encourage more of this sense of calmness

88
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:35,120
so when we sometimes hear this word sometimes it gets translated as this word concentration

89
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:43,519
but i know certainly for me for years at the first of my practice i thought concentration was this real straining

90
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:49,440
bearing down working really hard way to practice

91
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,040
and yeah the mind gets settled a little bit more but it's missing that well-being

92
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:01,839
quality when we do this and it's missing this quality of

93
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,720
ease it's missing a quality of uh maybe it's uh

94
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:15,360
rather than like stapling the mind onto the object it uh it has more of a sense of just

95
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,880
being unified or or i don't know it's a

96
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:28,320
samadhi is a nicer feeling than just bearing down and really trying to focus

97
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:36,880
so there's a few qualities that are within samadhi that i'd like to

98
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:44,160
highlight to talk about to help us remember that it's not just this bearing down forcing the mind to really

99
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:51,440
get concentrated so one thing i'll say is

100
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:58,160
that there's this um some of the qualities that we find within samadhi when we're like moving towards that end

101
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:04,079
of the spectrum of a little of more collectedness and unification and well-being

102
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:09,680
some of the qualities we'll find is this steadiness

103
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,279
as it starts to become a bit more steadiness supports investigation

104
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:21,519
so there's a little bit more investigation or maybe investigation is

105
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,959
not exactly the right word but just as i said with the

106
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:33,600
tripod with a telescope with the steadiness we can see things differently so in the

107
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,800
as we're moving towards more and more samadhi there's a uh seeing things a little bit

108
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,720
differently than we might do with our just our regular every day and

109
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,639
which we just go through our business so there's this capacity to maybe look at

110
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:57,279
what's happening see a little bit more deeply to learn from what's happening

111
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,800
in a way that's maybe in a relaxed easy way for it to penetrate into our

112
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,920
experience so that's one quality that's happens

113
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:14,800
when there's samadhi but also we can see that there's a certain refinement we might use this word refinement or

114
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,720
delicacy of the attention sometimes when we're doing mindfulness

115
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:27,600
and where it's like the object and the mind drifts away of course the mind drifts away this is what minds do right

116
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:34,240
and there might be of like dang it you know just right this way in which there's this uh

117
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:41,440
a little bit of i don't know forcefulness and trying to really stick back here

118
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,839
so when there's uh as the mind starts to come down there can be a little bit more like oh

119
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:54,480
and maybe just with the subject maybe just touching lightly instead of i use this word kind of like stapling on or

120
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,519
forcefully on there's this way in which it can be

121
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:07,839
a little yeah a little bit more gentle a little bit more delicate and this delicate gentle

122
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:14,639
awareness can see things that are more subtle

123
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,760
so i just talked about how investigation enables to see things that you couldn't normally see but

124
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:25,279
also we can see things more subtle and as the objects are becoming more subtle

125
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:32,079
the quality of the mindfulness or quality of the mind maybe i'll say it's also getting i'll use this word

126
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:37,920
delicate or maybe uh refined

127
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:43,920
or smooth or something like this and so this is a quality that's

128
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:51,440
happening too this softening or maybe a little bit more subtle or delicate so this is another

129
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:58,399
quality of samadhi but or maybe i should say before i move on

130
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:05,760
part of the really powerful parts of samadhi is that with this as the objects are becoming

131
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,199
more subtle and the awareness is becoming more delicate

132
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:16,399
and that might be the right word i'm not sure maybe uh you know i'm going this with my hands

133
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:22,639
like refined it's not quite as rough you know like how sometimes there's material that feels rough and there's material

134
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:30,639
that feels like silk or something like this but then we're able to see more and more

135
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,839
subtle ways in which we are clinging more and more subtle ways in which there

136
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:42,240
might be some aversion where we want things to be different that we just might be so accustomed to that we don't

137
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,320
notice and then when we start to see oh yeah here's a little bit of clinging here's a

138
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:54,240
little bit of tightening here i hadn't noticed then there could be some letting go

139
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,440
which also supports some deepening of the samadhi and more freedom

140
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:05,360
more ease so another quality that is present when

141
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,839
there's some samadhi is this idea of malleability or

142
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:16,880
flexibility or plasticity so the mind can

143
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,320
is a little bit more flexible it's especially when there's a sense of

144
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:28,160
well-being as there's often right the mind doesn't do what we want it to do

145
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:34,800
especially like in the mid in the earlier in our practice and if you've had a day in which there's been a lot of

146
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:43,600
agitation right when we sit to meditate we notice like oh my goodness my mind is all over the place

147
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,720
but as the as we start to settle then

148
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:57,040
with samadhi the mind becomes a little bit more malleable and agile and maybe able to approach things

149
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:03,120
a little bit differently there sometimes there can be a way and with our practice we have a sense like

150
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,880
okay nope this is what i do i'm with mindfulness of the breath and when the mind wanders i come back

151
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:15,440
when i count 1 through 10 and and this can be really great to have this as a practice but there can also be

152
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,480
a time in which maybe that's not the best practice at that moment

153
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:26,959
maybe it would be helpful to open up and do a little bit of loving kindness or some softness

154
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:33,759
if we're really agitated with something that's uh some ill will is really prevalent with

155
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,959
us or maybe we're being really hard on ourselves and we're kind of like beating

156
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:46,000
ourselves over the head with this kind of mindfulness so this malleability is to be able to

157
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,440
recognize what's needed here what's what's the best way forward i'm

158
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:59,279
going like this with my hands to kind of like in a soft gentle way not in the way that we have to find the

159
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:04,880
most pleasant experience and flip around but in a way this i have borne out of

160
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,079
care sensitivity to what's going to support some settling like

161
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:15,360
what would be helpful here should i stay with the breath

162
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,798
maybe maybe i'll just pay attention a little bit more to the exhale the exhale

163
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:26,558
can be a way in which we can like calm or as i said maybe um we could do some

164
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:32,000
loving-kindness third way maybe we could open up the awareness and have this

165
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,760
sense of being receptive so instead of bringing the awareness to an experience we more kind of like open

166
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:45,200
up and allow the experiences to arise these are like subtle differences but

167
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,320
when there's samadhi there can be this malleability and this agility to

168
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:56,720
recognize what's needed without bouncing around too much

169
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:03,120
trying to find just you know the perfect perfect uh experience

170
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:13,600
and so and that maybe i was in this uh a quote here from the suta that sue does this

171
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,960
this particular quote is all is all throughout the suit is in there a number of times

172
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:25,840
and i i myself feel kind of inspired by this so the buddha is describing his own

173
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:32,559
awakening experience and he described that right before it was

174
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:38,160
his awakening enlightenment he described his mind

175
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:44,480
and he said that his mind was concentrated using this word samadhi

176
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,480
concentrated purified cleansed unblemished

177
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:56,400
rid of defilement malleable wieldy

178
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:04,480
and steady and it turned atta attained to imperturb ability

179
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:10,320
so right this is this is why it's a factor of awakening right this is kind of helps creates the conditions in which

180
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:16,320
awakening can happen but i appreciate very much these words you know malleable

181
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:22,080
wieldy you know and steady doesn't mean you know um

182
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,760
you know holding on for dear life and i'm kind of saying emphasizing this

183
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:34,960
over and over again because i suffered a lot in my early retreat practice with i had

184
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:41,679
this idea that i just had to strive strive strive strain strain strain as much as i could and oh my gosh it was

185
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:49,280
miserable it was really miserable you know i'm being on long retreats and

186
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,720
feeling like oh no pain no gain i hadn't quite got the memo

187
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,000
that there was supposed to be some well-being associated with this

188
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:07,840
so of course that's another quality of samadhi is this sense of well-being

189
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:14,640
for me this is like the ah part of samadhi like there's a sense of ah

190
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:21,760
yeah okay yeah i'm here i'm right here

191
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:27,440
just collectedness a sense of okay i'm here

192
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:34,960
so this well-being that comes with somebody is really not only is it an integral part

193
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:41,679
of the practice and the experience but it's actually really important

194
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:49,360
it's important for a number of reasons one is the letting go all these subtle letting

195
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:57,840
goes i'll say in the plural that happens with the the more freedom we find the more

196
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,120
closer or in the direction of awakening is all about letting go it's not about

197
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,799
you know accumulating so it's not about accumulating meditative states it's only about letting go and this is definitely

198
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:15,360
how one gets into somebody too are you practice it but the well-being

199
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:21,440
supports of oh okay yeah i can let go of this right when we're in the middle of

200
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,720
emotional distress or we're in pain we are not in a place to let go of things

201
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:33,760
we can't let go of our habits we can't let go of the usual way our views of how things work our ideas about ourselves we

202
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:40,799
just can't so this well-being supports this letting go as well as the understanding

203
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:46,400
we see the understanding that things are changing they're flickering they're not what we

204
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:52,240
thought they were and that also supports the letting go but so does well-being

205
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:58,880
and i'm using this vague word well-being because it shows up in so many different flavors

206
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,720
and so many different ways with samadhi so i kind of like this generic word

207
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,400
well-being that i'll use for right now but it's not only

208
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:17,280
because it supports letting go that this well-being is really important

209
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:23,120
if we have some of this experience in our meditative

210
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:29,840
experiences and our meditation sessions of experiencing some sense of well-being

211
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:37,440
then this starts to we might say permeate our experience

212
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:43,760
that carries off of the cushion and into our daily life

213
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,760
what we start to experience sitting we start to know oh this is available

214
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:55,600
the mind knows how to do this the mind and body together know how to do this

215
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:02,000
and it starts to allow some of this well-being to show up off the cushion

216
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,280
and this maybe allows for some emotional stability

217
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:14,400
this emotional well-being allows us to have a little more stability in our emotional life which really allows our

218
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,200
daily life off the cushion to unfold in a different way

219
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:26,159
so so this is kind of like dipping into this sense of well-being this

220
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:33,280
also helps us to no longer be pursuing sensual pleasures i need one

221
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,720
more dopamine hit i just need that for me it's cookies

222
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:44,720
or maybe it's you know the internet or buying things or

223
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,400
gambling i don't know what you know all of us have things right if we start to have these experiences of

224
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:57,120
well-being then we start to realize oh yeah these dopamine hits they are

225
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,480
actually inferior they clearly are inferior

226
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:08,400
to these sense of well-being in these meditative states so these

227
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,840
knowing that something better is possible they start to lose their pull

228
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:21,600
they start to be less compelling when we're able to have some alternative experiences and i

229
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:27,200
would say it's often not until people have some meditative experiences of well-being

230
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:33,840
that their relationships to pursuing pleasure really starts to shift

231
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:41,200
right i mean human beings this is part of our biology is to pursue pleasure so it's not until you experience

232
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:47,840
deeper more satisfying more pervasive

233
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:53,600
well-being than our experiences to all of uh what happens in daily life can

234
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:59,840
shift so in some ways i i maybe i'll just

235
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:08,240
emphasize this one more time that that well-being is just as important as like the settling

236
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:14,480
so these two things are happening the settling steadiness and the well-being

237
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,480
the way that we cultivate samadhi is we're cultivating both of

238
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,158
these both the well-being and the settledness

239
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:35,520
so to cultivate somali it does take patience it does take consistent practice

240
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:41,039
it's not something that will happen right away for many people

241
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:49,200
some people do have a propensity for kind of like a settling

242
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:56,960
part of this can be is how we spend our daily lives that if you are a preschool teacher and

243
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:03,840
you're having to keep track of what all the kids are doing no no johnny don't do this you know susie don't do that then

244
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:10,640
you know you're always trying to keep track then this is how you spend your days then you're getting really good at taking

245
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,840
being aware of many things at once or if you're an office manager and or people

246
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:22,840
are calling all the time or customer service you know these types of things is different than if you have for

247
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:29,520
example um a profession that maybe is a scientist who is trying

248
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,720
to look through a microscope for you know you have to kind of really be focused and you don't have a lot of

249
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:40,080
other sensory input or mathematician or computer scientist or

250
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,679
some of these things right so how we spend our days does have an impact what our

251
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:53,360
professions or if you're uh yeah if you tend if what how

252
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:59,279
i'll just leave that i'll say that how you spend your days as well as it's some of it's a mystery i don't know

253
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:04,840
why people don't know why some individuals it's just a little bit easier than for other

254
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:11,600
individuals there's no telling why but

255
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:19,279
there's this way in which we can think about cultivating samadhi

256
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:24,559
as it's not all about bearing down it's focusing i think i've made this point in

257
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:32,880
so many different ways right but one way to think about when we're cultivating this is that 50 a good half

258
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:39,120
of the practice is about relaxing

259
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,480
and letting go and kind of like tuning into the ease

260
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:51,200
whatever ease is available even if that ease is not your dominant experience that might just be a little

261
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:57,440
corner of your experience but not being dismissive of that

262
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,880
quiet sense of contentment or a little bit of sense of like ah when

263
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,320
the mind starts to settle down at least 50 of the practice is

264
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:14,640
tuning into that seems like this should be straightforward but right human beings

265
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:21,360
we have this negativity bias we want to just tune into everything that's wrong so this turns out not to be necessarily

266
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,960
so easy to just stay with what feels comfortable

267
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:33,360
what feels okay what feels good what's pleasant or even what's neutral so 50

268
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:39,360
there another 25 maybe it's just this attitude

269
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:45,679
of receptivity i'm going like this with my hands it's kind of like an openness

270
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:52,720
this maybe has a quality of equanimity so rather than going and trying to fix

271
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:59,440
and make that be different and do this or something like this with our meditation 25 of his is kind of just an

272
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,960
openness this can um allow

273
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:12,080
like things to arise and pass away without our chasing them or trying to change them or some way

274
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:17,919
and then it's only 25 percent whereas this effort to kind of like stay

275
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:23,440
focused or stay present on our experience

276
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:31,200
and often when uh with concentration practice very common to stay focused on the

277
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,799
breath the sensations of breathing or the movement

278
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:42,399
of the abdomen or often the feeling right here above the upper lip

279
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:48,640
but also the there can be focus on loving kindness some of you know this lemon kindness

280
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:54,559
practice there's a way in which the repetition and that's kind of this warm-heartedness

281
00:29:54,559 --> 00:30:01,840
really supports some samadhi as well as a third way there can be rather than a particular

282
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:08,960
object or a loving kindness a third way is maybe a little bit

283
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:14,000
more open but for an example something might be

284
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,559
just noticing the changing nature of whatever object is in our attention so

285
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:26,799
sound but really the noticing of the sound arising and passing away and

286
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:32,000
sensations in the body but really the noticing is on the

287
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,080
other the flickering a little bit they're not completely constant this third way is a little bit less common

288
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:43,679
but for some people works really well so these are the three different ways in

289
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:49,559
which we might use that 25 that's focusing

290
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,760
so one thing that i want to say is

291
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:00,799
really important maybe

292
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:07,840
i don't know if it's the most important it might be is when we talk about samadhi doing this

293
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:15,919
practice it's really important for us to pay attention to our relationship

294
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:23,679
to this practice because if somebody says the word concentration

295
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:29,919
then two things often happen and uh i've had this experience but it

296
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:36,240
wasn't in a rob berbeau he was a fantastic dormant teacher he talked about this and

297
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:41,440
he's the one who kind of put words to this this definitely is i think a lot of people's experience certainly was my

298
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,640
experience when we hear this word concentration there's a way in

299
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:53,519
this kind of our sense of practice kind of shrinks and it all becomes about measuring am i

300
00:31:53,519 --> 00:32:00,080
focused am i not focused dang it that was a thought okay i'm not focused okay i'll stay here there's kind of this this

301
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:07,440
way in which they're like here's the grind to get to somebody so this idea of measuring

302
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,840
shows up so i would say use this word

303
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:18,159
samadhi with this emphasis on the ah samadhi

304
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:25,200
that's opening and we're just moving along the spectrum towards studying

305
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,039
calming and more well-being because as soon as this measuring mind

306
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:37,600
shows up then it's there's kind of a collapsing a strong sense of self i'm not as

307
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:44,799
concentrated as i used to be yesterday i'm not as concentrated as that person sitting in front of me or that person sitting over there or whomever right all

308
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:51,360
this all this chatter starts to come up and that's not the direction we're going

309
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:56,399
so not only that not only is there this measuring

310
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:03,519
but often if we have a sense of focus we have to focus then there's also this really subtle

311
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,960
sense maybe it's obvious sense of aversion that arises

312
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:15,279
dang it i'm trying to concentrate don't those neighbors know that their dog should be quiet and you know we have

313
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:21,519
this little irritation or why is this somebody i share the house with why are they just right now decided to talk

314
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:27,760
loudly on the phone or whatever there's this aversion that creeps in if we have the sense that we have to

315
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:35,039
focus and of course right aversion is not a sense of well-being it's not a sense of receptivity so

316
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:42,799
really pay attention to the relationship and is there a way in which we can

317
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:48,320
stretch our idea of what samadhi practice is

318
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,840
i talked about these three different elements of well-being

319
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:02,000
focus and being receptive but now i'd like to stretch it even more

320
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,720
and say no matter what is happening in your samadhi practice

321
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,878
there's a way in which we can we're practicing perseverance

322
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:21,679
this is enormously helpful in our life we're practicing patience this is enormously helpful in

323
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:29,760
our lives maybe if we're focusing on well-being then we're noticing that oh i'm the mind

324
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:36,158
i was on the object and now the mind has wandered is there a way that i can come back to

325
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:41,440
the object that's with a sense of warmth and gentleness and

326
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:47,040
it has a sense of well-being like oh okay i'm just gonna come back to the breath

327
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,800
that is also enormously beneficial or we might start to notice oh yeah

328
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:59,280
there's not a sense of well-being here because i'm beating myself up because i'm not getting concentrated

329
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,720
and we might start to notice oh yeah this is what it feels like to have a judging mind

330
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:10,079
ouch it doesn't feel good so even

331
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:15,359
if you sit down and you want to be concentrate cultivating a little bit of

332
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:21,520
samadhi and you feel like samadhi is nowhere nearby that's okay too

333
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:27,440
that's okay too because what we're cultivating will be such a support for

334
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:34,160
our practice and for our daily life and this practice gets cultivated in

335
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:40,480
just the same way in which we might um gain strength you know some physical

336
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,839
strength you know by doing bicep curls right we don't get strong just by doing

337
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:52,560
a few bicep curls and we don't even notice that oh bam oh okay now i'm stronger

338
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:59,440
right it's just kind of like the repetition of doing this over and over again and it often is this settling

339
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:05,200
happens imperceptibly and i know for me sometimes i haven't

340
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:12,560
even noticed so much that the mind has gotten settled until like the bell rang i'm like

341
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:18,240
oh yeah there's a bell and it just feels nice and it's uh

342
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:24,560
arises in the meditation experience and and there's a sense of

343
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:31,760
oh yeah this is pleasant maybe i'll get up maybe i won't maybe i'll stay

344
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:40,520
so there can just be this this is quiet settling that we don't notice until the end

345
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:46,640
okay so i think i'll maybe next week talk a little bit more about

346
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,839
somebody but i wanted to introduce this idea

347
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:57,839
as one of the factors of awakening and now i'd like to open it up to some

348
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:05,280
questions if you have some questions about samadhi cultivating it the experience of

349
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,720
it maybe can we use use a microphone if

350
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:15,839
somebody has a question if you don't that's okay too but if

351
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,400
there aren't any questions

352
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:35,200
good evening diana i think uh if that's not true we might have to turn up the volume here on the

353
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:41,040
mixer you can see which is the blue microphone so if you look at that

354
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:48,320
okay is that yep yes thank you um the practice today was very nice

355
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:53,520
although all the things you had mentioned with measuring and aversion

356
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:59,760
and just comparison were all over the place and so mari i

357
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:05,280
hope i'm saying that right was nowhere near when i had i was just striving towards

358
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,640
and i was just like like oh i'm waiting for the bell to ring and i'm

359
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:18,960
like oh no that's not what i want and so i just how how can i cultivate that loving

360
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:24,240
kindness i mean i'm not supposed to say anything am i or like

361
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:31,119
uh or i mean i know there's the whole may you be at peace safe and

362
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:36,320
etc um yeah yeah so um there's a way in which with

363
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:42,960
mindfulness practice we might have this idea of like okay we just have to be with whatever arises but if you want to

364
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:50,320
do a little bit of smiley there can't be a little bit more intentional movement and i would um

365
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:56,480
there's a few things one is i'll start with it's like maybe the posture it's it's really makes a difference it

366
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:01,920
turns out if the posture if the body has some alertness it kind of allows the

367
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:07,920
body to the mind to have some alertness as well so i'll just say that's one

368
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:14,000
thing the second thing is i think one thing that's really

369
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,839
impactful maybe two things one if you see if you had this thought oh i'm just waiting for

370
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:27,440
the bell that's not what i do one thing to try is to label oh that's a thought

371
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:34,480
it doesn't have to be a problem it's just a thought our minds think and then just come back to

372
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:41,839
the anchor often the breath is the anchor i don't know if it is for you but so just to label it thought

373
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:48,560
and come back and that kind of interrupts the momentum of the thinking thinking thinking like oh i've been

374
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:54,480
thinking i don't want to be thinking the last time i wasn't thinking as much and i hope i don't think later and the bell's going to ring when is she going to ring the bell what time is it it's

375
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:00,240
got to be this time right this is the mind right our minds do this so

376
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:05,760
so just this quiet note thought can maybe interrupt that momentum and

377
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:11,760
come back the second thing is and this is not always easy but it's

378
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:17,119
something to pay attention to is to notice the

379
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:22,200
manner in which the mind come comes back to the object

380
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:29,119
is it i use this expression is it like a dang it get back here you know

381
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:35,040
and if you feel that so what's what happens is we see this

382
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:40,400
a hundred times we see this a thousand times honestly we see it many times and

383
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:47,520
then we're like you know what i this just doesn't make sense anymore and it starts to just be a little bit

384
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:54,880
softer a little bit softer so if we start to see experience notice

385
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,920
the way in which we're on the object the mind drifts away

386
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:07,359
then there's a waking up and in that moment is there cursing or is it like oh okay

387
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:13,520
i'm i've wandered and then notice how the mind comes back

388
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:18,640
can there be a gentle warm-hearted way

389
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:24,800
and this is subtle it's very subtle and it's can be a really strong habit

390
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:30,160
very strong habit to want you know like i kind of was doing this right you know to just come back with this a little bit

391
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:36,640
of uh like jerking it back a little bit of aversion so don't beat yourself up if

392
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:43,200
after you've seen it ten times a hundred times ten hundred times a thousand

393
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:50,560
ten thousand times it's something that just starts to shift so this is where kind of the repetition

394
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:55,839
of continuity of practice really comes in was that helpful very much thank you

395
00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:00,040
so much you're welcome you're welcome

396
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:13,200
thank you diana you're welcome um i attended earlier this year

397
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:19,040
retreat on the aggregates we did the aggregates and it seems to me

398
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:24,640
we've been meeting since that retreat to discuss the retreat because it just

399
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:31,838
seems so rich that there's a lot of space in

400
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:36,400
the study of the aggregates to try and

401
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:42,839
find different ways to samadhi or samadhi sort

402
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:48,240
of generically or more

403
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:54,480
i don't know it occurs more easily when you're studying the aggregates

404
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:59,839
i wondered if you had any thoughts about that

405
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:06,720
well maybe i'll say this that i won't the aggregates are different aspects of our experience

406
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:12,079
let's say that and they are a little bit more subtle

407
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:19,119
and so having to see subtle kind of like the mind has to settle in order to see subtle and it's that

408
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:24,880
tuning into the subtleness kind of creates the mind settling and i would say that's kind of what supports maybe

409
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:31,280
the samadhi and then i don't know maybe i'll start i'll stop there does that make sense that

410
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:37,599
yes thank you yeah yeah and often we can't see the aggregates unless there is some settling and the

411
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:44,160
more we're looking at him and kind of investigating playing around exploring them you know the quieter the mind has

412
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:50,160
to be well it occurred to me from that retreat and also

413
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:58,880
through this discussion of samadhi how much of this practice is really um

414
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:04,240
learning about how your mind works yes i mean it's almost like a scientific

415
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:09,359
study of the how the activity of the brain works

416
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:14,720
yes i would say that it's so much

417
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:21,119
about this is the expression is knowledge and vision so being able to understand things and see things yep

418
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:27,599
that you can't that you don't see right without this practice yeah yeah

419
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:33,760
okay okay so we're at the top of the hour here so

420
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:39,599
just uh warm wish for everybody having some well-being and some settledness and

421
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:46,880
steadiness in their lives and an appreciation for practicing together

422
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:52,240
and i'll stay up here if you other people have some other questions otherwise i wish you all a wonderful

423
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:56,599
rest of the evening thank you
