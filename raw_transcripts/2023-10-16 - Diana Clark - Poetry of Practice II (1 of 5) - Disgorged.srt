1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:08,920
good morning good morning all what a pleasure it is to be here and

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:16,480
what a warm welcome I received in the chat so thank you for that as many of you can see from the

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,400
title of the YouTube that we're going to do poetry of practice again with some different poems I was here I think it

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,359
was uh in August couple months ago doing some poetry and I had so much fun doing

5
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:34,160
that and um I heard from a number of you that you enjoyed it too so here we are

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,680
again the Poetry of practice maybe I'll start in a similar

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:46,440
way that I started with uh back in August and that is to just recognize that there is a way in which we can

8
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,680
engage with practice and we can engage

9
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,920
with the Buddhist teachings in a way that is maybe focused on

10
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,480
learning understanding and maybe learning or understanding technique or

11
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,640
teachings and right there's all these Buddhist lists right and but there's this

12
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:15,720
uh emphasis on learning like gaining something that we didn't have gaining

13
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,000
some knowledge that we didn't have and to be sure I love this way I'm I like to

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:30,560
learn new things and to uh like explore new topics but that's not the only way

15
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:37,119
right that's not the only way to engage with teachings and practice this way in which we feel like we have to consume

16
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:45,200
lots of information it can be helpful but there's also a way that invites a

17
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:51,439
another type of knowing like this way in which we might touch with awareness or

18
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:57,360
something like that there's this uh maybe a caress

19
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,000
of information a caress of something I don't even quite know how

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,879
to explain it but this way in which poetry allows this opening of the heart

21
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:16,040
and the softening of that which wants to know more and learn

22
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,760
more and maybe poetry also is like a type of coming home that is that we have

23
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:30,920
to be here and present to feel the poem to touch into the poem so the way that

24
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,959
I'm describing it poetry is maybe a little bit more of a somatic experience

25
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:44,879
and maybe even the way that I'm using that type of language is maybe like a little not so straightforward but I'm

26
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:51,879
hoping that you all of us have read poems poetry and maybe you understand what I'm talking to that there's a way

27
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:58,080
in which poetry sometimes invites this recognition recognition of something

28
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:05,000
that's true and pure inside of us as opposed to just

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,640
like amassing more information allows us to soften this always this leaning

30
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,799
into evaluation or leaning into the next moment do I understand it do I got it as

31
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:23,080
opposed to maybe the question is oh what does this feel

32
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,680
like as opposed to what am I supposed to

33
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:37,879
learn so poetry is a way that we allow language to touch us in a different way

34
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:44,200
different way than our normal way of interacting with perhaps Buddhist teachings or perhaps even just the world

35
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:52,840
in general many of you know that there's plenty of verse in the PO canon in the

36
00:03:52,840 --> 00:04:00,640
earliest Buddhist literature there's lots of verse there's the Awakening poems there's the dapada there's this

37
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:08,159
ATA the book of eights the suata you know all all these and so

38
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,519
today I'll drop in some vers is from contemporary

39
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:20,519
times I'll drop in some during our sit and then during the little daret um

40
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:26,919
maybe unpack it a little bit what this uh poem means and I'm

41
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:34,000
delighted to share these with you not necessarily because all of you will love these poems but hopefully just with the

42
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,320
introduction of poetry itself is a pointing towards there's different ways

43
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:47,380
different ways of being with our experience different ways of being with

44
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:54,680
[Music] information and we can use all these ways to support our

45
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,560
practice okay with that isn't

46
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,599
introduction and just take a moment to really settle

47
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,000
in maybe a large exhale as

48
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,400
we sit whether that's literal or figurative

49
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,120
that we take a meditation

50
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:36,720
posture and perhaps feel these sensations of

51
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:49,759
sitting feel the pressure of the chair cushion the couch the bed whatever

52
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:55,360
you're sitting on feeling the pressure against the

53
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:01,479
body feeling the body in cont

54
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:25,120
we're here connected

55
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:31,400
grounded just here

56
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:40,440
can we feel the sensations on the back of our legs that are in

57
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:47,759
contact our feet that are in

58
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:56,960
contact in the sensations on the back if we're leaning against a the back of a

59
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:03,639
chair feel the sensations on the back side where we're

60
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,360
sitting bringing an aliveness of

61
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,879
attention to this experience of being connected to whatever it is we're

62
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:37,159
sitting on and connected to

63
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:53,879
here can we bring some mindfulness into the bodily

64
00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:02,759
experience inhabiting the body with presence with

65
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:11,120
aliveness alive to the body and the way it feels right

66
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:34,680
now and then setting the sense of direction the

67
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:41,120
orientation of this meditation is one of

68
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,120
kindness kindness to

69
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:57,519
ourselves and openness to the

70
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,200
experience as best we can

71
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:11,800
can if you work with chronic pain or acute pain at this

72
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:21,839
moment is there a mutual or pleasant experience you can rest your attention

73
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,959
on rather than the

74
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:36,360
uncomfortable not deny not pretending that the uncomfortable isn't there just

75
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:43,360
choosing as best we can to rest our attention

76
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:50,200
elsewhere maybe it is the pressure against the buttocks as we're sitting

77
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,560
that's

78
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,120
neutral and tangible

79
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:13,079
holding yourself in care holding yourself with a kind

80
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:16,360
attitude with

81
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
warmth

82
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,959
so we're here with an attitude of

83
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:48,839
care and then rest your attention on the sensations of

84
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:57,240
breathing feeling the bodily experience of inhales and

85
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
exhales

86
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:11,519
feeling the stretching and the release of the

87
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:24,720
stretch that occurs with

88
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
breathing

89
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:55,959
tuning into coming sensitive to the experience of

90
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
breathing

91
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:11,680
the movements in the body as the body

92
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
breathes

93
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:56,279
feeling the beginning middle and end of an

94
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
inhale

95
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:43,519
feel the beginning middle and end of an

96
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
exhale

97
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:51,120
and feeling the transitions between inhales and

98
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
exhales

99
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:24,720
when the mind wanders we don't have to make it a

100
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:31,920
problem we just very simply gently Begin

101
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
Again

102
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,600
I'm going to drop in a

103
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:47,640
poem you don't have to do anything with this

104
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:55,520
poem allow it to be

105
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:02,960
received I don't have to try to understand it

106
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:10,120
or apply it just hear

107
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:21,080
it this is about somebody going their experience

108
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,000
and a Meditation

109
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:33,640
Retreat when I first floundered in no one knew

110
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:40,480
me not even myself staggering under a Saratoga trunk

111
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:47,400
crammed with humiliations bottled like urine samples nail cakes of anger

112
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:54,480
carbons of abusive letters chemistry quizzes with FS even the horse I never

113
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,799
had and two casseroles left over from the diam dip

114
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:04,880
supper no one remarked that I had brought too

115
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,720
much I was wearing three fur hats donated by opulent cousins my feet

116
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:18,400
encased in cement ever since the failure of the patio project and my mouth full

117
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:26,760
of barbs as an old trout no one praised my

118
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:33,640
appearance the trunk fell off my back disgorging

119
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:42,039
its unusual contents at my stone feet which also came off the fur hats tumbled like a moth

120
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:48,320
eaten Avalanche burying a small monk no one

121
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,480
noticed no

122
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,080
one now no

123
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:33,480
one I'll read it

124
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:41,440
again when I first floundered in no one knew me not even

125
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:47,919
myself staggering under a Saratoga trunk crammed with humiliations bottled like

126
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:54,440
urine samples nail cakes of anger carbons of abuse of letters chemistry

127
00:24:54,440 --> 00:25:00,480
quizzes with FS even the horse I never had and two casseroles left over from

128
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,360
the diip supper no one remarked that I had brought too

129

130
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,480

131

eaten Avalanche burying a small monk no one noticed no

135
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,679
one

136
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,440
for

137
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:59,260
[Music]

138
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:08,380
[Music]

139
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:29,240
[Music] for

140
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:43,440
so for those of you we're here for the poem this called zazen by Virginia

141
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:49,760
Hamilton Adair again that's zazen by Virginia Hamilton

142
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:56,360
Adair and um I don't know if you can hear this I have this background noise going on I'm just G to close my door

143
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,960
here for a moment I'll be right

144
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,159
back

145
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:55,799
okay sorry that I had to make that sound go

146
00:31:55,799 --> 00:32:00,919
away so the this poem some of you who have

147
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:07,440
um listened to some of the like happy hour I've done or some of Dhat talks or

148
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,519
path of fearlessness know that um I I really enjoy poems that have a certain

149
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:19,159
amount of Whimsy to them and that are really uh a lot of imagery in them so I

150
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:24,240
think that's part of the power of poems is right is they're not being explicit

151
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:33,159
but they're pointing to something that um we can feel or imagine or you know a

152
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:40,039
different way of understanding something so this poem zazen by Virginia

153
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:45,279
Hamilton Adair is uh describing a meditation you

154
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:52,240
know maybe it's a day long or a retreat or something and uh it seems like there's so many wonderful and the the

155
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:58,880
poet is using like so many wonderful uh like image images here

156
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,960
and maybe I'll um just I'll begin by reading it

157
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:11,120
again when I first floundered in no one knew me not even

158
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:17,200
myself staggering under a Saratoga trunk crammed with humiliations bottled like

159
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:23,639
urine samples nail cakes of anger carbons of abusive letters chemistry

160
00:33:23,639 --> 00:33:29,639
quizzes with EPS even the horse I never had and two casseres left over from the

161
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:34,919
diamond dip supper no one remarked that I had brought too

162
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:40,519
much I was wearing three fur hats donated by opulent cousins my feet

163
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:45,760
encased in cement ever since the failure of the patio project and my mouth full

164
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:54,559
of barbs as an old trout no one praised my appearance the trunk fell off my back

165
00:33:54,559 --> 00:34:01,480
discouraging its unusual contents at my stone feet which also came off the fur

166
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:07,240
hats tumbled like a moth eaten Avalanche burying a small monk no one

167
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:13,040
noticed no one I kind of like this unconventional

168
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:20,240
but like evocative imagery that's used here and for example like the

169
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:27,200
poet she uses this first line is like when I first floundered in this like

170
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:33,200
floundered in this clumsily maybe with some confusion like some staggering and

171
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:40,000
makes me reminds me of when I first came to a meditation hole like I really didn't know what to expect what was do

172
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,960
what was happening and kind of like you know what I was supposed to do and may there maybe there's a way

173
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:51,079
that uh we feel that way with our own meditation practice or even if we go to

174
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:57,720
meditation centers or the med meditation Retreats we feel like okay is there like a protocol here here that I'm supposed

175
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,520
to follow I feel a bit

176
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:09,440
awkward and then um the poet she also writes no one knew me not even

177
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:15,359
myself oh I just love this line because such a big part of meditation practice

178
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:22,119
is a self- understanding for example like I had no idea how much planning I

179
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:29,920
did when I until I started meditation practice and I just saw what was going on in my my mind and then then as I you

180
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:36,599
know continued with meditation practice I discovered that probably like underneath all this planning was some

181
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:42,839
fear you know I couldn't even necessarily tell you exactly what the fear was about but I just knew that I

182
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:52,000
had to be prepared just in case maybe I didn't have confidence that I could handle whatever it was that was going to

183
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:58,240
happen and like I just this is for me part of the power of poetry that just a

184
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:03,400
few lines can be really evocative of so much because also we might understand

185
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:10,640
this line no one knew me not even myself is this recognition that sometimes you

186
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,800
know that meditation centers or can't be initially like this really warm

187
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:22,520
welcoming place maybe some are maybe some aren't if they're filled with some shy

188
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:29,400
introverts or if you come a little bit late and some people maybe not late but maybe not too early and some people are

189
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:36,079
already meditating so they're sitting there with their eyes closed and so there's a way in which you

190
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:41,720
just come in and you kind of like is this okay and for some people and certainly

191
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:48,960
for some communities this is can be really off-putting this sense of just going into a meditation Hall meditation

192
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:55,720
space and there isn't necessarily warm welcoming and then the poet she

193
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:02,599
continues staggering under a Saratoga trunk crammed with and then she gives this big

194
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:08,560
long list of things right it's true we bring baggage

195
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:14,079
wherever we go whether we realize we're doing it or not there's this kind like heaviness

196
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:20,800
that can follow us and she puts this uh long list um Som

197
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,040
of what I kind of like is these carbons of abusive letters like you know these

198
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:32,000
things we keep copies of things that are painful harmful you might even use the

199
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,079
word trauma here like these are carbon copies they aren't the original things

200
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:43,720
but there's these carbon copies that were keeping with us you know I don't know exactly when

201
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:48,960
this uh poem was written but uh again those of you probably many of you

202
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:55,000
remember right we used to use carbon paper and type on things to keep a copy and it was the carbons are always a

203
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:01,920
little bit fuzzy not quite as clear I mean they were obviously carbon and they were on a different piece of paper so

204
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:09,000
this recognition that it's not the original harm but a copy of it that

205
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,400
we're carrying with us and these chemistry quizzes with FS

206
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:20,960
that the poet is also bringing yeah right the things that um

207
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:28,160
happened to us when we're young I was just sharing with some friends recently that

208
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:35,800
when I was um I don't know maybe 11 years old or something that uh I wanted to sign up for choir practice or chorus

209
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:43,160
you know at the my school because my friends were and the chorus teacher asked me d

210
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:49,319
uh maybe you can just mouth the words because my voice I don't I don't

211
00:38:49,319 --> 00:38:55,400
know how to carry it to it's just not possible for me and then this shows up when I'm

212
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,640
starting to begin a Meditation Retreat and I'm supposed to be leading the chant and I have a microphone on and

213
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:06,680
everybody's going to be hearing me chanting I feel like oh yeah this little voice that like Dan you're not a very

214
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:12,480
good uh V chanter or singer or something like this so these things that we carry

215
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,640
around with us that are extra he

216
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,000
extra but uh I appreciate that the PO concludes like no one remarked that I

217
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,480
had brought too much well maybe there's no nobody's talking at all or maybe they

218
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:35,000
didn't see what she had brought or maybe they saw but wasn't saying

219
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:42,280
anything there's a way in which this can be helpful but it also can be a little bit disconcerting like doesn't anybody

220
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:49,680
ackowledge what's happening here and so we might say that there's a

221
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:55,079
sense of progress or a sense of uh movement during this uh poem because

222
00:39:55,079 --> 00:40:00,800
first is like the arriv and then maybe it's the sense of

223
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:07,480
practicing she the poet writes as wearing three fur hats donated by

224
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:14,920
opulent cousins for me I'm thinking like these are things that you know our family kind like puts on us expectations

225
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:20,400
they have or things that they think we like or oh you're the one you're the

226
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,920
smart one you're the funny one you're the dumb one you're the silly one you

227
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:32,920
know like these things that kind of like family gives to us maybe I'm reading too much into this poem but there can be a

228
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:39,359
way in which um what we are carrying what we're holding with us or things that family

229
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:45,079
has given us then she the

230
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:52,359
poet again Virginia Hamilton Adair she continues my feet incased in cement ever

231
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:59,480
since the failure of the patio project right the sense of stuckness we get when

232
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:05,560
we have a sense of failure and then she also says in my mouth full of barbs says

233
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:11,800
an old trout might even say maybe she's doing a

234
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:16,920
little bit of body scanny right she's talking about her head

235
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:23,800
hats the mouth full of barbs and feet encased in

236
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:29,680
cement and full of barbs as an old trout right this is trout they take the bait

237
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:37,400
and then they get caught so what are the things that we do to take bait that we get caught CAU

238
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:43,400
with and then there's this sense of shame or inadequacy that's part of this

239
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:48,440
uh poem sense of not being good enough

240
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:54,280
right there's nothing in this poem where she's feeling comfortable or at ease or

241
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:59,319
with warmth towards herself this sense of lack this sense of

242
00:41:59,319 --> 00:42:05,040
inadequate inadequacy often drives a real strong sense of seeking that shows

243
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:10,720
up in our spiritual practice convinced that the sense of lack this moment is

244
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:16,480
lacking this self is lacking so we're always like spilling over into the next

245
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:24,079
moment that holds the promise of somehow being better more

246
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:32,000
satisfying and then the part describes the trunk

247
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:39,640
fell off my back dis gorging its unusual contents disgorging what a fantastic

248
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:45,960
verb like this discharging this expelling this emitting which isn't

249
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:53,720
smooth or effortless like this letting go that happens often is something that's

250
00:42:53,720 --> 00:43:00,520
uh not easy not straightforward and part of what's

251
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:08,400
getting discouraged are these identities for her maybe I'm the one who

252
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:16,040
doesn't do well in chemistry I'm the one who failed the patio project and meditation in some ways is a

253
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:23,119
purification practice maybe an extraction practice where the removal of everything that's extra and part of

254
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:29,480
what's extra are the ways that we identify with what's happened to us in the past and

255
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:36,160
limit ourselves with these types of ideas and to be sure these moments of

256
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:43,400
Freedom can feel like an unburdening discouraging the Saratoga

257
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:48,480
trunk falling off our back

258
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:54,079
like the lightning and then lastly I'll

259
00:43:54,079 --> 00:44:01,079
close with this use of the poet using this word no

260
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:07,079
one no one knew me not even myself no one remarked that I had

261
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:13,720
brought too much no one praised my appearance no one

262
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:19,280
noticed and then she ends just with no

263
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:27,079
one recognition that not even she was there

264
00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:34,720
no one there's not a self there aren't we have all these identities that we take up but part of this practice this

265
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:42,680
discouraging if you will this purification you will is a letting go of these selves that we create and

266
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:47,200
feel so much like we have to bolster and support and

267
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:54,319
defend so this poem zazen by Virginia Hamilton

268
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:59,480
Adair just for me just brings a sense of delight and I hope maybe it did for you

269
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:07,040
today for you this morning and maybe you can bring this sense of delight with you as you go throughout your day thank you

270
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:12,880
very much for joining me this morning and I'll see you tomorrow thank

271
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,280
you
