1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,399
okay nice to see the new year wishes shall we uh go ahead and get

2
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:14,599
started with what we all do together it's new year but what we share is this

3
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:19,720
meditation practice so I feel like we should just

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:25,519
jump right in and we'll talk afterwards so as you're

5
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:31,080
arriving please uh find a posture where you'll be comfortable for

6
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:38,879
a little while and settle in so that we can start off this year with some really good

7
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:45,840
energy among ourselves and sending out into this world that needs it so

8
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,800
much if you're comfortable doing so I invite you to close your

9
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,800
eyes allow your attention to come

10
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:06,640
inward settle ing back from the screen finding a balanced and

11
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,159
upright or if you're lying down a straight back

12
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:24,560
posture maybe really sensing your feeling of

13
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,520
presence almost rootedness like where your body is placed your seat on the

14
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,758
chair or the

15
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,600
cushion having a sense of groundedness of stability

16
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:51,880
connection to the room that you're in or the place that you're

17
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,320
in just being here

18
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:12,640
and then from that place of clear presence softening softening the

19
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,440
face softening the

20
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:31,840
shoulders the [Music] arms down through the Torso and the

21
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,040
belly softening even in the legs and the

22
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:50,599
feet so inviting a sense of clarity and presence that is at ease

23
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:54,159
in some way

24
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:16,840
and then inviting ease also in the mind so letting the mind be at

25
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,480
rest be okay with the condition of the

26
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,040
body with the conditions of the environment maybe it's chilly maybe

27
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,560
there's some

28
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:42,080
sound but it's okay we're

29
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,519
here so you may notice that it took a little bit of energy or effort to orient

30
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:07,480
the Mind collect it bring it here maybe still some effort is needed to

31
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:13,879
be stable or willing to be

32
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,680
present but as you find your

33
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:26,320
balance maybe tuning into the breath or

34
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:33,479
sounds Sensations in the body some simple anchor that can keep you

35
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,479
present maybe it starts to feel like there's a little bit of

36
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,639
momentum maybe you can begin to feel

37
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,759
like it's more like being on a skateboard or a bicycle

38
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,960
and as things get slightly out of balance you just add a little bit you

39
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:11,360
know you move to the right or the left or you push again on the

40
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:21,240
skateboard but generally the motion is already happening we just do enough to

41
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:36,280
rebalance so sit quietly for a few minutes now with this intention of

42
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:42,120
seeing if we can establish some momentum and then get into a position where what

43
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,600
we're mostly doing is rebalancing the mind

44
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,560
for

45
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
for

46
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,479
for for

47
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,560
the art of learning to rebalance the

48
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:22,640
mind has to do with noticing in what ways it tends to fall

49
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:29,760
away from the present moment at this time cuz sometimes that's different

50
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,640
you know on a given day the Mind might be really obsessed with the

51
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:41,759
future thinking about what's going to happen tomorrow what do I need to

52
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,680
do so then you set up a little check in the mind okay every time I'm thinking

53
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:54,000
about the future I need to watch when the mind starts going that way and then I'll

54
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,279
bring it back other times the mind is

55
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:09,040
get concerned with the future but it's more with that pain in my rib cage

56
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:14,600
today and then we have to watch when the mind starts going in that direction so

57
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:22,200
it's very situational very attuned to how things are

58
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,279
now so how's your mind right now today

59
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:37,480
what are its top three ways of being

60
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:45,800
distracted can we notice those when they just start and rebalance

61
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:47,860
[Music]

62
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:02,079
for

63
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:44,560
if the distractions of the Mind are not seen as

64
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:51,000
problematic but instead seen as normal opportunities to

65
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,480
rebalance it can be really enjoyable to just Cruise along with the

66
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:03,360
mind like riding a bike through different kinds of

67
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:09,160
terrain sometimes we're pedaling harder sometimes not as hard sometimes there's

68
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:16,440
gravel sometimes it's smooth and it's all just part of the bike

69
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:31,959
ride for

70
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:26,679
and as we find that we've gotten the hang of being present with the mind as it's

71
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:30,720
just starting to drift off

72
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:41,000
we might have the feeling that we could back off from any

73
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:49,919
doing any sense that we need to be managing even actively

74
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,919
rebalancing the Mind feels more like a ball rolling downhill or a stream

75
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,720
flowing toward the

76
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:11,840
ocean you can release some doing and trust that the mind will be

77
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:18,080
with the unfolding of experience maybe it will still drift off

78
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:25,720
but somehow it will naturally come back the way a stream may move back and

79
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:30,639
forth but is always flowing down toward the

80
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:41,679
ocean so seeing seeing what it's like to let go of some of the doing of

81
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
meditation

82
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,559
for for

83
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

84
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
for

85
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
for

86
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
for

87
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,360
e for

88
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:58,200
so noticing how is the mind now

89
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:07,720
has there been an effect [Music] from letting go of some of the

90
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,679
management of

91
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:20,440
it maybe that meant it drifted off a bit more or maybe

92
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:28,600
not and maybe there was a different feeling in it to not be continually managed

93
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:33,960
by the cognitive mind there's something of an art to

94
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:42,399
interacting with the mind how much energy or effort we put

95
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:50,039
into working with it so to speak so just noticing that there is

96
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:57,000
that range and there is that effect sensing how it was for you today

97
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,240
in this meditation

98
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,840
and as we are going to be coming out in a couple of

99
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:29,520
minutes and then after that moving into our lives

100
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:35,919
that's also a time when sometimes we're very active

101
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:43,320
in staying present being with the situation actively seeking to shape it

102
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:49,840
in some way and then there are other times where we're more just letting it

103
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,919
unfold still present but with a very light

104
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:02,919
touch having some trust in the unfold of it or otherwise sensing

105
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:09,880
that we don't need to be so active this is also an art

106
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:15,760
form and it also has an effect on situations when we're trying to manage

107
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:23,519
them versus not other people too so considering as we go

108
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:32,000
out May the way that I bring energy into my interactions into my work into the

109
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,039
tasks I do for Others May that energy

110
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:43,919
be rebalancing may it be helpful

111
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:53,039
beneficial just the right [Music] amount that things are kept flowing but

112
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:57,720
not over contr controlled

113
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:03,320
with the wish that that helps things to go smoothly and helps other people to

114
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:10,440
feel welcome and connected so that our

115
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:15,320
presence is a joy and a benefit in the

116
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:22,440
world and can bring goodness to this world

117
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,000
Okay so Happy New Year to everyone in the way

118
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,039
that we measure time very nice to be joining you with

119
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:13,799
this outset of 2025 but we're also right in the middle

120
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:20,440
of our week of talking about uh letting go and cultivation and specifically some of the

121
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:25,760
Dharma topics that support doing these actions

122
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:31,679
effectively so we've noted earlier how these are not opposites they're not

123
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:38,480
opposites but they're actually intertwined letting go in cultivation or intertwined almost like two sides of the

124
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:44,000
same hand right um and we've also talked about some internal factors that can

125
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:52,159
help any of them either of them to succeed we talked yesterday about willingness capacity and knowhow as

126
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:58,919
three important components in in our efforts to let go and to cultivate

127
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:05,799
So today we're going to look at the topic of wise effort or right effort which is not about right and wrong um

128
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:13,960
but it's really more about uh Effectiveness or appropriateness of the effort or energy that we bring to our

129
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:21,240
lives to our endeavors and it's a very important factor this is actually the sixth factor

130
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:26,919
of the eight-fold path so the Buddha singled it out as an important area for

131
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:31,960
investigation it's quite integral to both our practice on the cushion and to

132
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:39,279
our everyday life uh sometimes it's a little bit of a uh I don't know people feel a little bit

133
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:44,480
down when they hear this topic of effort because it's been associated with other

134
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:51,200
things in their lives but um hang in there there's some uh interesting sides

135
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:57,639
to it all along the path actually were accompanied by this issue of effort and

136
00:31:57,639 --> 00:32:03,399
the teachings on it tend to focus on what we're doing and what we're making

137
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:08,519
an effort to do which fits in perfectly with our topic actually um the

138
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:14,840
definition of wise effort on the eight-fold path is to let go of and if

139
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:21,039
possible prevent UNH wholesome mind States and also to cultivate and if

140
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:27,159
possible to maintain wholesome mind States so it's totally about this uh

141
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:32,679
theme we have of how can we let go of what's UNH wholesome and cultivate what's

142
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:39,080
wholesome but an equally important Dimension is how much effort we need to

143
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:45,000
apply in any given situation and that's a little bit more what I want to focus on

144
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,039
today um in our and I and I there's a a

145
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:55,600
kind of a a reason for that there's a wide range of efforts that are talked

146
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:01,279
about in the Buddhist discourses and I hope maybe uh what I say today will

147
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:10,399
expand the range um in your understanding of how the budha talked about effort or energy in our in our

148
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:16,120
life so many of us have had introductory meditation instructions you know where

149
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:23,279
we go and take an introductory course or start working with a group or a teacher

150
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:30,240
and most often here in the west those instructions will encourage relaxation

151
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:36,919
ease acceptance words like this um and actually you know we can practice just

152
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:42,080
with those for a very long time so these are W these are important instructions

153
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:47,279
to start with often because we're very you know driven or ere efforting in

154
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:53,760
certain ways and so it's like okay let's just start with ease with acceptance

155
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:58,919
with being still um and that's good

156
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:06,639
and yet we also know from our own experience I think that it does take some effort or energy even to accomplish

157
00:34:06,639 --> 00:34:14,440
relaxation right if we sit down and do nothing while we're sitting uh we'll probably think for the whole session and

158
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:19,560
the mind will become tired or agitated from that thinking is actually pretty

159
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:27,280
energetic and tiring so we have to put in some kind of well-directed effort in order that the mind can settle

160
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:33,919
down and find ease so even with that first instruction we find that there's

161
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:39,040
some subtlety to this issue of effort or energy and we'll need to put in some

162
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:44,240
kind of effort in order to settle down and experience the deeper benefits of

163
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:52,440
meditation so when should we ease up and when should we bring in energy and to relate it to this turning

164
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:57,760
of the New Year how can we apply ourselves appropriately to any change

165
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:03,800
that we might wish to make in our lives so I hope we can set aside maybe

166
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:09,240
our associations with this word effort about pushing or striving or what a

167
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:14,599
teacher told us in school one time to make more effort or something um and

168
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:21,119
let's try to kind of take a a fresh start on it a fresh start for the for the new

169
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:27,240
year so what I want to do is walk through several quotes from the

170
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:34,440
discourse of the Buddha that span a wide range about what he said on effort so

171
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:40,920
that'll maybe give us the idea first of all that there is a wide range but also that he didn't teach uniformally about

172
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:47,040
this topic there's a lot of different ways that he did depending on the context depending on the person

173
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:54,400
depending on the situation so I hope it will spark some reflection and a sense that there's a

174
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:00,599
need for discernment in this area so um some of what I'll say applies

175
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:07,960
specifically to sitting practice but some of it also applies to the to the Practical wider world that we live in

176
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:15,800
and anyway what we do on the cushion of course influences how we act in the rest of our life so we're starting at one end of a

177
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:22,760
spectrum um so we'll start with the end of applying more effort and a lot of

178
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:28,839
effort in fact there's probably no way to study the early Buddhist teachings

179
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:35,599
without hearing that there is a strong EAS emphasis on making effort so the the

180
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:41,599
qualities and factors of effort and energy um appear in the most lists that

181
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:49,319
the Buddha um gave So This this term Vira or some similar term uh appears the

182
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:55,560
most often in the various common lists that he taught and so about the Buddhist own

183
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:01,040
quest for awakening he made this declaration I want to read

184
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:08,240
it gladly would I let the flesh and blood in my body dry up leaving just the

185
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:13,800
skin tendons and bones but if I have not attained what can be reached through

186
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:20,880
human firmness human persistence human striving there will be no relaxing of my

187
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:26,319
persistence from this heedfulness of Mind was attained Awakening from this

188
00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:35,680
heedfulness of mind was attained the unexcelled freedom from bondage okay so that's quite powerful

189
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:42,040
language um maybe at the top level we could say that the instruction to relax

190
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:47,800
and accept Everything Is Not the Only instruction um but of course this degree

191
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,880
of striving that the Buddhist talking about here is quite extreme and you know

192
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,960
we wouldn't do that on an ordinary everyday basis but but you may recall

193
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:05,720
that there maybe you've encountered times in practice where there were very strong physical Sensations or very

194
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:11,240
strong emotions coming and we did have to bring forth a pretty strong effort of

195
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:18,079
attention in order to meet them mindfully maybe we weren't able to in that moment but I can think of times

196
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:24,640
where I had just enough capacity that I could I could with maximum effort meet

197
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:31,880
what was arising that was pretty strong and powerful and that felt really good you know it actually felt like yeah I've

198
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:38,400
got some strength of attention here and I'm just going to be with this and it's like oh and you feel the the power of

199
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:44,079
that and the way that it slowly transforms what's there uh or we can it

200
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:50,640
can be the other way we could be caught by a powerful wave of sleepiness or toror and the mind is really fading and

201
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:57,240
there's a sense of no I'm I really want to stay awake I really want to stay present I had a time on a retreat where

202
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:03,040
I was falling asleep every day after lunch it's fairly common but for some reason

203
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:09,400
on that Retreat I was very determined that I wasn't going to fall asleep and so I stood up uh during about halfway

204
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:15,440
through each of the after lunch meditations I stood up and I felt very

205
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,640
tired it was took effort actually to bother to move my body to stand up but I

206
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:26,359
felt like that was what I wanted to do really wanted to stay awake so there are

207
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:32,440
times where we bring for forth a fair amount of effort and it feels good feels right for that

208
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:39,280
moment so that's one end of the spectrum it is there in the teachings and then there's also a broad

209
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:45,040
middle range where the Buddha talks about balanced effort and many of you

210
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:54,079
may have heard a suta called the Sona suta where he's teaching a monk named Sona and um poor Sona had been doing

211
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:59,520
such vigorous walking meditation that his feet were bleeding he' walked and walked and walked and

212
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:06,760
walked cuz that's what he thought practice was about and his he cut his feet on the ground and um the Buddha

213
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:12,800
teaches him that it's about uh tuning his effort like one would tune a musical

214
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:19,800
instrument cuz Sona had been a musician before you know he said if the strings are too taut can you play your

215
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:27,400
instrument and Sona says oh no I can't it sounds terrible says well and if the strings are too loose can you play it no

216
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:34,880
that also doesn't work so the Buddha says right we have to tune our efforts so that our mind will be in tune and

217
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:40,800
playable like an instrument and so then we have to put in the right amount of persistence not too

218
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:47,079
much but not too slack and then of course Zona finds that balance and and

219
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:54,400
finds Awakening so there is that um there is that need for balance and then another

220
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,920
image he gives for the balance is a Goldsmith or to purify gold so from time

221
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:05,560
to time he blows on the fire so that it revs up sometimes he sprinkles water on

222
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:10,680
the fire so it cools down and sometimes he it looks fine and so he just watches

223
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:16,880
the gold purifying and it's the same way with our mind that's what I was encouraging in the meditation is to kind

224
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:23,040
of watch how the mind goes off and do what needs to be done to rebalance it so

225
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:31,560
there are a lot of teachings also about balanced effort so that message is more like the effort

226
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:38,599
is not formulaic or uniform we need to apply sometimes more sometimes less

227
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:46,599
always looking toward the balance point but then there is yet another

228
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:52,079
farther out on the Spectrum the other end of the spectrum sometimes it's appropriate to

229
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:58,319
apply no effort at all that any effort would be uh disrupt dtive to the

230
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:03,800
practice so I want to read a very interesting verse from one

231
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:10,119
discourse the Buddha says one Insight is that effort is the

232
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:15,480
basis of all suffering the other Insight is that by the complete Cooling and

233
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:21,319
cessation of effort no more suffering is produced every form of suffering grows

234
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:27,280
out of effort eradicate effort and no more suffering is produced

235
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:35,440
wow right obviously that's not a general instruction and it's in a specific context that he says that um this word

236
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:41,559
that's being translated as effort um pbod translates as instigation it refers

237
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:46,800
to the kind of inception of energy the movement toward doing something and this

238
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:54,280
word that is translated here as suffering is of course Dua but duka can also just mean stress so we could say

239
00:42:54,280 --> 00:43:00,920
one Insight is that uh moving toward doing something creates

240
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:07,079
stress and by we by the complete sensation of the movement toward doing

241
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:12,319
anything no stress will be produced right so there are times in

242
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:17,640
practice not all the time but times where things are flowing along so

243
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:24,440
smoothly or in meditation the mind gets so still that any movement creates a

244
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:29,720
little bit of tension any effort to do anything introduces a little bit of

245
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:37,440
strain a little bit of duka and so in that case the mind will actually let go of intention itself which is a very deep

246
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:45,520
kind of surrender so maybe we've come full circle and relax and accept is actually

247
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:51,240
the deepest instruction as well as the initial top level

248
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:56,400
instruction so the teachings on effort span this

249
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:01,599
amazing r right from unremitting striving human

250
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:06,839
striving such that Awakening can be achieved through balancing our effort

251
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:15,480
all the way through don't do anything if you do anything it's going to disrupt this flow this perfect smooth

252
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:22,160
balance so there's a need for wisdom then in how we apply effort and how much

253
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:28,079
particularly so I hope this maybe is an inspiration to

254
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:33,839
um being inspired to really tune in and listen to our own mind and body at a

255
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:39,079
given moment we have to look all the time where are we at what's going on

256
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:47,160
with me and with the surroundings how much effort is needed how much energy should I put forth to be present or to

257
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:52,440
change what's happening or to redirect my mind well maybe I don't need to at

258
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:58,000
all maybe trying to do all that is just going to mess it up and I should just let things

259
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:04,319
flow so um this also points us eventually

260
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:09,720
toward something that points away from our s you know there's sort of less and

261
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:17,760
less emphasis on personal effort where we need to sort of consciously manage everything and more a sense of intuition

262
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:25,640
of okay what needs to come forth here or what shouldn't come forth maybe everything's unfolding just as it should

263
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:32,920
life doesn't necessarily unfold because we are doing it it's actually already unfolding the question is what we're

264
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:40,319
doing in response to that how we're being with that you're already on the river what are you doing with the ore in

265
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:46,240
your boat that's the question we're not creating that flow we're being with it

266
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:53,200
in a certain way so in a sense the fruit of learning balanced effort is

267
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:59,319
forgetting about effort um it's kind of like when we learn a skill or a craft at

268
00:45:59,319 --> 00:46:05,280
first we are painfully deliberate making sure we do each

269
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,839
movement with our conscious will and then later it flows naturally without we

270
00:46:10,839 --> 00:46:15,880
really having the sense that we're doing it even though we are doing

271
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:21,200
things so this is not necessarily easy or simple but it is something that comes

272
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:30,319
about through this um clear seeing of how we are okay so to wrap up um it's

273
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:36,359
clear that the appropriate amount of effort could be seen as an act of wisdom that's what I've been pointing toward

274
00:46:36,359 --> 00:46:42,000
but as a preview for tomorrow we could also see uh this balanced effort and

275
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:48,119
this appropriate effort as an act of care love and compassion and kindness

276
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:53,720
are related to how much effort we're putting forth all of these are behind

277
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:59,119
acting skillfully so tomorrow we'll talk a little bit more about the uh the

278
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:05,280
affective side the heart side of our efforts to let go and to cultivate in

279
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:12,000
the new year so I hope to see you then be well
