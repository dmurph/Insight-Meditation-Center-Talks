1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,759
okay so welcome welcome to our third day on talking about our working with the

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:15,920
inner critic and today I'm going to start I just want to talk a little bit about

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:22,720
thoughts and in the guided meditation we're going to turn towards thoughts we're going to work with thoughts and uh

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,560
and I'll talk about it some more in the daret afterwards and there's this way in

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,640
which if we um turn towards thoughts instead of just thinking like oh this

6
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:40,280
thing is annoying get out of here I'm trying to meditate which let's face it sometimes that is our attitude we have

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:46,160
this like oh shoot why are you here you know there's this tone of um them not

8
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:53,760
being welcome but when we are willing to like turn towards thoughts acknowledge them

9
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,359
and I'm like okay come on in you might as well be part of the mindfulness practice because you're here anyway if

10
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:08,880
we have that kind of like you know turning towards them and inviting them in there's this way in which that we are

11
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:16,119
honoring thoughts we are respecting thoughts we are being inclusive by when

12
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:22,200
we bring awareness to this common everyday experience of

13
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:29,560
thoughts and we all know it's such a big part of our experience but there's this way in which

14
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:36,240
we are honoring its nature or somehow dignifying their presence because they

15
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,240
are here and it becomes a gateway to our

16
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,640
immediate experience there's just another thing we can become aware of and in that way you

17
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,320
can just uh highlight the present moment experience and no longer be um lost by

18
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:02,399
them no longer be pushed around by them so so there's this way in which we

19
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,679
can just invite in our our awareness or maybe I should say the word uh receive

20
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:14,239
the thoughts because they are already there we don't have to try to um make

21
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,879
our experience be different than how it is and there's this way in just shifting

22
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:26,560
our attitude towards thoughts is enormously powerful just

23
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,080
shifting our attitude from please get a go away to

24
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,120
like oh hello there you are come on in right it's very uh different so there's

25
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:46,159
lots of uh instructions that we often give um on meditation Retreats or here at 7 a or you know if we're going to do

26
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:53,239
some teaching of the introduction to mindfulness but maybe right here I'll

27
00:02:53,239 --> 00:03:01,519
say there's um two different ways in which we can think about thoughts and one is the experience of thinking

28
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:09,319
so like what does it feel like to have a thought is it constrictive or do we feel like we're getting um just lost and

29
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:14,560
carried away by them but they experience the felt sense

30
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,000
and then the second way is to notice the there's a

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,680
theme is there planning fantasizing

32
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,760
remembering ruminating then of course

33
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:39,159
judging so one just the experience and two just to notice the theme we don't

34
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:44,840
have to get concerned with the exact content but just noticing if there's a

35
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:51,280
theme and that's what we'll start with uh in this guided

36
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:59,360
meditation [Music] so to begin with our meditation this

37
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:07,599
morning just tuning into the bodily experience

38
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,159
as it is right

39
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,959
now how does the body [Music]

40
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:25,400
feel we can begin with a global assessment does it

41
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,639
feel energized or is it low energy

42
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:38,000
is there a sense of okayness or even well-being is there or is there a sense

43
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,240
of General kind of discomfort or

44
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:52,400
disease however it might be can we just tune in and acknowledge and maybe even

45
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,759
bow to it like yep it's like this right

46
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:04,600
now the bodily experience is like this right

47
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:29,840
now and then noticing that the body is breathing

48
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:38,039
the body breathes itself of course it does you don't have to do anything

49
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:47,639
intentionally so tuning into becoming sensitive to the experience of

50
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:57,360
breathing that is the bodily experience of breathing like how does it feel to

51
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,639
breathe

52
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:18,520
and then for just a few breaths not all of them just a

53
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:25,880
few we're going to extend the exhale just a little

54
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:32,479
bit the exhale often is associated with some relaxation

55
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:38,319
or releasing some tension it's just a physiological way

56
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,599
the body works so we can take advantage of that

57
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:49,360
and just in a relaxed easy way intentionally

58
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,560
extending the exhale just a tiny

59
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:06,439
bit maybe it's associated with a side maybe

60
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:13,609
[Music]

61
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:35,360
not then allowing the breathing to to return to normal not changing it in any

62
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,919
way just resting attention on the sensations of

63
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:48,680
breathing the experience of breathing the embodiment of

64
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
breathing

65
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:16,919
and tuning into any sense of okayness any sense of

66
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:24,039
well-being maybe it's delightful to connect with others this longer in chat

67
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:29,199
maybe it's delightful to know that you're doing this wholesome thing for

68
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,520
your yourself this helpful thing for

69
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:05,200
yourself and then from this slight or maybe obvious or maybe

70
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,880
very subtle sense of yeah this is it's okay

71
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:20,000
it's okay bring your attention to a lovable

72
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:27,160
being a being that when you bring this being to mind just makes you smile

73
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:32,720
whether it's a exter internal smile or an internal

74
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,200
smile and just rest your attention

75
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:44,640
there with the loveliness of The Lovable

76
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:52,240
being in whatever way feels comfortable easy accessible for

77
00:09:56,079 --> 00:10:04,320
you of course this includes lovable beings that are puppies or kittens or

78
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:11,200
maybe maybe you saw this really cute kitten video recently and I'm chuckling because I did see a kitten video

79
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:17,360
recently that was so Charming this little kitten that reached

80
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:24,040
out and hugged a duck I think this was going around the internet maybe some of you saw

81
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:34,360
this apparently they I'm assuming they must have grown up together these two creatures es it was sweet silly and

82
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:45,639
sweet can we allow ourselves to feel the silliness sweetness Beauty lovability

83
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:54,040
whatever it might be allowing the heart and the body to have this little bit of

84
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
uplift

85
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
e

86
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:41,120
allowing yourself to just feel

87
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:51,839
experience that maybe there's a slight sentense of delight or an okay sense of

88
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:58,240
okayness I'm smiling it's makes me smile to think about these

89
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
things

90
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:14,959
and then can we use this sense of delight

91
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:20,000
loveliness warm-heartedness can we use that to

92
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,399
Source our experience to fuel our

93
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:34,800
experience and I want to normalize if it's not there you don't have access to it that's

94
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,519
perfectly fine too last thing we want is the tyranny of

95
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:47,839
a guided meditation telling you you should be one way when it's just not happening that's

96
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:54,680
perfectly okay whatever you're experiencing is can it be

97
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
okay

98
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:11,079
and then just to tune into the experience of

99
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,800
breathing I'm bringing this attitude of warmth or

100
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,800
Delight into noticing the experience of

101
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
breathing

102
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,279
noticing the inhales and the

103
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
exhales

104
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

105
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:40,720
and for now when you find yourself lost in thought just very simply gently maybe

106
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,920
with this attitude of warmth begin again with the sensations

107
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,160
of

108
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
breathing

109
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

110
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:55,480
and now when you wake up or realize oh I've

111
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:02,079
been [Music] thinking you just recognize it as such

112
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:08,839
just this very simple word thinking and then return to the

113
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:14,560
sensations of breathing so recognize that thinking was

114
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:24,079
happening in a relaxed easy way very simple oh yeah okay I was

115
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:30,920
thinking I'm going to return to the breath

116
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:44,959
no need to make it complicated add stories to the stories just oh yeah

117
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:53,880
thinking and then rest attention on the sensations of

118
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
breathing

119
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,240
you find that you're just left in thought just not really being

120
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:41,120
mindfulness that much on if breathing that's okay can you just maybe tune into

121
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:49,039
the exhale and notice oh yeah thinking is like this then I have an inhale

122
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:55,279
and with the exhale oh yep thinking is like

123
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
this

124
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:11,440
what I'd like to point to here is the Simplicity just noticing yep that was a

125
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:18,520
lot of thinking okay and come back to the experience of

126
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:24,600
breathing and without having

127
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:30,400
to add an attitude of somehow it should be

128
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:37,799
different this is what Minds do they think we're just

129
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:43,720
noticing thinking happens and then begin again with the

130
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:53,279
sensations of breathing thinking is Perfectly

131
00:18:54,679 --> 00:19:00,720
Natural don't have to disparage it

132
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

133
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

134
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

135
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

136
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

137
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

138
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

139
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

140
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

141
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,480
when we recognize that we've been thinking just meet it with a

142
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,760
warm-hearted attitude

143
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,840
thinking doesn't have to be any more complicated than

144
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,840
that and then simply begin

145
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,400
again with the sensations of

146
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
breathing

147
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

148
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

149
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

150
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

151
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

152
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
e

153
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:05,070
e [Music]

154
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:13,889
[Music]

155
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:39,570
[Music]

156
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:08,840
okay so this idea of noticing our thinking in

157
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:17,000
a relaxed simple way without having to add

158
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,720
anything extra to it so this is our third day of working

159
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:31,159
on uh with the inner critic and I've been describing the inner critic is this

160
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:38,600
interior you know I'm using this word said personality but you know I'm not a psychologist I'm just using that in the

161
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:44,240
you know just not in a technical way uh by any means but it's this way in which

162
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:50,360
there's this uh voice that's like a constantly putting us down or belittling

163
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:56,880
us and this voice of negativity that's blaming us and nagging us and the strong

164
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:03,679
sense of like you should do this or you should not do that or sometimes it's associated with this

165
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:09,559
real sense of Shame Shame for just being who we are or existing and it's really

166
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:15,279
has this quality of harshness and creates this attitude this

167
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:22,919
interior experience of a harshness and so going to link this to

168
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:28,960
thoughts that often this inner critic shows up as thoughts and they might be like quiet

169
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:35,440
thoughts that uh maybe U we don't see so much but it's just of the nature of

170
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,840
thoughts that for the most part most thoughts are self-referential that there are these

171
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:49,799
thoughts about me you know whatever you know there's just thoughts about um who

172
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:56,559
like there's this implicit sense of that there's this me at the center that needs to take care of something or do

173
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:02,000
something or everything is relation to me or however it might be but there

174
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,320
maybe two things to notice about this that these thoughts about me are always

175
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:13,600
distorted in some kind of way we don't think they are we think they're accurate

176
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:20,960
and true and and precise but they're distorted and it's not until often that

177
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:26,159
we um can get away from being lost in thought all the time that we can start

178
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:33,799
to see how distorted our thoughts are and so in one way that they're distorted

179
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:40,039
is this idea of you know always judging ourselves and putting ourselves down

180
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:48,760
disparaging ourselves this inner critic that shows up and for many of us it just

181
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:55,919
feels like normal well of course there was this inner critic putting us down that's just the way it is in fact we

182
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:03,399
might not even notice that they're NE netive or that they're critical it just might be so familiar it just feels like

183
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:09,799
okay this is what the interior landscape is like and I also want to normalize this isn't true for

184
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:16,159
everybody for um this is 100% anecdotally but those individuals that I

185
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:22,519
recognize that grew up in the United States they often have this inner critic maybe less so if you grw up outside of

186
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:32,120
the United States this is just Diana's observations no scientific evaluation about that just my simple observations

187
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:39,440
but and so it can be enormously powerful to notice that we are having not only

188
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:47,360
thoughts but that they are judging us and that not in a positive way judging

189
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:54,960
us in a way that is unhelpful and there's this way in which the less we are aware of our judging

190
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:01,880
thoughts the more likely we're uh allowing them to kind like chip

191
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:07,480
away at our sense of self-worth or our sense of wellbeing there's this way that

192
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:13,480
just a little bit by a little bit it kind of like diminishes any sense of

193
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:21,639
okayness or contentment or satisfaction that we might have so these thoughts that are

194
00:33:21,639 --> 00:33:28,960
disparaging towards ourselves really take a toll they're really texing

195
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,519
and so it can be enormously helpful to just notice them and then not only to

196
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:42,000
notice them but to kind of like take the rug out from underneath them from away from the authority that they seem to

197
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:50,639
have the way that they like to masquerade around is they're the truth and accurate and it's not the truth and

198
00:33:50,639 --> 00:33:56,120
it's not accurate it's there's a way in which it's distorted they're of course

199
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:03,480
they're based on things that actually have happened in reality for the most part not always so I don't want us to

200
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:10,720
say that you know we have to completely um ignore them but uh so often

201
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:18,240
they're um twisting what's uh actually happening so with mindfulness practice

202
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:25,560
little bit what we did in the guided meditation just noticing thinking that um activity to just notice

203
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:31,440
like oh okay I'm I was lost thought but in a way that brings some

204
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:37,079
warm-heartedness or some warmth to it as opposed to like oh gee Austin thoughts

205
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:43,079
again you know we can sometimes have that attitude but if we can bring just a

206
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:49,638
simple awareness of thoughts then that helps us to

207
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:56,520
discern what's helpful what's not helpful what's healthy what's not what's

208
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:03,280
not healthy because there's this way in which the inner critic if we don't notice it just

209
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,920
uh drones on and on and on and sometimes if we do notice then we're just critical

210
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:15,680
of the critic and that's just another way of droning on and on right it's just like maintaining this attitude of being

211
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:21,599
critical and disparaging and judging in a unhelpful

212
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:28,760
way so when we notice that the thoughts are are

213
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:34,359
disparaging they're pejorative they are unhelpful towards

214
00:35:34,359 --> 00:35:40,880
us we can isolate those types of thoughts are

215
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:46,640
unhelpful from other types of thoughts that are helpful we need thoughts of

216
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:52,760
course we do to plan to communicate to maybe our livelihood depends on thinking

217
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:58,079
and we need to solve problems in our daily life how are we going to get that

218
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:05,359
big bowl in the dishwasher you know whatever uh whatever the uh problems

219
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:11,560
that are meeting us in the day so first is to notice

220
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:17,920
thoughts and then to second can we isolate can we separate those thoughts

221
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:25,560
that are judging I use this word critical disparaging from the other

222
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:32,240
ones and so this is a skill that often requires that we bring

223
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:39,960
mindfulness to our thoughts and sometimes we're just so lost in thought that we can't do that but is there a way

224
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:46,599
in which we can separate we can isolate we can discern helpful solving problems

225
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:53,319
communicating planning not helpful beating ourselves up making us feel like

226
00:36:53,319 --> 00:36:59,920
we're unworthy or shame or something like that to practice is to separate

227
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:06,560
from the helpful from the unhelpful so what's one way that we can recognize the

228
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:13,960
unhelpful I mean the obvious ones are if the if the particular thoughts are

229
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:21,359
obvious to you like you know if we hear these words like you're worthless oh you're hopeless you know if

230
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:28,480
we hear those types of thoughts okay that's obvious that's not it's really not helpful

231
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:35,520
but there's another way in which we can notice is the tone of the thoughts

232
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:41,960
helpful thoughts often just have a neutral tone but the unhelpful ones have

233
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:48,599
this way of a maybe this feeling like they're barking at you you know the tone

234
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:56,560
is maybe sharp and loud and harsh something like that or maybe that we

235
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:02,079
notice that it it's not about a particular thing um maybe the thought

236
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:08,680
has as I spoke about yesterday has taken a specific event and just globalized it

237
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:14,280
like okay you were lost in thought during meditation and then the inner critic

238
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:21,560
takes that one piece of data and says you're a terrible meditator you're a

239
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:29,079
terrible person like why are you even bothering you know oh gosh it's just so hard it's it's hard for me to even say

240
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:35,319
these things out loud right it's painful but there's so many ways in which the Mind likes to do this the

241
00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:41,680
inner critic likes to do this take one little data point and then use a broad

242
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:48,079
paintbrush to make something about our innate value our innate

243
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:54,160
worth so that's another way if we can notice if um the inner critic is arising

244
00:38:54,160 --> 00:39:01,480
these thoughts as if it's challenging your innate value in some globalized way and

245
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:07,720
then Third Way which we might notice the tone of these unhelpful thoughts if

246
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:14,839
you're starting to feel weighed down there's like and you kind like the posture like

247
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:20,000
oh my gosh you know this just feels too much and this we can start to feel like

248
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,200
the energy just really dropping and feeling

249
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:32,079
um hopeless feeling uh overwhelmed like oh it's just too

250
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:39,880
much those are thoughts that are not helpful not helpful so how can we work

251
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:45,200
with this first as I said we can like separate helpful thoughts solving

252
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:50,359
problems communicating planning unhelpful inner critic disparaging

253
00:39:50,359 --> 00:39:58,280
ourselves making Global assessments about our value and then just label it

254
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:07,240
judging is like this judgement is like

255
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:14,960
this and then just tune into the experience yeah it feels heavy feels

256
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:20,960
crappy doesn't feel good and there's a way in which just the

257
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:28,200
actual judging helps us to get a little bit disentangled from it we're noticing

258
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:34,040
it but there's something about like um turning into the experience of judging

259
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:39,520
which is you know mindfulness being aware of and the mindfulness has a

260
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,680
little bit of uplift with it the judging itself might be

261
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:51,800
uncomfortable but to be mindful of uncomfortable brings a little bit of space and

262
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:59,880
uplift so this just saying judgment is like this helps us to crystallize this

263
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:06,760
understanding that we're judging it helps this judgment to stand out to separate from the other thoughts that

264
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:12,760
are helpful and then but just to be careful here there's no need to judge the

265
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:18,200
judging judgment is like this and I'm judging the judging and then we can like

266
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:26,160
judge the judging of the judging and then off we go right so if you notice that just say judgment is like this just

267
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:31,520
kind of stop with that and um it's like judgment is like

268
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:38,720
this and then we can just see it as just a bunch of thoughts it's just a bunch of

269
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:44,359
thoughts and what are thoughts what are they they're like you know they're

270
00:41:44,359 --> 00:41:49,720
intangible there's like you know we could just blow them away right

271
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:55,520
there's like how many thoughts a day do you have how many bazillion guilan made

272
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:01,440
it feels like that so many you'll have other thoughts later

273
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:07,520
so notice that you're thinking separate the helpful from the unhelpful when you

274
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:15,520
notice that there's judging just label it say judgment is like this judgment is like this it feels like

275
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:22,040
this and that's a way that creates some space then you can like tune in if

276
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:29,720
you're meditating tune into the sensations of breathing or just continue doing whatever it is you're

277
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:35,000
doing so I'd like to add this to some of the instructions that I gave earlier in

278
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:41,079
the week because you know whatever's available right when we're in the midst of the inner critic we work with

279
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:48,000
whatever is available so on Monday we had this expression I'm doing the best I can

280
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,960
right now maybe that comes after like judgment is like this and I'm doing the best I

281
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:03,000
can right now and on Tuesday yesterday I gave the instructions to like tune in like how am

282
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:10,480
I right now like just to tune into the felt experience as a way maybe to interrupt the inner critic maybe you

283
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:18,920
could add today's uh instructions like judgment is like this and how am I right

284
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:26,680
now or maybe it's just like judgment is like this it's like this it's just a bunch of

285
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:33,480
thoughts and our thoughts they like to push us around they can feel authoritative they

286
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:39,839
can feel weighty but they're just thoughts you'll have other thoughts you

287
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:45,920
were having other thoughts just a moment ago we don't have to believe them or get

288
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:53,119
as invested in them as often as we do or as much as we do so today like not

289
00:43:53,119 --> 00:44:01,520
disparaging the disparaging instead just to say disparaging is like this judgment is

290
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:08,240
like this and help take the the sting out of it or the just make

291
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:16,160
it simple just make it simple so with that I hope you have a

292
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:21,960
day in which you can separate that unhelpful judging from the other types

293
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:29,039
of thoughts thank you thank you all I look forward to practicing together tomorrow

294
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:59,040
deep bows deep bows to all of you

295
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:10,640
hean be self meta rather than self-critic oh that's cute I like it I like

296
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:21,720
it yes thank you for all you it's a beautiful thing to practice

297
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,960
together

298
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:41,079
so nice too how you all support one another and

299
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:47,640
support me and this feeling of community even that we're all over it's beautiful

300
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:54,359
beautiful like what would the world be like if everybody had this experience to

301
00:45:54,359 --> 00:46:00,680
be able to know be with other people who are warm-hearted and kind and

302
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:07,680
generous I think that we are like changing the world just by coming

303
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,240
together like why not have it start with

304
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:20,369
us is being openhearted towards one [Music]

305
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,920
another

306
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:48,160
it's spend for me to connect with you all reading your

307
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:58,839
chats

308
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:19,760
every rights we have grown together over the years right it's quite something that over the years know so many people

309
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:27,440
