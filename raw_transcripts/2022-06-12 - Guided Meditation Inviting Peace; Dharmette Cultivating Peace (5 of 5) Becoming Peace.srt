1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:08,800
greetings everyone it's a delight to be here with this beautiful sangha

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:15,360
and i should have mentioned this yesterday at the outset i've been um i had a wonderful visit from my daughter

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,680
and grandchildren last weekend but they all had coughs and i've been fighting off a sore

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,680
throat all week and yesterday i could barely talk i could barely make sounds with my voice

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:36,039
so i hope it'll be a little bit better today but if it's a little bit scratchy you know why

6
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,600
so let's begin our meditation today as we've done every day this week by

7
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,800
first of all leaving all our concerns preoccupations agendas worries and

8
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:07,439
responsibilities outside the door for the next 30 minutes

9
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:14,720
so take a moment to do that put them out there carefully

10
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,840
knowing that you can come back to them when you're ready

11
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,360
so we'll begin again our meditation by inviting sati

12
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,880
awareness our best friend to the forefront

13
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,840
this is so helpful because as awareness becomes strong we can see

14
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,079
when unskillful thoughts begin to arise and then we have a little opening in

15
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,320
which we can make a choice not to pick them up

16
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,640
so now bring your awareness to your posture

17
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,280
balancing aligning the whole body

18
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,040
you might wanna adjust a little bit back and forth side

19
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,200
to side

20
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:45,040
and now connecting with the earth feeling

21
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:53,599
the connection of the body on whatever is supporting it your cushion your chair your bed

22
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,000
and imagine words going down deep into the earth

23
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,200
and now inviting the grounding energy of the earth to flow up through the seat

24
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:23,040
through the spine providing stability

25
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:32,400
maybe confidence assurance we're here on this earth

26
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,040
and then as the energy flows up the spine we let it exit through the ground of the head

27
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:46,040
and now we can open to the energy of space

28
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,840
we can imagine that the body is suspended from above by that invisible thread

29
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:13,120
so ideally we have a comfortable posture that is both grounded

30
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:20,320
and spacious balanced stable

31
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,320
open

32
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,400
we'll begin by relaxing the muscles of the face

33
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:45,120
softening the forehead the eyes between the eyes

34
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,960
the cheeks the lips the tongue

35
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:02,320
the jaw the neck

36
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,479
relaxing the shoulders

37
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,840
the arms the hands

38
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,800
the torso and the belly

39
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,520
relaxing in the legs the feet

40
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:43,080
and let's take up residence in this body just as it is

41
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,880
and as we become more and more present in our bodily experience of breathing in and

42
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:09,680
breathing out there may be a subtle joy that arises

43
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,600
simply from being present

44
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,360
so now closing the eyes

45
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,919
breathing in being here

46
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,120
breathing out peace

47
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,759
breathing in being here

48
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,840
breathing out peace

49
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,919
breathing in i'm here

50
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,720
breathing out i'm okay with the way things are

51
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,399
here in this body breathing

52
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,519
breathing out peace

53
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:28,649
and with our receptive awareness [Music]

54
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:37,760
maybe a subtle feeling of joy and really being present

55
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,640
in this moment

56
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:51,680
breathing in joy and breathing out peace

57
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:57,760
so we shift to inviting joy on the in-breath

58
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:07,000
breathing in joy breathing out peace

59
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:47,040
grounded in the breathing

60
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,560
breathing in inviting joy

61
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,399
reading out peace

62
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:07,199
and from the joy of being fully present

63
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,839
we now invite tranquility

64
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:18,959
breathing in calm breathing out

65
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,959
peace

66
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:41,199
inviting the body to relax inviting the mind to relax

67
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:47,519
tranquil quiet breathing in

68
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:54,600
calm breathing out peace

69
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:35,280
right now i'm okay with the way things are

70
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,799
the body however it is is doing its best

71
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:47,679
mind is doing its best i don't need to change how things are to

72
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:55,200
be okay this moment is enough

73
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:02,480
i'm happy that i don't have to fight with the way things are

74
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:14,160
for minutes just imagine uh take in the wrong being

75
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:19,280
of the contentment the happiness

76
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:25,240
of being okay with the way things are right now

77
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:41,799
now without really using words

78
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:50,679
we'll breathe in the well-being of contentment and breathe out peace

79
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,720
in well-being

80
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,880
breathing out peace

81
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,880
if the mind should wander because that's what minds do

82
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:37,919
come back with a smile to breathing in

83
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:45,799
the well-being of contentment breathing out peace

84
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:51,520
coming home to safety there's room for all of me here

85
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:58,320
i'm home in this body in this moment

86
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:05,640
breathing in safety breathing out peace

87
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:30,960
with quiet joy calm the well-being of contentment

88
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,960
i'm safe here at home breathing in

89
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:43,840
safety breathing out peace

90
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,240
as we come to the end of the sitting let's bring to mind the people we'll

91
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:49,600
come into contact with today strangers as well as the people we know

92
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:55,600
making the wish that through our presence

93
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:01,200
our example we may offer them peace

94
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:17,760
no matter what the circumstances are if we have

95
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:24,399
clear awareness we can always find

96
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:31,200
a way to be peaceful and we can offer this

97
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,320
to everyone

98
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:43,840
so by abiding peacefully ourselves

99
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:50,320
may we offer all beings ourselves included safety

100
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,840
peace happiness

101
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,158
and freedom

102
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:07,200
[Music]

103
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,130
[Music]

104
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,289
[Music]

105
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:05,480
greetings everyone it's a pleasure to be here with you all

106
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:12,240
today is the last in our series this week on cultivating peace

107
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:19,120
in the early texts of the buddhist teachings there are many synonyms for nibana

108
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:26,880
complete awakening one of which is the supreme peace

109
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,278
another is the unconditioned

110
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:38,880
so i'll read it to you in something from the samyutta nikaya 43

111
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:46,518
1 the buddha says to his disciples

112
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:54,480
i will teach you the unconditioned and the path leading to the unconditioned

113
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:02,799
what is the unconditioned the destruction of greed the destruction of hatred

114
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:09,519
the destruction of delusion this is called the unconditioned

115
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:15,000
and what is the path leading to the unconditioned

116
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:20,640
mindfulness directed to the body this is the path

117
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,159
leading to the unconditioned

118
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:35,039
so oh with complete awakening the poisons of greed hatred and delusion

119
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:41,000
are completely eradicated never to return

120
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:49,679
and then the buddha says that the essence of the path leading to the supreme peace of the unconditioned

121
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,360
is mindfulness of the body

122
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:02,559
as we've seen samadhi or unification is the last of the preparatory

123
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:07,840
conditions from which the insights necessary for liberation

124
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:15,760
arise when the meditator can dwell in samadhi

125
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:21,039
the insides leading to awakening will gradually and spontaneously

126
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:24,039
unfold

127
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:31,919
and in all the wholesome stage that we find in buddhist teachings each one

128
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:40,559
can arise in a wide spectrum of depth or intensity and that entire spectrum is valuable

129
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:47,120
including the first baby steps samadhi for example encompasses a range

130
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:53,760
of increasingly profound states of meditative absorption

131
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:59,919
and before entering into samadhi proper there can be access samadhi

132
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:07,399
when all five hindrances are in advance and the mind is settled

133
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,480
for most practitioners it's unlikely to be accessible in a 30-minute meditation

134
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,760
on a weekday and a silent retreat offers

135
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,639
the ideal conditions for cultivating samadhi

136
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:28,560
that said we may have tastes of samadhi outside of a retreat center

137
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:37,839
when the mind is at peace unified and these small tastes are valuable

138
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:45,040
and should be savored they give us an idea of what is in store

139
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:54,720
so for samadhi to arise we put in place the condition of peaceful contentment

140
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:01,760
the body and mind are suffused with a sense of well-being

141
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:07,359
which is calmer and more satisfying than joy

142
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:16,320
so let's briefly review the steps along the path of liberative dependent arising

143
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:22,320
which put in place the conditions for entering into the sacred state of

144
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:31,400
samadhi it all begins with an honest confrontation with our suffering

145
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:38,480
we live in a world of 10 000 joys and 10 000 sorrows

146
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:44,720
which arise and pass away and we need to know our suffering

147
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,838
in order to start the process of becoming free

148
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:59,839
and then it's important that we have confidence in the path we've chosen to follow

149
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:07,119
the stronger our confidence in the path the greater our resolve can be

150
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:15,280
then with confidence that we're on the right track gladness naturally arises

151
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:23,960
we see that indeed there's a light at the end of our tunnel of darkness

152
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:34,480
next step is joy which is directly proportional to how absorbed we are in our practice

153
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:40,920
when awareness is strong we feel the joy of being fully present

154
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,119
the miracle of each moment

155
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:53,200
and these first steps of confidence gladness and joy

156
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,560
have a very useful function of dispelling anxiety

157
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:04,079
and agitation they put in place the conditions

158
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,240
for tranquility

159
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,559
when tranquility becomes pervasive

160
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:23,359
the conditions are in place for peaceful calm contentment to arise

161
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:29,119
the gentle happiness of sukkah we are at peace

162
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:36,279
with the way things are with a deep feeling of well-being

163
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:44,960
with agitation dispelled through tranquility the well-being of calm contentment

164
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,160
allows the mind to become unified in samadhi

165
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:57,280
so we're on this beautiful gradual path and it may be more gradual for some than

166
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,960
for others it doesn't matter if we're a slow bloomer

167
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:09,760
or fast bloomer we all have our karma to untangle

168
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:15,680
our knots to untie and this will take the time it takes

169
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:21,280
we need to study how we get caught and to learn what works

170
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,880
and doesn't work for us on the path to freedom

171
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:34,400
the good news is that no matter where we are in the past there are always opportunities for meeting or suffering

172
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:40,640
skillfully and in that encounter

173
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:45,680
if we are mindful we will see the forks in the road that continually arise

174
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,720
and we can choose the peaceful road that leads to freedom

175
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,920
if we're not mindful chances are we'll be caught in reactivity

176
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,839
and without even seeing the fork we hurtle on down the samsaric path

177
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:07,920
of dukkha it's also good news that as our practice

178
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,200
develops we do get better and better at recognizing the forks in the road

179
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,640
and choosing the wholesome one over the unwholesome

180
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:24,400
we learn that we don't need to be at war with ourselves we're at war with the way things are

181
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,839
in any situation we can choose peace

182
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:35,440
obviously i'm uh not saying that we shouldn't defend ourselves if we're attacked

183
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:43,400
but i am saying that blind reactivity is our enemy on this path

184
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:50,160
as our mindfulness becomes strong and we begin to live in the practice of mindfulness

185
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:55,640
more and more we choose the path of peace

186
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,280
one of the most powerful things i learned from my root teacher suzuki roshi

187
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:07,280
was that he taught the dharma most powerfully by his example

188
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:15,119
he radiated the buddhist teachings and that's something that we can do too

189
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:24,319
so in the context of what we've been exploring this week we can incline our minds to the supreme

190
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:32,079
safety the supreme peace through our practice we cultivate joy

191
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:37,200
tranquility the well-being of contentment

192
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:43,280
and unification and we can share these beautiful fruits of practice

193
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:51,359
with everyone we come into contact with so the invitation is to live in peace to

194
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:54,960
the extent we're able to

195
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:05,560
we can begin to contribute to peace in the world by cultivating peace in ourselves

196
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:14,160
if aversive thoughts arise we look for peaceful thoughts

197
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:21,640
we try to ensure that our speech is peaceful our actions peaceful

198
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:28,160
and through our practice little by little with help of sati

199
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:34,440
lucid awareness we can be peaceful

200
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:43,760
in everything we do we offer peace to ourselves

201
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:49,720
and to everyone to all beings

202
00:41:53,839 --> 00:42:01,440
and we can make the aspiration to be a safe haven of peace

203
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,880
for all beings everywhere

204
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,280
thank you for your practice

205
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,720
you
