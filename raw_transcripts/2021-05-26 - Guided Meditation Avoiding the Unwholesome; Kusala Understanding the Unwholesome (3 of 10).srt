1
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,920
so good day and

2
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:28,480
i certainly feel kind of full or happy to be here with

3
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:35,680
you and also feeling a little bit quiet so

4
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:45,840
i'll leave it at the welcome the

5
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,160
navigating between the skillful and the unskillful

6
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:59,840
the wholesome and the unwholesome is the path of practice

7
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:08,960
because navigating towards the wholesome and away from the unwholesome towards what's beneficial

8
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:16,720
and the wholesome is seen as that which is healthy that which is

9
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,560
nourishing and also uh one of the connotations of the word

10
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:30,720
crusolyze that which is clever clever not in the sense of i don't know

11
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:39,439
being tricky or something but wise and being able to differentiate between what is

12
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,720
unwholesome and what is wholesome

13
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,079
and in in doing meditation practice one of the central areas to

14
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:58,479
distinguish between this is uh with how

15
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:06,000
we are responding to the present moment and if we're

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,080
responding with mindfulness attention how we are attentive

17
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:21,040
is the attention wholesome or unwholesome is the attention

18
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,680
nourishing or does it feel healthy is it inspiring is the way that we're

19
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:35,040
paying attention is it do you feel the goodness of it as opposed to paying attention which

20
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,599
sometimes people use their attention and practice both for mindfulness and for concentration

21
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,959
in ways that if you really pay attention to it would not feel so

22
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:53,440
inspiring or so beneficial they're straining and pushing and and a

23
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:01,440
sense of heavy duty and and ideas of i have to do it right i'm not good enough for this and this is

24
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,840
so hard a feeling of discouragement there might be some complacency

25
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,360
lackadaisical nature kind of yes we're kind of paying attention but we're really

26
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:20,080
not that interested and and we're here kind of on road so

27
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,760
there's all kinds of ways which the attention if we pay attention to how we're attentive

28
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,680
it doesn't really inspire anything but there's ways of doing it that does

29
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,200
inspire but inspire not in an excited way

30
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:45,599
but in a in a way that arouses interest arouses

31
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:54,799
engagement that is peaceful that feels settling that feels

32
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:02,480
beneficial it feels like a a ambrosia of sweetness

33
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:09,280
that settle us or it's so as we do this meditation today

34
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,400
you might see if you can distinguish between the kind of attention that you're using

35
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:22,560
the kind of engagement and mindfulness that maybe carries with it some unhelpful

36
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,000
qualities and some that carry and then if you can see if you can

37
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,120
explore how to bring some helpful qualities of attention

38
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:40,560
and one of that is a simplicity and a matter of factness just just this engagement in a clear

39
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:47,680
wholehearted way but without any strain or pushing something that is opening to experience

40
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:56,720
or resting an experience or or lovingly receiving the experience

41
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:03,199
for example the breathing so to

42
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:14,479
enter into a wholesome or skillful posture

43
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:24,080
which is always very personal the posture that is beneficial

44
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:33,039
take some time and adjusting the small details of posture

45
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:39,840
that gets things kind of lined up

46
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,280
and then to close your eyes

47
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:09,039
and this is moving towards the wholesome

48
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:20,639
to what's beneficial begins right away can begin right away

49
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:29,198
so maybe you could find a nourishing or nurturing attention

50
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:35,840
maybe the attention can be free of

51
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,720
greed or aversion

52
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:50,800
maybe the attention ever so slightly qualities of generosity giving our

53
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,280
attention

54
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:03,840
qualities of care love or kindness

55
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,599
maybe valuing appreciating

56
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:17,840
attention itself and that we're attending

57
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,198
to our experience

58
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,840
and with this kind of attention to take a few long slow deep breaths

59
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:58,560
settling in as you exhale relaxing the body

60
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,160
as you exhale deeply

61
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:13,520
give in to your weight settling into your seat

62
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,120
the place that's holding you up

63
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,840
and letting your breathing return to normal

64
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:41,839
and then a wholesome attention to the breathing

65
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:53,120
or noticing any unwholesomeness any thing that's not inspiring about

66
00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:01,120
the effort the way that you're attending now to your experience

67
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:14,800
and orient yourself quietly to a quiet attitude

68
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:22,959
that's maybe free of greed or aversion

69
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,760
simplicity

70
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:41,760
and as you exhale to relax and soften the muscles of the

71
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,160
face

72
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,760
relax and soften the shoulders

73
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:19,839
relax and soften the belly

74
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:32,800
and this dedic this dedication to the wholesome means that even the effort to

75
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:39,360
see the wholesome and avoid the old wholesome

76
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:47,760
is done wholesomely not anxiously

77
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:57,360
not with the idea that you have to do it right there's a wrong way that you're good or you're bad

78
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:05,839
just a simple appreciation and recognition

79
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:15,839
that if you're doing it in an unwholesome way there is a better way

80
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:22,560
rather than there's a right way there is a nurturing way

81
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,880
so we're not condemning anything or condemning ourselves

82
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:35,920
just they're here to attend

83
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:43,839
wisely carefully lovingly

84
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:56,079
to each in breath and each out breath

85
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:02,079
being a friend to the in-breath and a friend to the out

86
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,399
breath

87
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:15,839
here attending to the breathing

88
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:25,839
in the wholesome way that you would attend to someone you cared for a lot

89
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:19,839
if you're lost in thought is your thinking wholesome or unwholesome

90
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:29,679
and even if the thinking is wholesome maybe it's not nourishing supportive

91
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,320
for the wholesome presence of mind in the present moment

92
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,960
so let go of your thinking

93
00:17:42,640 --> 00:18:01,840
and enter into the world of attention awareness

94
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:35,760
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

95
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:45,600
it's a time to turn our attention outward into the world that we will maybe

96
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:51,039
encounter today of other people activities

97
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:58,880
and hereto the buddhist orientation is to avoid being in the world

98
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,960
unskillfully unwholesomely

99
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:13,600
but to orient ourselves to what is wholesome and beneficial inspiring and nourishing

100
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:26,480
and so to orient ourselves to the world in a way that doesn't involve grim duty and obligation

101
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:39,760
but rather has a kind regard for others

102
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:46,960
a care for others compassion love friendliness

103
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,840
that is not forced and not in a sense required

104
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,559
but which is inspiring

105
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,880
and is expressed in personal ways so that we know that is it is beneficial

106
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:13,039
for ourselves nourishing and self-inspiring

107
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:23,039
and that way how we relate to the world and to ourselves becomes part of the path

108
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:30,880
of liberation and freedom because it brings these good qualities

109
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,840
for to the forefront in our lives

110
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:45,120
and so to turn the attention outward now to the world into the people and in your own way

111
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:52,880
gazing gazing upon the world kindly in your own way

112
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:03,760
having thoughts of well-wishing good will for others

113
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:12,159
in a way that you feel good about having it like because it's your own way

114
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,840
to the extent and interest that you have

115
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,279
and with that in mind maybe these words can express

116
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:32,080
your good will represent them may

117
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:38,320
all beings be happy

118
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:45,679
may all beings be safe

119
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:55,120
may all beings be peaceful and may all beings be free

120
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:05,600
and may each of us in our own way that's nourishing and wholesome for us and for the world

121
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:13,840
contribute to the welfare and happiness of all beings

122
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,400
[Music]

123
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,639
okay

124
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:50,799
so i think it works now okay so

125
00:31:53,600 --> 00:32:00,480
yeah there's only three buttons i have to push but sometimes that's too many

126
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,799
for me

127
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:14,320
okay so so the um

128
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:20,559
in talking about wholesome and unwholesomeness this week that

129
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:27,760
today i'm going to talk about the unwholesome and i think that understanding what

130
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:34,399
the buddha's teachings are on this topic or how we saw this topic that

131
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:42,480
it helps us to study and investigate how it is for us personally and um

132
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:49,840
uh so it gives us kind of ideas or orientation to really see what

133
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:55,440
the impact is of some of the attitudes we have some other of our behavior some of the ways

134
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:03,200
we speak so even some of the ways we think because some of that maybe occasionally

135
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:11,200
can be unwholesome or uninspiring or

136
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:18,559
unskillful or unbeneficial and and so

137
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:25,840
um so to look at this topic of the unwholesome in particular three what's called the

138
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:35,440
roots of the unwholesome kind of the source for all things which are unwholesome so first the unwholesome

139
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:43,039
is um is described as um involving suffering

140
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:49,360
in this very life involving stress in this very life and the word

141
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:56,559
suffering sometimes people take it to be only the big things in life are suffering but the word dukkha can be anything

142
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:01,840
deranged from even mild forms of

143
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:10,398
um um of uh stress or of um

144
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:17,679
not not just discomfort because that's too broad but um this mild forms of distress smile

145
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:25,440
forms of of you know the mild forms of suffering

146
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:33,118
and so the unwholesome whatever is unwholesome always involves some degree of dukkha

147
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:41,440
buddha goes on it says it involves vexation despair and fever so those are strong

148
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:48,960
words so we have to understand there also that there can be mild versions of it and

149
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:57,359
but it always involves some kind of way in which it uh it it harms ourselves

150
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:04,000
that there's a kind of self-harm involved so uh

151
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,720
and it involves discomfort so unwholesome always involves dukkha

152
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:17,040
harm and discomfort and and so

153
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:25,599
so when we act with hostility when we act in a mean way to people when we

154
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:33,760
are consumed with meanness or criticalness of ourselves when we are greedy

155
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:40,320
it's not a moralistic teaching like shouldn't do those things because that's the immoral thing to do

156
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:46,480
and with some abstract morality coming from outside but rather the pragmatic and

157
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:53,280
experiential orientation of the buddha is always how does it feel how am i experiencing

158
00:35:53,280 --> 00:36:00,640
myself what's the impact of this on myself here and so

159
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:07,839
rather than looking into the rule books the moral rule books to find out you know is it okay to lie is it okay to steal is

160
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:14,240
it okay to um to you know um

161
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:22,000
gossip negatively about my friends uh what we can do is uh in practice and

162
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:29,440
this is why mindfulness is so amazingly useful when you develop strong capacity of self-reflection self-awareness

163
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,480
you don't go to the rule books but you go to your own heart you go to yourself

164
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,520
and you see what's the impact on this on this behavior this attitude this way

165
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:46,560
of speaking and it's possible with heightened sensitivity to feel the way that it causes suffering

166
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:53,440
for oneself pain for oneself discomfort for oneself it's not nourishing it's not inspiring

167
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,440
in fact to really be mindful and see some of the impact the way we are some people actually get

168
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:05,839
distance disinspired they get dismayed and discouraged and they feel

169
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:11,440
the way some of this stuff even though some of the ways of acting on wholesome lies are energizing

170
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,800
and people feel that the pleasure of being alive when they're hateful and

171
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:24,240
angry at other people there is a way in which uh it really is draining

172
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:30,480
some essential vitality and goodness within us some wholeness some being really

173
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:37,040
connected to ourselves because the kind of anger and many times this unhealthy behavior

174
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:43,599
is um the focus is outwardly directed um in such a way that we are out of

175
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:50,800
touch with what's behind that outward movement and that's a true for ourselves as well if we're really

176
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,839
mean or critical of ourselves then there's a way in which we treat ourselves as an

177
00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:01,760
object and we don't see what's behind it we don't see the the way that we're aware we don't see

178
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:09,040
the impact it has on closing us down or contracting or the discomfort of it

179
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,720
so so this reference point of the impact that our attitudes

180
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:21,359
thoughts speech behavior has and and really taking that in in a deep way

181
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:27,839
i've known people who've only only experienced the impact of their behavior

182
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:34,240
what they've done years later where they finally kind of woke up and they were just shocked like it sometimes

183
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:40,160
became like lightning like oh my my wow i can't believe it

184
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:47,359
and i really hurt someone and and so it's better later than

185
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:53,760
uh than never but even better is to feel it right away and so for the

186
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,599
buddha the unwholesome is um in modern english we talk about

187
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:06,560
instant karma there's this instant way in which simultaneously acting on it we can feel

188
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:14,640
how it's debilitating or draining or it limits us or closes us off and compartmentalizes ourselves so

189
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:21,280
we're not really whole and full anymore and now this is uh so

190
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:29,680
uh vexation despair and a fever even when it's really strong

191
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:35,839
so we can certainly look at all this and become aware of it so that we can

192
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:41,359
then not do it and think that's good or that's fine in itself

193
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:49,359
but we don't want to it's important not to underestimate the value of this for the buddha who has a very pragmatic

194
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:57,520
orientation towards the dharma towards his teaching very functional very experiential and

195
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:03,760
um and immediate and it wasn't uh metaphysics there wasn't uh abstractions

196
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:11,280
and there wasn't some kind of divine authority beyond or everything everything unfolds here

197
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,480
in our experience um this is where we discover peace this is

198
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:22,720
where we discover how we're not at peace and so the buddha talked about how is it

199
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,838
you can know the dharma

200
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:34,720
really for yourself and the way he talked about it is this dharma that he's teaching or pointing to

201
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:41,760
is visible here and now it's immediate it has to do with right now

202
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:48,000
it invites you it invites itself to be seen by you

203
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,319
by oneself so it's kind of like come here can you look at this there's a kind of pull

204
00:40:54,319 --> 00:41:01,200
of attention towards this if you're really attentive and it's onward leading

205
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:07,520
it has consequence that's beneficial that leads us more and more goodness and it's

206
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:13,200
personally realized by the wise so again it's very personal pragmatic

207
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:20,720
pragmatism so that's the dharma and how how is it that way when you know

208
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:26,079
there is no greed no hatred and no delusion

209
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:32,560
within you and when you know oh when you know there is greed hatred

210
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:37,920
and illusion first you have to know it's there and then you know

211
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:43,040
that it's no there's no greed no hatred and no delusion within you

212
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:48,160
to see that movement to go from the whole unwholesome to the wholesome

213
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:53,680
the absence of the unwholesome and then the presence of the wholesome

214
00:41:53,680 --> 00:42:01,040
that then you know that the dharma is visible here and now immediate

215
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:07,040
inviting inspection writing to be seen um onward leading and personally

216
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:14,240
realized by the wise and so um and so this emphasis on the

217
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:20,480
on greed hate and delusion here is because the buddha in the buddha's eyes in the buddhist

218
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:26,240
experience all things which are unwholesome

219
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:34,079
and maybe it's almost the definition of unwholesome all the things that are unwholesome are in one way or the other rooted in

220
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:40,560
greed hatred and delusion and again it could be very mild forms of greed

221
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:47,920
craving compulsion compulsive desire or hatred or it can be you know can be

222
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,280
very mild or can be very strong but the mild forms of

223
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:59,839
unwholesome maybe have mild forms of greed hate and delusion but this kind of this is a common denominator for

224
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:05,040
all things which are unwholesome and so that's why to really get down and see

225
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:11,280
underneath our behavior and see the greed hate and delusion and let go of it have come to an end of

226
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,480
it that is how we see this pragmatic teachings of the buddha

227
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:22,319
orientation of the buddha this experiential approach that he has which is very

228
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:28,720
personal because this is only something that we can know for ourselves in the way that we experience and know

229
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:36,240
it for ourselves and and so

230
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:43,680
so the emphasis today is on this uh very personally experiential

231
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:50,000
reference point for the dharma for the buddhist teachings for the path

232
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,359
of liberation and for if you use modern english

233
00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:02,720
terminology for ethics for morality that that morality springs out of

234
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:10,400
it can spring out of a very deep connectivity connection to oneself

235
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:17,119
and um and uh and we know for ourselves and that is kind of inspiring to have

236
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:24,720
our ethics our morality how we live in the world really well up from a deep understanding within that is kind of a

237
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:30,960
wellspring a kind of a source of goodness that

238
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:40,079
carries us along in that goodness as opposed to carrying us along in um in you know a sense of grim duty

239
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:47,520
or or uh fear of fear of some retribution or something

240
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:54,720
so um the unwholesome so it might happen that in the next 24

241
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:59,760
hours for a few of you that you might have some

242
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:06,640
thought or speech act or behavior that helps that you recognize

243
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:14,640
as being unwholesome and if you do then take that opportunity

244
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:22,720
to turn the attention back on yourself and really see what um how it's impacting you

245
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:28,319
yourself and see if you can see the way that it has a negative impact and maybe

246
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:35,280
an impact you don't really want to have it's not very inspiring and and the stronger your bout of

247
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,800
unwholesome is uh the better it is for this exercise don't go

248
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:47,200
invent unwholesomeness for the exercise but the stronger your you're about of somehow doing something

249
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:55,280
unwholesome expressions of greed hatred and delusion or something then i think the more clarity you can

250
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:00,800
have in this exercise of really seeing the impact it has on you

251
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:10,480
and then we'll continue with this tomorrow thank you
