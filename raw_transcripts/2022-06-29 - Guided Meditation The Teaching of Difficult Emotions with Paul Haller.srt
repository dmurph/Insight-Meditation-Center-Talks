1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,319
good morning can you hear me okay

2
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,840
from where i'm sitting i can see uh outside

3
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:31,480
it's a uh a cloudy morning here in san francisco

4
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,600
it it brought up the thought for me

5
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,800
as we start to sit to in a very simple way

6
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,079
just notice where am i

7
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,520
you know what's what's the uh

8
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,359
the surround of this moment and then also

9
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:12,840
what's the interior activity or surround of this moment

10
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,200
any kind of a deliberate maybe even a kind of leisurely way

11
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,240
you know like meditation

12
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,320
is not another thing but it often is another thing on our to-do list

13
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:39,439
but actually it's also asking us to sort of shift gears

14
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,880
this is a time for simple presence

15
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,280
for noticing what's going on

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,479
how is your mind now virgin thoughts

17
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,799
are there a particular

18
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,239
mental dispositions

19
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,840
and your emotions

20
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:28,080
is there a sense of ease or a sense of dis-ease

21
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:36,160
is there any particular mood

22
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,319
to your state of consciousness right now

23
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:51,160
in a way in just that kind of noticing

24
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,640
it's a reminder of the proposition of meditation you

25
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:05,760
know in mindfulness in awareness that to simply be present and experience

26
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,000
whatever's happening in that moment

27
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,360
in a way that's the wisdom aspect

28
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:30,879
it is what it is and then for us as humans

29
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:36,640
it's enormously significant when we open to it

30
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:46,760
it's a way in which we make more sense of who we are to ourselves

31
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:53,200
we're noticing and acknowledging what's going on

32
00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:01,000
um this state of mind of these emotions

33
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,640
then as we notice that to let that same

34
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:15,400
simple attention come into the body

35
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:24,400
there's something essential primitive fundamental

36
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:31,360
to our physical being in a way our psychosomatic being

37
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:38,479
registers the notable experiences that occur for us

38
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,240
and to start to bring attention to the body and notice

39
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,280
how is the body does it feel

40
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,120
settled does it feel spacious and open

41
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,160
are there some points of tension

42
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:13,840
but then from the wisdom side it is what it is it's beyond

43
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:20,560
good or bad or as it should be or as it should not be you know

44
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,360
it is what it is

45
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:36,120
and we take it personally

46
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:44,479
the continuance of me is in the balance

47
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,720
of what's being experienced right now

48
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,199
it's a two allow

49
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,240
the body to be reflecting

50
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,199
this moment this day's version of me

51
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,560
and when you relate to me as a body

52
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,880
it's a different me from the one that's caught up in

53
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,360
thinking

54
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,759
the thinking it's reconstructing reality

55
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:40,319
it's judging its own constructions it's having feelings about its

56
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:46,840
constructions it's drawing conclusions and judgments

57
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:02,560
and to just remind ourselves that that's not going to stop because we've decided to meditate that will in fact

58
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:10,880
is a significant attending to that experiencing that the construction the judgment

59
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,759
the memories that the mind creates

60
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,680
these are today's versions of me

61
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:32,400
and as we embody it can we

62
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,720
invite it to be palpable

63
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:44,039
the experience of me in this moment

64
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,360
and can we breathe

65
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:06,759
can breathe in the thoughts the feelings the sounds

66
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,000
and can we notice

67
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:35,120
how does that register is it pushed aside by thinking

68
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,039
is it imbued with emotion

69
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:47,240
either pleasant emotions or unpleasant emotions

70
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:02,000
and however it is can we remind ourselves to hold it tender

71
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,959
in our human existence thrives

72
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,320
when it's related to benevolently

73
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:28,240
we just let that thought let that disposition

74
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,480
become part of our breath

75
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,680
giving something permission to be itself

76
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,839
can you breathe in in a way that's

77
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:57,120
inviting the body to be expensive

78
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:07,120
inviting the body to it's almost like opening downwards

79
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,560
can the chest relax and open

80
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,720
can the mid region the stomach relax

81
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,319
can the abdomen relax

82
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:36,000
and sometimes it can and sometimes it can't but to invite that in a benign way

83
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:43,839
it's as if we're very softly saying to ourselves it's okay

84
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,000
it's okay

85
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,279
compassion of practice

86
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:12,640
and as we start to settle like this then noticing

87
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,680
are there many subtle adjustments

88
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,200
subtle adjustments to our posture

89
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:31,480
more settled more at ease

90
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:51,839
are there any adjustments to how we're involving

91
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,519
awareness in our being

92
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,360
can it be invited to be allowing

93
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,600
and accepting

94
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:17,839
can can there be a softening of doing

95
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,600
and opening the beak

96
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,880
and as you make these subtle adjustments

97
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:55,120
can you notice what the consequence of it is

98
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,120
it's like noticing is soaking up

99
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,920
what's being experienced

100
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,800
and if the attentiveness of noticing

101
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,600
is starting to dissipate or has wondered

102
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:11,520
just return the basics of body and breath

103
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,120
physical sensations

104
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,640
it's your posture shifted

105
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,840
some part of your body tightened

106
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:02,640
it would be helpful to put some emphasis on allowing the

107
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,080
inhale to be deeper

108
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:13,480
or along we may exhale to be a little longer

109
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,039
so

110
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,919
you

111
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,720
noticing if there are particular thoughts that

112
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,520
keep repeating

113
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:48,720
or is there an emotional disposition

114
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,760
that's coming into being

115
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:07,760
and the opening to it it's a teaching about me

116
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:17,880
it's another interruption to teaching

117
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,840
what is it register in the body

118
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,799
does it affect the breath

119
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:35,589
[Music]

120
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:43,520
sometimes it can be very instructive to watch the shift that happens within

121
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:51,120
us as we shift from meditating

122
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,559
to whatever's next

123
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:05,760
sometimes it can be a teaching about attention

124
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:13,480
involvement that affects consciousness

125
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:23,840
expresses itself for some kind of doing or not doing

126
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:30,159
so try to notice what happens what's the shift

127
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,840
when the bell rings

128
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,520
um

129
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:55,089
[Music]

130
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,320
um

131
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,919
so good morning again

132
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:33,840
you know the process of meditation of mindfulness

133
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:43,520
in a in the context of stimulus it offers us an opportunity

134
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:50,799
to heighten our senses to enhance our capacity

135
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,480
to experience

136
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:02,720
and so sometimes that's a wonderful gift especially when it's a pleasant experience

137
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:08,240
yeah something

138
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:13,679
energizes us says something that is soaked up

139
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:22,159
as a kind of nourishment something opens up our gratitude

140
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,080
our appreciation for the moment

141
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:33,679
i think sometimes it's unpleasant that something in us

142
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:41,278
is agitated distressed

143
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,559
the challenge of practice is to

144
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,760
engage them both

145
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:02,158
maybe in a human way we could say the engagement of the pleasant

146
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:10,360
is a kind of encouragement to our practice it's kind of reassurance

147
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:22,559
maybe we want to tell ourselves oh i'm making some kind of progress

148
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:28,080
and maybe we are if you want to think of opening to

149
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:35,039
pleasant as progress and for most of us

150
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,799
it is a beneficial thing

151
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:49,278
and it helps to create a reassurance and a trust

152
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:57,200
that the life for living

153
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,559
the being we are can be

154
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:08,440
validated and embraced for just what it is

155
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:16,799
and then there's a way in which engaging the unpleasant

156
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:23,200
can actually have the same qualities yesterday i quoted martin luther king

157
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:31,440
you know where he said challenging experiences can be both educational and transformative

158
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:38,799
yesterday afternoon i was at a meeting at the zen center

159
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:46,799
practice and i'm scheduled to lead a one-day sitting

160
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:53,760
saturday after next and as we it was a planning meeting

161
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:59,519
and then in the planning meeting someone said well we haven't advertised

162
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:04,960
it and i thought

163
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:11,520
what i haven't advertised it and then i said

164
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:18,158
well maybe we should cancel it but actually as i attended to my own

165
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:23,520
experience there was a kind of

166
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:28,480
frustration that it hadn't been advertised

167
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:35,000
there's a way in which i took it personally

168
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:42,240
this impacts me and that statement

169
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:49,760
even though i said it in a matter-of-fact way you know maybe we should cancel it

170
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:55,760
you know in an emotional way it was an expression of

171
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,838
my frustration and disappointment

172
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,760
and then that group of us it's about five people

173
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,800
and usually we get along very well

174
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:22,480
usually the feeling in the room when we're going through these planning things

175
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:29,960
is kind of fluid cooperative and appreciative

176
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:39,040
so having that feeling of frustration disappointment

177
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,560
agitation was in contrast

178
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:49,599
to how i usually feel and so this often happens for us you

179
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:55,599
know our meditation and our dedication to it

180
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:03,680
it helps to create a benevolence and a spaciousness

181
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:13,119
and then that stands in contrast to our moments of contraction or moments of disappointment

182
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:21,440
our moments of frustration and in a way they become more poignant

183
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:27,839
it's like we're more open to them and we feel more

184
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:34,880
so one of the challenges of practice is to uh

185
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:43,920
despite that despite the the intensity of the unpleasantness

186
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:49,359
to still find within ourselves the resource

187
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:55,040
to acknowledge to notice and acknowledge

188
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:01,760
okay this is how it is and so yesterday when i was noticing and

189
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,880
acknowledging that

190
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:14,160
what happened to my mind was then

191
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:20,880
i asked what happened yeah how come

192
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:26,000
that had turned out the way it turned out that it wasn't advertised

193
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,680
it actually it was a complicated but logical reason

194
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,800
you know it wasn't that someone had done it with

195
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:42,000
the intention of hurting me it was like there was a miscommunication

196
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,720
of this person puts it on the website and this person connects it to the

197
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:54,480
online program and they hadn't communicated

198
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:02,320
and so it hadn't been promoted

199
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:10,240
but as i listen to that as i took in

200
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:16,400
what's going on you know so we have an experience

201
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,520
and something in us takes it personally

202
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,880
positive or negative that's our inclination

203
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:33,359
but there's also a different kind of anchor how come

204
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:40,000
how come this moment has or this interaction

205
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:45,440
has come in to be not so much

206
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:51,920
that our mind gets busy making a story but that we're opening up

207
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:58,640
to what's going on you know especially when we're relating to other

208
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:05,280
you know i think opening up to their perspective

209
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:11,359
because usually there's some variation between their perspective and ours

210
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:16,720
you know i think there's something for us to learn in the moment

211
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,599
so this way in which our

212
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:32,400
our emotional response even when it's unpleasant for us

213
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,359
if we can remind ourselves to

214
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,078
knead it with the inquiry

215
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,760
and sometimes the inquiry is

216
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:57,599
the the interaction between ourselves and others

217
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:04,559
and then sometimes it's internal

218
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:14,880
what was i feeling or what am i feeling and what for

219
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:22,240
what thoughts what perspectives what conclusions am i really re creating

220
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,480
in relationship to that feeling

221
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:37,280
and then as we relate in that way in that process of discovery

222
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:43,359
and there's an extraordinary thing can happen for us

223
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:51,560
we start to see what's happening and we start to see through it

224
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:59,839
this is this is we start to see it oh okay this is what's happening in this moment

225
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:06,680
and we start to see and it's just this moment

226
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:14,160
it's the occurrence of this moment it's not the totality of reality

227
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:21,839
even though my mind wants to conclude oh this is how it is

228
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,359
judging others oh this is a negligent person

229
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:37,200
and when we can explore oh and how this come to be

230
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,640
i lose the process in interactively then we listen to

231
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:48,800
others and then intra intrapersonal

232
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:55,359
we look at how we had the feeling

233
00:41:55,359 --> 00:42:00,720
what the what the feeling evoked in terms of thoughts and judgments

234
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,520
and how that led to conclusions

235
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:14,000
we see it and we see through it

236
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:20,400
the very interesting thing for us as we do that

237
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:27,680
it it invites us in in a

238
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:32,880
affirming way to trust our practice

239
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,960
ah when we learn something

240
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:45,160
about who we are about how we're interacting

241
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:52,240
it evokes within us a certain kind of trust and confidence

242
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:59,839
in the practice and as martin luther king said it can

243
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:07,359
also have a transformative quality because as we see it

244
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:14,560
and rather than just drop into our habitual way of responding

245
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,000
we see the possibility of a different response

246
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:28,960
and when we take that different response something in us is relieved

247
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:37,400
something in us is heartened by the discovery of possibility

248
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:49,040
but even difficult experiences unpleasant experiences challenging experiences

249
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:55,838
frustrating experiences offer us something

250
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:02,400
and and if we can remind ourselves that even though

251
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:08,560
the the first response can be one of pushing away

252
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:15,520
you know which is essentially what frustration annoyance agitation is

253
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:20,880
it's a kind of no i'm not going to

254
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:28,400
go with this i don't like it somebody's to blame for being wrong

255
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:36,960
when we can go beyond that we cannot let that be definitive

256
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,760
conclusive end of story

257
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,119
when we can turn towards it and notice it and

258
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:53,040
experience it it can have

259
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:59,680
a teaching for us it can create

260
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:06,880
another story that can create an alternative conclusion

261
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:16,680
and that's encouraging for us

262
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:25,119
when we have the difficult experience and we fall into habitual

263
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:33,839
disappointment discouragement frustration that's discouraging for us

264
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:40,480
when we evoke this alternative we're encouraged

265
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:46,720
as martin luther king says we're educated and

266
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:51,839
it holds the potential for transformation

267
00:45:54,640 --> 00:46:00,720
so maybe today when you feel something disappointment

268
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:07,680
discouraging you can remind yourself of that and see

269
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:15,040
what's going on and maybe it's interactive you know

270
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:21,680
like when i asked the group yesterday what i asked one person in particular

271
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:27,200
they they explained it to me when they explained it to me i thought oh well that makes sense

272
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:33,440
this person did that and then they went on vacation and so this other person

273
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:38,560
um draw a conclusion from what they've done

274
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:45,119
and didn't advertise it it all made sense

275
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:50,640
it was something that needed to be mended but

276
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,359
still it made sense

277
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:01,599
so maybe today you'll be blessed with something that

278
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:08,720
annoys you you'll be instructed by something that

279
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:15,200
frustrates frustration or disappoints you

280
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:24,400
so thank you whatever the day turns out to be may you

281
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:31,040
enjoy it and be supported by it

282
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,040
okay
