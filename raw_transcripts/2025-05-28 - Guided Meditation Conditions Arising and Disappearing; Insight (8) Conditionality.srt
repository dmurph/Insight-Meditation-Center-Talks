1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:08,720
hello and welcome and for today's guided meditation as a

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,920
way to support the teaching afterwards I'd rather than some

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:22,840
instructions I'd like to offer you um Hello and welcome like to offer you a

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,320
um kind of an analogy or

5
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:38,559
metaphor today um the coming down here today I biked down to IMC and uh I was wondering about

6
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:47,280
the weather uh in one direction to the north the clouds that I call them clouds

7
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,760
were uh very dark and seemingly heavy and there was kind of a a cool crispness

8
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:01,199
in the air like uh crispness that was like Christmas like Christmas confusing

9
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,320
myself um uh a cool crispness in the air

10
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:13,040
that um uh it indicated to me that rain was coming so I was looking at all this

11
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:20,400
trying to make sense of it and I looked at my phone for the weather that they provide on the app and uh it said it was

12
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:29,040
cloudy through the morning and then it was going to be um sunny in the afternoon and uh and I knew

13
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,240
that in the last week or so we've had a lot of fog strong heavy fog coming in

14
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,960
from the coast and I thought maybe that today was just another uh you know rather intense version of it so I

15
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:48,799
decided to bike down some years ago my wife and I were at about 10,000 ft elevation in the

16
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,920
Sierra Mountains high up beautiful place we had lunch in this beautiful little

17
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,399
lake and we're just resting there um and uh we could see even higher peaks a

18
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:07,280
little bit to the west and um and the the sky was uh

19
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:14,959
completely blue and free of clouds and then there would be um we

20
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:21,800
would watch and kind of directly above some of the highest peaks they would

21
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:28,319
form a little cloud you know it was one of the littlest clouds I could imagine

22
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:34,519
there being in the sky a little puff would uh appear high high up in the

23
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:43,120
sky and um and then uh it would dissolve and not be there and then

24
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,720
another one would form and dissolve and disappear and it was kind of like magic

25
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,959
it was almost like watching something um uh arise out of nothing

26
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:02,959
and then disappear into nothing so I knew that what was happening was that uh the the again the coastal uh

27
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,400
weather uh was blowing moist air towards the Sierras and it would be pushed up as

28
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,640
it close to Sierras and at the highest peaks it would be pushed up the highest where it was cool enough for the

29
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,640
moisture to to form little cloud and then probably the wind was blowing it to

30
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,680
the further to the east where it was warmer and it would um or something and

31
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,159
it would um uh the cloud would disappear again so I kind of knew what was uh you

32
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:40,560
know you know the unseen world I knew something about but what was remarkable was that

33
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,040
uh was this watching the arising of the cloud and the

34
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:52,720
disappearing and um and the vantage point of being at ease peaceful calm

35
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:59,439
um watching the the birth of a cloud kind of understanding the simple air uh

36
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,959
atmospheric conditions that were operating and uh and being delighted and

37
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:11,159
amazed by it and the contrast of today with all the clouds and I could probably

38
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:17,519
construct an atmospheric explanation for what we have but uh my mind was

39
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,919
concerned about is it okay to bike down to IMC you know do I need to maybe it's going to rain and my bicycle will get

40
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,919
wet and what will I do and and how do is this these clouds clouds are going to

41
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,960
rain later and it was all this world of predicting and thinking and wondering

42
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,000
what to do that was very different world than the world just watching the child

43
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,240
being born and disappear and um and meditation is a

44
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,520
little bit like going from one the first the complicated ated world of many

45
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:59,520
things and many conditions coming together and predicting and wondering and analyzing figuring out and kind of

46
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:07,199
kind of conceptualizing about it to a kind of quieting and stilling and and to

47
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,280
be able to observe a single thought

48
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:19,600
arise and pass a single sensation come and go and we start seeing the the

49
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:26,000
simplicity of the details of our experience and uh and but the idea is

50
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,680
we're there resting after uh being at ease comfortable

51
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,840
peaceful kind of like we were my wife and I were kind of just resting on an

52
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:44,479
edge of a lake looking up at the sky so so this idea of meditation is just

53
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:50,639
there to become still enough quiet enough in the present moment

54
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:56,800
enough and oriented not towards the big concepts of today tomorrow is it going

55
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:05,919
to rain or not going to rain but right now in such a way that in the present

56
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:11,600
moment we see the birth of a thought and because we're not going to

57
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:18,280
participate in it so much it fades away the birth of a

58
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:24,080
feeling the birth of a perception of a feeling some feelings emotions seem like

59
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,400
they're have a constant presence but there's the perception of

60
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,639
it and simple simple perception that arises

61
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:42,240
and comes and goes there's the breath the inhale is like that cloud

62
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:50,479
that is born and then ends and then gets born again

63
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:57,680
so assuming a meditation posture and gently closing your

64
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,680
eyes and to become

65
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:10,440
established here and now in this

66
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:16,599
body taking some fuller breaths to feel your body on the

67
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:23,560
inhale a full feeling broad wide feeling of the

68
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:29,360
body and on the exhale relaxing the

69
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,840
body settling in

70
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,039
and then letting the breathing return to normal

71
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:03,560
and for three breaths relax your body as you exhale

72
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:30,160
and then for three breaths on the exhale quiet soften the

73
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,638
thinking mind

74
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:07,760
and then to settle in to the simplicity of

75
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:17,040
breathing not the complex thoughts about breathing

76
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:26,040
predictions about breathing or judgments about it but at the most basic level of

77
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:35,399
breathing seeing watching the beginning the first

78
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:41,720
appearance of inhaling the

79
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:48,800
inhale coming into fullness then ending

80
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,839
and the exhale

81
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:10,480
begins goes through its full

82
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,279
movement and then fades away

83
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:41,839
and this very simplicity of watching the coming and going of inhale and

84
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,839
exhale

85
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:53,560
it might highlight how much thinking there might be going

86
00:10:53,560 --> 00:11:00,399
on how much conceptualizing complicated

87
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:12,839
ideas be amazed that the mind can do this

88
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:24,399
be amazed at a mind that can be clouded filled with clouds of

89
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:38,760
thought and then come back to that simple place in the natural

90
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:44,399
world where you're watching the natural unfolding of

91
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,079
breathing in and breathing

92
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:57,360
out amazed at the comingings and goings of

93
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,160
perception of breathing

94
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:09,159
there's that complicated world of thoughts and ideas past and future

95
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:18,640
and there's the simple world of what appears in the

96
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,679
present the

97
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:35,520
perceptions something is heard something is

98
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,880
seen something is

99
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:54,559
felt some new thing or old repeated thing is thought the thought arises

100
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:04,960
How can you settle back relax into the present

101
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:13,280
moment to watch the comingings and going of perceptions and

102
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:24,480
thoughts by watching the new every new perception as it comes into

103
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:32,720
existence and then something else and something

104
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:44,720
else and all this can be seen in the comingings and going of

105
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,840
sensations of breathing

106
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:57,200
if you're simple enough with your presence just here for the comingings

107
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:04,000
and goings of perceptions you might

108
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:11,360
notice there's a perception of something a feeling a

109
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,640
hearing and then there's a thought about

110
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:22,320
it or there's a thought that

111
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:33,879
arises and that conditions some feeling in the body

112
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:54,799
that things arise in awareness based on

113
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:05,640
conditions that come together for its appearing

114
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,240
and as we come to the end of the

115
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,760
sitting to appreciate

116
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:16,000
that the desires we have can condition how we see the

117
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:23,640
world and if you desire kindness

118
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:29,480
compassion if you desire to support the well-being and happiness of

119
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:39,000
others if that's the wish then we see the world differently

120
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:51,080
we see the world in such a way that we care for it more

121
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:07,759
and one possibility of meditation is to be more deeply

122
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,480
connected to the heart's

123
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:22,760
wish to bring greater peace safety compassion

124
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:29,679
love into the world for the benefit and well-being

125
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,480
of

126
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:42,240
others may it be that our meditation

127
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:51,840
practice is a condition for wishing for the welfare

128
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,960
and happiness of everyone

129
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:04,158
wishing may all beings be

130
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:10,000
happy may all beings be

131
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:16,000
safe may all beings be

132
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:22,440
peaceful may all beings be free

133
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,559
and may these

134
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:34,679
wishes condition the eyes by which I see the

135
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:41,000
world may I see the world with love and care

136
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,289

137

thank you [Music]

139
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:59,120
hello and welcome to the next talk in this series on insight

140
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:04,200
and this week I'm talking about five different categories of insight that

141
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:10,960
um um can be experienced that uh fit into this at least for the Buddhist idea

142
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:16,679
of insight the first day was personal

143
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:24,039
insight this yesterday I talked about um seeing um the difference

144
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:30,000
between appearances and the recognition of the

145
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:37,679
appearance the naming of it the remembering what it is and how one has a little bit more to

146
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:45,360
do with the senses the sense doors the sense contact with the world and the other has to do with how we understand

147
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:51,440
the sense contact how we recognize it as something and um and if we have these

148
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:58,480
two uh completely joined together as if they're the same thing then we can't see

149
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,919
either one clearly and things become kind of solid and have kind of a solid

150
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:12,399
existence so if we don't see uh so if um some food appears in front

151
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:17,960
of us someone offers us food and um and

152
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:27,200
uh and so we see food but we don't just see food we see an offering but we see

153
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:34,559
we see it through the lens of um oh uh this is something I don't like this is u

154
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:43,039
this is one of my least preferred dishes and uh and now the whole thing is

155
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:50,080
tangled up together as one big knot of the food the offering not my favorite

156
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:55,919
food i don't really want this they should have known better and how what am I how am I going to deal with this what

157
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:01,279
am I going to do here and um and you know it's becomes this

158
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:08,399
big knot um but if we can see each step along the way oh there's there's an

159
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:13,679
offering there's food and a recognition of food there's an offering recognition

160
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:19,000
of offering there's a rising of uh not preferring

161
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:26,159
this there's that thought and then uh uh there is that impulse to want to do

162
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:32,399
something about it and um and then we see that impulse clearly

163
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:40,559
and because we see it curly maybe we don't do anything about it we don't grimace we don't uh show our distaste we

164
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:49,320
don't we just kind of graces gracefully gracefully maybe just receive the the food so to be able to see the component

165
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:54,640
parts of what's happening the experience and our relationship to it that's more

166
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:00,720
of a mental world uh gives us a lot more freedom to be wise and careful with what

167
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:07,919
we do in um in the next insight is um that

168
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:14,480
uh can happen sequentially it can that really is highlighted because of our ability to see difference between a

169
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:22,280
sensation and recognizing what it is an experience and then the relationship we form to it is that

170
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:28,240
um is to see conditionality insight into uh the

171
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:35,280
conditions how one thing arises and something else that's a condition for something else arising i've sat minding

172
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:41,760
my own business in meditation very quietly and um and so I don't know why

173
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:47,118
at the moment but there's maybe some thought arises i'm sure it arose because

174
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:54,398
previous conditions I didn't see but uh thought arises and now uh maybe it's uh

175
00:34:54,399 --> 00:35:02,359
concern about something that was difficult with someone and I can feel fear arise in my belly that thought

176
00:35:02,359 --> 00:35:07,760
arose and that was a condition for fear in my belly uh there's no so then

177
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:14,240
there's no mystery if I didn't see the thought arise I just feel the fear in my belly uh and I just kind of keep

178
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:19,480
ignoring it then after a while I don't know what the original condition was that stimulated

179
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:25,400
it it can go in the other direction sometimes there's a a s sensation in the

180
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:33,200
body and um and uh the um so so I had a little tinge in

181
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:41,440
my back this morning so that was a little bit of pain and I've had back problems before so um I could see that

182
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:48,400
based on that there started to be thoughts about how do I be careful with this do I have to do some exercises do I

183
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:54,000
have to kind of go through the day a little more carefully here and so there was a and there was a cause and effect

184
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:02,720
relationship or uh this arose then that arose and um and so at some point when

185
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:10,480
the mind gets quite quiet and settled and the mindfulness gets clear in the present moment the that gives us a

186
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:16,800
vantage point gives us a a a vantage point from which a vista point to gaze

187
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:23,920
upon the present moment and being able to see the uh the simplicity of a

188
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:30,000
condition and the and what arises from that condition what that condition uh

189
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,040
evokes for us and things aren't a mystery anymore things aren't glued

190
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:41,280
together entangled caught in knots and um and we see that nothing has some

191
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,480
inherent existence nothing has some permanence or weight just because it's

192
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:53,200
there in our mind which it tends to have if everything is knotted together into a big ball of judgments and fear and

193
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,839
concern and history and past and present and all seems to be kind of in a big

194
00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:06,800
knot but to see oh with this comes that with this comes that and then there's

195
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:14,240
more space to leave it alone to not act on it to not uh take it on as a as a

196
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:21,400
truth or as a as a something that has to be dealt with it's just we can see more

197
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:26,960
clearly and some people when they come to this stage this form of insight um

198
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:33,040
it's not required exactly so we don't go looking for it it's um it's really comes

199
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:39,280
from being settled but some people found it's really eye opening for some people

200
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:45,040
um it they feel tremendously empowered they feel tremendously like now they can

201
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:51,440
imagine what freedom is like because uh they see the space between a stimulus

202
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:59,400
and a response uh they see that uh stimulus is one thing response is another a stimulus

203
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:06,240
might a stimulus might uh it doesn't have to go into something else because

204
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,680
at some point as we see the these things things things these things arising one after the other one condition leading to

205
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:20,160
another at some point we don't participate it we don't get involved we don't act on it we're not we don't come

206
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:26,160
under its influence and so this morning when I felt my back pain uh I wondered

207
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:34,160
about it and uh spent some time thinking about it that was the condition for those thoughts was the back pain and um

208
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:41,520
and uh and then I thought you know I don't think that this uh level of pain which was very slight warrants much

209
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:46,720
concern uh at this point so I think I've done enough thinking about it so I think

210
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:52,720
I'll put it down if the pain is there again I don't know if I need to really get involved in those thoughts so I

211
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,920
might want to think about it but I have other things to think about or I would rather just be present for what I'm

212
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:05,599
doing at the moment so I just leave it alone so this is called insight into

213
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:11,280
into intercond conditionality and uh and kind of uh to

214
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:20,680
get to drop into it in a deep way it's kind of like entering into a different world uh a world where nothing is really

215
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:27,920
solid nothing is absolute in our direct experience and we can even see that uh

216
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:38,320
the impersonality of certain things that um that uh uh uh a certain sensation

217
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:44,400
arises and with that comes a thought and uh and it just kind of the thought wafts

218
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:53,359
up like the cloud I saw in this kind of being formed in the sky and then disappearing or as um a rainbow appears

219
00:39:53,359 --> 00:40:00,640
and then it disappears that um there's a there's a

220
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:07,359
um a sight of a bicycle that's kind of shiny and new that's the sense

221
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:13,359
experience more or less and then with the mind there's a thought maybe I

222
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:18,960
should get a new bike and we see that the seeing of the the bicycle conditions

223
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,720
the arising of the thought if I hadn't seen that then I might have come I might

224
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:31,599
have just galloped off into thoughts about the new bike and uh and and but

225
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:37,280
because I could see so clearly the new bike the bike should I get the thought

226
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:44,800
should I have a a new bike I could just leave it alone i could my wisdom could operate and I could say you know I don't

227
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:51,040
need a new bike i have a perfectly good bike and um and uh let's not uh gallop

228
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:56,560
off let's not get swept up in those thoughts um and so there's a sense of of

229
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:04,480
freedom there oh and the thought should I get into a bike that is u almost like not my

230
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:10,880
thought it's almost like I didn't plan to have that thought i didn't um uh it

231
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:17,440
wasn't my wish to have that thought why exactly that thought arose from the different conditions in my psychology I

232
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:22,880
don't know but I don't have to take ownership of it i don't have to make it

233
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:28,640
something that um um make me out of it it just there was seeing a bike there

234
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:33,760
was a thought about maybe I should get a new bike and it just like it comes and

235
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:42,040
it goes it's just like a cloud in the sky that comes and goes a rainbow that appears and disappears that

236
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:48,079
um uh that um things are just things come and

237
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:54,359
things go and uh and then it's much life is a lot simpler and

238
00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:59,599
easier and so so as I said before that this is a for some people uh this

239
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:07,520
becomes a very clear and strong insight that uh it they feel wow some people

240
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:14,440
even start feeling that this is so clear and powerful that they think that now they have tremendous wisdom they must even be

241
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:19,920
enlightened because the clarity by which they see this and they see that they

242
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,599
kind of begin seeing everything through the lens of conditionality that X X

243
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:33,440
arises then Y arises X occurs and Y occurs and um so but it but the

244
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:40,599
condition for it for this really to go go strong is the mind is deeply

245
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:47,440
settled and um and concentrated this is why samadei is so helpful and supportive

246
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:53,359
that we drop into a deeper samadei and stillness and capacity

247
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:58,640
really be here in the present moment content and happy and full the

248
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:05,040
distracted mind is no longer operating and uh and now uh we're just in this

249
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:10,160
vantage point of ease and relaxation we're just watching the experience

250
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:18,200
coming and going and one of the things that insights then is this insight into

251
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:24,400
conditionality and this uh sets up the stage for um the next one uh next

252
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:30,000
insight the insight into ins one's called comprehension or insight which

253
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,440
involves understanding and that'll be for tomorrow

254
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:42,560
so I also feel that you know this entry into insight is a little bit more is more

255
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:47,839
seemingly more intellectual more conceptual and um and some people

256
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:54,599
associate meditation so strongly with the experience of getting calm and settled maybe samadei that's kind of

257
00:43:54,599 --> 00:44:02,640
exciting but uh but this is maybe seem now seems too heady and all that and um

258
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:08,560
but remember that the purpose of samadei is to be able to see in a new way and

259
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:13,839
these are the new ways that people see and to really do well it's not

260
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:21,079
intellectual it's not in the head it's actually the opposite it's to be really centered here and these become

261
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:30,160
revelations this is what gets revealed to us not something we have to think about or figure out or reme even

262
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:39,119
remember so uh the insight into conditionality is uh phenomenally important uh in the

263
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:44,400
in the in the teachings of Buddhism and all forms of Buddhism and for in our

264
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:51,319
practice it becomes an insight that's something we see clearly it's not a

265
00:44:51,319 --> 00:44:56,160
philosophy so thank you very
