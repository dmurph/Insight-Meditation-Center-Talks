1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:08,160
so in doing breath meditation and doing this

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,559
over these weeks from one perspective we're going through it slowly from another perspective we're going

3
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:20,320
through it quickly and i'm sure there's people who feel it

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,800
both way one way or the other and from the slow perspective

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:33,200
we're putting together slowly piece by piece the el the alphabet for breath

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:40,239
meditation all the little basic elements and and

7
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:46,800
learning you know once you learn the alphabet that gives you access to

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:54,399
a tremendous wealth of knowledge potential for communication writing

9
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:03,920
reading understanding all kinds of things that uh come alive with uh reading and writing

10
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:11,040
and so in the same way we're learning kind of the basic elements the alphabet in the sense of all the little things to notice and be

11
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:18,159
aware of as we're breathing and and then slowly over time these begin to be put together and

12
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:24,799
after a while it's you know you can read the book pretty quickly or easily maybe

13
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:31,439
and so after a while we get a sense of the all the little elements how they come together and

14
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:38,400
create the grammar of meditation and create the sentences of spirituality and freedom

15
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,720
so we're going to continue and uh with this um

16
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:51,920
with this uh our education and

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,479
the elements of breathing in meditation so

18
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,799
to assume a meditation posture and taking a few moments to settle into

19
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,479
your posture to

20
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:19,440
maybe sway a little bit front and back forward sideways

21
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,720
maybe twisting a little bit maybe making small adjustments

22
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:34,879
so that the the weight and the way your body is organized

23
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,640
can be one that is settling for you

24
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:48,840
that allows certain things to settle and so that taking your meditation

25
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,160
posture is a little bit of a homecoming or a little coming to a place

26
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,519
where you have some modicum of contentment

27
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,800
and so taking the time to feel that not to be in a hurry in meditation

28
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:15,040
and overlook the basic establishing your posture and in doing so

29
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:25,120
establish a mindfulness of the body establish a degree of embodiment in this

30
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:38,959
posture and then to close your eyes and

31
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,599
take a few moments to feel this body

32
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,640
okay sense how the what's happening in the body

33
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:58,080
all the different kinds of sensations that come alive in the body

34
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:06,400
and don't don't focus on any particular one just let your attention roam around

35
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,360
taking it all in

36
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:29,840
and if in doing so there are still some small adjustments in the posture it can still be a good thing to do

37
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:52,800
and then ever so gently ever so lightly

38
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,360
bring your awareness close to your breathing

39
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,080
not head long into it just kind of on the edges of it maybe

40
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,280
and begin feeling the experience of the body breathing

41
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:28,479
maybe coming to the breathing through your back and from there towards

42
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:39,840
the front lightly slowly

43
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,880
and taking a few moments to familiarize yourself

44
00:05:52,880 --> 00:06:07,840
with how the body's breathing

45
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:20,800
and letting your attention quietly roam around the various places in the

46
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,800
body where the movements and the pressures and the

47
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,840
release of pressures appear that are associated with

48
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,840
breathing

49
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,840
and perhaps as you exhale there's some places in your body that

50
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,599
the breathing can relax more

51
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:17,840
release as you exhale

52
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,319
perhaps as you exhale there can be a softening

53
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,840
in the breathing body

54
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:59,840
and feeling more fully the experience of inhaling

55
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:09,759
and ever so gently as you inhale inhale

56
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,720
more fully longer inhale

57
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:31,840
so in the as you inhale the chest expands or fully

58
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:41,839
maybe there's a lifting of the shoulders

59
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,839
and not breathing in so fully or deeply that you get winded

60
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:55,839
in a relaxed way

61
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,480
and as you inhale see if you can notice if there's any

62
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:29,120
upwelling feelings the way in which energy in your body or a lightning feel

63
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:35,760
feeling that of lightness feeling of movement that's

64
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,920
lifts upward through your torso and up towards the head

65
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:52,560
a little movement that is energizing

66
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:07,040
perhaps as you breathe in a little deeper than usual

67
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:18,880
there's a movement towards greater clarity especially if you let

68
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:33,839
the thinking mind get quiet as you feel it more fully

69
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:42,480
and energetics that is that moves in the direction of waking you up

70
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:51,040
awakening a clarity and a lightness

71
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:05,839
and if you do this breathe deeper breathing just very slightly

72
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:12,399
is there anything that feels pleasant in doing so in the upwelling is there an upwelling

73
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,800
that brings pleasure or pleasantness

74
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,800
maybe even delight

75
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,279
some people might feel there's things get brighter a little bit more

76
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:42,880
light in the mind and letting your

77
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:50,320
breathing return to normal but still on the inhale

78
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:57,839
is there any upwelling feelings that occur in your body

79
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:13,200
ever so ever so slightly movement which lifts and straightens

80
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:25,839
the spine

81
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:33,519
and then as you exhale ride the exhale

82
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:39,440
with a very simple quiet ah

83
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:53,839
to feel the releasing the relaxing

84
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:03,120
and then on the inhale to receive and allow the upwelling

85
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:10,639
of energy of brightness lightness

86
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,759
receive it with the receiving of the

87
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,839
in-breath

88
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:40,320
a releasing as you exhale that releases the edges of your body

89
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:49,839
releases tension in your body

90
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,399
will you release into a tingling vibration

91
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:03,839
warmth softness in the body perhaps

92
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:31,839
and then receiving allowing the upwelling of in-breath of the inhale

93
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,760
the exhale tends to be more for relaxation

94
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:59,839
the inhale more for energizing or brightening

95
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:38,720
and as you're breathing is there any feelings of pleasure

96
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:45,920
pleasantness the joy

97
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:56,480
that comes along with the body breathing in

98
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,160
the body exhaling

99
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:11,920
low that pleasure

100
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:23,839
to flow through your body as you inhale

101
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:37,839
maybe flowing in an upward direction or outwards

102
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:51,759
maybe it flows downwards as you exhale

103
00:16:51,759 --> 00:17:00,160
receive and let it spread through the inhale and ride on it as it in the exhale

104
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:06,720
let it flow it could be very subtle tingling and

105
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:12,798
warmth feeling of goodness

106
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:24,000
pleasure and as you breathe with a quiet mind

107
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,439
letting your thinking become very quiet and sensitive

108
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:38,000
so you're sensitive to feeling the pleasure that might be here

109
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:47,840
with your in-breaths and out-breaths breathing in and breathing out

110
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:07,840
there may also be unpleasant sensations as you're sitting here

111
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:17,200
don't don't don't ignore that they're there but don't give them any real attention

112
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:25,039
let your attention go with the pleasant sensations of breathing the

113
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:31,440
pleasant sensations of just sitting here in your body

114
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:38,159
as if they are big enough to hold what's unpleasant

115
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:49,840
as if they are a tender caring for what's difficult

116
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,320
and if the mind wanders off in thought

117
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,840
let yourself have a homecoming

118
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:12,320
into what's pleasant enjoyable contentful

119
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,840
in your body as you breathe

120
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,600
and as we come to the end of the sitting

121
00:24:54,799 --> 00:25:03,440
perhaps with this light touch a light touch with the breathing

122
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:11,440
and the breathing as it moves through your body letting it have a light touch

123
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:18,879
on whatever is tender or difficult in your body

124
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:26,320
very tenderly touch it with your breathing

125
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,960
touch it with your light awareness

126
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:42,559
just a light touch of recognition of accompaniment

127
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:49,039
so that whatever pleasantness and joy there is contentment

128
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:57,840
it shares itself tenderly with what is difficult

129
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:11,840
what is not so pleasant

130
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,480
and in our capacity to sit here

131
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,039
quietly contentedly

132
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:43,760
openly maybe softly

133
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:50,840
many different ways of you might feel at the end of a

134
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:57,760
meditation can you now lightly tenderly

135
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:07,840
just lightly touching opening to the suffering of the world

136
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,520
just touch the edge of the edges of it

137
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:23,440
no need to go into the middle of it challenges of our people you know and

138
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:31,679
don't know around the world a gentle soft

139
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:39,600
touch on the edges of their suffering arising out of your soft

140
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:49,200
light awareness soft light breathing

141
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:56,720
so their suffering doesn't disturb you and you don't disturb them

142
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:03,440
but you're there to accompany to recognize to clearly see

143
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:16,080
the world suffers

144
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,440
and then perhaps from whatever tenderness you have

145
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:28,320
towards the suffering world a tenderness that maybe comes from a

146
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:34,399
that's seeded in a place of meditative contentment

147
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:39,279
meditative ease or subtleness

148
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:49,120
and allow your compassion and care and good will

149
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:58,159
maybe to take the form of wishing well for others

150
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:04,240
wishing them happiness freedom from suffering

151
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:13,840
wishing them hell then well-being

152
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,159
may all beings be happy

153
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:31,760
may all beings be safe

154
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:41,039
may all beings be healthy

155
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:45,278
may all beings be free

156
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:55,840
and may all beings live together

157
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:09,840
in good will

158
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,919
you
