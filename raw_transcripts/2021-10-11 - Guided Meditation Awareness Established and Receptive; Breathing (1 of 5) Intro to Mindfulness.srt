1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:08,879
hello everyone and nice to be back here with you and uh

2
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:16,720
i want to begin with a analogy that i've taught before but i

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:24,160
think he makes the point well when my son was in

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,840
preschool so he was three and four years old

5
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,520
uh sometimes i'd visit the school wonderful school and the wonderful teachers

6
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:44,320
and it was fun to watch the kids running around chaotically in

7
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,920
the various rooms of the preschool and and it certainly was chaos and a lot of

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,680
joy watching and watching them but also seeing the joy in them

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:02,239
and at some point it was time to change the schedule to change what the kids were doing to get them ready for something

10
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:08,560
else and one of the teachers would stand in the middle of the

11
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,240
classroom and he would just stand there very still upright and the kids were running around

12
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,799
him and through his feet or all kinds of things they were doing but he was just standing there and then he would begin

13
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:28,320
to whisper talk very quietly and it was remarkable to watch then all

14
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,600
these little kids begin to kind of slow down

15
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,880
sit down gather around him until after a minute or two

16
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:45,119
all the kids were sitting quietly and had gathered together around the

17
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:51,680
teacher and then he would tell a story and they probably knew that this was the deal they recognized it

18
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,719
but this way of getting their attention was it was not you know a command like

19
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:03,119
you know he didn't uh you know was commanding them just you know shut up and come here and

20
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,800
um there was nothing like that he was just standing attentive in the middle of it all

21
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,440
and being quiet and all the kids gathered around and got quiet themselves

22
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:21,360
so this is a nice analogy for meditation practice that um

23
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,720
we are in a sense establishing ourselves

24
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,720
with awareness at the middle we're establishing the awareness we have the attention

25
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:39,760
we're going to use to be here becomes established kind of at the center center of our being center of

26
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:46,560
here where we're sitting and all the ways that uh all the ways that our thinking

27
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:53,519
and our feelings and everything gets us scattered spins us outwards the outflow and the scatteredness and

28
00:02:53,519 --> 00:03:00,319
about thinking about the past the future fantasy um the way that feelings keep us activated

29
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,599
and engaged and thinking and story making

30
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:13,519
because we have a awareness centered and established in the middle it kind of works as a gathering point

31
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,599
things start getting collected it's kind of like there's a little bit of a gravitational force

32
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:25,440
that uh without any more um

33
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:32,560
insistence then gravity may be in some ways something that because begins things begin pulling in coming in getting

34
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,680
settled gathered and it's kind of a special thing that

35
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,560
what we have to do is stay aware stay present in the present moment

36
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:51,760
and then this gathering begins happening it's collecting of ourselves and all the desperate parts the scattered parts

37
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:58,560
um collect together so we don't have to do so much the work of bringing the mind back

38
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,920
we don't have to do so much work of you know jerking the mind back or

39
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:11,920
being disappointed in ourselves all we have to do is to come back to being aware be here

40
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,199
and i like the word just here for that just here but here

41
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,960
open and aware of what's here present for what's here and then things begin

42
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,400
you'll probably see that things will slowly begin to come closer and closer and

43
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,120
there's less a tendency to wander off or or get involved in the scatteredness that'll still happen but just come back

44
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,520
to here to hear and perhaps to do that with a

45
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,639
with a quietness within not a forcefulness not a

46
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,759
not a you know in insistence not a

47
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,800
expectation just like the way that a loving kindergarten teacher would stand

48
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:03,199
there loving the kids being quiet and being present and beginning to tell a story that

49
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:09,720
gathers them together so um

50
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,280
assuming a posture

51
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,639
that allows you to establish mindfulness

52
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,840
establish awareness

53
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:35,919
lowering your gaze relaxing your eyes

54
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,600
not looking at anything in particular loose focus

55
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:51,000
and then gently closing your eyes that's comfortable for you

56
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,160
and taking a few long slow gentle breaths imagining

57
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,840
that as you breathe in it's like you're spreading your arms

58
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,720
wide to gather yourself to gather

59
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:32,720
all the scattered pieces and as you exhale you you bring it all in close in let it

60
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,319
settle as you relax on the exhale

61
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,680
breathing in deeply

62
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,160
a full embrace of all that you are

63
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:56,880
and the exhale letting it all relax here back to the

64
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,880
center

65
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:17,840
and then letting your breathing return to normal and on the exhale

66
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:28,080
relaxing different parts of your body with the idea that in relaxing

67
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:34,960
something is gathering settling back into the place of awareness

68
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,840
relaxing the face

69
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:05,039
on the exhale softening the shoulders and as you soften your shoulders

70
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:12,599
settling back into a place of awareness

71
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,879
being here

72
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,800
and relaxing your belly maybe almost as if you relax your belly

73
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:35,200
and it settles and there's a groundedness in here

74
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,839
a rootedness here

75
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:27,200
and then centering yourself in your breathing

76
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,640
being here not so much reaching out

77
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:41,040
to the breath to breathing or directing yourself to the breathing

78
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:48,000
but more being aware being present being available for what's happening

79
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,399
here and now

80
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,120
and more like allowing the breathing to find you

81
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,839
as if the sensations of breathing in your body

82
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:17,519
are arriving in the awareness that knows your

83
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,839
breathing

84
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,959
and when thoughts override your attention to breathing

85
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:47,360
re-establish the awareness the knowing

86
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,160
that receives the inhales and the exhales

87
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:01,839
as if breathing is part of the gathering together

88
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:09,519
and over time you'll notice that even the mind that begins to think

89
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,000
will feel like it too is known

90
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,839
as if it arrives in awareness and there's no need

91
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,279
to wander off with the thoughts

92
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:38,519
everything is arriving in awareness supporting

93
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,079
present moment awareness

94
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:50,320
and as part of welcoming the breathing into awareness

95
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,760
you can say the wording as you breathe in

96
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,600
but maybe with the idea of welcoming it as it arrives

97
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:10,880
you can say out as you breathe out welcoming the sensations

98
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,160
that come with the exhale

99
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:03,480
you might think of awareness as a place of rest

100
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:20,480
where all things gather together

101
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,400
to rest in the embrace of awareness

102
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:31,360
allow things to arrive in this restful place of attention

103
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,360
knowing

104
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:14,399
and for the next three or four breaths

105
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:19,600
see if you can relax more deeply

106
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,919
on the exhale

107
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:32,960
maybe relaxing something deep in your core

108
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,360
deep inside

109
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,960
that's agitated or

110
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:50,919
tense activated

111
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,640
deep relaxation

112
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:38,080
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

113
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:50,000
there is a wonderful reversal that can happen with

114
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,559
awareness that if you

115
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:01,720
do not direct your attention outward

116
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:10,398
if you don't direct your actively your concerns to outward into the world

117
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:19,760
but you allow yourself to be receptive so the world arrives in awareness

118
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:28,520
it's kind of like you're settling back and just available for things to be known

119
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:38,880
and when you do that with others and we're not distracted or preoccupied

120
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:46,240
with doing and directing and making and fixing and

121
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:54,640
protecting but deeply relaxed receptive available

122
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:00,720
to receive the experience of others

123
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:08,559
that makes room that allows for a deeper experience of

124
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:13,840
love of care

125
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,759
friendliness good will

126
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:40,039
the more we are receptive to the world

127
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:51,640
the more room it allows for these positive feelings for the world

128
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,760
and so at the end of this sitting to

129
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:05,039
allow the world to come back to you

130
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:12,559
of your community your friends your family colleagues neighbors

131
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:22,200
people in your neighborhood and out across the lands where you live

132
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:30,720
and to receive them to know them to be reminded of them with no obligation

133
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:36,799
nothing you have to do except to allow your heart to receive

134
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,519
their presence

135
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:49,200
and perhaps with a relaxed heart the heart then responds

136
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:56,320
with warmth tenderness care

137
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:01,000
and orientation of being friendly

138
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:16,320
and to give voice to this warm feeling of care friendliness

139
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:22,240
you can allow your heart to in a sense to say these words

140
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:29,799
may all beings be happy

141
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:38,000
may all beings be safe

142
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:47,559
may all beings be peaceful

143
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,320
may all beings be free

144
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:14,880
and may you your heart from your heart from your inner life

145
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,519
may their flow naturally easily

146
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:25,519
and inspiration to contribute to the welfare and happiness of all

147
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:32,880
beings may this generosity

148
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:40,440
spread out from us out into the world may all beings be happy

149
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:56,619
[Music]

150
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:58,960
so hello everyone and um here we are on monday

151
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:06,000
and for this week's uh theme and for the next actually maybe four or five weeks i

152
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,599
would like to uh go progressively through the basic instructions that

153
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:18,079
we give here at imc for a mindfulness meditation week normally we'll do a five-week

154
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:23,440
introduction to meditation course some of you have probably done it with us

155
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:29,599
and it's available the course on audiodharma and

156
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:36,800
the and it follows a sequence where it's five five weeks one evening a

157
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:42,560
week the first week we talk about just introduction to mindfulness and

158
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,760
then mindfulness of breathing and then the next week we talk about

159
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:54,398
mindfulness of the body as people settle any meditation the body

160
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:59,119
often becomes very

161
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,960
loud or clear often because it gets uncomfortable if you're not used to meditating

162
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:12,240
and then the next week we talk about mindfulness of emotions and then mindfulness of thinking

163
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:18,720
the fifth week there's a range of things that are talked about and um and that sequence is meant to

164
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:25,680
kind of slowly later steadily make later groundwork to a time when all of all those ways of

165
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:32,640
practicing all those areas are integrated together into a hole where we're practicing mindfulness

166
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:38,240
where depending on what is compelling what is predominantly what's happening the most

167
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:44,400
we might be aware of breathing the body the emotions thoughts and other experiences of our

168
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:51,280
life and this ability to develop an awareness that's available mindfulness is available

169
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,880
to the full range of our human experience is the goal of mindfulness practice

170
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,079
and that's uh valuable for many reasons uh one reason is valuable is then we

171
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:07,920
have a heightened attention to so many areas of our life things don't become remain things don't

172
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:13,200
remain unconscious things don't remain unknown or kind of

173
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:19,680
sidelined everything sooner or later comes through the the view the

174
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:26,720
the knowing of awareness and seen clearly also um

175
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:32,800
as we do this practice over time we start appreciating more and

176
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:39,200
more what it is to be aware what it is to be mindful and in particular

177
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:45,280
noticing all the extra uh baggage we bring along in this that

178
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,480
we put on top of the simplicity of awareness the expectations we have

179
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:55,839
the idea that we have to do a lot of things the idea of the being an agent and i

180
00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:01,200
have to prove myself i or i i shouldn't fail and this is you know that it's all

181
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:06,560
up to me me myself and mine to do it we might come with fears around being

182
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:12,240
aware and being aware of what's coming along it might be more of this kind of things we bring along with it

183
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:18,160
we might have um you know really big goals like you know ambitions around meditation that we

184
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:25,280
bring along and as we become more and more aware of all this extra stuff we bring along

185
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:31,920
we can start kind of shedding them and discovering the simplicity of awareness itself

186
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:39,440
and part of that simplicity eventually is that awareness exists can be present

187
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:47,520
without us doing it and an awareness becomes kind of autonomous

188
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:54,480
from our doing it our role is to allow for it to stay

189
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:00,240
close to it and it's a magical time a special time to feel that awareness is just kind of

190
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:08,480
the nature of who we are and we don't have to insert the self and agency and doing

191
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:14,720
into it and there's a shift in mindfulness that for someone who's a raw beginner

192
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:21,280
the practice does involve doing we're engaging in something that changing the direction changing the

193
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:28,480
course of our how our life is going from just letting ourselves wander off in thought and desires and aversions and

194
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,680
just kind of be caught up in things to waking up

195
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:40,400
to not being lost in the world but being

196
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:46,240
present in the middle of our experience they're really present really centered here

197
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:52,640
and and there's a doing coming back and and so applying ourselves to the breathing applying ourselves to the body

198
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:58,960
to these different areas that we pay attention to there's a sense of app like applying oneself and doing it

199
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:05,280
and partly that's because it's a it's an alternative to being lost

200
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:11,599
as that builds over time this sense of autonomous awareness

201
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:18,240
independent awareness becomes stronger and stronger and then awareness is more like receives

202
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:23,440
experience things arrive in awareness awareness is not something we have to do

203
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,560
it's more something we allow and there can be a sense that things just arrive

204
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:34,400
or arise within awareness and awareness

205
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:40,079
becomes freer and freer of even the sense of me being a doer the doer the

206
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:46,480
agent in a sense awareness becomes independent of of the usual ways in which we identify

207
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:53,599
who we are me myself and mine and the

208
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,599
and so the awareness um and so the mindfulness instructions that

209
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:04,800
we give have two sides to it it can have the side of

210
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:10,319
um something we do and uh so it's prescriptive this is what

211
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:16,560
we do and that's often the case for for certainly for beginners but at different phases of life different

212
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:21,599
levels of what's happening in our life it it's it's always coming and going these different ways of practicing

213
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,960
depending what's needed at a time if we're very experienced practitioners

214
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:33,839
really frazzled and agitated they might be better off applying themselves in the meditation

215
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:40,720
but as so prescriptively the other way that mindfulness works is the instructions work it's more like

216
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:48,319
they're not instructions what to do but instructions what to notice so it's descriptive of what arrives in

217
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:56,079
awareness when awareness is established awareness established it gathers together or allows to arrive the

218
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:01,920
experience of breathing the experience of the body the experience of emotions experience of thoughts

219
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:08,880
and there's a radical shift from being a doer to being an allower and that allowing allows for a different

220
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:15,200
way of participating in the world that's still very effective but very different than

221
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:22,160
you know being all up to me myself and myself to do and be and all this stuff

222
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:28,240
so in these next days i'm going to talk more about breathing and what i want to do for each of these

223
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:34,800
try to do each of these five days of each week of this series i want to

224
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,920
repeat the same kind of theme around each of them so that these become

225
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:46,319
a little bit more familiar regularly available to you at different times to really

226
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:52,800
understand different facets of this practice so on mondays and i'm not going to do

227
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:58,480
much time now but mondays the theme is going to be relaxation

228
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:05,040
and tuesdays the theme will be recognition wednesday's theme will be

229
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:11,280
respect thursday the theme will be restoring

230
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,880
and friday will be released so we'll look at each of these things hopefully and

231
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:22,000
and look at these different aspects of the practice in relationship to

232
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,160
breath body emotions and thoughts and then whatever we do the following weeks

233
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:33,599
and and so uh relaxation with the breathing we did

234
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,880
that a little bit in the guided meditation part of the function of coming back to

235
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:46,480
the breath over and over and over again and the mind wanders off and we come back is that

236
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:52,079
if we return to the breathing is the breathing then is the anchor for

237
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:57,760
having awareness established and and we relax it isn't so much that we

238
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:03,359
force ourselves back to the breath but it's more like we welcome ourselves back to the breath over and over and

239
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:09,839
over again so the breathing the regularity of breathing takes the energy away from the other

240
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:15,839
from ways where tents tense around our thoughts tense around our emotions caught up in things

241
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:22,800
and the more preoccupied we are in thinking the more attention there is in the system more force and pressure there

242
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:30,640
is and this gentle returning to the breathing returning to be aware of the breathing

243
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:36,880
begins to take away some of that energy that goes in keeping the mind and the heart and the body tense from our

244
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:43,839
concerns and then in addition the regularity of breathing helps us to relax the rhythm

245
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:49,200
of breathing for many of us and so you can even help that by

246
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,720
allowing yourself to relax on the exhale relax gently openly

247
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:00,480
for some people this focus of breathing is difficult sometimes that's

248
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:06,000
that's normal enough and it's just a process to work through that and be gentle and

249
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,760
patient and and not make a problem out of how difficult it might be the tension or

250
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:17,599
the holding patterns or the breathing or controlling the breath or something and it's well worth kind of spending

251
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:23,200
time to see if you can kind of work through it for some people if the

252
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:28,319
the breathing is not really the appropriate object for attention um

253
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:33,760
and um i've known people for example who had a maybe a near-death experience of

254
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:39,359
drowning or something else it was very difficult for them where breath was really a challenge

255
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:45,359
and so that the memory of that or the impact of that is such that breathing never really

256
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:51,280
becomes a good place to meditate and so for them sometimes body

257
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:59,200
just being rooted in the body kind of being grounded here in the body in some open way is much better there are other

258
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:06,000
options as well but but it's really nice to work through some of the difficulty if possible

259
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:12,800
around breathing and relaxing is a big part of it learning to relax with the breath

260
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:19,359
so that's the plan for this uh next period of time and i'm hoping that this instructions

261
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:26,160
and teaching i give will work both for people who are beginners or new but also they'll be

262
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:31,280
support for the people who are quite experienced in practice as well

263
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:38,319
the beginning practice is the practice and so in some sense the more mature people become in this practice

264
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:44,000
the difference between a beginner and a mature person is that a mature person is a better beginner

265
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,359
a more thorough beginner and finally i gave kind of said some of this but also

266
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:55,760
a little bit more yesterday morning for the sunday morning talker at imc a talk that was kind of done as an introduction

267
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:00,960
to this series that we're doing here now so some of you haven't if you haven't heard that you might go and listen to

268
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:06,640
that half an hour and it also sets the stage a little bit for what we're doing

269
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:12,480
so um thank you for today and i'm looking forward to sharing something that is so

270
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,960
something i love quite a bit so thank you
