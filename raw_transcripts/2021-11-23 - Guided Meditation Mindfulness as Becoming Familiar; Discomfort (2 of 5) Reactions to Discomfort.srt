1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:08,240
so warm greetings and

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:19,279
one of the important aspects of a regular meditation practice

3
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:27,840
is developing more and more familiarity

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,160
with your own body more and more familiarity with your own

5
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,920
mind and how the mind and body work together

6
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,000
how they connect and meet and you know to take the same

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,760
meditation posture more or less same but maybe every day

8
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,920
it we develop a heightened sensitivity to the subtle distinctions differences from one

9
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,680
day to the next the way the body is held the tension the patterns are breathing where the

10
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,880
breath is maybe a little bit held and where it's easy

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,880
and so and same thing with the mind we begin developing heightened sensitivity to the

12
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,920
differences and how the mind is is day to day from

13
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,799
even minute to minute what it's uh how much energy is in it how tired it is how

14
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,840
distractible it is how centered is so

15
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,759
all kinds of things and this is not incidental to have this heightened sensitivity

16
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:45,200
it's actually very important and the more we become sensitive to the subtleties of the body

17
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:51,119
and the mind the more interesting meditation becomes and more we have a an ability to kind of

18
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:58,960
begin seeing more deeply and offering more presence to our experience

19
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:05,119
and ability to relax more deeply so

20
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:12,319
to just keep becoming familiar so taking a alert

21
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:23,800
relaxed posture and gently closing your eyes

22
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:33,120
and before you start meditating to familiarize yourself with your body

23
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:40,400
how is it now what parts of your body are

24
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:49,000
tense tight what parts seem settled and relaxed

25
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,760
part of the subtle familiarity with the body is familiarity with the

26
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,080
minute differences in posture

27
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,599
the alignment of the spine

28
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,159
the placement of the hands even half an inch difference of where

29
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:35,879
the hands are can make a difference in relaxation of the arm and even the shoulders

30
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,599
in the position of the head on the neck

31
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,480
you might try tipping your head down a teeny bit

32
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,599
or bring the head back slightly

33
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,639
and then gently ever so gently

34
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,919
as if you're familiarizing yourself with what happens as you do so

35
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,479
take a few long slow deep breaths

36
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,680
deep enough that you feel the fullness but not so deep

37
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,320
that you feel winded

38
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,520
long relaxation as you exhale

39
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,840
letting your breathing return to normal

40
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:01,520
and gently familiarize yourself with the experience

41
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,599
of breathing

42
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,680
noticing the activity level of the mind

43
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,639
familiarizing yourself with the activity level of the mind

44
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:59,840
noticing any way in which the mind might be contracted or tense

45
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:07,000
or agitated or dull

46
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,759
and like your body might relax if you sit down in a nice easy soft chair

47
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,240
see if you can have the same movement of your mind as a mind

48
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:53,440
settles down into the body into the breathing

49
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
the mind settled on the body breathing

50
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:20,720
st at steadying the mind the awareness on the experience of

51
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,720
breathing

52
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:33,680
and as the mind is steadied on breathing

53
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:40,080
as you exhale let the thinking mind become quieter and

54
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,640
stiller

55
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,519
thinking slows

56
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,959
and as the mind gets a little quieter stiller

57
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:16,200
let there be a heightened sense of higher sensitivity to the experience of the body breathing

58
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:31,160
with awareness centered on breathing

59
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,120
so

60
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,919
you

61
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
foreign

62
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:40,240
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

63
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:46,880
to turn your attention inside out in the sense of turning now your gaze of

64
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:54,559
your attention on the world people you'll encounter

65
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:59,360
today tomorrow

66
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,320
into familiarize yourself

67
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:15,120
with your attitudes and feelings towards others

68
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,720
how is it for you

69
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,320
the people in your life

70
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,799
and without pushing away any way that you feel

71
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,398
to continue to turn this inside out of the heart

72
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:45,520
so the softness the peacefulness of the heart of your inner life

73
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:53,440
is the place from which you gaze upon the world of others

74
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:03,519
with a well-wishing heart a heart that has good will towards

75
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:09,518
others wish them well

76
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,640
may others be happy

77
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,840
may others be safe

78
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,840
may others be peaceful

79
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:32,039
may others be free

80
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:42,399
in ways in whatever ways that are easy for you today

81
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:48,799
perhaps you can contribute to that possibility may we live for the happiness and

82
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:56,760
welfare of ourselves and others may all beings be happy

83
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:18,969
[Music]

84
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:36,720
so to continue this topic of discomfort

85
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:43,480
it's a maybe a simple ordinary experience to feel discomfort

86
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:51,760
and there's so much to learn from it and there's so much

87
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:58,559
room for many of us to discover how to be freer

88
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:05,279
with our discomfort how not to be pushed around by it or react to it

89
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:13,360
how to be present for discomfort so that we see clearly what's happening

90
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,840
rather than being distracted by the discomfort

91
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:27,440
so one of the things to study when we study discomfort

92
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:33,039
and this is the task of this beginning of this week is to really stop and take a good look

93
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:39,840
at how you're uncomfortable when you're uncomfortable what's happening then

94
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:45,200
is to look for and see if you can understand

95
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:51,440
the unhelpful ways in which you react to discomfort

96
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:57,760
when you're somehow things are not comfortable for you whether it's socially or

97
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:04,320
physically or personally any anything at all that

98
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:11,200
what kind of unhelpful ways do you then respond to that react to that

99
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:17,118
what does what comes out of that discomfort what kind of behavior

100
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:24,398
that is not really in your best interest so there's a list in buddhism the famous

101
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:31,280
list called the five hindrances and they can be understood as five

102
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:39,520
unhelpful ways of trying to cope or deal with discomfort of any kind at all

103
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:44,720
so sometimes when there's discomfort we

104
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:51,040
go to desires we want something different we want to be sued we want to be to

105
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:56,800
escape we want to be distracted

106
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:02,000
we want things to be different and then how they are and we get pulled into this world of

107
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:09,040
wanting and desire and it can be quite strong and

108
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,560
sometimes in meditation you can spend a long period of times fantasizing

109
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:21,520
about something that's comfortable something that's you know an alternative to discomfort revealing

110
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:28,480
interpersonally it could be that we look to have

111
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:34,720
conversations or have activities with others that that somehow

112
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:39,838
bypass the discomfort and give us pleasure

113
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:47,599
sometimes people drink alcohol for this person this reason interpersonally the relationship is

114
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:53,280
uncomfortable and maybe there's tension between a couple

115
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:59,200
and the alcohol kind of just settles it away and

116
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:05,280
and breaks through the barriers of of the tension between them

117
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:11,040
and that and rather than staying in the discomfort and seeing the interpersonal discomfort as a

118
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:18,640
as a doorway to a deeper connection to each other to resolve something uh people go towards alcohol to kind of

119
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:24,400
just change the whole dynamics so there's all kinds of ways that things people do

120
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:30,320
watch television watches something another strategy

121
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:37,680
is hostility is to blame to be angry blame oneself blame others

122
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:44,800
be angry push things away throw things away stomp away run away out of hostility out

123
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,839
of anger this is i don't want this this is uncomfortable for me

124
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:55,119
and sometimes there's can be a spiral of of hostility that builds up anger

125
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:01,200
irritation that we're uncomfortable we're irritated that we're uncomfortable we indignant

126
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:06,640
that we feel uncomfortable and so then we feel more uncomfortable and there's a

127
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:13,520
pressure and it's building up inside and that makes us maybe more irritated or more aversive

128
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:19,680
and so it goes until something may be on really unhealthy happens

129
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:26,320
another strategy with discomfort is a kind of giving up a kind of collapsing around it

130
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:32,000
and maybe around the self-pity or around hopelessness or

131
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,520
lack of personal efficacy agency and just there's a guy and so there's a kind

132
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:43,760
of giving up that's uh characterized in buddhist languages sloth and torpor

133
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:49,200
and kind of shutting down like kind of numbing out

134
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:56,240
the the fourth strategy is uh restlessness and

135
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:02,000
anxiety restlessness and regrets anxiety and

136
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,040
regrets it's not so clear exactly what the classic words mean

137
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:13,040
but um there's a whole complex of things where that are energizing whereas sloth intorper is

138
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:19,599
numbing or you know makes us tired uh there's and becoming energized so

139
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:25,040
sometimes it's fear people aren't comfortable and they're afraid we're just going what's going to happen

140
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:32,960
sometimes people just get restless in it they're like a trapped deer or a rat that's kind of racist walking around

141
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:39,920
the cage and just kind of endlessly kind of looping and looping and just trying to take the energy of

142
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:44,960
restlessness and and give it some kind of expression with

143
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:51,920
you know in of um you know some kind of behavior you know that uh

144
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:58,320
chewing our to uh our fingernails or tapping a fingers or

145
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:04,160
reaching for a cigarette because it just we need something to do something that energy can go into something anything

146
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:11,359
all kinds of things and the the fifth is uh doubt

147
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:16,400
uh perplexity indecisiveness

148
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:22,960
we're kind of stuck kind of in a a hard place between knowing what to do and not to do we're not quite sure not

149
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:30,160
to hurt but here should we not be here and and who's at fault what's happening here

150
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:36,640
um and so there's kind of a swirl of confusion of delusion that goes on when we're uncomfortable

151
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:43,760
and am i allowed to take care of myself am i allowed to be comfortable and and i can't really blame someone else or

152
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:49,359
i'm supposed to be kind of you know you know supposed to be comfortable but

153
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:54,640
i'm not comfortable and what am i supposed to do here and i'm somehow wrong and i'm doing i'm

154
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:00,160
failing and something so so there's kind of a little description

155
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:07,119
of these five hindrances and perhaps somewhere in those you can see yourself occasionally

156
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:13,599
and and the task of in mindfulness practice the kind of instructions in mindfulness

157
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:20,640
is to be a connoisseur of these hindrances become a connoisseur of

158
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:27,920
how you react unhelpfully unhelpfully with uh discomfort

159
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:34,160
so when you when you're uncomfortable um so one thing is like yesterday just stop

160
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:42,560
and pay attention to it really get to know it become familiar with it and as you get more familiar with it now

161
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:51,440
see discover what your common reactive patterns are and seeing the common patterns is very

162
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:58,079
helpful because they're likely to reappear a lot and you can become you know your phd and

163
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:04,560
the entrances can be on the particular ones that are your specialty and uh and the idea serious is to really

164
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,920
get to know it well so that you can't be fooled by it so you can see it coming in

165
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:16,720
the distance so that you learn how to not give into it but learn how not to work with the

166
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:22,720
hindrances and it might be the discomfort you're feeling is a lot easier

167
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:29,760
if you uh tease apart or separate out the hindrances that are operating from the

168
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:36,480
discomfort itself the hindrances add power to the discomfort or add a kind of uh

169
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:42,960
um you know

170
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:49,040
kind of like they're they hinder our ability to see clearly

171
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:56,079
and so without the hindrances or with a hindrance a scene for what they are and put aside then maybe we can stay and

172
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:02,560
feel and be with the discomfort in a more direct way which we'll see in the rest of these days it's how useful that

173
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:07,760
is and what can open up so for today

174
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:13,839
um i'll become a work at work at maybe not in one day

175
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:20,160
but uh set your aim at at uh

176
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:26,960
when you get uncomfortable today look around and see what is your

177
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:33,200
unhelpful reactivity to that and then take it give yourself time don't let go

178
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:38,960
of it right away don't uh be upset with yourself for having this reaction

179
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,240
but rather kind of stop and take a good look so the bumper

180
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:49,839
sticker for today can be i stop for the hindrances i stop to look and study and how does it

181
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:54,960
feel in the body how does it feel emotionally why do i believe in them or why do i get

182
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:01,440
caught in them what's the dynamics there and what's the stickiness and what are the beliefs that come with

183
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,880
all these so um

184
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:12,319
so and if you really want to do do this kind of with some help

185
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:18,000
if you have any kind of friend or stranger or someone that you can tell them that you're doing

186
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,599
this exercise and uh and can you kind of share with them with you a

187
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:29,520
little with them a little bit through the day what you're discovering that might give a little bit more of

188
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:35,040
substance to the both the study and the understanding that comes from it

189
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:41,599
so um may your discomfort and your

190
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:47,520
reactions to them be the arena of mindfulness for this day

191
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,760
thank you
