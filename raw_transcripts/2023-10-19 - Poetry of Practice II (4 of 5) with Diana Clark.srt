1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:07,120
warm welcome to everybody wherever you

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:14,799
are all these different places before I turned on the recording I think it's beautiful that we all come

3
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:21,080
together in this way and maybe not surprisingly today I'm

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:27,039
going to continue on this series The Poetry of practice and so many things that we could say

5
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:34,399
about poetry but one thing that we could say is part of it power part of the way it makes an impact

6
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:40,239
on us is that allows us to see things in a different way maybe from a different

7
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:46,559
perspective a fresh perspective and sometimes it's even like a surprising

8
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,960
perspective which can bring you a sense of delight or maybe even a sense of like

9
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,480
wait what like with a twinge of uncertainty or you know shake things up

10
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:05,360
a little bit and I love this about poetry to be sure I'm not like a scholar in poetry or

11
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,119
literature or anything like that so I like poetry that has some imagery and

12
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:18,840
sometimes imagery allows us to consider things or experience things in a different way so today I'll share

13
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:25,560
another poem that uh has some imagery that I really appreciate this

14
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,000
poem and I'll drop in this poem after a short kind like guided meditation we

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,640
have a chance to settle and get quiet and then we can just allow this

16
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:43,439
poem to enter or touch Us in some kind of way

17
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,240
without having to analyze it or anything like that during the

18
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:58,840
meditation okay so with that as a introduction we can take a meditation

19
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,560
posture a figuration of the body configuration

20
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,360
maybe of the body that expresses Our intention to

21
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,160
meditate but also has some

22
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:28,760
ease traditionally this is in a sitting posture with a uprightness with a

23
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:34,640
steadiness usually focused around the spine the

24
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:43,680
spine being upright the vertebrae stacked on one another and letting the limbs just

25
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,720
hang the arms just hang from that

26
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:58,519
uprightness letting the spine be

27
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:03,560
upright and the muscles to be

28
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:16,760
relaxed feeling into that experience the experience that is being

29
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,760
had

30
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,680
now

31
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,720
and this is part of the art of practice is finding this

32
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,519
balance between alertness and

33
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:58,680
relaxation you can begin with feeling grounded

34
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,599
supported but whatever it is we're sitting

35
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:12,670
on or standing on or lying on or walking on whichever posture you're

36
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,740
[Music]

37
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:28,600
in feeling the pressure against the body feeling the

38
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:36,199
contact of the body with the

39
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:44,560
ground foundation and feeling the

40
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,880
stability that this contact

41
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,560
provides

42
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,638
and from this stableness can arise the spine or this sense of

43
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,479
uprightness

44
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:24,120
tuning into the bodily experience including the experience of

45
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:34,560
breathing feeling the movement of the body as it

46
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:44,880
breathes the obvious large movements as well as the more

47
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:52,039
subtle smaller movements without having to dig for

48
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:58,400
them but more receive them allow

49
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,199
them welcome them into

50
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:35,840
awareness noticing the real rym of the

51
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,360
breathing there's a way the Rhythm itself can be

52
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:02,080
supportive inhales and

53
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,280
exhales transitions between inhales and

54
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,960
exhales very simply just this pattern of [Music]

55
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,319
breathing being

56
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
repeated

57
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:31,600
it wouldn't be surprising if the Mind wandered and entered into imaginations

58
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:39,959
and stories and thoughts what if we don't make that a

59
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:45,480
problem instead we recognize that this is what Minds

60
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:52,120
do and we very simply gently Begin

61
00:09:52,160 --> 00:10:01,120
Again tuning into becoming sensitive to the experience of breathing

62
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:35,760
nothing in particular needs to be

63
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:42,000
happening we're just noticing what's

64
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:50,240
happening and resting our attention on the sensations of

65
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
breathing

66
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:33,519
and can we bring an attitude of warmth and

67
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:42,360
care this experience to this moment and the next moment and the

68
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:52,720
next softening any

69
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
harshness

70
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:37,320
bringing a sense of presence to the

71
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,440
moments being present for the experience of

72
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
breathing

73
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,879
I'm going to drop in a

74
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:44,840
poem nothing you have to do with this palem just allow it to be

75
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:54,519
received at the end of this meditation after I ring the bell I'll give the name of the poem and the

76
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,880
poet but now just allow the poem to be we

77
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:11,520
experienced the poem goes like

78
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:21,799
this and the secret Temple of my heart was an altar with nothing on it I love

79
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:29,159
nothing the pure potential of it sometimes when others journeyed here

80
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:36,440
I sense they were surprised perhaps even sorry for me as if it would be better with a Lotus

81
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:45,880
or a cross or a star or figurine or a photo of someone or a stone always

82
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:55,679
something I tried in fact to put things on the altar but no thing let itself

83
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:03,720
stay there was a day when in a single moment the altar had everything on it

84
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:10,360
and by everything I mean everything every bee every stick every plastic bag

85
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:16,799
and Beetle every crushed empty can every crumpled shirt every door handle Compass

86
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:22,279
broken thermometer Apple trash can tree

87
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:28,919
everything and it was so beautiful I wept for

88
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:37,919
hours oh the pure potential of it and then that altar was no longer in

89
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:46,240
some secret temple in my heart but everywhere everywhere A Place To

90
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,880
Worship everything a prayer waiting to be heard to be

91
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:57,039
touched and inside the most beautiful

92
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:05,159
nothing not even an altar which is oddly everything I I

93
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:11,200
can't say how sometimes when I'm quiet enough I

94
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:17,720
notice it sometimes when I get out of the way I

95
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,000
fall all the way

96
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
in

97
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,880
I'll read the poem again

98
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:13,559
and the secret Temple of my heart was an altar with nothing on it I love nothing

99
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:19,760
the pure potential of it sometimes when others journeyed here

100
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:26,320
I sense they were surprised perhaps even sorry for me as if it would be better with a Lotus

101
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:34,120
or a cross or a star or figurine or a photo of someone or stone always

102
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:43,360
something I tried in fact to put things on the altar but no thing let itself

103
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:49,240
stay there was a day when in a single moment the altar had everything on it

104
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:55,559
and by everything I mean everything every bee every stick every

105
00:24:55,559 --> 00:25:01,679
plastic bag and beetle every crushed empty can every crumpled shirt every

106
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:07,919
door handle Compass broken thermometer Apple trash can tree

107
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,520
everything and it was so beautiful I wept for

108
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,840
hours oh the pure potential of

109
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:26,679
it and then that altar was no longer in some secret temple in my heart but

110
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:31,799
everywhere everywhere A Place To

111
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:38,440
Worship everything a prayer waiting to be heard to be

112
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:43,840
touched and inside the most beautiful

113
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:52,080
nothing not even an altar which is oddly everything I can't say

114
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:59,399
how sometimes when I'm quiet enough I notice it

115
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:06,720
sometimes when I get out of the way I fall all the way

116
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,600
in

117
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:28,119
[Music]

118
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:46,069
[Music]

119
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:55,329
[Music]

120
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:02,760
so this poem has a curious title it's a very long

121
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:08,840
title I I'll say the poet is Rosemary traumer she spells her first name like

122
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:14,279
like Merry Christmas Rosemary traumer beautiful wonderful

123
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:21,519
poet and the title of this poem is after reading what's in the temple by Tom

124
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:28,159
Barrett I considered his question so Tom Barrett is another poet

125
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:33,840
who wrote a poem called what's in the temple so again the title of what I just

126
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:39,960
read is after reading what's in the temple by Tom Barrett I considered his

127
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,799
question by Rosemary

128
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:03,799
trummer so to continue our exploration of uh

129
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:10,080
poetry and practice or the Poetry of practice maybe I'll share something that

130
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,720
um John Brum who's a created a collection of mindfulness

131
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:21,639
poems none of the poems that I have been sharing are in this collection but he

132
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:28,799
um mindfulness teacher I believe and he writes that poetry presents a powerful

133
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:34,880
way to disrupt the habitual momentum of the Mind its automatic reactions and

134
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,840
obsessive self-c concerns and uh he continues saying to

135
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:48,480
fully enter a poem we must first stop and step away from the more immediate

136
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:54,080
demands of life and engage in an imaginative activity that has no obvious

137
00:31:54,080 --> 00:32:01,000
practical value I appreciate is bringing in this way in that to enter a poem is where we

138
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,320
have to stop or interrupt the normal way of thinking or the usual way of doing

139
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:13,919
whatever it is we do and to engage in imaginative activity so that if right

140
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:19,159
the poems do require a certain imagination especially ones that have a lot of

141
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:27,880
imagery and then I like that uh John brem includes it has no obvious practical value yeah right so often

142
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:33,279
we're concerned with what's practical but and lastly this is the

143
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:38,799
last thing I'll say from John Prem he writes more importantly we must shift

144
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:44,720
out of our everyday Consciousness the Speedy mind wrapped in its self centered

145
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:51,039
stories and projections right usually our minds are you know trying to make us

146
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:58,279
happy and avoid difficulties and Stave off pain and difficult

147
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:04,679
emotions but if I were to stretch John brm's uh discussion about poetry I would

148
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:11,159
say that um maybe to fully enterr a poem he's talking about it is to interrupt

149
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:19,480
the momentum of what the Mind usually does but what if we say to fully enter a poem is to enter the Temple of the heart

150
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:25,480
rather than being in the thinking of the mind and maybe in this

151
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:34,080
way the form of today's offering also kind of um is related to the content the

152
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,840
fact that it's a poem so I'll read this poem again one

153
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:45,440
that I just dropped into the guided meditation the title

154
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:52,440
is after reading what's in the temple by Tom Barrett I considered his question

155
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:58,159
and I'll unpack that a little bit uh after I read the poem The poet is

156
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:03,960
Rosemary traumer I I just love Rosemary trummer's

157
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:09,158
poems I she has a a lot of Whimsy and uh

158
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:14,440
and she's a Buddhist practitioner as well and it kind of shines through in her

159
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:21,158
poetry so here's the poem in the secret Temple of my heart

160
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:27,440
was an altar with nothing on it I love nothing

161
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:33,079
the pure potential of it sometimes when others journeyed here

162
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:38,200
I sense they were surprised perhaps even sorry for me as if it would be better

163
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:44,679
with a Lotus or a cross or a star or a figurine or a photo of something someone

164
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:51,599
or stone always something I tried in fact to put things

165
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:58,000
on the altar but no thing let itself stay

166
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,040
there was a day when in a single moment the altar had everything on it and by

167
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:11,000
everything I mean everything every bee every stick every plastic bag and Beetle

168
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,440
every crushed empty can every crumpled shirt every door handle Compass broken

169
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:24,359
thermometer Apple trash can tree everything and it was so beautiful I

170
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:30,119
wept for hours oh the pure potential of

171
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:37,760
it and then that altar was no longer in some secret temple in my heart but

172
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:43,400
everywhere everywhere A Place To Worship everything a prayer waiting to be heard

173
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:48,880
to be touched and inside the most beautiful

174
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:54,640
nothing not even an altar which is oddly

175
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:01,800
everything I can't say how sometimes when I am quiet enough I

176
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:07,200
notice it sometimes when I get out of the way I

177
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,480
fall all the way

178
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:21,400
in so this poem that's called what's in the temple by Tom Barrett because we've kind of

179
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:27,400
like entered into a conversation between two poets Rosemary trummer's respon to what

180
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:34,040
Tom Barrett have wrote and Tom Barrett's poem includes this these lines if you

181
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:40,800
had a temple and the secret spaces of your heart what would you worship there

182
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:46,800
what would you bring to sacrifice and in this poem Tom Barrett's

183
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,280
poem he also includes this lines we don't build many temples anymore maybe

184
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:58,680
we learned that the sacred can't be contained

185
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,760
so this question what what do you worship what do you

186
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:10,480
sacrifice and rosemary tra her response is to say that she's not making these

187
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:19,040
distinctions that as soon as we designate something as sacred then everything else by definition becomes

188
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:24,800
profane and of course you know our minds make these

189
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:32,560
distinctions but if we are saying something sacred then saying it's like spiritually significant and treated with

190
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:39,720
reverence and respect and there's certain rules or Norms about how we

191
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:45,160
interact with them so if something is sacred kind of

192
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:51,240
like implicit in this also is this idea that this will help me find more freedom this will help me find more peace this

193
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:59,440
will help me find more ease but of course implicit in that is

194
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:06,359
everything else that isn't sacred the the the profane those things or activities that don't have any spiritual

195
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:13,280
significance they're the ordinary the everyday the secular and implicit in that is like oh

196
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:20,559
this won't help me find more freedom oh this is you know an

197
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:28,520
obstacle and rosemary traumer in this poem she's pointing to what if we stop making those St

198
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:36,280
distinctions then everything becomes sacred even the ugly The

199
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:41,560
Unwanted everything becomes connected to beauty and

200
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:50,160
truth even the very ordinary these things that we tend to dismiss or disregard or just not even

201
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:57,000
notice Rosemary traumer in includes in her poem like every crumpled shirt every

202
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:04,359
door handle Compass broken thermometer Apple trash can tree like in my mind I'm just imagining

203
00:39:04,359 --> 00:39:10,760
that the poet is just sitting there and just kind of like looking around and just naming you know what's there and

204
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:18,920
that visual experience but there's a way in which we

205
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:24,560
label things conflict you know limits

206
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:30,119
them because it's makes it this and not that which of

207
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:37,680
course is true but it also maybe undermines that sense that

208
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:43,319
meditation of practice is about being present for whatever is

209
00:39:43,319 --> 00:39:50,920
arising and just by our folding it into our practice whatever the experience is

210
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:58,440
is a way that we find more freedom so what happens if we we stop

211
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:05,119
labeling things and I know this is um contrary to

212
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:12,160
what um practice instructions are and to be sure it's very helpful to label but

213
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:18,800
to make note of things but what if there's a way that we

214
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:27,079
can be within experience without reifying it without limiting it without

215
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:32,280
somehow like making it permanent and I first discovered this

216
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:40,160
the very first time I ever entered some or heard some Buddhist teachings the teacher this was in a yoga

217
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:47,240
studio uh gave this expression they were holding up an object for them it was a a

218
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:54,640
a pen but in the same way I'm holding up a striker Striker for the Bell I'm calling it a striker so you

219
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:01,119
know it is a striker that's how it can be used but maybe it's also a back

220
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:08,760
scratch or something that can help you reach a place in your back or what if it's a somebody you

221
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:14,640
wanted to like scare an intruder or something and you can throw this object

222
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:20,720
or and it would be I don't know something a weapon or something or maybe

223
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:28,079
if um this got taped to my hand and it would become like a splint you know I'm just making up these things right but

224
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:33,720
that this one object as soon as we call it a striker it's

225
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:39,119
limited it's just this it's not all those other

226
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:45,400
things so to be sure labels are helpful and important and we need them and we

227
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:54,079
use them and this is what naturally happens the Mind does but what if we softened all these

228
00:41:54,079 --> 00:42:00,880
labels sacred poane Bell strier back

229
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:10,359
scratcher and if we are stopping making these distinctions between sacred and

230
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:17,560
profane then there is no longer a maker of the

231
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:23,000
distinctions there's no longer an entity that's at the center that's assigning

232
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:29,040
things sacred or profane there's no longer something that's here like oh yes

233
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:35,880
this is good this is bad this will help me in my spiritual life this [Music]

234
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:43,880
won't so this idea of making something sacred or profane revolves around a

235
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:52,480
center the center that's a me or mine this will help me or this won't help

236
00:42:54,319 --> 00:43:02,359
me what if there's no Center what if there's just experiences

237
00:43:02,359 --> 00:43:07,720
without a center and I think this is what the poet

238
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:13,559
is pointing to when she writes sometimes when I get out of the

239
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:18,079
way I fall all the way

240
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:25,760
in and this is real Freedom this is a real deep

241
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:32,520
freedom and I know this is a paradox about

242
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:41,160
making labels or distinctions and not making them but this is part of the Paradox of practice and maybe the art of

243
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:51,520
practice so this idea of softening lessening this making the

244
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:57,680
distinction between what goes in the temple and what's outside of the Temple

245
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:06,800
what if everything is ordinary what if everything is

246
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:16,599
extraordinary thank you thank you for your practice and maybe what would it be like

247
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:25,000
today to notice everything in a way that isn't

248
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:32,640
dismissive not in a way that we have to furtively you know always be mindful of everything but just um to be

249
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:39,000
with whatever the moment brings us whatever the m whatever is arising in

250
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:46,799
the moment thank you and we see you

251
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,960
tomorrow

252
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,880
I
