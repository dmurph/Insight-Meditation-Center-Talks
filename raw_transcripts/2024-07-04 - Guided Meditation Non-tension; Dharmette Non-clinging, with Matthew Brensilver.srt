1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:06,759
so uh so welcome folks welcome to certain Wednesdays certain Wednesdays

2
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:13,920
with Matthew production by Matthew I'm Matthew it's not really a

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:20,920
production and it's not officially called certain Wednesdays but I like that certain Wednesdays because I'm here

4
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:29,039
certain Wednesdays and I am not certain about much at all

5
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:37,040
but uh we're here practicing nonetheless and uh thank you uh thanks for um yeah

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:47,079
saying hi lovely to see you your names and um we'll uh we'll sit and see what

7
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,960
happens for

8
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:40,360
whenever it would get real uh hot or cold in the

9
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:47,119
uh meditation Hall the teacher would say as we sat there teacher would say in the

10
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:54,039
summer the Buddha sweats in the winter he shivers

11
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,720
and so if uh the temperature as a number of people said if

12
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:22,599
um it's not at the kind of set point for your body just uh take stock of how

13
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:28,160
it affects uh your heart

14
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,879
mind e

15
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:17,879
any subtle bracing practice releasing

16
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,760
that e

17
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:07,280
it's not that conditions have to be just right for us to

18
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:15,879
surrender let go they're never just right for

19
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,040
that so we actually Leverage The

20
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:32,840
imperfection as a motivation to stop

21
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,759
fighting and when we stop fighting we become

22
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:04,120
uh poor to the Dharma

23
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,880
we don't have to say okay to everything

24
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:51,160
forever but for right now

25
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,319
we give

26
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,360
permission for all the conditions that that comprise this

27
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:14,080
moment to be as they are all the Loose Ends of any human

28
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,240
life everything that could get better we give

29
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:32,560
permission for it to be as it is for

30
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:07,199
and we know that we've actually given deep

31
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,440
permission for that which is to be as it is

32
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:21,160
when that which is changes softens

33
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,199
the permission

34
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:47,960
reshapes the [Music] constellation of phenomena of our

35
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
life

36
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
e

37
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
e

38
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
e

39
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
e

40
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

41
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,279
e e

42
00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:02,200
just fill your body with uh awareness for

43
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:46,760
less like we're pouring the awareness from our head into our body and more

44
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:57,880
like our awareness uh blooms out of our

45
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
body

46
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
e

47
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,079
e e

48
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:50,440
and clinging uh carries a burden of of tension with it a kind of

49
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:57,759
Whirlpool of tension energy swirling

50
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,959
so we

51
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:17,440
relax we unify the the field of our body

52
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:49,519
settle into the uh juicy aliveness of the

53
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,839
Moment undefended

54
00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:00,920
by our stories

55
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

56
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

57
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

58
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,799
e e

59
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:48,559
to uh to pay attention is to pay attention to change

60
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:16,679
so we practice not pushing or pulling on a

61
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,400
n impermanence

62
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:50,600
we practice not uh seeking a place outside the flow of

63
00:19:53,720 --> 00:20:00,640
anicha but finding ourselves within it

64
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

65
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

66
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

67
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

68
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,480
e e

69
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:27,840
if there is no place to stand you might as well just fall

70
00:23:55,559 --> 00:24:00,440
we fall more and more deeply into

71
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:08,520
and present less and less

72
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:19,400
baggage fewer and fewer ways for the attention to snag like a hang nail on

73
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,880
fabric but on

74
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
phenomena

75
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

76
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

77
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

78
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

79
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

80
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
e

81
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,158
e e

82
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,080
e

83
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,880
okay so it's good to uh good to sit with

84
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:48,360
you um thank you for uh for the the questions great questions

85
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:53,919
um I uh yeah I appreciate just seeing what's what's on people's mind last last

86
00:29:53,919 --> 00:30:04,039
time if you were in here I chatted a link in to submit uh anonymous questions and um got a bunch

87
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:11,960
and um yeah great questions about um about Free Will and the self and

88
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:17,600
Consciousness and awareness and some of the questions are above my pay grade

89
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:24,039
some will lead me very deep into nerd territory and we might not come out and

90
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:29,960
we might not be wiser if we did get out

91
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:37,000
so I got to be selective in what I pick up but I I do really those are a lot of

92
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:44,240
my questions it's on my mind and so even if I'm not answering the questions it's informing what I'm uh thinking about how

93
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,720
I'm thinking about uh this group so uh so thank you and we'll have time to to

94
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:56,279
do do more of those I'll pick up more that have been submitted

95
00:30:56,279 --> 00:31:03,480
so the question that uh I selected somebody just cut

96
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:09,960
right to the chase what's the best way to overcome

97
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:17,080
clinging and uh that um that's really the question

98
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:22,960
right Joseph Goldstein I remember some some years ago was asked to sum up his

99
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:28,279
Decades of practice in a sentence and his his response was simply

100
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:35,440
the mind that's not clinging to anything it's how he summed up

101
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,960
everything and if you're not clinging right how could anything really be a

102
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:49,880
problem how if you're not clinging could greed possibly gain a foothold

103
00:31:49,880 --> 00:32:00,320
how could hatred gain a foothold right hatred greed are not not possible

104
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:10,679
in the wake of letting go but love is and that kind of asymmetry is of

105
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:16,519
Interest so this is a critical uh question

106
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:26,279
um but in some ways I can't really answer you know uh anyone

107
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:34,840
who boldly pronounce is like this is how you let go here's the the algorithm here

108
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:43,279
are the three steps to Letting Go you can know for sure that

109
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:49,200
person is a scam artist you know it's like in the trenches of our experience

110
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,279
we're all going to have to wrestle with that we always have to

111
00:32:54,279 --> 00:33:00,120
wrestle with it it's not like we know how to let go and then we just keep doing doing it the rest of our

112
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:07,960
life and in in one sense maybe we say you know that we want to be careful

113
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:15,480
in the question not to overestimate the place of willfulness as if there are choices of

114
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,840
how to let go and it's just that we need to pick the right

115
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:28,279
strategy and in a sense the the the kind of willfulness is a

116
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:35,159
reiteration of the clinging rather than its

117
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:42,039
solution okay so that's maybe the Preamble but enough enough of me

118
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:50,399
dodging a very good question and the first thing that came to mind

119
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:59,039
really is that uh to know that that certain choices guarantee

120
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:04,440
clinging you know that certain investments

121
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:09,560
in relationships in in you know in in a

122
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:15,118
child in a cause you know ethical cause

123
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:21,878
like it pretty much guarantees some measure of of

124
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:28,440
clinging I don't think that's exactly can be free of clinging

125
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:33,720
it's like the up Upstream decisions guarantee Our

126
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:39,839
Fate and then the question is like can you actually consent to that clinging

127
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:47,440
can you consent to that suffering and it doesn't mean we can't

128
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:55,839
work to free ourselves up to some extent but the fantasy of like Freedom

129
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:03,000
given those Upstream ches it's it's not realistic the way we invest the way I've

130
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:12,720
invested various ways um and so we we actually open to that

131
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,000
okay this is part of the

132
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:23,800
contract Shanti Deva um said um just as

133
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:29,200
um no one no no one thought

134
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:36,720
may I now be born no one thinks may I now get

135
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:42,839
angry and we could add no one ever thought may I now

136
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:48,200
cling may I may I now suffer may I now be born May I now

137
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:58,599
cling clinging in other words arises out of out of many causes and conditions

138
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:04,520
and it's been reinforced in the behavioral sense it's been

139
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:10,760
reinforced in the sense that uh it's brought some rewards it kind of works

140
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:18,520
clinging kind of works some of the time a

141
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:28,520
little and that kind of reinforcement schedule like that is um

142
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:35,160
very problematic that really uh encourages the behavior the repetition

143
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:41,200
it it doesn't quite work but it usually works at least a little sometimes it

144
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:47,680
works really well you know or clinging and maybe it's a little bit like uh

145
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:53,160
gambling or something it's like we know that playing a you know

146
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:58,480
slot machine is not like a strategy for getting rich

147
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:03,880
uh but the casino programs the slot so that we get just enough reinforcement to

148
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:09,280
keep playing right and of course everyone's heard that one story about

149
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:17,440
that person that friend's sister-in-law who won big you know right and so it's

150
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:23,920
like gets reinforced and because clinging kind of

151
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:31,319
works it's hard to actually believe that we've got to exper with uh with

152
00:37:31,319 --> 00:37:36,520
letting go and

153
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:43,960
so letting go you know it's it's

154
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:50,800
um it's hard and I'm very suspicious of a kind of instruction on how to let

155
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:57,640
go because it strikes me that that letting go is is sort of like the simult

156
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:03,640
anous expression of many of the the parames

157
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:11,200
the 10 Perfections you know that's uh that's why no one can tell you

158
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:18,079
how to do it you know CU it's like you can't can't just tell somebody how to be

159
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:25,000
you know patient and equanimous and have resolve and all at once right so the

160
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,839
parames the parames um are considered a kind of description

161
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:36,000
created not by the Buddha but by others of the Buddha's beautiful

162
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:43,520
qualities right and um and so just like looking at the the

163
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:50,240
list of you know the parmes the ones that have been highlighted uh non- clinging Letting Go

164
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:58,160
it involves a lot a lot renunciation you know

165
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:05,560
um letting go is to relinquish we're we're we're um we're unclenching our

166
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:11,319
fist right we're foregoing some measure

167
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:18,599
of the the pleasure that clinging can deliver right anger with its honey tip

168
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:24,599
and poisoned root the Buddha said right and so okay to let go of the poison we

169
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:31,720
actually have to let go of the honey too the sweetness varia energy Another Part Of Me

170
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:39,920
like clinging is painful but it's often actually the path of least resistance

171
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:45,200
right my clinging does not seem to ask

172
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:53,079
much of me it's water rolling down a hill right and so to actually change

173
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:59,318
that to change that habit to go against the stream that takes energy

174
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:09,520
and uh and Adana resolve commitment a deep commitment to

175
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:17,599
stay the course you know clinging is part of its problem is

176
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,920
its persistence you know its persistence it's not so much the peak

177
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:30,400
intensity of one given moment it's just the persistence the return turn of the

178
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:38,079
longing and patience patience to Bear to bear with the

179
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:44,560
process willing to to plant seeds and not insist upon

180
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:49,800
harvesting now

181
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:58,000
and uh maybe lastly equinity you know this kind of practice of wrapping

182
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:07,440
wrapping the whole realm of pleasant and unpleasant with um kind of the space of

183
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,200
okayness and so

184
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:21,920
um yeah and letting go of clinging we will be asked to have equinity

185
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:28,200
with intense feeling intense feeling a lot of feeling gets res

186
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:34,160
released in the kind of gesture of Letting Go letting

187
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:40,560
go uh sometimes to let go we have to do

188
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:48,800
something new we have to ritualize some aspect of what's come and gone or

189
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:55,839
sometimes we actually have to find something new to love you know

190
00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:02,520
to and this this has kind of Echoes of Freud you know it's like to to let go

191
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:07,560
the energy that was invested in one thing gets

192
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:13,960
reinvested somewhere else that's actually how we let go so sometimes it's

193
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:19,480
not this pure internal inside job you

194
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:27,280
know and um letting go uh

195
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:34,359
is about I would say the wholesome the wholesome

196
00:42:34,359 --> 00:42:41,200
unpleasant a wholesome unpleasant the reward of course is very pleasant but

197
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:47,200
the process of letting go is is about the wholesome

198
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:54,200
unpleasant and for the wholesome unpleasant not to devolve

199
00:42:54,200 --> 00:43:00,720
into unh wholesomeness we often need to kind of Leaven the

200
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,839
letting go with some pleasantness we need to find

201
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:13,160
some you know something soothing some sense of Refuge some sense

202
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:19,880
of of pleasantness to um make more space for the
