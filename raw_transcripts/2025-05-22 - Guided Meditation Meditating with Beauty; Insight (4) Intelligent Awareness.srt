00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:09,240
hello from Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City and delighted

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:17,039
that this meditation hall has become so large and encompassing to include all of

3
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:25,160
you and all the different places you are and for us to have come together this morning to meditate

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,800
and uh one of the [Music]

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:38,120
uh emphasises uh I've been giving lately is that

6
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,540
um I'm I'm defining awareness as

7
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:49,840
[Music] the as the

8
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:57,320
coordinated coming together working together of all the different attentional faculties that we

9
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:05,119
have and um and when they're all working in an unself-conscious way but we're

10
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,799
quite present for them all they come together to a sense or

11
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:18,320
feeling of a spacious open receptive field of awareness and where where maybe our

12
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,840
capacity for spatial awareness spatial reconstruction contributes to a sense of

13
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,600
space that awareness can have for some people so it's not essentializing

14
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,439
awareness into something but rather it's seen as a as a composite of many things

15
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:42,720
operating together so this is a minor point I want to make but that the more important is that we

16
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:50,439
have all these different attentional faculties and uh this week I've been

17
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:55,799
emphasizing knowing sensing and then yesterday

18
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,520
observing and uh clear comprehension there is one more that

19
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:08,479
maybe nor ordinarily is not considered an intentional faculty but it can be uh

20
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,560
engaged with recruited for the purposes of greater

21
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:22,959
uh present moment awareness and that is our intelligence our capacity to understand

22
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:29,280
to figure out to question to explore to consider new options

23
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,640
And um and uh if someone is uh engaged

24
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,480
in finding their way in the wilderness all their senses might be open and one

25
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,160
of the things that keeps them you know even more right there in the uh in the

26
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:53,120
present moment is the intelligent kind of uh scanning the environment trying to

27
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,680
understand where they are what direction to go what's the wise way to go and there's a lot of engagement

28
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,120
it might seem like that's tiring to apply that to meditation but there is a

29
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:12,159
natural way of using intelligence to figure out how can I be here in the

30
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:18,239
present moment in a in a a valuable way

31
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:26,120
that is relaxed how can I be here in such a way that there's a deep settling and a

32
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:32,239
relaxing and if uh if we don't ask that question don't engage our intelligence

33
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,840
um with the present moment awareness and how to do it in a nice way uh many of us

34
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:45,920
will use our intelligence to fantasize better uh to uh catastrophize better to

35
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:52,080
uh resent better as we review and think about the past we're we're using our

36
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,799
intelligence sometimes for things that keeps us trapped in the world of

37
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:05,599
suffering in the dharma we want to use our intelligence to bring ourselves into freedom in the present moment and we can

38
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:11,040
use our intelligence for that purpose and uh the reference point I'd like to

39
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:21,120
you do use today as a guide for if you want to do this is um um uh I could just

40
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,720
reach out for my cup here i can just kind of grab it and bring it up and

41
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,919
drink it and and without thinking about it maybe

42
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:37,520
I'm just greedy doesn't matter how I grab it and uh how I drink from it or I

43
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,919
can make the actor drinking the cup a satisfying meaningful beautiful act in

44
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:51,120
itself kind of like a a uh a Tai Chi movement or maybe in the way that a

45
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,280
dancer might dance and move their arm and the whole expression of art is in

46
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,280
the movements of the hand or someone who go uh practices the Japanese way of tea

47
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:09,560
and they uh they would uh just the way they would pick up the cup with two

48
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:16,560
hands holding it bringing it to their their lips and drinking the whole way they're doing

49
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:24,800
it um has a quality of beauty in it and um sometimes I think that the the

50
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:33,560
way of tea can be called the way of beauty um and so how can you use your

51
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:41,440
intelligence to ina to activate awareness of breathing of present moment

52
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:47,440
of the body what's happening fear of the mind wandering off how can you engage

53
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:54,400
awareness attention so the very use of it is beautiful and that's what we have

54
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,520
intelligence for and that's an intelligence which uh brings us into the

55
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,560
present moment to be aware beautifully

56
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:12,199
so assuming a meditation posture but not being in a hurry to do

57
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:20,240
so assuming a posture almost as if that is itself is an art form or a Tai Chi

58
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,800
movement or

59
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:32,680
um perhaps in a way

60
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:38,479
that would express to others that you're really present for

61
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:45,639
them for the activity you're doing assume a posture that is beautifully

62
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:51,280
attentive there's an intentionality that's the intention to be here with the

63
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:59,400
whole body and maybe that means to sit a little bit

64
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,720
straighter a little bit more intentionally not a posture of

65
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,639
completely no intentional muscles operating at all so you can relax as

66
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:18,960
deeply as possible but a posture that allows for some kind of expression

67
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:27,360
of beautiful intentionality to be here around which the body can

68
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:36,080
relax and then to gently close the

69
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,520
eyes in a way that is

70
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:51,919
graceful elegant or has a deep pleasure to

71
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:02,080
it just in the right speed for you take a few long slow full breaths

72
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:21,879
maybe the ex inhale has the beauty of the of a

73
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:30,479
sunrise in this way it appears or of a flower opening

74
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:36,599
how would you breathe in can you look and orient yourself towards breathing

75
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:41,360
in and breathe in a way that is

76
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,320
beautiful and

77
00:08:55,399 --> 00:09:02,880
exhale maybe like a bird that stops flapping its wings

78
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:09,759
and now glides down to a

79
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:17,279
landing elegant bird elegant

80
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:28,560
exhale and as you breathe in deeply and

81
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:35,399
exhale as if you have all the time in the world on the

82
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:40,240
exhale gently relax your

83
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:05,959
body and then letting your breathing return to normal

84
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,040
and be with your

85
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:21,959
breathing with the exhale relax the thinking

86
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:27,800
mind any tightness and pressure in the face or

87
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:34,360
head shoulders or belly associated with thinking

88
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,160
And then how would you

89
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,560
Have your awareness your

90
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:36,519
attention come together with your breathing so there's something beautiful

91
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:41,279
graceful with how you're

92
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:52,200
aware the simple knowing of breathing in breathing out maybe you say the word

93
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:58,800
in out but the way the mind says

94
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:06,600
it is like ceremony saying something beautifully

95
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,880
to allow yourself to sense and feel the body breathing the

96
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:34,839
sensations is there a way to give a lot of time and space and

97
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:40,200
presence to the act of feeling

98
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,920
so that there's

99
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:54,519
pleasure in being available to feel or there's beauty

100
00:12:54,519 --> 00:13:01,959
or there is gracefulness

101
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:13,320
no hurry just like

102
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:20,720
a dancer who moves an arm it's really in the arm as it

103
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:30,839
moves as if it's the only thing in the world to be there sensing

104
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:39,800
inhale exhale in the body as if it's the only thing

105
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:11,680
with your intelligence recognizing what's happening in the

106
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,760
mind with strain or pushing or being in a

107
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:22,240
hurry maybe even being anxious how there's a way that that is

108
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:29,079
not so beautiful and for these minutes of

109
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:35,240
meditation orient yourself

110
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:45,680
intelligently carefully lovingly to the beauty of attention

111
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,480
beauty of being aware of breathing of

112
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:57,320
meditation being mindful in a beautiful

113
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,199
way of the present

114
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:17,040
moment so that your intelligence your

115
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:24,920
creativity supports your absorption in the present moment just

116
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,920
here now

117
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,720
for the activity of the mind to be

118
00:20:53,720 --> 00:21:01,960
beautiful it helps to know the quality of mental activity the

119
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:08,320
mind what it's involved in and

120
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:15,200
How and can there be a

121
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:28,360
generous consideration of how to change the

122
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:37,320
mind so that its activity of attention is beautiful

123
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:45,280
is satisfying is

124
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:52,039
peaceful in this simple ordinary

125
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:57,960
acts of attending to the present moment

126
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:24,639
and then as we come to the end of the sitting to

127
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:29,960
consider with some degree of intelligence

128
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,640
consideration reflection

129
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:43,200
curiosity is the mind is your inner life a little bit more satisfying than

130
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,158
it was before

131
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:59,159
meditation is there did you learn something about beautiful attention

132
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:12,398
or did you learn something about way of being with your inner life that's not so

133
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:20,480
beautiful that maybe you don't want to invest so much time and attention to

134
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:30,960
perpetuate and as we come to the end here you might consider ways in which

135
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:38,720
you live your life with attitudes with mental

136
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,760
activity with emotional

137
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,799
states that are not so

138
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:59,240
beautiful that don't bring greater beauty and peace calm to yourself or to

139
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:04,559
others and maybe some of those you go along

140
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:10,799
with automatically and maybe

141
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:24,398
unnecessarily and maybe instead of doing what's not beautiful you can come into the world

142
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:32,158
Feeling empowered feeling that it's okay for

143
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:39,640
you to enter your activities of the day with a beautiful attitude

144
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:45,760
beautiful mindset beautiful

145
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:52,039
orientation not hijacked by being in a hurry

146
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:04,039
may it be that by entering this world in a beautiful way beautiful

147
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:12,200
tension beautiful consideration that we contribute to the

148
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,519
peace and

149
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:25,240
happiness for others may it be that we make this

150
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:32,200
world a more beautiful place spiritually

151
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:40,120
ethically attentionally with our awareness our presence and our

152
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:45,520
care may all beings be happy

153
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:52,440
may all beings be safe may all

154
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:59,480
beings be peaceful may all beings be

155
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:04,679
free so they can live in beauty

156
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:18,119
[Music]

157
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,120
thank you

158
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:40,720
so good morning and welcome to this now fourth talk introducing the very

159
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:50,240
important topic of insight in for insight meditation practice and this week in introducing it

160
00:32:50,240 --> 00:33:00,840
I'm laying out the foundation of uh foundational awareness practices that

161
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:08,440
uh are used for having insight insight is a

162
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:16,799
byproduct of a careful present moment attention to our experience here and now

163
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:23,840
and so knowing how to do that is important and for insight meditation

164
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:30,000
we're using engaging a wider range of our attentional faculties than we do

165
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,279
when we're doing practicing samadei there's a lot of big overlap

166
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:43,799
and one of the uh important ones that um with uh some people

167
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:50,000
would would would beg to differ with me but uh

168
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,399
there's a greater uh usage of curiosity and

169
00:33:55,399 --> 00:34:04,240
intelligence for inside meditation the stance of inside meditation is the

170
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:11,000
question what is this and sometimes I've just used the word what in sitting in

171
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,200
meditation and um and the what the question what the stance of what is not

172
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:26,079
looking for an answer but it's more like I I was some occasionally would say to me what is this and uh and it's without

173
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:31,520
actually moving at all it's as if my whole system attentional system is

174
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:38,240
opening it the arms wide and stepping forward to be more connected more

175
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:44,398
present for whatever experience I'm having and this using this question what

176
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:50,638
what is it and and a a sense of receptivity that can follow from that is

177
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:57,920
and getting closer letting it be more intimate is um uh is making a choice

178
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:04,160
about how it's useful to be present and and to track that choice to see is this

179
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:12,560
a way is this forward leading does this help me be more present does it help me be more centered here does it help me to

180
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:18,560
uh be more connected and to develop greater clarity of attention and clarity

181
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:24,480
of knowing what um what's happening in the moment all these kinds of questions

182
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:32,880
can be done kind of uh you know somewhat without a lot of thought but exactly but

183
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,078
they you excuse me

184
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:44,359
wait all these questions um are an expression of

185
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:51,119
intelligence and in one of the attentional faculties we have meaning one of the mental capacities that are

186
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:56,320
operating that can help support present moment attention that's actually maybe an

187
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,440
integral part of it is our intelligence our ability to figure things out

188
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:08,440
understand things better question what's going on uh experiment with how we're uh

189
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:14,960
practicing and uh and many people associate that kind of use of intelligence with the mind getting busy

190
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:21,760
and distracted and it's too coarse too too much is going on in medit meditation

191
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:28,800
and that's but that's how we use our intelligence to know how we're using our intelligence so it doesn't make the mind

192
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,720
busy and and activated we use our intelligence to know how the mind can be

193
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:41,920
more peaceful more quiet more centered more here so I found that asking the question

194
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:47,040
in meditation what is this with this attitude of opening up and being with

195
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:54,680
the experience that this actually was quite useful for me and helped settle me help me become

196
00:36:54,680 --> 00:37:01,359
quiet i learned that and the intelligent consideration of how am I being aware

197
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:08,800
here what's the quality of the awareness of the attention uh can that be more satisfying more

198
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:14,400
peace producing can it be more beautiful so I did a lot of mental

199
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:22,960
noting in my practice and I learned to pay attention to how I did the mental noting so the mental noting itself was

200
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:28,040
deeply satisfying was calming was settling was

201
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:35,839
supportive of a deepening of the practice i've done a lot of sensing uh a lot of

202
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:42,400
being my body sensing my experience and there too uh I using your intelligence

203
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:49,400
and consider how am I sensing is this the best way is there another way of doing it what's the quality of that

204
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:56,400
sensing and uh sometimes I could feel that my sensing I didn't want to sense something and I can feel the contraction

205
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:02,079
of pulling away I can sometimes feel like I was straining I was pushing too much trying

206
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:07,119
to make something happen p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p pushing forward sometimes there was a sense of

207
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:14,640
being in a hurry and so I learned to uh to look at that and see that and ask myself are

208
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:22,560
there other ways of doing this can I do it without straining what would that look like can I give it more time

209
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:29,920
can I somehow find a way to um to uh

210
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:36,960
uh maybe have it be more beautiful sensing so the knowing the sensing the

211
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:43,760
the more generic open kind of idea of awareness itself what's the quality of that and one of the reference points for

212
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:49,040
this intelligence a number of them intelligent consideration is uh does it

213
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:54,240
support the meditation does it support us to be more calm more peaceful

214
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:00,079
does it support an inner beauty an inner kind of deep a deep kind of uh pleasure

215
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:08,200
or joy for being engaged in the practice and um the

216
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:15,359
um the um so in intelligence as part of the

217
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:21,599
attentional capacity we have to use our intelligence to be more present and the

218
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:27,359
word intelligence in English might be a triggering word for some people maybe because we think I don't I'm not

219
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:33,359
intelligent enough everyone's has enough intelligence for meditation practice

220
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:39,000
everyone has enough intelligence to find their way to uh freedom from

221
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:46,960
suffering and um you only need as much uh intelligence to get out of suffering

222
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:54,400
as you use to get into it and so if you don't have such great intelligence then

223
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:00,480
um maybe it's not so sophisticated the way you got into suffering and so it's

224
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:06,240
easier to find your way out so everyone has plenty of intelligence enough to do

225
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:11,599
this but sometimes in meditation circles we get the message almost like we're not

226
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:17,880
supposed to use it in meditation because it seems like it's too much mental activity it maybe too much

227
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:25,920
thinking but uh and so people leave their intelligence at the door when they sit down to meditate um intelligence is

228
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:32,320
a very important part especially when we engage in in uh the both samadei and

229
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:38,400
insight practice but maybe even more with inside practice and um and then so

230
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:44,400
we but then we have to learn to use the intelligence we have um to to support us

231
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,839
not to go in the opposite direction and one of the ways that can help with this

232
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:55,359
use of proper use of intelligence is to consider that uh if we're spending a lot

233
00:40:55,359 --> 00:41:01,040
of time in the hindrances a lot of times distracted in things uh chances are our

234
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:06,960
intelligence has been hijacked so that we can better fantasize so we can think

235
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:12,640
out scenarios of fear and danger and dread for the future

236
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:20,560
so we can review and creatively review and trying to figure out what happened in the past and um and or write the

237
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:26,000
great American novel as we're meditating we our intelligence is operating and we

238
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:34,880
don't want to let it get it hijacked and being used for purposes in meditation that are not useful for us and so um to

239
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:42,480
intelligently understand where our intelligence is going and to f figure out how to use our capacity to think

240
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,880
well to consider to explore to experiment and to adjust what we're

241
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:53,680
doing so that it supports the whole process of being absorbed in the present

242
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:59,359
moment just here and um and I'm sure some of you

243
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:07,280
will feel like this sounds like a lot of work but as soon as it feels like tiring work uh intelligence is hasn't is not

244
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,480
doing its job job of intelligence is to help you feel like it's not not

245
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,680
difficult work it's not strain it's actually really pleasant really

246
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:23,440
wonderful and so the reference point I used in the guided meditation was um

247
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:30,319
something like it's really elegant like a dancer moving an arm

248
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:36,640
uh and it moving that arm uh it's completely there it's elegant it's

249
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:42,960
beautiful the whole world the whole world of the the dancers's expression

250
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:50,000
purpose in life meaning in life everything is in that movement of the arm and part of the reason why it's so

251
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,200
wonderful to watch a really skilled expressive dancer is we can feel that

252
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:01,200
there's so much is there in this and the grace of that arm moving

253
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:07,200
for um uh someone who does Tai Chi there's a there's a beauty there and how

254
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:12,640
things are moving chiang perhaps and in a reference point in

255
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:19,359
Japanese um way of tea the path of tea chado the sometimes in English called

256
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:25,359
tea ceremony to do things as ceremony meaning to do things with an elegance a

257
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:30,800
beauty uh a care where every gesture

258
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:36,800
um uh you're fully in the gesture and so that has a has an intentionality a

259
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:45,440
purpose beauty a presence a generosity a care that goes into it we offering it

260
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:53,680
and um and so to use our intelligence to figure out how can I be attentive to my

261
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:59,440
breathing to the present moment as ceremony as a dance as a place to

262
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:05,280
express something profound within us and the primary reference point I'd like to

263
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:12,400
suggest uh is the idea of beauty to use our intelligence to understand how to be

264
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:20,240
mindful in a beautiful way so that if wherever we go with mindfulness we bring

265
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:27,280
beauty with us we are we live in beauty because how we're aware of the world is

266
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:34,319
beautiful and since that's the only way to be aware of the world is to be aware um you

267
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:41,599
bring beauty with you everywhere with how you're aware and to and to challenge you a

268
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:46,920
little bit uh I'd like to suggest that

269
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:54,200
uh uh being aware in an un beautiful

270
00:44:54,200 --> 00:45:00,640
way is a is not a good alternative the best

271
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:05,680
alternative in the moment probably is to do it beautifully choose the best choice

272
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:12,839
the best way of doing it don't choose something that's lesser and undermines you and debilitates

273
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:19,520
you don't keep sacrificing giving up on yourself by doing something which is not

274
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:25,680
so beautiful choose beauty and use your intelligence for

275
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:30,839
that purpose so all these

276
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:36,800
intentional faculties including intelligence are coming together now so

277
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:42,000
we can begin to have deep insight and uh that will we'll continue with this topic

278
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,680
for tomorrow thank you
