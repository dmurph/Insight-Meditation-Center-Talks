1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,279
so

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,120
we're beginning now with the ninth step

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,200
of anapanasati mindfulness of breathing

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,080
in and mindfulness of breathing out

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,439
and the ninth step really

6
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,640
builds on what fault what was earlier

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,279
some teachers who teach anapanasati this

8
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,439
practice of 16 steps

9
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,000
will insist that you should always begin

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,079
with step one

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,640
and systematically work your way through

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,879
all the steps as far as you

13
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,719
you've gone so far you know and

14
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,399
and there's some advantages to that some

15
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,719
people's minds really like having

16
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,399
order and having a real clear definitive

17
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,559
steps the mind gets organized it gets

18
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,879
focused it gets concentrated

19
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,000
knowing what it's doing step by step

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,559
other people find that it it ties them

21
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,399
in knots to do that that kind of trip

22
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,559
over themselves it's too much trying

23
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,280
too much expectation and some people

24
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,119
find that

25
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,920
that it's good to be familiar with all

26
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,200
the steps

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,840
and then as we sit and meditate i

28
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,040
discover where we are

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,479
where the where the salient step is

30
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,720
and sometimes we can start on step five

31
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,479
or start on step

32
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,799
you know even step eight or even step

33
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,640
nine any any of these steps

34
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,640
because we sit down and we're that's

35
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,320
what's kind of available

36
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,479
in a kind of way and

37
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,400
then sometimes we move through up and

38
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,560
down in the course of meditation

39
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,799
so these steps are can be done linearly

40
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,159
linearly for those who

41
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,640
find this beneficial and they can be

42
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,360
more

43
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,520
a resource for those people who want to

44
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,119
track themselves and understand

45
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,759
kind of the domain the territory of

46
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,600
what's happening in their meditation any

47
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,360
any one time what the emphasis

48
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,799
is and um but we get

49
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,680
uh to then to the ninth step and one way

50
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,079
of

51
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,960
appreciating this though is that um one

52
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,239
way or the other

53
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,319
it's helpful that the earlier steps have

54
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,920
been been familiar

55
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,560
been developed in some degree and that's

56
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,280
because

57
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,680
the more we're grounded in our body and

58
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,120
the body is relaxed

59
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,800
the more we begin opening up in a

60
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,239
holistic way

61
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,800
to our experience and we begin kind of

62
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,400
working through some of the knots some

63
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,840
of the entanglements and

64
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,040
tightnesses and tensions that we have

65
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,480
and then and then to go to the second

66
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,000
tetrad

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,519
five to eight is to begin to fix

68
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,560
feeling sensing

69
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,239
the emotional tone of the body

70
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,560
and if you're quite relaxed and focused

71
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,360
it's a contentment and well-being

72
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,000
and then with that it's easier to begin

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,080
trusting it's okay to relax the mental

74
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,120
activity

75
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,599
we don't have to be so actively involved

76
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,040
in fixing solving

77
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,400
remembering planning criticizing

78
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,080
whatever the mind is doing

79
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,000
and the activity the mind can bring to

80
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,480
rest and this also this resting this

81
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,080
releasing

82
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,000
bringing making the mental activity

83
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,319
calmer continues this process of

84
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,000
becoming more holistic being more

85
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,959
inclusive

86
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,040
more open to our experience and then

87
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,080
based on that the experience of the mind

88
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,239
becomes easier to experience

89
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,480
so step nine is breathing in one

90
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,920
experiences the mind breathing out one

91
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,000
experiences the mind

92
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,480
and i love this word experience uh that

93
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,720
could the pali word could be translated

94
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,480
as to feel

95
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,000
the mind feel the the you know feel the

96
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,040
mind

97
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,159
and um and so it's not thinking about

98
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,360
the mind

99
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,319
it's not having ideas about the mind but

100
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,319
it's something that is more

101
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,760
holistic more broad and using a kind of

102
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,040
the

103
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,120
the range of sensory apparatus we have

104
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,239
to take in our inner life the but the

105
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,159
mind is not the details of the inner

106
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,359
life not the particular activities

107
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:19,840
as i've said the mind is just a sum

108
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,959
total

109
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,160
of its mental activities but it's the

110
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,600
way that we

111
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,000
can somehow take in the totality of that

112
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,560
whatever way our mind and i want to

113
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,199
emphasize

114
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,440
arm on your mind experiences

115
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,639
the mood the mental state

116
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,440
the overall overall configuration or the

117
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,240
kind of balance of it all

118
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,000
that's what we call mind and i say that

119
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,520
because

120
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,199
there's a lot of people who would like

121
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,960
to have the mind

122
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,759
be something in particular to define it

123
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,000
to know what the mind is

124
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
and i don't think that that's really the

125
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,880
emphasis in this buddhist practice is to

126
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,840
know in some abstract way what the mind

127
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,720
is

128
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,199
and that's a topic for some other

129
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,880
occasions some other purpose than

130
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,560
meditation

131
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,680
in meditation we're only interested in

132
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,440
how each of us experiences our mind

133
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,600
and for some people the word heart is a

134
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,880
better translation

135
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,560
for cheetah c-i-t-t-a

136
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,400
some people even translate it as heart

137
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,320
mind

138
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,919
and the

139
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,199
but it's the kind of the it's the it's

140
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,000
the

141
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,800
the um so the state of the heart the

142
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,720
state of the mind the quality of our

143
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,320
inner life

144
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,280
it's the mood the atmosphere it's kind

145
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,960
of the sum total of how

146
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,759
all this works and sometimes there's a

147
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,120
predominant mood

148
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,160
of the mind so the predominant mood can

149
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,639
be one of desire or lust or

150
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,639
strong wanting and

151
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,240
and everything is kind of seen through

152
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,759
the filter of the strong

153
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,759
wanting and the there's almost like the

154
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,960
mind has a force

155
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,880
overall force like give me that and um

156
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,639
it's quite something we have a cat at

157
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,520
home and it's i kind of delight somehow

158
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,039
and amazed to see

159
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,280
the cat definitely has desires and it

160
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,400
seems like everything

161
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,720
and the whole katniss is focused on

162
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,120
getting what it wants

163
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,560
and it's clear that the desire is there

164
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,160
and and so the mood of desire

165
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,720
this disposition maybe mind is kind of

166
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,720
like the overall disposition that we

167
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,039
have

168
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,720
and um and sometimes it's not

169
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,479
desire you can feel the difference

170
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,560
between a general mood

171
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,280
characterized by this desired design and

172
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,880
one which is not

173
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,599
sometimes it's aversion hostility ill

174
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:58,720
will

175
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,319
and that's kind of you can kind of see

176
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,240
it sometimes in people that

177
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,800
there's like almost a cloud of anger or

178
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,720
hostility around them

179
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,120
and you know that atmosphere i'm sure is

180
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,400
being experienced or could be

181
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,880
experienced in the inside as well

182
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,479
or there can be the absence of ill will

183
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,680
there could be love and then there can

184
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,680
be confusion

185
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,479
that characterizes it all and mind is

186
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,160
jumping around not knowing what it wants

187
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,240
to do and doesn't understand

188
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,560
kind of a lost feeling that's a kind of

189
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,759
a general tone

190
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,199
of the mind or the absence of confusion

191
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,479
maybe there's clarity wisdom

192
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,120
the overall mood of the mind mind state

193
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,199
can be one of

194
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:45,840
destructibility around scatteredness

195
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,960
or it could be one of um being present

196
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,440
and

197
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,800
undistracted and then one of the great

198
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,280
ones that the tradition talks about

199
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,319
is one can know the mind is being

200
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,360
expansive or large

201
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,759
or one can know the mind is not being

202
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,400
expensive not being large

203
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,879
and this points to how as we become as

204
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,879
we develop this mindfulness and as we

205
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,000
develop

206
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,280
a reflexive awareness of awareness

207
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,840
itself

208
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,000
of the mind itself that seems to change

209
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,639
the mind that seems to change the kind

210
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,360
of it's harder than to focus

211
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,879
on on only the things that we're

212
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,319
thinking about or

213
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,200
things we're aware of something begins

214
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
happening when we're aware of awareness

215
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,599
aware of the mind that knows or then

216
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,440
where the mind state

217
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,200
it's kind of like if someone points out

218
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,120
to you how dirty the windshield is in a

219
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,080
car

220
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,680
then now you drive and you're now you're

221
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,839
aware of the windshield you can't

222
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,839
you're not focusing on it but you can't

223
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,920
not see it anymore

224
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,279
so to become aware of the mind uh it

225
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,600
changes the mind

226
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,720
because the mind is not a physical thing

227
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,680
the mind is the one way of understanding

228
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,320
it's a

229
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,480
kind of this kind of the sum total of

230
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,360
the mental activities that are operating

231
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,920
and one of the key mental activities

232
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,959
is the knowing of itself if the mind is

233
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,839
known if we bring attention to the mind

234
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,959
and the attention is a uh

235
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,760
not for or against the tension is not

236
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,279
with

237
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:30,080
expectations with demands with criticism

238
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,200
it just kind of relaxed equanimous

239
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,560
allowing awareness of the mind that's a

240
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,600
mental activity in itself

241
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,360
that then feeds back into the formation

242
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,480
of the mind as a whole

243
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,200
and so we're shaping our mind all the

244
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,279
time

245
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,200
maybe the brain doesn't change that much

246
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,080
the mind is very flexible

247
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,160
the buddha emphasized the mind is very

248
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,920
very changeable

249
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,600
and it changes with all our moods and

250
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,720
activities and what's going on and so

251
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,240
mindfulness itself meditation itself

252
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,279
does have an effect on how we experience

253
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,880
the mind

254
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,480
and as we and here the instructions are

255
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,480
know the mind or experience the mind

256
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,519
breathing in and breathing out

257
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,040
as we do that um because everything we

258
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,360
do

259
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,880
has with the mind hasn't

260
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,200
feeds back onto shaping the mind the

261
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,600
experience of the mind we have

262
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,000
and so now we're in this kind of can you

263
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,120
start being in this kind of

264
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,040
loop this kind of cycle this kind of

265
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,680
where

266
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,279
as the meditation deepens we're bringing

267
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,839
more and more equanimity more openness

268
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,240
more and more receptivity

269
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,160
to whatever our experience is including

270
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,760
that of the mind

271
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,200
and that has

272
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,920
creates some of the ver brings those

273
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,279
qualities to the mind itself

274
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,160
so one of the reasons why in meditation

275
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,160
practice we're trying to develop

276
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,560
an equanimous mindfulness that's not for

277
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,560
or against experience

278
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,839
it's good in and of itself but as that

279
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,440
gets stronger

280
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,480
it feeds back to

281
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,680
reshape or reform the disposition of the

282
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,519
mind the quality of the mind the state

283
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,800
of the mind

284
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,360
so the mind itself begins feeling more

285
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,399
receptive

286
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,320
soft expansive

287
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,000
and um and all kinds of wonderful things

288
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,720
we'll talk more about

289
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,079
so it might be that it's difficult to uh

290
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,079
some of you to follow what i'm saying

291
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,440
but um

292
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,200
but maybe you think about it as mood

293
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,200
your the your mood that you're in or

294
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,480
the feeling tone the emotional tone of

295
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,760
your inner life of your mind your heart

296
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,440
and um and you can certainly be aware of

297
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,360
it anytime at all

298
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,680
but to be aware of it after having

299
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,839
meditated for some time

300
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,839
for example the more or less the first

301
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,279
eight steps

302
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,480
kind of prepares the ground for

303
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,440
mindfulness of the mind to have this

304
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,360
wonderful feedback loop

305
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,279
to continue to condition or

306
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,240
open the mind in a more deeper and

307
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,279
deeper way

308
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,200
that will allow for concentration to

309
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,600
develop

310
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,000
so i'll talk more about these this mind

311
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,240
thing over the next couple of days

312
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,440
so in the meantime what you might do

313
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,920
is as you go about some of your daily

314
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,839
tasks maybe some of the common things

315
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,680
you do

316
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,440
something that you maybe do regularly

317
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,200
through the day maybe

318
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,839
washing up or cooking or driving or just

319
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,800
going for you know whatever you do

320
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,240
why don't you start noticing the mood

321
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,200
with which you do it

322
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,399
and then really know the mood and don't

323
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,680
just check it off oh

324
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,519
you know i'm annoyed at the exercise

325
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,399
and don't just don't just check it off

326
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:24,880
really

327
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,000
experience the mood take time to

328
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,320
and one way to make sure you give enough

329
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,320
time to experience the mood

330
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,800
is to breathe with the mood take time

331
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,920
just breathe

332
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,160
with it for a while and get to know it

333
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,560
and start recognizing your mood

334
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,480
and start recognizing also how your mood

335
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,320
shifts

336
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,360
as it is known as you experience it

337
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,639
as you breathe with it and in daily life

338
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,040
as you go through the day

339
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,079
um don't overlook

340
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,399
the windshield by looking through it on

341
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,600
to what's on the other side

342
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,040
so thank you all very much

343
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,240
and and i'll say it a few times so this

344
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,959
week we're meeting at seven o'clock

345
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,680
and and then next week we'll meet next

346
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,160

347
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,120
i'll start again at 6 45 for that week

348
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,519
and

349
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,720
um and because i'll be on retreat again

350
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,720
and uh so it works really well from

351
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,920
connecting the two

352
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,800
for the retreat practice and the what

353
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,760
we're doing here on youtube

354
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,320
so thank you very very much and i look

355
