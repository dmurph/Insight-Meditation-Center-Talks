1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:06,640
so hello and welcome to our meditation and we're

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:14,200
during a period of time now for the last couple of months where we're focusing on

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,320
samadei and samadei has this uh dual characteristic

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:27,680
that's can seem a little bit like a paradox and

5
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:36,320
um and that is that um there's a both simultaneously a

6
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:44,960
feeling of wholeness that arises where everything's included or a feeling of um the mind

7
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,000
being quite expansive or the mental state the awareness

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
being expansive open wide inclusive of

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,440
everything on one hand And the other hand there's a centering on

10
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,960
something and that centering uh can become

11
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:16,880
so central that that's in terms of what we're aware of that's all there's left

12
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:23,680
that we're the world gets so relatively small uh in terms of what we're consciously

13
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,000
focusing on or centered on and those two things go

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,640
together so the expansive mind the whole mind that includes everything

15
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:43,200
um uh is not actually aware of

16
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,680
everything and the sense of being centered on

17
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:55,040
something it it does not exclude anything

18
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,600
so it's a little bit like this that as we get absorbed

19
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,320
in some wonderful activity we're doing we're not thinking anymore about the

20
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:13,680
past and the future we're not thinking anymore about uh right and wrong or it should be

21
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:21,319
different or should be better or we're not thinking anymore about other places

22
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:28,480
that at the same happening now we're no

23
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:36,160
longer the mind is no longer interested or involved in or

24
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:44,319
concerned with things so as we get more and more absorbed the world of where the

25
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:51,200
mind rests becomes smaller and uh while at the same time

26
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,720
this expansive mind that we have this holistic quality is there definitely

27
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,280
there but it's almost like it doesn't nothing is in

28
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:10,080
it everything could be in it but because we're so centered so focused focused on

29
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:17,200
this central thing a lot of things begin receding so in samadei at some point uh

30
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,319
people will say that they no longer hear sounds around them they're quite capable

31
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:29,920
of hearing but uh somehow the the absorption in breathing the mind is not

32
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,480
interested or not oriented towards sounds anymore at some point it's so absorbed

33
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:43,599
in just the simplicity of breathing that uh parts of the body seem to disappear

34
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:49,200
some people describe in samadei that they they don't feel their body anymore

35
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,560
and of course the body's there i've sometimes thought the body disappeared so I wanted to make sure I was still

36
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,760
there and opened my eyes of course it was there it's just

37
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,760
that somehow the the what the mind is taking in what the mind is interested in

38
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:12,000
what the mind every rather than the the field of awareness is so involved in

39
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,720
something very small though it's still very expansive so it's just kind of

40
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:23,759
like so a whole a whole wholeness of practice that becomes simpler and

41
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:31,639
simpler and simpler and one of the things that remains in this wholeness of

42
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:38,880
experience is um this first Janna is the there's still

43
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,960
a lot that remains there but it's getting simpler and what we're starting to feel now is this kind of we're now

44
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,000
we're really getting centered really there's a and so there a center that has

45
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,639
this wide hole and so one one way I think of it is that of a standing in the middle of a

46
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:04,639
trampoline where the weight of the body has the whole trampoline sagging and everything all the balls that the kids

47
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:11,440
have left on the trampoline will roll down on the center of the trampoline and so the center of the

48
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:17,360
trampoline is where the mind gets centered and everything gathers and then

49
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,160
after a while we're no longer aware of the what's outside of the trampoline and then not aware of the edges of the

50
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:31,759
trampoline just here where we're standing so to take assume a meditation

51
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:39,520
posture and taking the place where you're

52
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:48,280
sitting is so important because it is in a sense the going to be the middle of your

53
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:57,440
trampoline the middle of the circle of awareness in which we you sit

54
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:04,240
and so to really assume the place where you're sitting the place where you're lying the place

55
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,160
where you're standing

56
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:16,240
as a place to connect to feel the weight of the body against

57
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,400
the surface that the surface

58
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:31,199
that supports you from falling and falling by the pole of

59
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:39,080
gravity and maybe the surface your body's resting on feels

60
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:48,560
firm solid and gently closing your

61
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,680
eyes in some ways with the eyes closed the center of the trampoline the center

62
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:02,720
of your circle is the sensations of the body the

63
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:10,400
weight of the body the substantiality of the

64
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,360
body the solidity of the body

65
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:28,120
the simplicity of sensations of the body

66
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:51,919
and then within the body is there a center of your

67
00:07:52,360 --> 00:08:00,560
body do you have something intuitively or place that you feel maybe deep in the

68
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:05,479
torso center of gravity

69
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,400
some place where the torso the weight of the

70
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,440
torso or

71
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,440
the central

72
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:34,360
location maybe deep in the belly below the navl

73
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:45,440
that somehow the center of the trampoline of your

74
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,759
body and maybe from

75
00:08:54,120 --> 00:09:00,720
there receiving the inhale as it

76
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:13,160
begins not so much you receiving the inhale but the body receiving it

77
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:30,279
and allowing the exhale allowing the release

78
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:56,040
And also on the inhale have your awareness your

79
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:02,959
mind open as you breathe in like it's opening a window for the

80
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:10,320
breeze to come in open the mind wide to

81
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:17,440
receive the awareness of breathing breathing

82
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:30,240
in and as you exhale allowing the mind be to become

83
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,240
wide

84
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:52,920
the mind wide like the surface of a lake where the waves and ripples calm

85
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:58,399
down and the surface becomes calm and

86
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:05,440
still breathing in opening the

87
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:14,199
mind breathing out stilling the mind

88
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,160
and with the mind open

89
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:48,800
wide centering yourself centering the awareness your

90
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,240
attention on the breathing

91
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:17,680
seeing if you can be relaxed and easeful with whatever way your body is

92
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,360
breathing it's all okay

93
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:04,760
and then beyond the edges of the body's experience of

94
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:11,880
breathing are there any feelings of pleasure

95
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,880
appreciation

96
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:39,680
gladness as you breathe in let the pleasure calm of your body

97
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,720
whatever is there let it receive the

98
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,399
inhale allowing the exhale

99
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:08,600
to ride through the pleasure the joy

100
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,440
as you breathe in

101
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:35,760
connecting to the sensations of breathing in as they are received in joy or

102
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,639
pleasure

103
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:51,079
as you exhale connecting to the

104
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:55,440
exhale and riding the

105
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:06,600
exhale bringing the joy or that pleasure with you to the very end of the exhale

106
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:19,600
so there's a very gentle engagement

107
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,199
involvement centered on

108
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:36,480
breathing without the mind becoming tense or tight

109
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:36,720
giving yourself over to the simplicity of

110
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:44,240
breathing or anything more complicated anything not involved with

111
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,960
here and now that the

112
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,520
mind takes a

113
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:01,880
vacation the mind takes a break from concerns with

114
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:09,080
anything but a devotion to breathing in and breathing out

115
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:16,840
not trying too hard with anything

116
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,600
but giving yourself over to receiving

117
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:42,520
breathing receiving the inhale as if that's all there is to

118
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:53,360
do we're breathing in is received in the wide open field of

119
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:03,970
awareness and the exhale is [Music]

120
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:13,320
allowed in a wide field of settling calm

121
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:30,159
appreciating the rhythm of receiving and

122
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:42,840
allowing supported by whatever well-being

123
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,039
That's being massaged as you breathe

124
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,559
and as we come to the end of the

125
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:42,320
sitting to feel into your body your heart your

126
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:50,000
mind for whatever ever feels good about coming to the end

127
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:57,799
of the meditation how you're more settled or calm

128
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:07,120
maybe there's something you enjoy about all this something that can be called

129
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:14,919
pleasant or pleasurable maybe even some joy

130
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:20,679
or well-being that as you think

131
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:28,799
about might bring you a little smile or maybe you would turn up your

132
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:34,039
corners of your mouth just a little bit to bring a

133
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:38,639
spark of something that feels like

134
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:47,559
joy and with whatever joy or pleasure or calm that you

135
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:53,320
feel imagine that that it's through the lens of

136
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:58,158
that that you gaze upon the

137
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:07,159
world that how you see the world is a gift you give the

138
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:16,200
world if you gaze upon others with appreciation joy delight

139
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:22,320
pleasure it does them a world of good to be seen that

140
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:33,399
way even if they don't know that you look upon them that way it

141
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:40,279
spreads the conditions for friendship for kindness for

142
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:49,240
care gazing upon the world through the eyes of well-being of joy

143
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:58,000
delight calm may all beings

144
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,840
experience happiness may all

145
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,720
beings experience

146
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:16,880
safety may all beings experience

147
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:24,760
peace may all beings experience freedom

148
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,559
may all beings experience

149
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:43,039
joy well-being so we can

150
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:50,520
meet through our joy through our mutual appreciation our mutual

151
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:57,760
care the mutual way that we give each other space and

152
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:04,039
freedom may our practice of samadei

153
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:09,960
serve to bring benefit into this world

154
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,399
thank you

155
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:30,000
so welcome to this next talk the 43rd

156
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,120
talk in the series on samadei and these talks are certainly

157
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:43,600
building on the 42 earlier talks so they make more sense in the context of that

158
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:49,960
so the samadei is experience of immersion

159
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:57,320
absorption that involves a number of characteristics and one of the forms of

160
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:03,279
samadei that they're emphasized in Buddhism is called Janna and there are

161
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:08,519
four Janna four of these kind of almost

162
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:15,000
quantumly different uh states of absorption or

163
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,840
concentration and these are states uh of mind or states of being so that we want

164
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:28,080
to be careful we don't use the word concentration too much and the idea is that it's a laser focus of the mind

165
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,360
where the mind gets tight and narrow and focused and penetrating that's all too

166
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:41,600
easily narrows the field too much it's a wide open field that uh

167
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:47,440
settles into samadei and the first genre is generally

168
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:53,799
in uh it's taught they're characterized by five primary

169
00:32:53,799 --> 00:33:01,919
um kind of activities mental states that are going on and those five are called the

170
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:10,399
five Johnic factors and um and so those are the um

171
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:16,200
initial or um the um connecting

172
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:22,440
uh attention the sustaining of

173
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:29,039
attention joy happiness and then the fourth the fifth

174
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:36,519
one is uh the poly is eagata e k a g- a

175
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:43,519
ta and uh sometimes it's translated as onepointedness and sometimes it's

176
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:50,440
translated as unification or I like to call it wholeness a gathering

177
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:56,320
together and um so uh one way to kind of

178
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:01,600
uh bring those two different ideas together well I say

179
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:08,320
before I do that the idea of onepointedness uh lends itself to uh narrowing

180
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:15,520
attention to a single point and getting tense in the process it doesn't have to be that but a lot of people who practice

181
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,638
onepointedness on something will try to penetrate or have this laser focus it's

182
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:26,800
very tight and and um and uh it lead can lead to headaches even it can lead to

183
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:35,358
some kind of tension building up and some of the and negative consequences of samadei

184
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:41,358
are are born from any kind of tension involved as we practice samadei and

185
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:47,599
sometimes people are not aware that they're tense uh there's a can be a lot of pleasure a lot of goodness it can

186
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:53,118
even get concentrated with that tension But sooner or later that tension will

187
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:58,599
create some kind of unfortunate byproducts that can interfere with healthy

188
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:07,040
samadei so the word onepointedness is a little bit risky um unification or wholeness or

189
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:13,200
gathering together maybe is a little bit abstract for people to understand

190
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:18,240
so the the word that maybe kind of combines these two in a nice way might

191
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:25,240
be uh becoming one ekka means one gata can mean like going to becoming

192
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:34,000
something uh the state a state of one maybe a kind of oneness but becoming one

193
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:41,200
so every all of what we are becomes one becomes absorbed with the breathing and

194
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:47,680
there's no sense that anything is being left out but uh there's no awareness of

195
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:55,440
what's outside so it's you know if you close your eyes maybe laying on the couch and

196
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:01,839
listening to some really nice music and pretty soon uh the couch disappears the

197
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:09,560
room disappears uh the time disappears the future disappears the activities of the day

198
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:15,520
disappear in a way maybe even you disappear because you have become one

199
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:22,000
with the the music you've you've kind of centered now in the music you the

200
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,960
wholeness of experience now is defined by music so but there's you're not narrowly

201
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:34,800
focused on the music zeroing in on it uh there's a feeling that the mind is quite

202
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:40,079
you know expansive it's like the the mind has become the music become one

203
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:46,240
with the music but the music is you know broad and wide and everywhere in a certain way

204
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:53,119
so with samadei there is becoming one but you can't do that with tension it

205
00:36:53,119 --> 00:37:00,000
has to be very soft so it's almost like um uh so soft it's almost like a feather

206
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,800
that slowly lands on the ground and then is centered on the ground there becomes

207
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:13,800
one with the ground maybe i don't know what feathers are thinking about but becoming just there so

208
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:19,920
that uh it's that that love that kind of more like gently settling in and very

209
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:28,000
light feeling and so to find a way to be with um with breathing uh to be with the

210
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:35,839
sensations um and um and uh and and coming become

211
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:41,839
becoming one with it becoming simple with it becoming whole just with this

212
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:47,119
experience of breathing and so these five mental factors all work together

213
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:53,680
they're all there and they're kind of part of the whole so at this point in the first Janna there is a kind of

214
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:59,119
activity going on we are still engaged in doing some kind of practice that

215
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:05,599
gives but the way we engage it almost feels like we're we can enjoy it more so

216
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:12,480
this an uh applied attention we connecting attention yes we're here ah

217
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:20,240
connect and then and then um sustaining i sometimes uh liken it to getting a

218
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:25,280
massage where the masseuse went puts their hand and it feels so good to have

219
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:30,480
the hand touch us because we know what's going to come is the needing and so the

220
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:38,480
needing the and then or maybe the it's more like um the rhythm of needing and letting go

221
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:45,040
squeezing and letting go of a massage so there's this kind of rhythm of of a of a

222
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:50,720
making a connection fully with the breathing and then sustaining it writing

223
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:57,599
it feeling it and so the mind is gently involved with this so there's a little

224
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:04,880
bit of intentionality a little bit of participation but the sense of participation is just a delight just ah

225
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:11,760
it's so good to do this maybe it's like uh being really uh thirsty on a hot day

226
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:19,280
and then drinking um uh cool refreshing water and just feels so good to take

227
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:25,599
those sips and the gulps and have it you feel ah this is good this is good each

228
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:33,119
sip feels good in new ways like the rhythm ah and so that speaks to um this applied

229
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:39,000
and sustained attention uh is related to some of the sense of well-being that can

230
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:47,280
arise and I'll talk more about that tomorrow but um uh uh there's a sense of the pleasure

231
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:55,119
the joy the delight that comes uh uh almost as if it's like a thei that

232
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:01,640
rhythm of massaging applied s attention and sustained attention is almost like

233
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:09,480
um blowing on a gentle flame keeping it going keeping it going and

234
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:16,480
um and so it's it's not work it's not like we have an agenda it's not like we're trying to make something happen

235
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:22,240
ideally it's just really good for its own sake and so as we go deeper into

236
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:29,920
this these deep absorptions very important the more we go into it to not have trying to make

237
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:35,760
anything happen and do something um and try to do better but it's more like just

238
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:43,280
really enjoying what what's here now and just to be content with that and and that

239
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:49,280
allows for a deeper settling that we'll see so there's five factors then the first

240
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:57,520
four is um connecting attention and then sustaining then two forms of well-being

241
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:02,880
a joy and a happiness and I'll talk more about these tomorrow and then today the

242
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:10,119
emphasis is on this ekagata this onepointedness of becoming one this

243
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:16,640
unification and um which is a simplification where we allow allow the

244
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:22,560
mind to become simpler and simpler unconcerned about anything but just this

245
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:27,760
process of the samadei itself and we might be very aware that

246
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:34,560
there's a field of openness field of goodness field of joy and um and we're

247
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:40,800
just allowing that everything to be there everything there mutually supportive of this process of being

248
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,800
content just to be with the breathing uh just the simplicity of just breathing in

249
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:52,200
and breathing out nothing else needs to happen and in some ways the world

250
00:41:52,200 --> 00:42:00,000
disappears like on the couch listening to music um the the your your cushion

251
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,800
disappears your the room

252
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:13,599
disappears yesterday disappears tomorrow disappears maybe even you disappear in

253
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:19,079
just simply staying there with the breathing so

254
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:25,520
um so you might see as you go through the day today if there are certain activities

255
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:33,280
you do that uh lend itself to this kind of becoming one with the activity

256
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:39,680
so it could be something like washing dishes or or putting the dishes away in

257
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:45,720
a way that or cleaning the kitchen floor or folding the laundry

258
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:55,119
or chopping vegetables or making your bed or um you know uh putting your

259
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:01,839
clothes very nicely away in a drawer where you just give yourself over to that activity not to get it done quickly

260
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:07,599
to move on to more important things but to that this is the place to do become

261
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:13,599
one with this activity and often that means that somehow we do it with care we

262
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:18,720
do it so it feels really nice it looks like like like you know that folding it

263
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:24,240
in a neat kind of nice way the t-shirt before you put it in the drawer is not

264
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:30,640
because we're fidious but because that's what samadei does to be fully involved

265
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:38,680
with what we do is to do things in a way that are harmonious beautiful pleasant

266
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:45,160
enjoyable and see in the course of the day whether you can begin experiencing

267
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:51,560
some of the benefits of samadei in being absorbed in what you

268
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:58,960
do and uh you probably your heart will love it if you give yourself more

269
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:05,480
chances through the day to become one whole

270
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:12,599
unified one pointedly absorbed in what you're actually doing in the

271
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:22,760
moment so thank you very much and we'll continue thank you
