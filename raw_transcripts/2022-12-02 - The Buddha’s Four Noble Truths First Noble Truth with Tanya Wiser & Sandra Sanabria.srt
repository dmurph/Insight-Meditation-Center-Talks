5
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:10,739
that sounds a little loud to me a little loud okay but you do get soft I yeah

12
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,319
together about the four noble truths so um really

13
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:25,080
excited about it and you know happy to hear you're planning to come

14
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:31,379
for all the weeks and I don't know if you guys are you thinking you're going to make it for all four weeks there

15
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:36,659
might actually end up being five so um we'll we'll talk about that as we go

16
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:45,239
but what's that well the there's five five Thursdays in

17
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:50,599
December it's four noble truths I initially planned

18
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:57,120
we're gonna make up one and then yeah there's some scheduling

19
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,180
things so we'll wait for everybody to come into

20
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:09,420
the Hall before we officially begin but um I maybe in the meantime

21
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:15,420
um and Ben do you mind grabbing a microphone what would be really fun is to hear what

22
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:22,919
do you know about the four notable truths just a few words about how you're how familiar you are just you know what

23
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:29,000
your relationship is to it so

24
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:36,620
feel free to come on up you just got to stay one side or the other of the blue line

25
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,120
um does anybody feel like they would like to answer that question about

26
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:49,040
what do you know about the four noble truths and hi

27
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:57,120
Matrix great I mainly know the first one

28
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,699
I it's my expertise

29
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:11,040
but yeah what I know is that the first Noble Truth is that there's suffering yeah

30
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:16,280
and that there is a Cause

31
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:24,660
which is clinging or attachment yeah yeah and there is a way to get free from

32
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:33,319
that and there is a path that you can follow to get there that's right

33
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:41,400
yeah maybe just pass the mic and if you want to share anything the question is yeah Ben maybe Ben will answer any what

34
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,500
is your thoughts about the four noble truths you know you don't have to repeat what Mitra said is there anything you

35
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:52,100
would add or your relationship and if nothing at all

36
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:58,259
what brings you here I don't think what brings you here for

37
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:03,780
the series yeah um I got a

38
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:10,860
flyer or the the notification what's on there what what's the subject and but uh

39
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:18,539
I mean what resonated with me about

40
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:24,060
many of the talks and what I've learned over the years listening to different

41
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:29,699
teachers is suffering and attachments and how

42
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:36,560
attachments um the kind of it's like a

43
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,819
cause and effect kind of thing um I don't know what else I have to add

44
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:47,340
great and there's I mean we all have plenty of attachments

45
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:53,539
and some of them are oh I just this is how I do things

46
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:00,120
Etc yeah yes thank you Ben thanks so we don't have to

47
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,240
at this point I want to just kind of yeah let me just shift where and say

48
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,639
um just one or two things and then Sandra will do a guided meditation and

49
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:17,039
then we'll talk more about this first Noble truth but maybe I'll just say this

50
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:24,960
that um you know the Buddha this was his first real teaching

51
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:32,099
and it was right after his full Awakening and after he await you know

52
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:37,440
had this Awakening experience and this insight to how the mind works

53
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:45,120
um he first was like oh there's no way I'm going to teach no way like what's the there's too many no

54
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:52,199
people are not going to get it it's just going to be confusing and and then you know

55
00:07:52,199 --> 00:08:00,319
so The Story Goes some Celestial beings came to him and pleaded him to teach and so he he thought oh you know he sort of

56
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:09,419
considered okay well you know maybe I'll do this and um

57
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:15,500
and uh and then he thought well but who should I teach to

58
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:22,979
if I'm gonna if I'm willing to do this who should I teach to and who will understand the Dharma who

59
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:28,080
will understand this and so you know he was having his own crisis really around

60
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:35,399
what to do next in his practice and his life and he remembered for five people

61
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:41,399
that he had done a lot of practice with and he thought they'll I can talk to them I can teach

62
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:46,980
them and so he did he went and he taught them

63
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:53,160
and they did understand and that is what they say set they call it rolling the

64
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,920
wheel of the Dharma set was set in motion that that was the beginning of this

65
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:05,640
wheel that we're we're benefiting from now is that very first his way of

66
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:11,640
understanding the mind which we'll talk about around the four noble truths and suffering and life and this Wheel of

67
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:18,480
Life and the way to Freedom so I feel grateful personally that um

68
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:25,380
that he was you know convinced to teach and that he had people that he

69
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:31,800
could teach who could understand so he felt like it was you know a Worthy

70
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,320
a worthy endeavor so

71
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:44,100
just to plant the seeds of inspiration and kind of the history and the the

72
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:50,279
poignancy of this particular teaching Sandra will you do a guided meditation

73
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,820
for us

74
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:05,880
so I'll invite you to find a comfortable posture I'm gonna do a

75
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:11,700
around 20 minutes meditation so just feel comfortable and

76
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:16,800
that you can really soften your body if you want to bring some movement first

77
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:23,820
the shoulders the hair just let your body move in the

78
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:28,760
way it needs to move before we settle down

79
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:35,399
I'm taking a couple of deep breaths inhaling by the nose

80
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:39,140
well I'm exciting by the mouth

81
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:56,600
and I'll invite you to feel the contact with the floor

82
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:03,380
notice the contact with the chair

83
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:15,440
the touch of your hands on the legs

84
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,820
and just really feel your body here

85
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,040
notice in the weight of the body

86
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:56,600
maybe going from head to toe

87
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:06,680
noticing the muscles of the face and with the exhalation

88
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:12,079
inviting to soften to release

89
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:28,740
allowing the shoulders to get away from the ears and maybe falling

90
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,700
a little backwards

91
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:40,519
perhaps breeding becomes a little easier

92
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:54,860
noticing the chest and the belly

93
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:02,600
and softening

94
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,440
noticing any holding

95
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,760
perhaps with the exhale inviting to

96
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,899
to soften to release

97
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:58,220
it may be that the breathing becomes more clear

98
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:09,959
and bring your attention to that place in your body we're breathing

99
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:13,579
is more clear to you

100
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:41,940
not about thinking about the breeding but just sensing it

101
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:47,519
in the body noticing what happens

102
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,899
with the in-breath

103
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:02,660
and how what do you feel with the exhale with the out breath

104
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,399
and it's not about kind of becoming a monitor of your

105
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:29,839
breathing bed resting on the breathing

106
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:36,980
relaxing softening with the breathing

107
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:45,120
there's nothing to do or nothing to change it's just resting your awareness

108
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,060
around your breathing in your breathing

109
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:46,639
every time you notice the mind is distracted

110
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,360
because it all happened

111
00:16:53,220 --> 00:17:00,720
just bring it back it's an invitation to get back to the body

112
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,758
to the sensations of breathing

113
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:01,200
if the breathing doesn't feel right for you you could bring the attention to the

114
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,760
sensations in your hands

115
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:14,179
for the contact with the chair or the floor

116
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:46,520
when you get distracted notice what is your attitude

117
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,820
are you annoyed by the destruction or

118
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:12,240
or you like it very much and you just get lost it's so nice to get lost

119
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,120
just noticing what the Mind does

120
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,059
perhaps you're back to a discussion this morning or

121
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:45,440
planning for tomorrow

122
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:01,260
for some achiness in the body some worry

123
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,400
some fear

124
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:48,260
and whatever you find allow it to be there

125
00:21:51,659 --> 00:22:01,580
you don't have to change it or fix it or ignore it just allow it to be there

126
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:33,020
acknowledge the destruction

127
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:38,419
the boredom the sleepiness

128
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,820
that little egg it's technology

129
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:54,679
there's nothing to change or fix

130
00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:04,760
and come back to your breathing to your hands

131
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:57,799
and if the Mind feels concentrated

132
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:07,020
if it's easy to keep the attention on the

133
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:13,399
breathing enjoy that notice it too

134
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:16,080
and also notice that what was distracting you a few

135
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:23,840
minutes ago it's maybe gone and there's a new distraction now

136
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,559
just notice it

137
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,380
noticing your body

138
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:14,179
how does the distraction or or the concentration

139
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:17,778
expressed in the body

140
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:51,080
foreign

141
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:04,080

thank you oh good evening everyone hello again

147
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:49,860
hello Sandra um I noticed um I tried to have just the resting of

148
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:55,500
the awareness of the breathing and then I hadn't hadn't been to IMC in a while

149
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:02,520
so it's it's nice and cozy and I was I found myself I was going like this and

150
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:11,520
and then I'm like I fell asleep and then but then I was kind of not nice about it and I like okay well I

151
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:18,299
was dozing off so I just opened my eyes and but I you know I started this meditation

152
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:24,120
Journey with Tanya and never in my wildest dreams did I think I could sit

153
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:30,120
for 20 minutes comfortably because before in the beginning I was like I can't do this and then Richard showed me

154
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:35,880
how to sit like this and it's all coming together even if I'm dozing off a bit so

155
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:42,720
it's okay it's all good nice thank you very nice

156
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,820
something else did you happen to see your mind going

157
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:54,659
everywhere yes it was very much so and um the breathing just trying to focus on

158
00:33:54,659 --> 00:34:00,419
that and not strain I still find that even doing this or at least trying to

159
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:06,059
dedicate every day to Twitter I found myself doing more five minutes it's

160
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:13,740
just but you know every day trying to be consistent and has just kind of upsetting when I still

161
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:19,740
feel like even though I'm like my body is comfortable in this position my my

162
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:27,599
mind is still very much everywhere else and it I can I I know what I'm thinking

163
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:36,780
about it's yeah I'm very much aware of it I just have to Let It Be and that's not easy and

164
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:44,158
softening like being comfortable yeah you can be alert but comfortable yes so

165
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:51,138
it helps yes ah so like you relax the body the mind also yes relax

166
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:57,960
yeah thank you thank you thank you for anybody else any any thoughts

167
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,240
and the observations hi

168
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:09,540
um for myself I noticed things are becoming a little bit more routine getting into the practice of the

169
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:15,420
meditation it's almost like a walk in the park whereas before I would try and hurry up the 30 minutes like are we or

170
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:20,520
you know 20 minutes or whatever like is it the time yet and now I'm more kind of

171
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:25,800
accepting you know 20 minutes or 15 minutes will pass when 20 minutes or 15 minutes past you can't have it fast or

172
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:31,040
slow um 20 minutes or 15 minutes but um every once in a while

173
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:37,020
I'll have thoughts come up and I'll push them aside that was embarrassing that thing that happened way back when or

174
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:43,920
something but um every once in a while something will come up that's kind of important oh I forgot about that I should probably get to that eventually

175
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:50,400
so those ones kind of um will hamper me a little bit more of what I call more

176
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,099
important kind of a just random thoughts but for the most part now it's not as

177
00:35:56,099 --> 00:36:04,200
judgmental when things come up I just sort of brush them aside yeah nice yeah just oh look at that I

178
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:09,780
have forgotten about it I'm like okay I'll take care of that later but yeah I know that's very nice is the

179
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:16,040
attitude also that matters um yeah thank you

180
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:23,520
I would just okay for me to go ahead yes I think

181
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:30,660
there's just two two examples right here that I'll start with that exemplify

182
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:36,480
um creating a you know less suffering for

183
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:42,599
yourselves both of you the way you shared so the first Noble Truth is

184
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:51,000
and the poly term is there is dukkha and dukha is widely translated as

185
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,599
suffering often referenced to suffering but it actually when you look at the Pali word and you look at the different

186
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:03,720
ways to Define it it's it extremely broad range of experience from subtle

187
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:11,000
irritation stress to you know distress to

188
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:20,400
pain to agony it's this huge huge range of experience

189
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:27,119
and there's a a simile that the Buddha gave about the arrow you probably have

190
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:34,040
heard the simile some of you but in explaining suffering

191
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:41,160
one of the things that the Buddha pointed to was if you got shot with an arrow

192
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:48,119
would it be painful yes right now if you got shot with a second Arrow

193
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:53,220
would that be more painful let's imagine yes twice as much pain

194
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:59,520
going to be more painful and a third and a fourth right so

195
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,920
much of our suffering much of our dukkha is like the second third fourth fifth

196
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:11,520
two hundredth Arrow it's the it's the added psychological

197
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:19,020
stress that we put on ourselves so and Rose your decision not to trip out

198
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:25,380
about your mind wandering or falling asleep was an example of deciding I'm not going to keep shooting arrows at

199
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:30,839
myself that was a beautiful example of not

200
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:39,060
continuing to contribute to our difficulty and yours example of not tripping out

201
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:44,520
about fast slow things complete that of our control but we often try and control

202
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:50,579
that which is out of our control and it creates stress that might be a more subtle irritating

203
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:56,520
pressure kind of stress but it's stress and the experience the opposite

204
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:03,900
experience of just going oh okay well it's going to be 15 minutes or 20 minutes or whatever it is there's kind

205
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:10,440
of a freedom in that and that's the kind of Freedom that the Buddha wanted to teach us about

206
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:16,859
and um my I feel like my practice changed

207
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:22,800
completely when my relationship to do got changed

208
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,079
when my relationship to Duca changed the whole practice change

209
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:37,560
and Duca essentially became for me a very very useful feedback mechanism

210
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:44,940
I also liken it to a you know my relationship to using a compass we use the compass to help us find our

211
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:51,960
way we use the experience or absence of dukkha to help us know if we are on the

212
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,880
path if we are practicing

213
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:04,440
so if I look at a if I'm experiencing

214
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:10,920
that the kind of stress that is Duca the optional suffering right of the ways we

215
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:18,980
make things much harder for ourselves it's like looking at a compass and the compass says

216
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:27,180
keep going this way and you're going to suffer more right it's telling you right there this

217
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:32,520
is the way to more suffering you know so if you want to go that way keep going

218
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:40,920
this way and my option is to stop and reorient and sort of decide how I want

219
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:46,440
to proceed what the next step will be whether it will be toward more suffering

220
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:51,260
or away from suffering toward less suffering

221
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:59,640
um and feedback like it you know really

222
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:06,599
um what was I think oh pain okay so if you get a cut on your hand

223
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:12,480
and it hurts what does that mean to you how do you

224
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,579
relate to the cut hurting like in a really simple way like what's the

225
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:22,880
purpose of your hand hurting if you get cut

226
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:31,099
security there's the mic do you mind just uh

227
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:40,020
it's not on sorry Ash just for the body to know that this is something let it

228
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:48,540
rest let it heal leave it alone give it care right really uh pretty simple actually if we

229
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:54,799
don't know we're being cut we're not going to stop what we're doing that's causing harm

230
00:41:55,020 --> 00:42:00,960
right like if it doesn't hurt haven't you ever been cutting your not

231
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:07,500
known that you were put doing something that was causing your body to be hurt if it doesn't hurt if we don't have that

232
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:13,079
feedback we don't know the body is going to get injured and so

233
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:19,800
if we if we are if we can see that the function of

234
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:25,079
suffering dukkha is the same as the function function of pain from hurting

235
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:32,640
ourselves we can start to be all of a sudden yes it's unpleasant but oh my gosh I'm

236
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:39,540
really grateful I'm recognizing this because just like I want to take care of my body I want to take care of my mind

237
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:47,040
my heart so it's feedback and that very same way

238
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:52,079
it's just that it's like how I think it's kind of a

239
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:58,500
miracle that there's some sort of internal system that gives us feedback when we

240
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:04,740
are moving in the direction of of harming ourselves or others

241
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:10,280
so the Buddha um

242
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:17,700
oh please thank you thank you what if you're like getting

243
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:24,140
feedback and it's constructive yeah and then

244
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:30,960
you know it's you know it's good for you like you get cut you have to rest your hand but

245
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:36,540
what if it's something that you have to deal with and

246
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:42,060
he like Let It Define you even though you know you shouldn't and it's like

247
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:47,119
especially with work dumb you know work stuff so

248
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:53,400
it's supposed to make you make me better but it sucks

249
00:43:53,400 --> 00:44:01,280
in my you know well it all I mean I think um you know this is complicated right

250
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:08,040
relationships are complicated our relationship to work is complicated

251
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:13,140
um without the more specifics I don't know how to respond but I would love to

252
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:19,440
have that conversation with you you know um and hopefully we can flush it out a little bit more

253
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:27,180
here over this period of time that's yes bring your examples let's do it

254
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:34,500
um yeah so let me tell you just a few more key

255
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:41,160
points about the Buddhist teachings around this particular you know Mitra started she

256
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:46,380
named the four noble truths so just to remind you there is dukkha there is the

257
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:53,640
cause of dukkha there is the end of dukkha and there is the way to the ending of alduka

258
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:58,680
it's it's very much like a medical diagnostic tool right there's it's very

259
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:05,700
similar to how medicine works in terms of diagnosis and so the dukkha is like the symptom

260
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:11,760
that you go to a doctor with this is the symptom I have doctor okay the doctor

261
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:17,460
then says this is the cause of that suffering that whatever right and then

262
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:25,560
there's the ending of that particular illness hopefully if we're lucky right but this is for our working with our

263
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:32,050
minds and our hearts and with others in our life and our conditioning so

264
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:38,040
[Music] um his this is his first teaching this is setting the wheel of the Dharma

265
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:45,000
emotion it you know the do the Buddha and sometimes people will say I I teach I

266
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:52,260
only teach suffering in the end of suffering but I think the probably the real quote is closer to I teach duka and

267
00:45:52,260 --> 00:46:00,240
the end of dukkha and it's not that that's the only thing he teaches but that is primary to what he teaches

268
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:07,500
many things he teaches but they're all in service really of the end of dukkha

269
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:14,700
so it keeps this particular teaching at the center of everything he teaches

270
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:20,660
sort of a very very center of it um

271
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:26,640
and another important thing about the way

272
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:34,200
the Buddha taught and about these teachings as well is that this is not like a Creed or something

273
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:41,400
that you're meant to like just believe in it really is is it's like you can

274
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:46,440
believe that it hurts to get a cut but it's that's theoretical

275
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:52,859
we have to pay attention to when it hurts so it's it's the same idea that this

276
00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:58,920
this is a teaching to be incorporated to use as a guide for us and and everything

277
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:04,579
we do in all all forms of our practice all forms of our life

278
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:13,400
another way to think about this is that um

279
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:21,300
you know the their well I think I'll leave that alone

280
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:28,319
I think I'm gonna see yeah so let's let me shift to like

281
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:35,000
that relationship right to this suffering to dukkah like

282
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:42,380
so how do we start to be to welcome

283
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:52,680
when we recognize we're suffering and that's almost the opposite of what

284
00:47:52,680 --> 00:48:00,119
our instinct is when it comes to emotional suffering physically not so much I mean sometimes

285
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:05,160
we do we override right some people more than others but when it comes to

286
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:10,560
emotional or psychological suffering a lot of us collapse

287
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:17,720
or just kind of kind of keep trying to go and ignore it

288
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:24,900
um kind of trying to like it's like almost like we wanna make convince ourselves or the world

289
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:30,599
that we it's not really happening and somehow we don't have to give in to this

290
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:37,980
like there's something really um weird I find it weird that that's our

291
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:44,780
relationship to suffering to hurt to pain to distress

292
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:54,720
so really starting to be curious about what what is your pattern what is your

293
00:48:54,720 --> 00:49:01,740
relationship to noticing when you're having a hard time when you're having duka what is your

294
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:07,500
this is your conditioned the nature of conditioning right is you can start to notice

295
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:12,780
in your relationship to suffering so much about yourself so much about how

296
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:18,300
your mind has adapted and work is working and then in that space you can

297
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:25,220
start to like oh well I don't really have to do it that way

298
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:31,800
so one um

299
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:40,859
one way that I like to think about this is you know on 92 Highway 92 and 101

300
00:49:40,859 --> 00:49:46,980
when you're driving on the highway actually on 92 as you're going into Half Moon Bay in the middle of the road

301
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:53,880
there's rumble strips and then along the side there's these rumble strips and rumble strips are those things that when

302
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:59,339
you drive over them your car goes it really vibrates and it's loud and it's

303
00:49:59,339 --> 00:50:05,460
quite abrupt and so to me it's almost like that's

304
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:12,060
that's duka you know you we're on the path we're driving we're on the road and

305
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:18,240
you know we start we we wander out of our Lane

306
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:24,319
you know and and then you know it's like

307
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:29,400
the dukkah happens and sometimes it's really abrupt and loud and irritating

308
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:34,800
and you can be like oh I remember plenty of times driving on freeways and on the

309
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:42,420
sides feeling why is it you know like very irritated and that's maybe the natural initial

310
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:50,040
response it's totally fine but then like if we step back and we go oh wait a minute like I was looking at

311
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:55,260
the ocean instead of the road if I had just kept wondering I would

312
00:50:55,260 --> 00:51:03,119
have been off the road I would be in the ditch and so can I be grateful

313
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:09,660
that that experience happened so that I and you know that it woke me

314
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:16,500
up that it brought me back to the path to paying attention to where I was and not wandering off

315
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:22,800
so um am I supposed to be done at 7 20 yes

316
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:28,980
okay so we'll say one more little thing which is that it can be very helpful to think

317
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:35,760
about um that there is biological physical suffering that that's just innate part

318
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:41,220
of life like you know we're going to adopt we're born we age we get sick we

319
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:46,559
die these are this is just kind of this biological fact of being a human

320
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:54,920
and then there's psychological stuff suffering and psychological suffering stems from our reactivity

321
00:51:54,960 --> 00:52:00,240
to whatever is happening it's all about the reactivity the judgments the which

322
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:05,640
is a reaction the not liking it which is a reaction the wanting more of it which

323
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:10,040
is a reaction and

324
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:16,020
so it can be helpful to kind of think about suffering in those two terms and

325
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:21,240
we can go further into looking at sort of the psychological suffering and

326
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:26,460
psychological suffering that's based in identity Me Mine this is about me it's

327
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:31,680
personal um and it also can be about interpersonal issues

328
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:37,020
about you know our relationship to somebody how they're going to see us now

329
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:42,180
or what we really want them to be doing instead of what they're doing

330
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:49,079
that that's a interpersonal form of suffering and then you could also think about systemic suffering which is where

331
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:55,500
you might think about you know institutionalized racism things that are

332
00:52:55,500 --> 00:53:01,680
kind of on a grander scale incorporated into a system or society that oppress

333
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:07,079
women in Iran in my view it's oppression right but of

334
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:13,700
course that's my view and I think a lot of women in Iran feel that way right now they're telling us so and that's been

335
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:19,980
institutionalized right it's become systemic um

336
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:25,559
so so there's different this this is said

337
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:30,780
to say it can't kind of trying to help you start to look at and differentiate

338
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:35,838
the ways that duka might be showing up in your life

339
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:46,140
I was thinking as you were speaking that the four noble truths is kind of the

340
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:51,420
Buddha deconstructing suffering so first you have to see it

341
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:57,420
then you understand where he's coming from you know that it is okay I can can

342
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:04,079
be there's an end to it and then it offers you not a recipe but a path to follow that

343
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:09,300
will help you with it and I think as you were saying if we

344
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:14,700
don't see it if we don't become aware of that we're suffering and the sufferings

345
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:19,859
can be kind of a strong word if you are annoyed if you are uncomfortable

346
00:54:19,859 --> 00:54:25,440
if you don't notice it there's nothing we can do about it

347
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:32,280
I think it's in our biology uh kind of place against us in that sense

348
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:39,319
because we in our brain and and evolution and everything you we are

349
00:54:39,319 --> 00:54:45,240
biased towards looking for what's Pleasant to what's good and it's just

350
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:50,880
plain survival um we're going to be aversive to things

351
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:57,480
that are make us uncomfortable that we need to look for food we need to look to be warm

352
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:05,760
we like to be in community and things like that and then it's like the suffering that we

353
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:12,000
Society impose over us the way we were educated where we grew up if you look at

354
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:18,660
the publicity for example you deserve it it's like be unhappy or

355
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:24,359
be unwell or be anxious or

356
00:55:24,359 --> 00:55:30,780
feeling fear it's it's a big No-No like no like everything has to be perfect so

357
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:36,180
in a ways so we have the biology and plus uh all

358
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:44,819
the people that profit on us because it's human nature to suffer in a way

359
00:55:44,819 --> 00:55:53,220
so I'm gonna maybe give you some tips that you could like practices that you

360
00:55:53,220 --> 00:56:01,020
could do on your day-to-day um I mentioned during the meditation to

361
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:07,619
notice the attitude because a lot of these practices how we do it it's not so

362
00:56:07,619 --> 00:56:16,020
much what we do but how what is the attitude that we have so for what I'm gonna invite you to do

363
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:21,839
at some point during the week when you feel like um is to bring

364
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:28,260
a very kind curious awareness

365
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:34,920
so like huh look at that I hadn't seen that before like I didn't know I reacted

366
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:41,339
like that all the time like we we have all those patterns and habits and we may

367
00:56:41,339 --> 00:56:47,460
not like him when we start noticing them it's like oh I'm not I'm not a good person or think

368
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:52,800
like that we can go really to the extreme so the invitation is to bring

369
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:59,940
kindness and curiosity and curiosity like for example you go to

370
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:05,700
a place for a new hike but that you have never been before there's trees you have never seen before

371
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:10,859
the terrain is different so look you are really looking very carefully where you

372
00:57:10,859 --> 00:57:16,559
put your your feet like uh or gonna climb there so you're very careful and

373
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:22,079
like watching oh I can't see that tree oh look at those flowers so it's like

374
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:27,720
let's check there's something new in ourselves so it's a visit it's an

375
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:35,460
internal hike in a way I think the the very first thing uh kind

376
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:41,880
of the uh oh the other thing is the exercises like

377
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:50,099
big suffering like somebody dies we have a problem at at work

378
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:55,800
um we are in an accident we twist our ankle those are like whoa you very

379
00:57:55,800 --> 00:58:03,059
quickly realize that you're suffering but there's other type of suffering that they're not so obvious for the reason I

380
00:58:03,059 --> 00:58:09,900
was telling you sometimes we just don't want to see it it's like you know I'm good I'm happy I'm well everybody likes

381
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:17,099
me um you're in a group with friends and you're all smiles and things like that isn't it so that is that little

382
00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:22,140
suffering that little annoyance that we tend to forget and that's what I'm gonna

383
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:28,200
invite you to notice and it's because like going to the gym you're not going

384
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:33,420
to start lifting the 20 50 pounds let's just start with the three pounds the

385
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:42,119
five pounds and that's day-to-day suffering so let's say once a day you sit down and

386
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:49,260
the purpose is put 10 minutes aside and notice what am I feeling

387
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:55,079
what is making me uncomfortable and just like curiosity like

388
00:58:55,079 --> 00:59:00,780
I just noticed for example that my uncle is my I just twisted my food several

389
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:06,900
months ago and he said oh my foot is still hurting like that kind of suffering because I am I Ever Gonna Get

390
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:12,240
Well is am I gonna be free of this pain someday like I started like going like

391
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:20,220
oh look at that that's too good um you have a disc you had a discussion with a co-worker a family member or

392
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:26,760
something like that and you're still running that scenario in your head and you're telling yourself I should have

393
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:35,099
said that tomorrow I'm gonna let them know and things like that that's okay so just sit down and see hmm let's see what

394
00:59:35,099 --> 00:59:41,940
kind of things are going on in my mind and notice it no not with the intention

395
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:48,020
of going not fix it just see it like wow

396
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:53,280
and I think we all have the tendency we see something wrong and we want to go

397
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:58,920
and fix it it okay we need to do something here so notice what you do to

398
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:04,319
fix it to make it better to hide it

399
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:11,760
um sometimes we don't see the suffering we see what we do to cover the suffering

400
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:17,760
so notice that too like you're waiting in line what's the first thing you do

401
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:25,380
and you take your cell phone and start browsing like with no particular reason with no

402
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:32,280
purpose at all it's like notice that so notice the suffering or notice what you're doing to hide it and suffering is

403
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:38,280
a strong word here the annoyance the uh you're bored it's like oh my gosh do I

404
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:45,000
have to wait DMV for example things like that what do you do and then like why am

405
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:52,380
I doing this like you just start browsing look at your I don't know your Facebook or whatever social platform you

406
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:57,720
utilize so what what is why am I doing why am I doing this is I'm noticing

407
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:06,299
those things and again do it with kindness and like wow look at that I'm I'm just

408
01:01:06,299 --> 01:01:13,440
I'm not doing anything I just took it out like automatically how many times do we check our email

409
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:18,559
like every minute it's like I I assure you there's no new email

410
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:24,180
and we do it over and on like so oh what is what is behind that what is it that

411
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:30,680
I'm trying to get distracted from and see what happens

412
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:36,839
um yeah the other thing is okay the more

413
01:01:36,839 --> 01:01:43,799
noticeable annoyance discomfort like it's so

414
01:01:43,799 --> 01:01:49,079
obvious that you're seeing it so first what I was saying during the

415
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:54,900
meditation relax your body take a couple of deep breaths like oh can I relax my

416
01:01:54,900 --> 01:02:02,520
body it's not gonna fix but it's going to help you be better

417
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:08,880
with it face it and then maybe try to investigate a little bit

418
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:14,640
like the example the discussion that you have with a co-worker in the morning and

419
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:20,640
you're going over and over and I should have said that I'm gonna tell my boss

420
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:26,819
like we go into all these Loops yeah we had the second Arrow the third Arrow the

421
01:02:26,819 --> 01:02:32,760
four arrow so when you notice that you're in that situation could you

422
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:39,839
separate what was like the pain what what causing you to be

423
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:45,359
hurt or be sad or be annoyed what was the cause and then what is what you're

424
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:52,920
adding on top of it can you separate the two things and again is observation what

425
01:02:52,920 --> 01:03:01,140
the invitation right now is observe see what's happening and it may be that just by noticing

426
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:06,480
things tend to soften a little bit things tend to relax a little bit

427
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:12,000
what Tanya was saying too about these um

428
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:18,420
we we don't oftentimes we don't suffer in isolation so something happens and so

429
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:25,339
we have the event and then is because you really like that

430
01:03:25,339 --> 01:03:31,319
co-worker you get along so well and then you got so that what they say to you was

431
01:03:31,319 --> 01:03:36,960
so hurting and so terrible and it's also oh wow it's my relationship with this

432
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:43,200
person so don't look at yourself in isolation but oh wow is my relationship

433
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:49,079
to other people that really comes to play I think like family relationships

434
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:54,559
with our partners with our sons with our parents and those are complicated

435
01:03:54,559 --> 01:04:01,079
relationships so can we separate what was that happen what is that I am adding

436
01:04:01,079 --> 01:04:08,660
on top of that and recognize that is maybe that relationship that makes it very difficult

437
01:04:09,059 --> 01:04:14,700
think yeah I don't I want to make sure we leave time for the small groups great

438
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:21,839
well that's a perfect warm-up for the breakout groups actually so um what we what we like to do assuming

439
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:27,240
you're willing is probably to break you up into two groups so two groups of four

440
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:32,640
and um and have you share in that in those groups

441
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:38,280
personal examples that you feel comfortable sharing so don't share what you don't feel comfortable sharing

442
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:46,559
and you don't have a lot of time so not all the details but just this kind of a brief sketch of some examples for you

443
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:52,260
maybe think about big suffering and then a small suffering

444
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:57,839
big dukus molduca and also maybe what is a psychological or what is an

445
01:04:57,839 --> 01:05:04,980
interpersonal duka what's a personal duka like kind of can you come up with any

446
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:10,140
questions about those or examples of them and see if you can help each other kind

447
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:15,960
of identify by hearing from each other and sharing in that way are you in agreement

448
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:22,980
with willingness to do these great okay and so I tend to suggest people not go

449
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:29,940
into a group with someone they know well so you feel free to share and

450
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:35,220
um you know so I just leave it to you to maybe make a group on this side of the

451
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:41,460
room and a group on that side of the room um four people per group

452
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:47,299
go ahead and uh yeah that would be awesome

453
01:05:55,559 --> 01:06:02,760
so go ahead and introduce yourselves maybe say your name and where you

454
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:08,660
where you live or some if you've ever been to IMC before
