1
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:12,929
foreign [Music]

2
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:22,680
and for those of us here locally and we're kind of in a low between storms

3
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,439
and maybe meditation practice for some of you is a lull between different kinds

4
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:36,360
of storms a kind of uh this Sabbath or

5
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:43,260
a sacred pause in the middle of busyness or

6
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:50,538
preoccupations so welcome

7
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:59,940
in Japanese Buddhism in Zen a monk is some especially a young Monk

8
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,420
is sometimes referred to by the title of an unsweet

9
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:12,140
u-n-s-u-i-un sui and it's a combination of two words

10
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:19,619
cloud and water and uh so it's kind of a maybe an

11
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:26,220
affectionate way of referring to a young monk who is to practice being like clouds and Waters

12
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,860
not offering any resistance to anything but kind of flowing freely and

13
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,140
reluctantly between things or around things or through things or

14
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:44,700
um that offers no resistance but also takes the path of least resistance to go

15
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:51,899
forward so uh it's interesting to take this as an

16
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:58,619
analogy or metaphor for what we do with our awareness when we meditate

17
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:04,979
that too there is a kind of way that using awareness being aware being

18
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:10,200
mindful is something we do

19
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:19,080
and so that while we do that we can cease stop quiet being involved

20
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,599
in all the other things that the Mind usually gets involved in

21
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:31,980
so it's interesting to you know settle the water of awareness onto breathing in

22
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:39,480
the body but then to notice that this to doing the activity of being

23
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,760
aware gets interrupted by things gets interrupted by our thoughts and our

24
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,099
preoccupations gets interrupted by our reactivity to

25
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:56,000
what's happening if we don't like it we don't or we really want it

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,480
and this interruption in the activity of being aware of being mindful

27
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:11,099
is to be noticed but then bring back the flow of awareness the flow of the water and just

28
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:18,840
kind of flow around recognize bump up against whatever is happening but just let let the awareness be like

29
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:26,220
water that flows around and comes back to the to the bottom of the lake the quiet

30
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:33,060
place of the lake in your body with your breathing being aware with your breathing

31
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:41,480
flowing with your breathing so maybe this metaphor is Meaningful

32
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:48,780
so to assume meditation posture

33
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:56,959
one that allows certain kind of feeling of aliveness in your body

34
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:02,819
whether it's repositioning your hands and arms so that they're not completely

35
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:09,360
passive but also not active

36
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:14,760
kind of alive even for some for as simple as turning

37
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:22,940
the Palms up to the ceiling if usually your palms are down can give a little bit of a liveness

38
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:32,840
so a sense of being vitality in the body

39
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:41,280
closing the eyes and then feeling whatever Vitality or

40
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:48,000
energy there is in the body even if you're mostly tired and

41
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,500
exhausted where in the body is there some

42
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,520
aliveness some vitality

43
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:10,860
and letting him taking a few long slow breaths expanding the body and expanding

44
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,780
into that place of Vitality

45
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,020
almost as if you can expand it

46
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:34,080
taking a few long deep breaths and relaxing

47
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:38,060
settling into the body

48
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:56,580
letting the breathing return to normal and the more held or tense the body is

49
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:02,660
the more difficult it is for the awareness to flow like water

50
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,360
the more things are kind of frozen frozen water

51
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:16,639
so as you exhale relax the muscles of your face

52
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,020
it might be helpful to drop your mouth open slightly

53
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:30,080
and then float it back together

54
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:45,360
on the exhale relaxing the shoulders softening

55
00:06:53,520 --> 00:07:00,539
almost as if something is melting in the shoulders and flowing down below into the chest

56
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:03,860
down the arms

57
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,539
and relaxing softening the belly

58
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:36,560
a global softening of the body in the exhale

59
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:58,220
and for two or three breaths on the exhale relaxing the thinking mind

60
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,940
softening in the mind

61
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,900
quieting the thinking mind a bit

62
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,060
and then having your awareness

63
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:44,520
settle into the body breathing settle into how the body experiences

64
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,000
breathing

65
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:12,240
and the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out maybe can be seen as the undulations of

66
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:20,640
the waves on the ocean maybe a gentle rising of the wave

67
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,760
rising up on a wave and down the other side

68
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:36,080
awareness floating riding the undulations

69
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:49,279
where there's a kind of Vitality in being aware

70
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,040
if we're offer

71
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:02,220
a little effort or see awareness as being something we

72
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:08,760
gently do we do it and there's a vitality and

73
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,620
aliveness and being aware

74
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:35,660
where awareness is maybe like water flowing over through with your breathing

75
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:59,160
and if your mental vitality goes anywhere else into your thoughts

76
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:07,019
your reactions notice that the flow of awareness has

77
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:13,500
stopped or hindered

78
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,459
diminished

79
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:26,420
begin again with the flow of awareness flowing through or around

80
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,980
offering no resistance to anything

81
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,779
finding the path released a wrist resistance

82
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:41,300
around and through and under

83
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,120
back to the breathing

84
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:38,059
keep flowing with your awareness gentle calmly

85
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:48,919
let's being aware be an activity a gentle doing that flows along

86
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:55,700
so your mind does not get caught up in other doings

87
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:18,799
notice when awareness stops or is lost

88
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:26,480
and find a way to flow around your thoughts preoccupations

89
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:34,080
keep it flowing even if it has to continuously flow

90
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:40,200
around something it touches it

91
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:48,200
feels it knows it then flows on and on

92
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:37,158
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

93
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:47,100
the path of Harmony for love

94
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:52,200
is to flow where there's receptivity

95
00:27:52,380 --> 00:28:01,500
to flow where there's openings to flow around and over

96
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:06,679
but never to assert never to push

97
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:15,659
path of kindness or friendliness is soft like water

98
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:22,159
but always there available flowing

99
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:31,399
ready to flow into where there's it's welcomed

100
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:37,759
and when it's not it just flows around

101
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,980
never disappointed him

102
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:56,360
a kindness that needs nothing in return like water that just flows

103
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:03,659
and may it be that our care our kindness or love for the

104
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:10,320
world flows through US freely and openly

105
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,320
generously

106
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:22,580
because it nourishes us it's healthy for us it is us

107
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:30,559
and may it be that our good will are well wishing

108
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:36,559
flows in the path of least resistance

109
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,480
to touch all people with our care our kindness our

110
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:50,640
friendliness May the world know that we care

111
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:56,360
that we wish that all beings be happy

112
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,720
that all beings be safe

113
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,658
that all beings be peaceful

114
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:13,820
that all beings be free

115
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:25,220
and may our good will support that in happening

116
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:37,589
[Music]

117
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:06,240
so today I'll continue this theme about what is the Dharma

118
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:14,100
Dharma is a powerful word in Buddhism and it has many meanings

119
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:19,140
but when I study these teachings of the Buddha

120
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:24,779
I see that one of the primary ways in which is used as a

121
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:30,720
reference what it refers to uh not maybe what it means literally but

122
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:37,260
what it refers to is action things or something dynamic

123
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:43,799
it doesn't refer to things that are static especially when the word Dharma is used in the plural

124
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:50,340
and the singular sometimes it means teaching and uh the Buddha's teachings for

125
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:57,380
example but in the plural when it's first a Dharma it's often refers to action

126
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:04,380
something that's active and dynamic and um and this goes along with what I

127
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:12,440
taught yesterday that one of the meanings of Dharma or what it refers to is the relatedness of all things

128
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:18,840
that things exist in relationship to other things they come about in relationship to other things

129
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:24,539
and this relatedness has to is only related because there's a dynamic

130
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:30,860
relationship between them there are some ways in which the functioning of one thing

131
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:36,899
impacts and affects the other thing that goes on and so things that live in relationship

132
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:44,340
to each other because they're Dynamic they're more activities than they are things

133
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:51,120
there's more verbs than there are nouns in how Buddhism kind of focuses focuses

134
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:56,760
on the Dharma and so one of the clear places that I'm

135
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:04,200
inspired to see this is the Buddha near the end of his life talked about

136
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:12,480
uh I gave the instructions to um um take the Dharma as your Refuge

137
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,640
as your only Refuge as your Island as your support does your Refuge

138
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:23,820
and then he went on to say take yourself as your Refuge as your only Refuge

139
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:29,039
and saying the same thing to saying these right next to each other one after the

140
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:34,980
other take the Dharma of The Refuge and take yourself as a refuge Refuge uh kind

141
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:40,019
of implies a kind of a a equivalence between those they're kind of like

142
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:46,980
referring to the same thing seemingly especially when he says and no other Refuge well then it only works if the two are

143
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:53,460
the same Dharma and yourself and how could that be well then he goes on to say

144
00:33:53,460 --> 00:34:00,480
um and how do we do this by practicing the four foundations of mindfulness by practicing mindfulness of

145
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,940
the body mindfulness of feelings mindfulness of Mind States mindfulness of

146
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:11,820
of the dharmas here the fourth Foundation of mindfulness

147
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:17,580
and this fourth Foundation of mindfulness is referred to as dharmas that's referring all to things which are

148
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:26,040
Dynamic that are active many of them are mental actions mental activities we're doing the hindrances for example

149
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:33,960
and uh and those are all actions of the Mind activities of the Mind the seven factors

150
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:41,099
of Awakening things like mindfulness and investigation of dharmas uh

151
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:47,179
effort and joy and Tranquility concentration Equanimity these are all

152
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:55,740
functionings of the mind so they're not dynamic and generally when dharmas refers to

153
00:34:55,740 --> 00:35:01,440
activity It generally refers to healthy good activities Good Conduct whether

154
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:08,580
it's things we actually do conduct that we engage in or whether it's the activities of the mind that we wouldn't

155
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:15,119
necessarily call them actions if actions are limited to a person who does something but there's the functionings

156
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:21,960
of the Mind and um and so when uh there's an

157
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:28,800
emphasis on all things are changing in constant impermanent

158
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:34,619
um you see that yes of course that's what we're pointing to when we're pointing to the in constancy of things

159
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:39,660
not that they necessarily come to an end which certainly part of it but that as

160
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:46,920
they are they're Dynamic peering and disappearing kind of like waves that come and go and come and go there's

161
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:54,599
these activities that are not fixed and not static we're not stuck

162
00:35:54,599 --> 00:36:00,380
and so this idea that dharmas in the teachings of the Buddha

163
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:07,380
repeatedly refers to something which is dynamic and active and and an activity

164
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:13,140
is actually kind of the good news of Buddhism because it means that when

165
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:18,619
nothing is Frozen in place it's kind of like there's no Hardware

166
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:25,440
operating here it's all software and we can change the software

167
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:35,280
conditions can change the choices we make can change and and so because it's all you know in

168
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:41,880
relatedness all the actions we do relate to each other certain kinds of activities

169
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:48,480
that are unwholesome unhealthy they the way that they relate to what follows is

170
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,640
unhealthy greed and hatred has a negative impact

171
00:36:53,640 --> 00:37:00,000
generosity and love has a very different impact uh mindfulness is an activity of the

172
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,940
mind even though it might feel sometimes just being aware is like mostly and not a doing

173
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:14,520
and it feels so like so restful not to do just to be aware is if we're resting in Awareness even so awareness is a

174
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:19,560
firing of certain nerves in the brain it is a certain activity that's going on

175
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:26,820
um but it's not something that the self feels like it's doing and it's such a relief to feel like

176
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:33,300
something's beautiful thing is flowing but that we're not we're not the one who's doing it

177
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:39,000
so the um uh so we're so but when we do

178
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:45,599
mindfulness what we're doing is bringing in conditions that allows things to settle bringing in

179
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:52,460
the conditions allow us to see clearly what's happening uh bringing in conditions that allows us

180
00:37:52,460 --> 00:38:00,980
differentiate between the different kind of mental activities that are going on so that we do the ones that are

181
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:06,000
healthiest for us the ones that are the right effort that's from teachings from

182
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,260
last week another place we see this Buddha emphasizing this idea of

183
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:17,820
Dharma being activities is in this teachings of seven factors of

184
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:24,839
Awakening there's a teaching called there's what the second one is usually called an English investigation

185
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:35,160
but the the ancient word has the word dhamma Dharma in it and it's um vichaya

186
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:43,680
means to distinguish or differentiate it's the differentiation of dhammas

187
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:50,099
when the Buddha explains what it's differentiating its uh mental activities the seven

188
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:55,740
factors of Awakening again the Eightfold Path the four noble truths the the five

189
00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:01,680
faculties the four right efforts that the mind has ability to distinguish

190
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:06,780
between what is healthy and not healthy as activities of the Mind

191
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:13,859
as what's wholesome and not wholesome and this is the ability to see

192
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:21,359
clearly in the mind the activities of the Mind what's happening in the mind is part of the gift of being very

193
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:28,680
settled and present and quiet almost like we're not doing anything and then we start seeing much more clearly what's

194
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:34,320
happening there the activities Oh my mind's going down the lot the going down

195
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:39,660
that old well-dug Canal of wanting of

196
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:46,020
Desiring and I've seen that that doesn't take me in a good direction I don't have to do that anymore

197
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:53,099
I could take the Vitality of my mental energy of awareness and let let it flow

198
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:59,880
someplace else recognize what's happening and not get caught in it I could focus on something else instead

199
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:04,920
I can focus on contentment that feels healthy when I do contentment

200
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,960
then I settle more so there's this gentle kind of action

201
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:15,180
that goes on in this practice which you know I referred back to last

202
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:24,440
week right effort right effort is an action and we're learning how to act how to do

203
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:30,300
so it borders on or or some people would see it as almost like a not doing

204
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:36,599
it's so peaceful it's so relaxed it's so flowing maybe it's like flowing water we don't

205
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:42,240
see that's flowing because it's so clear there is an activity

206
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:48,599
that onward leading flow to what's Awakening through this practice

207
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:54,180
so the Dharma meaning activity dynamism

208
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:59,339
action um it means engaging

209
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:07,320
and so this is a also kind of a paradigm shift for some people just like focusing on relatedness is a

210
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:12,780
paradigm shift as opposed to post focusing on me and you focusing on the relationships

211
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:18,000
so the same way rather than focusing on nouns when things are fixed this is how

212
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:25,079
it is I'll always be this way uh it'll always be this way the situation will always be this way

213
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:32,700
um is to uh start being attuned to where the activity is where the flow

214
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:39,060
is where the dynamism is where that change and is happening it's always

215
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:44,099
happening anyway and so to be attuned to that to Surf

216
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:51,540
with it to flow in it to participate in it and if we're flowing in a river

217
00:41:51,540 --> 00:42:00,980
and the current is taking us against uh dangerous Rapids then we learn how to

218
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:07,500
swim over to the other side of the river where the water is peaceful flowing peacefully

219
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:12,960
we learn the terrain we learn the route we learn how to use the flow of change

220
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:18,119
but it's always changing so what I'd suggest that you do today is

221
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:23,940
if you're interested in an assignment is to um

222
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:31,020
to become a little bit more or quite a bit if you can aware of how you

223
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:36,540
freeze how you stop in the river of change River of Time how

224
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:42,960
you get preoccupied by Things Are fixated flowing doesn't mean you had to just can

225
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:49,320
don't have to focus on certain things but then we we focus on them with the

226
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:56,700
flow with the Mind itself shifting and changing and flowing the mind doesn't freeze the mind doesn't get caught but

227
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:03,240
is involved in a flowing Gentle Way where we are like unsweet we're like

228
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:09,480
clouds and water the Japanese word that flows with with the flow of Life the

229
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:16,319
flow of time that flows with uh the movements and activities of the

230
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:23,220
Mind choosing what's heavenly so the dhamma the Dharma

231
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:29,400
a very important if it's not the literal meaning it's often what's being pointed

232
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:36,960
to it's pointing to action to activity to dynamism and and that's where it's in

233
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:43,920
dynamism and activity in action that the Dharma is found more than

234
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:50,339
um assuming that it's only in Stillness only in peace or quiet or some thick

235
00:43:50,339 --> 00:43:56,720
State nothing fixed always changing always flowing

236
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:02,359
so I hope you can see the difference between

237
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:10,200
being stopped stuck and gentle flowing along without all

238
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:18,740
things even if you're sitting quietly still in meditation and your body's not moving everything is still flowing

239
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:26,900
so thank you very much and we'll continue this tomorrow
