00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:07,839
my greetings my warmest greetings to all of you and here from redwood city

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:13,440
in california at the inside meditation center

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:21,920
and um the topic for most much of this week is

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:28,240
the uh important insight one of the probably the most

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,360
important insight for people doing vipassana practice and

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,079
for what we see in the teachings of the buddha is the insight into the inconstancy of

7
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:47,840
experience and in constancy means that the moment-to-moment experience that we have

8
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,920
there's a lot of arising and passing appearing and disappearing of our

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,920
experience that is hidden from us if we

10
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,119
dwell in the ideas of what is happening

11
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:13,119
ideas have a constancy to them in our imagination we have an image perhaps of something and and the image

12
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:18,640
is not really current with how things are changing always

13
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:27,200
and uh and this in constancy is a repetition of uh just new things appearing they disappear

14
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:34,720
or they get replaced they're superseded by other things that arise and so for this meditation today i would

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,000
like to emphasize the appearing of experience the arising

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,720
of phenomena that we are aware of we perceive and

17
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:53,840
many things appear in awareness without any choice in our part or wish on our

18
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,439
part they just appear if there's a building in the environment where you're

19
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:05,520
a sound in the environment where you're at chances are some of those sounds are

20
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,560
creaking of a building or traffic outside is not something you willed or planned

21
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,239
on having or but it just arises it appears in awareness and then there's a recognition

22
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:22,319
there's a sound and it happens on your cheek and it wasn't

23
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:29,920
there before and now it's appeared and it was not planned it was not engineered

24
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:37,680
it just appeared no choice or no choice on your part and but it's

25
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:45,280
there it is and the initial appearance of many of these things is effortless in that it's effortless on

26
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:52,640
our part we don't have to make any effort to make it appear and so as we sit and meditate there are

27
00:02:52,640 --> 00:03:00,480
many things that will just appear in awareness and to settle back and just watch

28
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,800
and observe the appearance of things don't have to worry about how long it

29
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,920
stays and you don't have to worry about seeing it's passing away

30
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:18,400
but in the course of the meditation many of the things that appear will in fact disappear

31
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:27,120
they'll be there for a while and and then they will pass away there may be some things that dir endure

32
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,200
don't worry about that and um but for this meditation we'll stay with

33
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,319
the breathing it's the kind of that's the the beat or the the base that we kind of

34
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:45,120
keep staying at um being with the breathing in breathing out but as we do that in the

35
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,720
breathing itself we can be aware of just new sensations arise

36
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:58,480
um or maybe not new it might be similar to what's happened at the last in-breath or last out breath but still we can

37
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,480
we're there to not do not necessarily experience new things arising just that things arise

38
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:11,040
arise arise arise things appear without and there can be a cascade or a

39
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,600
rapid sequence of many little sensations that arise on the in-breath than the out-breath but that he has to rest and stay with

40
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,639
the breathing stay close and intimate to the breathing but then as you do so

41
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,000
gently in the peripheral attention as things arise a sound a sensation

42
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,320
your body a thought see it as something that's arising

43
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:42,560
if your thinking is incessant then notice how the the pixels of thinking

44
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,919
appear in the the structure of your thinking the thoughts that

45
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:53,360
if you think in words different words appear and disappear if you think more in

46
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,960
images different images images changes and new things appear just be sensitive

47
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:05,360
much as you can to appearing appearing and you might even gently use the label

48
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,440
appearing appearing as just a reminder stay here

49
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:19,039
don't strain don't be actively looking so much as settling back and allowing

50
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:25,360
like you're giving space for things to appear sensations experiences to show

51
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,440
themselves so taking a meditation posture

52
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:39,840
and gently closing your eyes and sitting here just right away

53
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:48,080
what appears what shows up

54
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,639
what sensations what feelings what emotions what even

55
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,880
thoughts that didn't exist before or didn't weren't happening just before

56
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,560
but then appear

57
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,560
the sound of my voice appears

58
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:26,160
and if you drop into your body what appears what sensations feelings

59
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,520
and say are there that you weren't aware of

60
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,840
before

61
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:46,720
and if as you feel your body you feel the body's wish to relax

62
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:53,759
maybe the shoulders the arms the belly the face give into that pull of

63
00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:03,840
relaxation allow it to happen

64
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:17,840
and as you do there may be new sensations arise

65
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:44,080
and if what arises as you're sitting here is unpleasant

66
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,680
maybe don't worry about it even if it's if it stays for a while

67
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,800
don't worry about it this is a meditation about being open

68
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,840
to the next thing that arises

69
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,440
the next thing that arises

70
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:12,080
and if it's a presence what arises

71
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:27,360
don't hang on to it because you want to be available for the next arising

72
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:35,440
if you find yourself straining or trying too hard to just be with the arising of phenomena

73
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,640
then relax and center yourself from the breathing again

74
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:50,080
simple breathing in and breathing out and then at some point gently

75
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,800
not trying too hard begin noticing again

76
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:05,760
the arising of experience and it might be mostly in the breathing

77
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:14,720
or in the body around the breathing or anywhere where arising new things

78
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:22,240
come into awareness and just know it's very simply know it

79
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,720
as an arising and appearing

80
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:37,839
without any other need to label it or understand it

81
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,959
just knowing it as something that's

82
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,839
arising

83
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:06,160
and knowing that it is good to be aware of

84
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:13,120
the appearing of experience in awareness

85
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,839
as it moves through as it appears and comes

86
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:37,120
in this small little sliver of time that we call the present

87
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:43,279
moment noticing what appears

88
00:10:44,959 --> 00:11:01,839
and how it appears changes

89
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:06,639
in the way that awareness operates it tends to move around

90
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:13,519
now aware of this now that sometimes following the train of thought

91
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:20,839
or feelings or so part of things that arise in

92
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:26,639
awareness arise because our awareness has shifted

93
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,759
were shifts

94
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,240
even when something is relatively constant

95
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,040
in the subtle details of awareness

96
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,839
or attention goes somewhere else and then it might return

97
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:05,839
and it's a new er and what was before arises again in awareness

98
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:15,200
to be aware of change in the arising of phenomena of experience

99
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:24,159
as if your mind your awareness is wide and receptive and open

100
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,559
receiving whatever arises

101
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:45,840
like the surface of the lake receives the raindrops

102
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:50,400
or receiving the arising of sensations in your body

103
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,840
like the bubbles that appear in sparkling water

104
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,159
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

105
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:19,200
that new experiences new things arise all the time for us not so hard to

106
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:25,440
understand a new new person appears or calls or

107
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,278
emails the email arises

108
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:39,600
maybe we'd eaten and we're satiated and full and then at some point hunger arises

109
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:49,840
again we rest well rested and then sleepiness arises again

110
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:58,240
but to see phenomena first and foremost has something that's

111
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:04,240
a risen to be right there in the present moment see oh it just appeared

112
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:16,320
there it is and to do so in a receptive way open way

113
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,880
to receive it in a liberated way

114
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:30,240
not entangled or caught in it but with an attitude that you could

115
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:37,279
bow to it whatever arises you bow

116
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:45,840
yes and so as you go through the day

117
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:53,120
new people will somehow or other come into your awareness maybe you'll see them

118
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,840
maybe they'll talk to you on the phone or send you an email

119
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,159
maybe you can be go through the day ready and open in the present to receive the

120
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:15,120
next arising person in such a way that you could bow to them

121
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:22,159
bow to them as a in a certain reverence or certain

122
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:28,559
deep appreciation of their capacity to have emotions and

123
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:34,240
thoughts and feelings their capacity for

124
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:40,960
goodness they have a heart a sensitive heart as

125
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,679
well as you

126
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:56,159
to give some care and attention to the first appearance of others into

127
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:01,520
your life today and how you are how that's received in

128
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:06,559
your awareness in your heart and your mind

129
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:13,679
perhaps before the reactions and usual thoughts and

130
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:21,440
ideas and entanglements as if you could bow to everyone who

131
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:29,120
appears and the bowing expresses a wish

132
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,559
may you be happy

133
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,799
may you be safe

134
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:45,200
may you be peaceful

135
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:51,840
and may you be free

136
00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:00,000
and then my receptive awareness of you

137
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:10,000
always ready to have those wishes may it be that i contribute to it being

138
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:18,559
so may i live this day

139
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:24,880
aware of the people who come into my awareness

140
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:35,519
living for their welfare and happiness and freedom may all beings everywhere

141
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:47,840
be happy may all beings everywhere be free

142
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:04,080
so you
