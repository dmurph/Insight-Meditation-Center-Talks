1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:08,320
so warm greetings and welcome to our adventure with

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:16,560
breathing for today and um it's kind of a lifetime adventure to

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,320
practice meditation and life attuned to breathing in touch with your breathing

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,680
and aware of how your breathing is going in any given time

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,840
and it's awareness of breathing helps us to avoid

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:41,760
spending unnecessary energy in as we go through our life

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:50,079
especially the unnecessary energy of tension or anxiety or or

8
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:59,280
ambition over efforting many of the ways that we because we could become stressful has to

9
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:06,159
do with an over exertion of energy in the muscles that they're tight too much and also in

10
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,280
the mind and so that's gets all that gets

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,640
translated into the breathing the breathing gets shallow gets tight it moves up into the chest

12
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,400
rather than being deeper abdominal breathing behold our breathing and so being

13
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,840
attuned to the breathing and breathing in a easy relaxed way

14
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,880
is a way to um

15
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:39,520
to not over effort in our lives so

16
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,240
to assume a meditation posture

17
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,680
and to close your eyes

18
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:59,680
and to feel the weight of your body against the surface

19
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,798
that's keeping you from falling to the center of the earth

20
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,760
your chair your cushion the floor your bed whatever it might be and feel

21
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,959
the contact of your body against this surface

22
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,959
and maybe rock side to side sway forward and back

23
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,319
or in some way kind of and then settle in

24
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,360
wiggle in a little bit to really settle into that spot where

25
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,800
there's a surface holding you

26
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:55,040
and then take a few moments to feel the edges of your body

27
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,920
your skin both where your skin touches your clothes

28
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,239
where the skin touches

29
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:15,200
your cushion chair and also wherever the tingling and vibration the warmth and

30
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,360
the coolness sensations on the skin become apparent

31
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:28,720
as you're sitting here kind of a global wide

32
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:36,239
awareness of sensations along yours all over your body on your skin

33
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,480
maybe it's a flowing sensation a tingling a vibration

34
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:56,799
maybe there's some sensations that fleet in and out of awareness

35
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,560
spark in and out awareness as your attention roams around

36
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,000
and then notice where the contact of your skin may be against

37
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
your clothes or if you're lying down against the surface

38
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:26,720
you're lying down and on no to feel we're breathing has an impact

39
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,120
we're breathing in the inhale the expansion of the chest or the belly

40
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:40,320
lifting of the shoulders causes more contact

41
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,280
with your clothes or some surface

42
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:57,840
and you can feel the sensations of movement of contact

43
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:07,280
feeling the rhythm of sensations of the contact of the body breathing

44
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,720
moving as you breathe against your clothes or your

45
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,759
back of your chair

46
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:24,960
maybe even there's this very subtle movement a sensation of pressure way down to

47
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,240
the cushion you're sitting on

48
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,840
sensations in the front rib cage the back ribcage

49
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,080
the sides of the ribcage

50
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:53,840
maybe even the belly

51
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,800
and then bring your attention inside of your body maybe not far from

52
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,319
the skin bring your attention a little bit inward

53
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,400
to where you usually experience your

54
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,840
breathing

55
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:49,840
feeling the movement of sensation the changing sensations with the inhale and exhale

56
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,840
and as you exhale

57
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:17,840
relax deeper into your body soften the shoulders

58
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,280
as you exhale let this the belly become

59
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,840
softer

60
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:46,319
as you relax the holding in the body the tension you're relaxing or the extra energy

61
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,120
you're expending

62
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,000
softening relaxing in the face and there's less energy going into

63
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,120
holding the muscles

64
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:15,038
relaxing the shoulders and the arms unless energy is expended

65
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,080
and paradoxically with less energy expended in tension

66
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:41,839
more there can be a feeling of vitality or maybe even flowing energy

67
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:56,160
the same thing is true in the mind the thinking mind if there's any tension

68
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:04,160
or pressure agitation there maybe as you exhale you can relax

69
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,839
let go

70
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,680
expend less energy conscious energy

71
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:23,040
in mental activity

72
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:31,360
it turns out the mind works much better more creatively wiser

73
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:51,839
when less anxious or tense energy everything goes into it

74
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:01,040
and then settling in to the body

75
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,839
breathing

76
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,880
and here too the art of meditation

77
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:20,480
is to stay committed with breathing without a lot of extra

78
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,079
energy without any strain

79
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:35,920
and for some people it can be helpful the notion of being receptive

80
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:47,839
to the inhale

81
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:01,839
and to allow the exhale

82
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,440
maybe relaxing a teeny bit at the end of the exhale

83
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,320
to have a little pause micropause

84
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:25,279
so that is more sensitive to receiving the beginning of the inhale

85
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:31,680
how the inhalations were trounced how the inhale

86
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:43,839
how the inhale arises on its own

87
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,440
receptive to the inhales allowing the exhale

88
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,680
as maybe you would floating

89
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,160
on the sea gently

90
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:30,959
being lifted and gently lowered by the small waves coming and going

91
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,959
allowing yourself to be held

92
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,959
by the buoyant water

93
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:53,839
allowing yourself to float on the inhales and exhales

94
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,959
some effort is needed to be receptive and allowing

95
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:11,040
while at the same time letting go and

96
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,560
allowing the breathing

97
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,839
to come to awareness

98
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:02,079
letting go of your interest in thinking

99
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:12,560
and letting your interest be

100
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:20,560
in floating on the gentle waves of inhales and exhale

101
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:27,839
like you're floating on your back on a wide peaceful sea

102
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:41,839
gently being lifted and lowered by the peaceful waves

103
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,680
relaxing the tension associated with thinking

104
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,839
the pressure the contraction

105
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,079
allowing the thinking to become quieter

106
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:51,839
so you can trust staying with the breathing more fully

107
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:08,320
and if you can imagine yourself floating on the your back on a peaceful sea

108
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:15,600
imagine that as you're looking up into the sky and a few clouds are drifting by in the

109
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:23,440
blue sky that way stay connected

110
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:31,520
stay floating on your breathing but notice whatever thinking

111
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:42,720
is happening like thinking your clouds drifting by

112
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:52,400
not to be involved with the thinking but to have a kind of a view from a

113
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,840
distance

114
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,120
where there's very little energy

115
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:16,880
it used to be thinking letting go of the extra energy to think

116
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:25,840
to be involved to be engaged in thought relax the energy of thinking

117
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:31,840
the efforting of thinking and while you stay with the inhales and

118
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:39,840
exhales without a lot of effort

119
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,840
be aware of the thoughts that flow

120
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,840
through

121
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:30,480
and notice that as you're thinking do you think more in words

122
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,840
or more in images

123
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:49,840
or is it kind of equally both

124
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:10,000
and then in recognizing whether it's more words more images or equal

125
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,320
both is it easier for you to notice

126
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,520
your involvement with thinking the energy expended to think

127
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:31,200
the tension involved in thinking

128
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,480
and if so as you exhale

129
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,919
can you relax and quiet that energy that effort

130
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,480
and as you do so

131
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:59,840
settle more into your breathing

132
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,880
our bodies and our minds

133
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:43,840
operate more harmoniously

134
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,080
when we stop using unnecessary energy

135
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,840
effort

136
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,760
the very

137
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:13,440
effort to try hard at something unnecessary

138
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,760
it's counterproductive it interferes with the natural wisdom

139
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:26,640
the natural sensitivity and the natural harmony

140
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:38,080
that's available when we don't apply unnecessary energy

141
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:46,400
before we learn to not do so it's useful just to recognize

142
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:52,799
when there is unnecessary energy in the form of tension in the body

143
00:26:52,799 --> 00:27:07,840
and the mind in the thinking

144
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,679
and then as we come to the end of the

145
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:22,720
sitting perhaps you can intuit or feel

146
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:31,840
oh without without tension

147
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:38,000
without this extra energy of tension and pushing and trying

148
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:45,840
there's more room in us for happiness

149
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:54,080
for well-being or there's more room for us for love for

150
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,840
good will compassion

151
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:13,440
and to end this sitting being open to the joys and sufferings of this

152
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:21,520
world and to be open to it without resistance

153
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,840
to breathe with it

154
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,799
to be willing to be a companion

155
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:42,240
to the world's joys and the joy the world's sufferings

156
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:50,000
to breathe with the world and in doing so

157
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:58,880
before needing to do anything more complicated perhaps you can be your kindness

158
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,158
spreads out from you to the world

159
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:14,240
a simple kindness which wishes well for others

160
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:23,840
wishes the best for them may all beings be happy

161
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:31,278
may all beings be safe

162
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,840
may all beings

163
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:46,320
be peaceful may all beings

164
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,840
be free

165
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,840
you
