1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,040
great wonderful

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,040
so

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,000
like to take a moment just to mention um for those of you who maybe weren't here

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,320
yesterday the theme of this week is practicing with the five elements

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,480
and um how the practice with the five elements relates to insight the

6
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:43,440
experience direct experience of insight and this is intended to tie in to gil

7
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:50,000
fronstall's ongoing series on insight so if you didn't get a chance to listen

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
to yesterday's talk it does offer a lot more background and orientation you're

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,719
welcome to do that if you wish and um meanwhile to take a moment if you

10
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,560
were um tuned in and practicing yesterday to consider for yourself or if

11
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:15,600
it feels right to share now or later how um practicing with the elements

12
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:23,960
especially the earth element may have appeared for you in your practice

13
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,119
and consider any key takeaways

14
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,840
from this series so far

15
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,909
[Music]

16
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:11,360
feeling of groundedness so with that we'll start

17
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,440
and i'll read and consider any other responses later with that we'll start

18
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:25,040
with the meditation this morning so um

19
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,480
adjusting this earthly body maybe rocking back and forth on your sit

20
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:38,120
spot or adjusting how you are on your cushion or chair or mat

21
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:48,080
taking a couple of longer slower embodied breaths

22
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,080
perhaps

23
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:02,920
allowing a slight smile on your lips or relaxation in your face

24
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:18,599
and allowing the outreath to settle settle the attention inward and downward

25
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:34,159
and when you're ready if you haven't already allowing the eyes

26
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,400
to close

27
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,440
allowing the breathing to be natural

28
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,760
and noticing the quality

29
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,720
of sensation on your skin

30
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,840
there's no dryness or moisture

31
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,200
sensed by the skin perhaps

32
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,939
[Music]

33
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,919
you notice qualities

34
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:44,639
of moisture or dryness in the breath as air becomes breath

35
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,520
perhaps in your nostrils throat

36
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:59,600
just noticing allowing the in and out breath

37
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:05,440
to be however they are today but attuning

38
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:13,840
to any wave like motion of inb breath and out breath

39
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,400
perhaps a wave like motion of the abdomen

40
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,440
moving up and down

41
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,600
movement of the diaphragm chest belly

42
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,520
allowing the whole body to be present

43
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,280
with awareness at the forefront

44
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:15,000
into tuning to any sense of motion

45
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:24,280
aliveness in the body

46
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,440
while maintaining primary attention

47
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:42,120
on the wave like motion the flow of breathing okay

48
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,400
allowing the attention to settle

49
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,599
again like sediment through water

50
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:57,720
settling into the moment the flow of the moment

51
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,639
distractions or thinking arise and they will

52
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:23,280
graciously fluidly shifting the attention

53
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,919
back to the moment

54
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:50,200
perhaps noticing moisture or dryness in the mouth the lips

55
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,920
the eyes

56
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,680
feeling into

57
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,600
the pulsating aliveness

58
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:20,279
of this living body the whole body

59
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,600
while being devoted to attending to

60
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,320
the flow of breathing and the flow of the moment

61
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,120
as the attention settles

62
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:06,320
noticing the ripples of sensation

63
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:15,800
no matter how slight any sense of pleasure or energy

64
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,079
flow of energy through the body

65
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:29,560
perhaps at the base of the pelvis or belly

66
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:36,440
or through the torso attuning

67
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,880
to wave like grass

68
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:52,839
allowing it to massage any contentment

69
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,680
ease embodiment

70
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:09,360
through the whole body allowing the mind to float

71
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,920
within the moment

72
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:09,158
as this sit begins to draw to a close

73
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:19,158
the invitation if you haven't already is to open to all of embodied experience

74
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:28,559
the shifting changing scintillating flowing

75
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:34,840
qualities of sensation in this moment

76
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:41,158
allowing everything just to move through

77
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,640
no need to get involved

78
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:50,440
and then as we draw this formal time of meditation to a close

79
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:59,039
attuning to any sense of goodness

80
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:10,679
any settledness fluidity

81
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:15,919
calm or peacefulness any glimmers of goodness

82
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:24,600
from this meditation and savoring them letting them nourish your practice

83
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:37,200
and from there invitation

84
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:45,039
is to let those qualities any benefits here ripple out

85
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:50,519
through your own mind and heart and life

86
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:59,720
to all of the lives you touch and all of the lives they touch

87
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,799
outwards and outwards

88
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:20,159
may all beings be safe happy

89
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:26,080
peaceful and free and may our practice here together be a

90
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:32,000
cause and condition for greater love liberation and peace in

91
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,240
the world

92
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:58,789
[Music]

93
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:08,120
thank you for the sincerity of your practice

94
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:36,159
so welcome dear sana and while um

95
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:41,200
i'm taking a moment to sip tea before the dharmat i would just like to make a

96
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,480
short announcement and that is that if you enjoy um sitting

97
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:52,880
with me and with my dear colleague kim allen both of us imc teachers we're

98
00:29:52,880 --> 00:30:00,399
actually co-eing a retreat um through my home sa my other home sa the one that i

99
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:07,360
lead insight santa cruz and um it's in the gorgeous redwoods in benlmond

100
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:13,360
california down here outside of santa cruz and it has a much smaller lottery

101
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:21,120
than a typical inc retreat so i'm going to drop the link in the chat for those of you who might be interested in in

102
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:27,000
signing up in just a moment

103
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,520
and um

104
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:08,000
the topic for today is a continuation of um

105
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,320
the series this week on insight and five elements practice

106
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:20,000
and there are different levels of five elements practice but to say

107
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:27,039
that um all of this is in context of the insight unfolding that gil is teaching

108
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:32,640
over these weeks and that um

109
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:40,000
they can be taken literally or as like material stuff and i spoke to that a

110
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,640
little bit yesterday okay it's a bronze age framing but we can kind of open our minds to all contemporary

111
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:55,919
elements in the periodic table if we wish um they also can be the qualities of

112
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:01,279
experience direct experience in the moment so today i was talking about

113
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:07,279
moisture during the meditation for example or flow so we can attune to those embodied

114
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:13,760
experiences that is a practice kind of direct practice and then there's

115
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:19,440
the level of inspiration or analogy simile and for example at the end of the

116
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:26,799
dharmat yesterday i mentioned that a later buddhist tradition the tibetan tradition had taken the buddha's simile

117
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:34,559
that the mind could be like the ground for the seeds of cultivation of our life force of good or ill and the

118
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:42,559
tibetan tradition sort of unpacked that and likened the mind to the earth element so it's not a literal

119
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:48,640
um kind of assertion but more it's in all of this

120
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:56,640
is intended to inspire so um today in the following days i will be

121
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:04,960
um addressing both the contemplation piece of this contemplating how this kind of way of

122
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:10,640
interpreting or understanding experience might support insight

123
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,840
as well as a direct experience of the elements in our practice and finally how

124
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:21,480
they might inspire us towards insight

125
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:28,480
um the five elements is one of many practices in this case it fits into the

126
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:35,039
body part of the four foundations of mindfulness which is in of itself a skillful

127
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:42,720
framework and then within that there's a number of skillful means mindfulness and breathing being the most common

128
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:51,679
that um can help to support insights into ana and constancy anata not self

129
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:58,640
and others so in terms of

130
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:07,200
insight through the five elements one key modality is contemplating them

131
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:13,599
internally and externally and this is easy to do with water for

132
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,720
example when sipping tea

133
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:25,118
when does tea become body

134
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:31,839
so let's start with internal and external contemplation with a quote from mainstream science

135
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:37,599
and i was looking around to sort of fact check some of this talk yesterday and

136
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:44,720
ran across a wonderful series of um posts on a substack

137
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:52,320
that um quoted and referenced scientists as long ago as the 19 early 1930s

138
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:58,000
and one of them basically named that in mainstream science even

139
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:05,040
back then as today and i'm quoting it is a common belief that blood is modified

140
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,800
seawater and the tlddr on this the too long

141
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:17,200
didn't read is that concentrations of sodium and potassium in our blood plasma

142
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:24,880
are remarkably similar to seawater and this is true of many animals including

143
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:31,359
humans who from an evolutionary perspective emerged from the ocean and

144
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:39,680
in a sense we still carry that salinity within in a sense our blood streams

145
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:48,320
are ambulatory oceans that call to the ocean that we feel and

146
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:54,960
at the seaside that soothing quality there's something about that that can

147
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:02,000
evoke a sense of this internal flow this internal wavelike

148
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:11,320
sensation our bodies are over half water some people's bodies are over 3/4 water

149
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:18,079
so that's kind of a bigger picture of this internal external

150
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:24,320
contemplation so on the practical level in the

151
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:32,880
commentaries within the body traditionally the water element is represented by blood sweat and tears

152
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:39,920
also by urine salivos and ovial fluid etc my um dear colleague and friend bob

153
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:45,200
stall every year does a meditation on what's called the 32 parts of the body

154
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:53,440
which unpack the ancient understanding of this and the way that these organs

155
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,440
um connect with the other elements

156
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:05,520
so that's the tradition and then in terms of felt experience

157
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:11,040
it we of course can attune to the qualities associated with the water

158
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:20,400
element flowing melting dampening wetness or conversely

159
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:27,119
freeze or fixity coagulation dryness is

160
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:34,640
noticing the experience of the body in the moment noticing that flow

161
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,839
can be a direct experience of inconstancy wherever

162
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:47,040
the experience of your body is in this a direct experience of that river of

163
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:52,040
change river of nature

164
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:59,920
so i'll name that the commentaries also say that it's impossible to directly

165
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:05,760
experience moisture that it's a quote unquote mental capacity to imagine it

166
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:12,000
and i'll just name that is not my experience water feels wet

167
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:19,520
so you can play with that and just check out it's a useful um exercise to do to

168
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:26,720
notice how much of what we feel like our direct sensory experience is actually

169
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:31,839
concept versus sensation

170
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:37,720
recognition versus sensation

171
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:48,480
also from the ancient commentaries water's function manifests as cohesion

172
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:54,440
expansion and holding together

173
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:02,160
so cohesion consider the differences between dust

174
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:07,280
and soil water is key

175
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:13,520
the association of water in the ancient teachings with social cohesion is also

176
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:19,760
strong so strong that when meta loving kindness is described in those same

177
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:26,720
commentaries as a social relational force of cohesion

178
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:35,520
it is described in kind of poetic terms of making moist or adding wetness

179
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:41,680
samati is described the same way as wet can imagine in ancient india much of

180
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:48,119
which is quite hot wetness was prized

181
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:54,800
there's also on a more inspirational level

182
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:02,560
considering the way that the that water and the water element links us to all other life

183
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:09,280
not just all other life now but all other life in the evolution of this

184
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:15,880
planet this is from scientist michael mcclennon

185
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:21,280
he writes "there's about the same amount of water on earth now as there was in

186
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:27,680
the mesazoic period all water that is breathed drunk and

187
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:34,320
urinated by living things remains as part of the planet's total water content

188
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:40,000
also included i might add is water absorbed by the skies which are now

189
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,520
thirstier more absorptive because of climate catastrophe climate

190
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:50,720
change in other words

191
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:58,079
the general point is that we the water we experience today in our bodies rivers

192
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:05,599
oceans skies aquifers embedded in life and oceans and trees

193
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:12,960
is almost exactly the same water element that's been here since the inception of

194
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:20,720
this planet vast inner penetrating cycle of change

195
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:27,119
sometimes meteors come in and bring water or ions and and individual water

196
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:34,400
hydrogen elements get sort of escape the atmosphere into space but overall the

197
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:42,079
vast majority is the same it's not personal it's not self

198
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:47,599
we borrow water for a while carry it around in our ambulatory oceans and

199
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:53,880
bodies and then it becomes external again

200
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:06,640
to add an ancient mythic scale and this is from the samuta nikaya the

201
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:12,400
connected discourses the buddha mentions that over lifetimes

202
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:18,720
you have cried more tears than there is water in all the oceans

203
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:25,720
i find that to be very poetic whether you believe in rebirth or not

204
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:31,599
on a more contemporary level this is a simile that spontaneously came

205
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:40,480
to me years ago that in a sense we can consider ourselves

206
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:46,800
our identified selves our bodies like clouds the cloud can drift from here to

207
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:54,200
another town or another country it gains and loses its water droplets

208
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:02,640
it changes shape yet remains a cloud all of its parts may change over yet the

209
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:08,560
cloud remains a cloud until

210
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:14,640
conditions change and it returns either to the earth through rain or to the sky

211
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:21,280
through evaporation like that while our mental identity

212
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:27,280
remains in flux we are processes or processes in constant flux

213
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:35,119
until we melt back into the all so as this cloud similly highlights

214
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:40,480
water like i've said many times about awareness is a shape shifter it changes

215
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:46,240
form manifestation dependent on conditions

216
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:53,440
just like we do and eventually when the rain falls that oceanic cycle

217
00:43:53,440 --> 00:44:01,680
continues the buddha advised his son rahula

218
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:08,720
to make his meditation like water if you make your meditation like water

219
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:14,560
agreeable and disagreeable things will not invade the mind and remain and like

220
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:22,079
him we can take water as inspiration fluidity adaptability energetic flow

221
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:25,720
through the body

222
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:35,839
and in fact in the later tibetan tradition that i quoted at the end last yesterday the mind's continuity

223
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:44,160
and adaptability is represented by water the buddha said of the dharma the dharma

224
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:50,880
just as in the ocean there is but one taste the taste of salt so in this

225
00:44:50,880 --> 00:45:01,400
dharma vineia this dharma and discipline there is one taste the taste of freedom

226
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:09,599
water also represents the capacity of the soft fluid and adaptable to

227
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:15,040
radically transform what is hard and rigid

228
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:21,920
consider the grand canyon or mountains eroding into rocks boulders riverstones

229
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,520
and eventually sand in the ocean

230
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:33,200
and with that i'll close with another terry gata

231
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:40,880
inspired poem this from utra life had always been hot sweaty work

232
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:46,400
first i learned to control my hands then my mouth then my mind

233
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:55,200
as things slowed i sank down down to the bottom of the heart's sea

234
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:01,359
there i dug out the root of all craving and swam back to the surface

235
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:08,480
the water had grown cool and outside everything had grown cool

236
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:13,720
as though the heart had traveled north

237
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:21,200
so thank you sa for your kind attention and if you wish

238
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:27,440
between now and tomorrow notice internal and external water that fluid

239
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:35,359
relationship and how water might inspire your practice and your actions

240
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:39,400
thank you for your kind attention
