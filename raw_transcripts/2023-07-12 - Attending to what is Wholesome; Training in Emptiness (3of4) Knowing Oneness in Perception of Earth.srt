1
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,940
greetings everyone good to be back with you

2
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:24,840
I'd like to offer my apologies for the technical glitches yesterday

3
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:32,640
before we started um and to thank you for your kindness

4
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:40,980
in that respect so we're going to pursue our

5
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:48,360
training in emptiness with the aspiration of cutting through

6
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,739
the illusion of self

7
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:00,840
and so to begin we recognize the wholesomeness

8
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,460
of mental seclusion

9
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,260
so knowing the tendency of the mind to proliferate

10
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:20,220
we carefully place all our concerns worries

11
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,939
stresses outside the meditation space

12
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,820
we can come back to them later no need for now

13
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,400
so begin by assuming your meditation posture

14
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,200
settling in whatever is supporting you

15
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:06,479
whether it's the cushion the floor bed chair

16
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:13,879
and feeling the contact this body

17
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,280
and this is contacting with the Earth

18
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:37,340
and closing the eyes if that's comfortable for you

19
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:42,379
and letting the attention

20
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:54,840
um to the breathing the long slow deep

21
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:02,040
inhale and exhale

22
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,360
as a way of connecting

23
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:29,000
and we'll do a brief but hopefully loving body scan

24
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:36,300
bringing warmth and kindness and meta

25
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:43,519
to all the parts of our body and as we do so

26
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:50,720
relaxing them to the best we can

27
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,180
so starting with the head

28
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:02,840
the eyes are closed

29
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:12,360
and see if you can feel the muscles in your face

30
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:19,739
see if there's any tensions anywhere in the forehead or behind the eyes

31
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:27,319
around the mouth any sort of folding

32
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:35,180
and it's a lovely thing to soften that

33
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:43,820
and bringing our loving attention down through the neck

34
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:54,440
and then letting go of the shoulders the arms and the hands

35
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:01,199
and down through the Torso the heart

36
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:07,020
your belly developments

37
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:17,240
loving awareness through the legs and down through the feet

38
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:35,900
and now making the connection with the Earth

39
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:43,380
and drawing up the Earth's energy through the feet

40
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:49,380
up through the legs the pelvis

41
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:55,699
the belly the Torso

42
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,699
the shoulders arms and hands

43
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:20,840
the neck the face

44
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,720
and the crown of the head scalp and that little opening

45
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,479
a remnant the fontanelle

46
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:41,340
we can let that loving awareness shine out

47
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,419
into the sky

48
00:06:52,139 --> 00:07:00,740
so being grateful for this body however it is

49
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:07,560
and now solutioning our mental state our mind

50
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:15,138
state with a taste of meta

51
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:22,340
lighting a little candle in the heart

52
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:31,080
and letting it farm and encourage

53
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,039
this body

54
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:43,639
and then little by little that he had spread out

55
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:53,039
far and wide to the front

56
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,979
the right that's it back to the left

57
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:03,800
above and below

58
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:14,599
gently radiating that down doesn't matter how far it goes

59
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:25,979
the intention is benevolence towards All Creatures

60
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:30,020
everywhere in this universe

61
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:02,540
I'm now keeping that flavor of meta

62
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,600
as a sort of background theme to our meditation

63
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,899
inviting the mind to rest in the body

64
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:19,760
resting in the body is a home

65
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:30,380
it's a safe and wise space for placing our awareness

66
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:49,019
if you like you can imagine the myriad biological processes going on in your

67
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:55,080
body and they

68
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:02,959
experiencing the body as flow in constancy

69
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:09,779
constantly changing and fundamentally empty

70
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:12,740
of a self

71
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:29,459
and we can move from the Ecology of the body to the Ecology of

72
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:35,580
the Earth and since our interdependence

73
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:41,779
with all the various creatures on the Earth

74
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,080
each breath

75
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:53,519
taking in oxygen and and giving away CO2

76
00:10:53,519 --> 00:11:01,100
sharing these molecules with who knows what beings

77
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,180
and when and where

78
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:17,000
We're All in This Together I like to say and um

79
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:32,339
I find thinking of my life in ecological terms

80
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:36,140
should be very very beneficial

81
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:44,459
it's really physically the case that there is nothing substantial that

82
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:51,660
we can really reified as a self that's in control of

83
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,959
everything

84
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,420
it simply doesn't exist

85
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,959
and these molecules that we share and receive

86
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:16,079
this process is so ephemeral who knows

87
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:23,300
who's participating sometimes we breathe in

88
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:31,160
molecules that somebody else perhaps like

89
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:38,040
[Music] they're Buddha perhaps may have breathed in

90
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,019
some of the molecules that we're breathing

91
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:56,540
and then getting down to Basics seeing the body in the body

92
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:03,620
and this means that we see the Dharma in the body

93
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:17,120
knowing our own and others bodies are just impermanent phenomenon

94
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:28,220
and now opening up our awareness to whatever is arising Moment by moment

95
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:37,740
through any of the sense doors and very carefully

96
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:45,560
attending to our lived experience

97
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:57,540
this is crucial because in each moment

98
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:04,339
we create the causes and conditions for the next moment

99
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:15,740
and so the crucial importance of seeing clearly

100
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:23,180
of keeping our mindfulness fully in gear

101
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,880
so that we can see when something arises whether it's wholesome

102
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:37,100
or unwholesome and then we can decide which way to go

103
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:44,660
and instead of choosing the path of bondage

104
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:54,319
being stuck we can choose the path to Freedom

105
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:13,160
may my practice be a cause for awakening

106
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:21,920
so whatever you do choose mindfulness

107
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,639
keep practicing like this

108
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:01,039
foreign

109
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:53,280
weeping our awareness on our lived experience

110
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:58,620
in this body in this place

111
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:08,100
In This Moment attending to whatever Horizons

112
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,440
and seeing that clearly

113
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:24,200
seeing the inconstancy of all that we experience

114
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:32,539
the flow of our experience

115
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:40,020
and being friends with whatever arises

116
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:49,260
and choosing which path to take

117
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:54,240
if something less wholesome arises

118
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:47,039
as we come to the end of this sitting we reflect on the goodness

119
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:54,779
of this path of practice and we each open

120
00:28:54,779 --> 00:29:02,220
our Circle of Care to offer whatever wholesome conditions

121
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:08,100
we created in this meditation [Music]

122
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:15,200
to benefit all living beings on this planet

123
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:23,220
mayola beings everywhere be safe

124
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:30,240
and protect it being safe

125
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:36,740
may we be contented at ease

126
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:42,260
may we all abide in peace

127
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:51,019
and may all of us and all beings everywhere be free

128
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:59,039
about you all about your breakfast and I invite you

129
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:05,220
to join me as we bow to each other with gratitude

130
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:10,580
for this circle of Sangha

131
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:28,919
greetings everyone welcome back to uh this series on

132
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:32,778
training and emptiness

133
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:41,399
as you may know the pillar uh the pillars the three pillars of the

134
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:48,960
Buddhist path are ethics and samadhi

135
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:59,120
and wisdom in Bali it's uh Sila Samari Banya

136
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:05,700
um and it's really important that we keep

137
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:10,980
in mind that we have to bring all that

138
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:18,899
into practice in order for our meditation to be at all

139
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:26,279
beneficial so we begin by

140
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:33,539
doing our best to be ethical

141
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:41,059
in body speech and mind and I also take generosity

142
00:31:41,059 --> 00:31:46,740
to be to be a part of being ethical

143
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:50,899
in addition to the five precepts

144
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:58,620
generosity because we're not just doing this for ourselves and it's it's a great thing to keep in

145
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:03,779
mind um the importance

146
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:10,020
of other people again an opportunity for

147
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:15,500
letting go of our obsession with Me Myself and mine

148
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:27,960
so samadhi or deep meditative composure

149
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:36,059
is not an end in itself it when it gets deep it is very

150
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:43,320
pleasurable and it can even be a trap if we get attached

151
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:50,480
to it but the purpose of deep meditation

152
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,679
is that it's allows us to collect the mind

153
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:03,539
sufficiently and to be sufficiently empty

154
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:10,799
in order to have the insights that lead to Freedom

155
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,760
to Awakening

156
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:24,360
so um yesterday I began reading to you from

157
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:30,179
uh the Buddha's shorter discourse on

158
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:37,278
emptiness and this is the um

159
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:47,899
and um if you were there yesterday we began with

160
00:33:47,899 --> 00:33:54,840
uh Ananda going to the Buddha in this beautiful

161
00:33:54,840 --> 00:34:02,039
um building and the forest um with where the monks were all practicing

162
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:08,398
meditation and he went and paid his respects and sat

163
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:14,638
down and and something was on his mind and he said and he really wanted to make sure

164
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:19,800
he had heard things right and he asked the Buddha to please um

165
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:26,580
let him know if he indeed heard correctly that the Buddha said previously

166
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:32,179
that he often abides in emptiness

167
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:41,658
and the Buddha was delighted by this question and confirmed yes indeed

168
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:50,299
I abided in emptiness then and I often abide in emptiness now

169
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:57,379
and then he begins to explain uh to Ananda

170
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:03,140
um what it means to provide an emptiness and how you might

171
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:09,119
actually approach deeper and deeper uh States

172
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:14,460
of meditation that become more and more um

173
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:20,579
empty so

174
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:22,760
um

175
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:33,480
what the um Buddha affirmed to Ananda is that

176
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:39,180
it is really important in order to dwell on emptiness to

177
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:44,640
um be clearly aware of our experience in

178
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:51,119
every moment and we should know as practitioners what

179
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:56,940
is present in our experience and in addition to that we should know

180
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:03,060
what is absent so

181
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,180
um

182
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:19,859
it's uh the teaching is that whatever is present is empty of itself

183
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:30,380
it's it's not it doesn't have thingness uh it is essentially uh a process

184
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:38,820
um the uh

185
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:44,220
our body and whatever we experience is empty if anything that's

186
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:50,359
uh substantial uh or eternal

187
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:02,940
so after this introduction that I read yesterday the Buddha goes on to say

188
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:09,359
thus one regards what is not there as empty

189
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:18,920
however as to what remains there one clearly knows this is present

190
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:26,460
thus Ananda this is the genuine undistorted

191
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:32,599
completely pure descent and to emptiness

192
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:40,200
and then he goes on to give some instructions and

193
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:46,500
here I'll be the the Buddha Buddhist text uses the word biku which means Monk

194
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:53,700
and uh Scholars now agree that um Biko can refer not only to monks but

195
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:59,940
to all monastics including nuns and to lay disciples as well

196
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:07,940
so I'll be using the word practitioner as a translation of Bitcoin

197
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:17,480
a practitioner attends to the Oneness dependent on the perception of Earth

198
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:23,700
through the perception of Earth the Mind gains confidence

199
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:30,480
becomes settled remains still

200
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,480
and is inclined towards release

201
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:47,099
so the advice is in this phase of the

202
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:54,359
gradual entry into emptiness this phase is

203
00:38:54,359 --> 00:39:02,700
being aware of the Earth as a way of

204
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:09,920
not being so attached uh through oneself and to details

205
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:16,099
so then the Buddha goes on to say um

206
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:21,780
not attending to any of the rivers and ravines

207
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:28,920
the tracks of stumps and thorns the mountains the uneven places

208
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:36,560
what attends to the Oneness dependent on the perception of the Earth

209
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:43,440
so perceiving the Earth in its globality without

210
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:50,220
getting bogged down and uh specifics

211
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:56,579
in details and then he says

212
00:39:56,579 --> 00:40:02,780
through the perception of Earth the Mind gains confidence becomes settled

213
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:08,820
remains still and is inclined for its release

214
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:16,500
so this is this is a refrain one clearly knows thus

215
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:22,020
whatever stress there might be dependent on the perception of people

216
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:30,180
that is not present here there is only this measure of stress

217
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:36,079
the Oneness dependent on the perception of Earth

218
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:42,599
one clearly knows this field of perception is empty

219
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:51,660
of the perception of people there is only this that is not emptiness

220
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:57,380
the Oneness dependent on the perception of Earth

221
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:03,660
thus one regards what is not there as empty

222
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:11,460
however as to what remains there one clearly knows this is present

223
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:20,400
this Ananda is the genuine undistorted completely pure descent

224
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,539
into emptiness

225
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:31,859
so we experimented with this a bit in in the meditation [Music]

226
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:37,020
and the idea is that

227
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:43,740
um we begin with mental seclusion with physical seclusion as we do when we sit

228
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:50,280
down to meditate and then we cultivate mental seclusion

229
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:59,060
um seclusion from the hindrances seclusion from the chattering mind

230
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:03,060
and uh

231
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:10,400
and then there was a step in between which was

232
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:15,839
the forest um but the text is repeated in each one

233
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:20,880
and today I wanted to begin with um

234
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:28,079
this phase of the gradual approach to emptiness which is

235
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:36,119
awareness of the Earth and we don't have to know everything about the Earth we don't have to know as

236
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:41,820
the Buddha says all the mountains and Ravines and rivers and so forth and

237
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:46,859
Fields so

238
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:52,260
this is um a very interesting instruction to not

239
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:58,380
get bogged down in details because as soon as we start doing that

240
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:05,060
the mind starts roaming around and um

241
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:12,780
and it's very easy to indulge in some sort of reification

242
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:18,140
so helping he's trying to help us out of the very human

243
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:23,119
tendency to reify our experience

244
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:34,260
um and I find that particularly helpful because I tend to be way too much of a

245
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:39,599
of a detailed person and um there's an expression in English

246
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:44,940
the uh the devil is in the details and

247
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:50,640
that's uh I've certainly seen in for me that that's the case I I can get

248
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:56,460
um by details and you know I wanted to make sure everything's in the right place

249
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:03,900
and uh that's the way it should be and this is not skillful uh on the path to

250
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:11,940
practice so if you would like some homework for

251
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:17,280
um the week or I mean not that we for for the next

252
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:25,740
24 hours um see if you can in your experience uh

253
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:31,619
really pay attention to where your mind is going and not just in meditation but in daily

254
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:38,880
life as well and if the and see what you're focusing

255
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:45,000
on are you focusing on people uh or what and then if you want to

256
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:53,640
simplify a bit the invitation is to focus on the earth as a unified

257
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:59,700
perception it's grounding it's settling

258
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:07,260
and uh it can help us to stay centered

259
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:11,240
and then as the Buddhist says

260
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:21,720
the there is only this that is not emptiness

261
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:28,260
the Oneness dependent on the perception of Earth and thus one regards

262
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:33,960
what is not there as empty

263
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:39,240
however as to what remains one clearly knows this is present

264
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:45,359
thus this is the genuine undistorted completely pure

265
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:50,000
descent into emptiness

266
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:58,220
thank you for your attention thank you for your practice
