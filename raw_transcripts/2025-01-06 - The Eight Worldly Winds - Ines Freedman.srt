1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:05,240
so good morning and um this morning I wanted to

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:12,120
um talk about um a relationship the relationship between the eight worldly

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:19,640
winds and or intentions uh the intentions that we kind of live throughout the day

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,720
with um they're called the eight worldly winds because they tend to uh toss us

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:31,520
around like strong winds um and um you know they can even

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:38,160
um uh um U you know kind of batter us around quite a bit you know like it

7
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,360
reminds me in New Zealand you know the wind sometimes in in Wellington gets so

8
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,600
bad that they actually have uh places to hold on to at the street corners when

9
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,640
the winds come and it's not that unusual uh but you know that's a lot a lot of time that's really what's

10
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,039
happening in our minds and um a lot of what keeps our minds from being at peace

11
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:07,520
in our lives um and you know no matter how um

12
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,560
you know how carefully we set up our lives how hard we work to always get the

13
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,360
winds we want uh it doesn't happen it doesn't work you know so we're always

14
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,280
kind of chasing these winds um you know trying to um trying to get the good ones

15
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,439
and avoid the bad ones um so just so very simple you know

16
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:36,720
the the they they're four pairs and the first two are kind of the personal ones

17
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,320
um they're Pleasure and Pain you know my Pleasure and Pain uh their uh gain or

18
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,960
loss you know things you gain or lose in your life um and the other two can be

19
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:54,560
more interrelational um so praise and blame I mean we can praise and blame ourselves

20
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:01,000
right we some of us are very familiar with that and uh but there also something unh happens in the in the

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,719
bigger world and the other one is uh the last one is Fame and

22
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:13,800
disrepute um now a lot of us who oh I don't want fame but but there's something very related to fame called

23
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,920
status and so fame or status which sometimes can be as simple as being um

24
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:29,200
I'm a good artist you know um that that just that little bit of wanting to be seen as a good something um so these are

25
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,360
all the things things you know these very common human things that Force us to drive

26
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:43,599
us um so um soly changing gears a little bit um

27
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:50,640
you know the first time um I saw a living statue and

28
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:58,360
anybody does everybody know what a living statue is you know so I I was in San Francisco and a living statue is a

29
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,840
performer they usually Street performers who they'll perform at fairs and they

30
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,040
basically what they do is they get in a costume and they paint themselves and

31
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,440
the first one I saw was just like a silvery white you know and they're in costume their faces painted everything's

32
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:22,599
silvery white and they just don't move they're just like a living statue and I

33
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:28,840
remember you know the time I was a yoga student you know and I really struggled

34
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,120
five minutes holding still standing up all I was just standing up Tre POS they

35
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:41,720
called it you know just standing 5 minutes and I was like you know really hard and this person you know I kind of

36
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:47,239
went for a walk came back an hour later they're still standing yeah it's quite

37
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:53,200
Quite a feat and um so now moving up to some

38
00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:00,480
years later um there's an artist um her uh a musician performer um kind of an

39
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:07,760
unusual musician performer her name is Amanda Palmer and you know maybe you've heard of her maybe you haven't you know

40
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,760
um but um before she made it in music um

41
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:20,479
she was a um living statue and she did it for seven years and this how she made

42
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:25,720
a living and um her her gig was called

43
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:32,360
uh the 8-foot bride and so she would stand on a pedest Crystal and um she'

44
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:38,400
paint herself white dressed in a wedding gown you know with a veil and um and

45
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:45,199
holding a bouquet of flowers of real flowers and she would basically stand there for you know usually they do like

46
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:51,360
an hour and a half at a time per set and um and there'd be a little um basket you

47
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,880
know at the floor people could leave a donation and um when she reflected on it

48
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:03,759
you know she happened to be a student you know as Zen and yoga student and she

49
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:10,000
said that um she said yeah yeah I'm really not a disciplined person you know

50
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,680
um but but you know when I thought of doing this I thought I can do one thing at a time and that's just like just

51
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:24,240
stand still that's all I have to do just stand still you know and then she qualified it stand still and love

52
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,919
whoever shows up um and so she um so this is what she

53
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:35,759
did for seven years as the way of making a living um and so people would come up to

54
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:42,160
her you know and and look her deep in the eyes and she would be really connecting with each person you know

55
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,400
this is like her practice you know to really show up fully for each person and

56
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,919
um and you know and then if they chose to give a donation um she would move surpris them

57
00:05:54,919 --> 00:06:01,120
by moving and handing them a flower and um so it's just very very

58
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,400
sweet you know but but it really struck me was just the way um she you know her

59
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:13,039
intention was just to do one thing she wasn't going to do a lot of things but just this one beautiful thing of

60
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:18,400
lovingly standing still

61
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,639
um you know but a living statue is also affected by the eight worldly

62
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:32,360
winds and um and so just you know to tell on them now you know that uh and

63
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:39,360
really maybe connecting yourself you know as as you uh con reflect on them um

64
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,680
you know like Pleasure and Pain you know where um it can refer to the really

65
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:50,039
small little pleasures you know like sipping a cup of warm tea or the really

66
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:55,520
big pleasure you know maybe reconnecting with a long lost friend and just feel

67
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,599
all this intense pleasure and joy um so can be physical can be

68
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:08,879
emotional you know and same thing on the other side you know the the uh the little aches you know of of uh standing

69
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:17,080
in line too long or um or the really strong ones of when we're ill or um or

70
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:23,280
heartbroken or uh you so all it can range Pleasure and Pain can be just this

71
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:32,400
huge realm and um um and you know so all of you here I

72
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,840
I think you all experienced a little bit of one of those in the last sit right anybody feel a little little

73
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:44,960
discomfort at some point um you know anybody felt a little bit of Peace a

74
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,759
little bit of of Happiness pleasure um you know so maybe some

75
00:07:50,759 --> 00:08:00,800
actually felt a lot of pain right some of us have a different conditions in our life um and so the the art is is is how

76
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,240
do we relate to those when they arise and if Our

77
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,879
intention is to always feel good it means that we're in conflict

78
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:18,840
with probably half of what happens to us and um and what happens when we

79
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:25,360
always want to feel good that means that we start grabbing it and oh don't go away that good feeling let me have my

80
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:32,279
third cookie I know I'm full but I want a little more pleasure right you know so we're always chasing after it not

81
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:36,959
wanting to Let It Go

82
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:45,720
um you know um the example that I I often go to with this is um um you know

83
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:52,160
I used to you know I moved away from my mother so I didn't see her that often you know and you know but whenever I

84
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:58,279
would come to see her you know she'd open the door and her eyes would just light up with joy to see me she'd just

85
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:05,399
be so happy so delighted but before I even got through the door she'd say how long are you

86
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:12,600
staying and uh and you know what whatever I said wasn't enough it didn't

87
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:19,000
only if I moved back in would be enough but but this is what we do we you

88
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,000
know we keep chasing after those good feelings those Pleasures

89
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,399
um so what's the alternative instead of being um you know seeking to be

90
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:38,079
comfortable all the time you know seeking to be at peace with whatever shows up could be an

91
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:44,760
alternative what kind of intention can we bring to our lives so that we are

92
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:50,480
present for whatever shows up and we're at peace with whatever shows up it

93
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,120
doesn't mean that if we notice that um oh wow I'm I'm really sitting crooked

94
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:01,760
maybe you know I'll be a little more comfortable if I sit a little straigh you we might still rearrange and be a

95
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:07,760
little more comfortable there's nothing wrong with being a little more comfortable but it's how we hold that

96
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:16,000
you know we might not be able to get more comfortable you know so how do we uh still find a sense of happiness or at

97
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,800
least a sense of Peace So having an attitude an intention

98
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:28,040
of Good Will towards ourselves or of kindness toward situation uh what can be your intentions

99
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:33,600
in the moment and intention of Letting Go you know in Buddhism we teach the

100
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:40,480
three wise intentions you know Good Will nonharming and letting go or

101
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,120
renunciation you know so those are the three kind of three sides to of the

102
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:52,920
qualities that really allow us to be present with whatever shows up and have a heart that's at peace when these

103
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:59,079
worldly winds you know can arise and Fall Away

104
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:12,760
so with gain and loss you know and and you know you think about the living statue I am positive she had plenty of

105
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:18,880
of um you know little Cool Wind feeling really sweet and probably quite a bit of

106
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,959
wow this hurts and and learning to meet that you

107
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:30,360
know um I mean at one point she said you know I have the best job in the world I

108
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:38,399
have the best job in the world um so gain and loss so um you know

109
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:45,079
we all have we all get things right we get things we want all the time you know might be something simple you know we go

110
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:51,680
to the store we buy dinner materials or we buy um or we get you know the bigger

111
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:58,800
things in life we might get a relationship a friendship we might get a career family all the different things

112
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:05,120
that we um you know skills you know uh learn how to play music learn how to work with

113
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:11,360
wood um you know Sports you know learn how to play tennis uh so you know maybe

114
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,720
we travel we get all these a nice place to live we have all these different um

115
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,680
things we gain we can gain in life and we can lose all of them right you know

116
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:28,040
we can um you know people who've been Master pianists have have uh injured

117
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:33,320
their hands and and lost that skill right so every everything we have you

118
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,360
know people get divorced um children move away you know

119
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,720
so um you know we all have losses in these lives this life is made of of both

120
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:49,480
all these great things we want might be minor you know uh that that we get and

121
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:59,199
and they might be major and we have all sorts of losses in this life and um one teacher said um

122
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:05,240
spiritual growth is a constant state of loss which is kind of interesting

123
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:12,600
interesting thing you know because we are actually constantly letting go of everything every moment otherwise how

124
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:19,600
when we show up um and um you know and some people give

125
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:26,920
such importance to some things you know I mean uh that's one thing that's always amazed me you know and and you know I'm

126
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:33,560
just culturally not in tune with this is that people get devastated when their team loses in

127
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:40,240
sports yeah I mean incredibly devastated you know and uh so we give

128
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:46,760
things a lot of meaning you know a lot of meaning you know I guess the meaning must be this is really important they

129
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:52,839
win it my life depends on it you know at least some people act that way you

130
00:13:52,839 --> 00:14:00,839
know um you know I remember you know um it was her first newer car you know and

131
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:06,480
it looked perfect you know it looked perfect and you know somebody came Buy in a bicycle and just keyed every car

132
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:13,120
down the street you know and I remember um you know doing you know thinking you know

133
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:19,920
just um we're actually standing outside uh IMC at the time you know it's like when I first started coming it was like

134
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:26,160
back in um Palo Alto and um and and it was like right after Dharma talk you

135
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,880
know so it's was a pretty equanimous place and I said you know next time my car I'll do that right

136
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:37,480
away I'll keep my car right away then I don't have to worry about it

137
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:44,320
anymore um but gain and loss right

138
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,440
um you know and you know and we lose everything right we you know eventually

139
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:56,040
you know we lose our health our abilities our capacities and we lose our lives we lose everything everyone we've

140
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:02,680
ever loved everything in our lives we eventually lose and Suzuki roshi said it

141
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:08,480
beautifully he said life is going to see in a boat you know will

142
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:17,199
sink you know I love that you know because you know that's that's the reality of it that's the reality of

143
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:23,839
it and you know there's nothing wrong with wanting healthy relationships and working towards these wonderful things

144
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:30,839
in our lives it's how much the heart is at peace it's like sometimes people you

145
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:37,880
know become Workaholics you know they're working in their career but they're so tight you know we actually have a name

146
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:46,000
for them type A personalities people that give themselves you know headaches high blood pressure from being so

147
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,160
contracted instead of working out of Joy instead of working in a peaceful

148
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:57,519
way um you know I remember when I used to um

149
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:03,199
work in a different you know um realm you know I used to you know I I I loved

150
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:11,319
what I did you know and I felt at the end of the day I wasn't exhausted by it you know I was kind of uh inspired by it

151
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:18,360
you know because I was just able to just do it full-heartedly

152
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,519
um you know one of the things you know that we get attached to you know in in

153
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:33,759
um um you was a yoga student you know and um um and I was really feeling good

154
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,800
you know it's like I'd been practicing for a while and I was really strong and

155
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:45,759
flexible and so I just felt really good for the first time in my life my body felt really alive and really really

156
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:53,360
strong and um and I injured myself and I had a really bad bad injury um and I

157
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,560
couldn't you know my whole leg was kind of messed up a bit and and um and I

158
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:05,600
remember talking to my friend who's a yoga teacher and um and I said oh I can't do

159
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:12,918
yoga now you know it's going to be months and months of of rehabilitating this before I can do yoga she said no no

160
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:22,360
no no yoga is about what you can do not what you can't do and so I found ways of doing yoga

161
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:27,678
with what I could do and um it brought a lot of ease to my body it brought a lot

162
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:35,799
of ease to my mind you know maybe I couldn't do um you know Lotus anymore you know but I could still

163
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:41,120
um you know stretch my upper body and I could still uh be really present in my

164
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,640
body you know so uh and this is a little this is really the practice you know we

165
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:54,679
see you know we're meditating and the mind is just like restless and chaotic we this is what we can do we can

166
00:17:54,679 --> 00:18:02,360
show up for it we can show up for it with with peaceful attitude it doesn't have to be fixed it

167
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:10,520
doesn't have to be changed just by having a peaceful attitude towards this chaotic mind uh already transforms it

168
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:17,000
it's already something that we can observe we can be mindful of

169
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:40,480
so praise and blame now we're getting into the relation Rel relational part

170
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:46,320
where um you know as I said we can often blame ourselves or praise ourselves oh I

171
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:53,120
did really great didn't I you know or or blame yourself you know I used to play racketball with this guy and and every

172
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,280
time he used to a ball he would hit himself in the head and say God idiot

173
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:03,760
idiot you know and you know it was kind of unpleasant to to play with him you

174
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:11,640
know to I thought we were playing a game you know um that um you know who you know

175
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:17,240
who knows who we blame ourselves for um you know I I remember when I first start

176
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:23,000
really paying attention to my mind and meditation every time I got distracted I

177
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,559
would blame myself you screwed up you there' be this little mean little voice that would blame me you know you know

178
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:36,720
and it's amazing how consistent that was you know I would failed you failed you blew it you know and and of course you

179
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,679
know you do that a 100 times a minute you know in you know especially in the beginning you know and you know maybe

180
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:48,520
only 50 in the advanced you know

181
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:56,039
um you know and the thing about failure is um failures are the building

182
00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:03,120
blocks of learning right you know if you watch a little kid learn to walk what do they do

183
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,440
they fall down right and how many times they fall down they don't oops I blew it

184
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:15,200
I didn't get it perfect never trying again you know um you know they just fall down fall down learn to get up get

185
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,360
up and that's how they learn to walk they learn to figure it out they learn to strengthen their

186
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:26,960
muscles um and that's how we learn any skill you know playing piano you keep hitting you hit the wrong note okay now

187
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,919
you hit it right you've got the wrong Rhythm okay now you've got it right you know and this is how you learn but you

188
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:38,600
have to have you have to fail to learn and so to have a relationship with the

189
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:44,200
natural failures of life um the um a

190
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:50,400
wholesome relationship um the quote I really like

191
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:57,880
from Neil bore you know he was a noble price physicist um he said an expert is

192
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:04,480
someone who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow

193
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,159
field but I love that I love that that's the expert is the one who screws up the

194
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:16,840
most you know and so let's make lots of mistakes you know it's okay um this is

195
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:24,840
how we learn we learn more we try more we're more adventurous we're more willing to talk to a stranger you know

196
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:30,000
more willing to make fools of ourselves um

197
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
you know Amanda you know the the eight-foot bride you know she would get

198
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,480
um you know uh people who would sit her oh God you're awesome you're awesome you're great thank you she get all this

199
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:48,640
wonderful praise and you know she she she noticed she would feel herself kind of puffing up with a

200
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:55,799
praise and then people come by and say get a job you know and you know she said her mind

201
00:21:55,799 --> 00:22:04,679
would would come to defense say I have a job this is my job you know and and eventually she was like oh

202
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:09,960
okay praise blame you know and just allowing them to course through her yeah

203
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:17,400
because when you're just doing one thing being still you see pretty clearly eventually you see these things you see

204
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:22,760
these movements of the Mind grasping um and you know again that's a

205
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:30,520
you know what what are we doing in meditation we're living statues right you know

206
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:36,520
um the Buddha said they blame those who remain

207
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:42,960
silent they blame those who speak much they blame those who speak

208
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,600
little there's none in the world who is not

209
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:56,480
blamed you know and uh you know how much energy do we put forth trying not to be

210
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:03,000
blamed you know so um and you know the thing about praise

211
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,320
is that um um you know for me I I I like being

212
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:15,480
praised but I didn't like being told you I'd like to hear about it from somebody else you know but when somebody would

213
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:23,240
praise me to my face I always felt uncomfortable took me a long time to find my way to say oh thank you a simple

214
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:29,520
thank you um so we have all sorts of different relationships of praise um you

215
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,840
know and and then um you know we can take praise and as I mentioned like get

216
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:40,440
Conceited from Praise You know you're really good at something and people are always telling you how great you are and

217
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:46,400
you get conceited by it or you know people you know like it it always um um

218
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:52,159
it would always bother me to see people praising kids for being pretty you know

219
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:58,039
especially your little girls for being pretty oh you're so pretty you're so pretty you're so pretty you know and and

220
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:03,279
then you you know you get old and you're so ugly you're so ugly you're so

221
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:11,159
ugly um you know praise some blame PR some blame they come and

222
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:17,559
go you know the motivation to get praise disconnects us from

223
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:24,520
people you know because we want something from them right you know we want them we want them to like us we

224
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:31,480
want them to we're wanting wanting you know um or not wanting to be blamed

225
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,679
you know so so you kind of tiptoe around

226
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:46,279
things you know we when we connect with our Good Will towards

227
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:51,960
others uh towards our kindness towards others we become interested in

228
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:59,000
them when we're wanting to be praised we're interested in ourselves you know we're want in you

229
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:07,000
know and and so that's where the connection Rises and even if Our intention is to connect with others

230
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,600
those winds arise in us you know if we're not you know we may not be

231
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:17,799
purified of wanting to be liked wanting to be praised you know wanting to be

232
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:23,520
seen as successful you know those things can arise in us and they can arise in a

233
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,679
bigger field we don't have to keep feeding them or being run by them them

234
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:35,200
and and chasing them we can have in a bigger field of of oh yeah this is my

235
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:45,840
intention is to show up and be here and to love you know and to uh connect um to

236
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:51,799
be to hold my life in a peaceful

237
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:02,159
way you if we didn't cling we wouldn't be practicing there'd be no need for

238
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:09,640
practice you know so clinging is not a mistake you know this is uh I mean you

239
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:17,360
know it's unnecessary unhelpful makes us suffer but this is what we do as human

240
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:24,480
beings you know or the whole human civilization is just filled with clinging all the suffering in humanity

241
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:30,240
is just filled with clinging this is The Human Condition

242
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:36,480
it's not for personal failure yeah which we often um look at

243
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,679
those things as personal

244
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:55,039
failures so the the last pair the status um or fame and then

245
00:26:55,039 --> 00:27:02,480
disrepute um this is about our image or how we are seen in society how we are um

246
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:10,679
uh or place in society uh how other people see us you know um you know some

247
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:16,520
people like to brag about everything they accomplish you know make sure everybody knows I think you know you may

248
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:23,360
have done that or maybe you've seen other people do that you know I I remember kind of looking for places and

249
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:29,799
conversations where I could um kind of weave in my accomplishments you know

250
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:38,760
uh the little ways that the ego wants to get its little perks yeah um and I've I've also been where um

251
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:43,799
you know we're talk you know um I had an idea it was a really good idea and you

252
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:50,440
know shared it with a group and then somebody's sharing my idea you know and and you know and everybody's like really

253
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:57,919
liking the idea it's like I want to make sure they know it's my idea you know it's mine you know and you know so these

254
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:03,840
little pieces of of this is the status the the wanting to be seen you know I'm

255
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:11,159
the one who did that you know I found the best restaurant the best one you know it's me who found it you know not I

256
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:16,320
want to share this really good food with you but no no I'm the one who found it you know I found

257
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,399
it um you know one of the things that always used to strike me you know even

258
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:27,760
though I had all these same feelings um but God this is so blatant you know people would have a bumper sticker that

259
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:34,399
said a proud parent of an honor student it's like you know um and maybe it was

260
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:39,519
like totally had had didn't have this flavor but for me that was like wow

261
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:45,120
that's like showing how much ego you have you know um so

262
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:53,159
um yeah and then you see the the other side of it you know you see like Olympic athletes right who are just incredible

263
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:59,480
incredible athletes and people who get the bronze and feel like complete

264
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:04,760
failures you know it's like we we attach these things to status you know the

265
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:09,799
things that give us status and the bronze for to them was

266
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:16,840
failure um you know we see it in you really see it in school you know when you're in you

267
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:22,000
know grade school high school you know you're either popular or unpopular

268
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,440
you're in this click or that click you know and then you see you know it reverse right you see some of the nerds

269
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:34,159
who are now had these huge companies and you know and they're the successful ones

270
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:41,360
and the other ones have the the lesser jobs and you know and and it just kind of goes on this whole status game you

271
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:47,679
know that people play um but it's not so much fun it's not a it's not a fun

272
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:54,760
game um you we create a lot of suffering for ourselves so we're motivated by wanting

273
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:59,880
to be liked or by wanting to get approval by wanting to be

274
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:06,760
admired um you know an example you know that you know I've often um used to some

275
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:12,640
students you know um is um let's say we're making lunch for a friend you know

276
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,559
and their initial idea is like oh well we'll get to spend time talking I'll make them some good food and I'll make

277
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:25,840
something really nice for them and we were kind of happy about it and then you sit down to planet and you start

278
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:31,600
worrying you know oh are they going to like that are they going to like that and then you've got to clean the house

279
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:37,440
and you get you know it's like oh it's not clean enough and and you know you go through this whole Rick andaro of being

280
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,679
very tense about this um you know not you know this is just uh some people

281
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:49,000
have this this particular Quirk and um uh and so instead of just

282
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,840
being with your friend and being a fun thing it becomes this uh and maybe at

283
00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:02,279
some point you enjoy the company once you've gone through the hell of getting there yeah uh but all of that all of

284
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:09,679
that can be done with a different intention because the reason that it's so painful when we do it that way is

285
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:16,840
that we're trying to be liked we're trying to get it perfect you know we're trying to be give a good impression we

286
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:22,760
want to be you know seen a certain way you know oh she makes great food oh she

287
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:28,440
she's uh she keeps a great house she you know whatever it is that that um

288
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:34,000
that we're wanting how we want to be seen But when the focus instead is like

289
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,360
to love her oh I'm going to make something to love her okay she doesn't e gluten okay I'll do something

290
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:45,399
gluten-free but it's coming from a very different place and the whole thing we

291
00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:50,760
can appreciate the process of cleaning um and it doesn't have to be perfect we

292
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:57,000
don't have to hold it so tightly and if the meal fails you know um we had an

293
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:03,320
epic failure once with a meal you know it was uh um it was New Year's Eve and I

294
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:11,399
think we were supposed to go out but the the with some friends they were coming over driving from long distance and we

295
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:17,120
had plans but somehow the uh place we were supposed to became um

296
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:23,559
unavailable and so we didn't have food in the house but we found one package of

297
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:31,039
pasta and so you know we put up the pasta and then put on some good me music and we're having fun and we're talking

298
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:37,679
and we're talking and we're talking and never hear the timer and you know show up and there's

299
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:44,840
this big green congealed mass of spinach pasta you know or well we couldn't call

300
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:50,440
it past anymore um and you know we all just start laughing you know it's just

301
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:56,559
so so classic you know and and it's okay we survived not having dinner on New

302
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:01,880
Year's Eve um and um you know un fortunately you

303
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:08,720
know the state we were in we're having such a good time I didn't feel um personally like a personal

304
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,799
failure um but easily could have been easily could have gone the other

305
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:21,158
way um so

306
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:33,559
um so I want to tell you about um and maybe some of you have heard this is um Zen story uh about sudong PO he was

307
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:40,799
um um uh a Chinese 10th Century uh poet

308
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:46,840
artist Statesman um and um he was a good he had

309
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:53,559
a good friend who was a zen master and I always forget the name zen master F Yin

310
00:33:53,559 --> 00:34:01,480
and you know who he would often discuss Buddhism with you know and he was a very they're both very um uh Sudo is a very

311
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:08,878
serious Buddhist student he took it very really took it to heart and so um you

312
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:15,040
know they would often discuss this and they lived kind of across a river from each other so you had to kind of take a

313
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:23,280
raft to get across you know and uh one day suong po was very inspired by his

314
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:29,040
meditation and he wrote a poem and um this is a it's just four

315
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:36,480
lines okay so um um I bow my head to the heaven within

316
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:45,240
Heavens okay rays of a light Illuminating the universe the eight winds cannot move

317
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:51,118
me sitting still upon the Golden

318
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:57,920
Lotus so he was impressed with himself and um he sent a servant to meet

319
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,240
hand carry the poem to um to F yin and

320
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:11,240
you know took the raft across the water and brought him the poem and um and um

321
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:17,359
you know and so F Yin looked at the poem and um he smiled and he wrote one word

322
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:25,960
on it and sent it back and the one word on it was fart

323
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:36,000
and um so Sudan po gets the manuscript back and um you know he's like you know

324
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:43,280
assuming that he's going to get praise and you know and um so he he sees that

325
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:48,960
and he is outraged he is you know what the hell that blousy old monk you know

326
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:58,119
who does he think he is you know and he gets you know dress goes across the river you know uh rafts over and and and

327
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:03,640
but the door's closed and there's a note on it for him

328
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:13,400
and it says the eight winds cannot move me one fart blows me across the water

329
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:20,020
[Applause]

330
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:29,850
[Laughter]

331
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:40,240
but this is what we do right this is how we are these little insults the little

332
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:50,440
insults so

333
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:02,599
um you know um as Amanda Palmer said as a statue all

334
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:09,319
she needed to do was to be still and love that's

335
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:17,599
it and um you know that's what the practice leads us to it shows us to show up for each

336
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:23,480
moment with a certain amount of Stillness and with a heart full with a

337
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:28,760
heart open a heart ready

338
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:40,240
um you know regardless of what Winds of Change have shown up you know what pleasures and pain what

339
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:47,440
gains and losses we just keep showing up for um you know with an open heart to

340
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:53,079
whatever shows up um you know in

341
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:59,240
Zen um they very much stress the benefit of doing one thing at a time you know

342
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:07,920
and kind of you know you kind of hear a little bit of a put down on multitasking not being quite a Zen thing to do and um

343
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:15,720
you know there was a z student you know who heard that this teaching regularly you know when drinking tea just drink

344
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:23,480
tea right you know and that one day he sees his teacher um drinking tea and

345
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:30,119
reading the newspaper you know and of course he goes up to him you know and he says um you

346
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:35,640
know he's he's kind of shocked you know it's like you know I thought I thought you said when drinking tea you're

347
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:43,000
supposed to just drink tea and you know the teacher says when drinking tea and reading the newspaper just drink the tea

348
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:50,360
and read the [Laughter]

349
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:56,240
newspaper we don't need to be perfect we don't need to be

350
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:01,520
rigid we we we don't we can just be you know these winds are there or

351
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:09,000
attachments are there uh and how do we hold or attachments you know how do we how do we

352
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,960
relate to um getting cut up by by craving how do we relate to that can we

353
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:21,720
hold them with just oh yeah you know being attached to that but being attached with an open hand can we be

354
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:28,160
attached to something and yet give it room for it to be seen to be healed

355
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:36,839
in its own time um you know we can aim to show up

356
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:43,200
for whatever is is in our lives whatever comes next with this at open-handed

357
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:50,640
attitude um you know towards any Wind of Change that shows up you know just be

358
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:58,599
completely just open-handed whatever arises can arise including or most

359
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:04,520
ridiculous egos sometimes you know sometimes just the ego has these you

360
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:10,440
know things that you don't want everybody to see right you know it just it wants a certain way you know it just

361
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:15,839
this little yeah oh that's what showed up that's what showed up okay you know

362
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:23,160
the moment that we can meet that with uh an open-handed uh acceptance it transforms

363
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:31,920
it it's no longer I am that ego it it's ah that arose and that went away it has

364
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:38,000
room to change it has room to um do both you know

365
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,079
um uh drink or tea and read the newspaper it has room for

366
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:50,680
both so um so thank you thank you
