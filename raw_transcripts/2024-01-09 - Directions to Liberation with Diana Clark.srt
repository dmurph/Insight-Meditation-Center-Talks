1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:07,320
so it's the tradition near the beginning of the year to talk about some of the

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:13,679
foundational teachings and so I thought I would do a little bit uh of that today but I want

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,880
to talk about them in a different way not the usual way I'm often I like to do

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:25,920
this not the usual way somehow I don't know what that says about me exactly but

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:33,840
uh and maybe I'll just uh start with um that the Buddha used a lot of similes

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,960
and some metaphors and part of that's what's the fun of some of the sutas is

7
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:47,039
reading them is really how the Buddha brings things to life with these similes

8
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,359
aimile is a way in which you know something is like something else so

9
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:59,519
aimile starts with something presumably that you know and that you're familiar with and then this new idea whatever the

10
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:08,240
Buddhist teaching he's saying oh it's like this thing you already know but for us thousands of years later

11
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,960
we're having to imagine kind of what it was like you know for them back then but I think we

12
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:20,520
can and many of the similes have to do with agriculture or animals or something

13
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,759
like this so one thing I'd like to maybe or

14
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:34,960
maybe I'll just add a few things that somebody even counted Caroline rice Davids uh she was one of the very first

15
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,240
uh translators this is back in the 1890s this is when the sutas were just getting

16
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,680
translated into Western languages so this at the end of the 19th century and

17
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,119
uh she counted and I don't know how she did this

18
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:57,840
568 different concepts for which this the Buddha gave simile that's a lot

19
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,200
that's you know quite something that kind of he's loved to use this way for

20
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,160
teaching and then maybe I'll start with something that maybe would be more of a metaphor than a simil if you wanted to

21
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:17,400
get technical but it's this [Music] idea that the Buddha's teachings

22
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:23,920
describe a way to Liberation to Greater Freedom greater peace greater

23
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,440
well-being I mean different people have different relationships to this word Liberation that's fine you're welcome to

24
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:35,360
have your own relationship with it and what it means to you and why you

25
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,599
practice but the the central premise is that there's a path there's a way to get

26
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:48,200
to this Liberation this greater well-being and often this is a path we

27
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,480
describe it as a path and somehow this idea of a path when we bring that to

28
00:02:53,480 --> 00:03:00,920
mind it uh often has a sense of like oh yeah there's a clear Passage way through

29
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:07,959
which a person or anybody any creature an animal excuse

30
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:24,680
me so a passage way I hope my voice holds

31
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:31,680
up I don't know what just happened with my voice I'll drink more water

32
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:50,720
now we'll see how it is okay it's a little bit better so this idea of a path to

33
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,280
Liberation is like this clear passageway in which you know a being

34
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,360
could just walk along but that's not quite the way that

35
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:08,079
it is because when we have this idea in our mind of a path it's often something

36
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:16,479
that's there already and we walk along at the sidewalk the road hiking trail it's

37
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:24,960
there already and we find it and we walk on it but this path to

38
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,199
Liberation maybe the pointing to it has happened before but it's not necessarily

39
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:37,919
like a clear passage way that just exists instead we are creating it as

40
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:46,440
we're walking it as we're doing these teachings as we're cultivating these wholesome qualities as

41
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:52,199
we're practicing mindfulness concentration right speech

42
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:59,080
Etc so this metaphor kind of breaks down because it's often we start to

43
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:06,639
think like oh yeah okay if I just get on the path and then it'll be smooth sailing but this kind of idea of a path

44
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,160
is more of a concept it's really things that we are doing that we are

45
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:19,039
experiencing in this moment but to get back to this metaphor

46
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:27,919
of the path in the same way that that we walk on a passage way or that we do Buddhist

47
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:34,759
practices when we're walking on a passage way we bring all of ourselves there of course we do we don't bring a

48
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:40,360
just one arm and leave the other arm back or you know something ridiculous like

49
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,759
that so in the same way this uh path towards greater freedom and ease and

50
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:54,039
peace requires all of us all aspects of us all of us even those secret hidden

51
00:05:54,039 --> 00:06:00,680
parts that we're trying to wish would just go away or we don't even want to acknowledge that exist there

52
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:07,479
our what's in our mind what's in our hearts what we say what we do it's all

53
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:14,800
of it is part of this path and there's this metaphor not only

54
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,120
of a path but that it was discovered by somebody that was uh in the woods and

55
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,280
say oh wow I think there's a path here and chopped down some of the maybe took

56
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,360
a hatchet and chopped down some of the things that were in the way found their

57
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,639
way along this passageway you know a lot of work and then they found this city

58
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:41,720
this beautiful ancient city that had been there but it had been overgrown and

59
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:47,120
they cleaned it all up and discovered like wow this this place is fantastic

60
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,400
it's beautiful and then this uh individual went back and told the king and the

61
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:58,400
queen hey I discovered this this path to this really beautiful

62
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:05,520
location and the king and the queen go and they walk on the path and they go to this

63
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,680
beautiful place and say this is great okay we're we're going to stay here and

64
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:16,919
we're going to move our kingdom here and I first heard this story from

65
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:23,120
Gil frall and for some reason you know back then I was really touched by this idea

66
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,199
that he said he said it's meaningful that this individual went back and told

67
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:34,840
the king and the Queen and then the king and the queen are the ones that are walking on this path it's

68
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:42,479
the sense of nobility the sense of kind of what's Noble in all of us like to be to on this

69
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:49,400
path towards greater Freedom or maybe a sense of Regal or you know the uprightness or something like this

70
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:55,840
respect sense of respect for those individuals who are on this

71
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:03,840
path so in this way liberation ation is like this long forgotten City in the

72
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,319
forest and but maybe just as it's possible you know anthropologists are

73
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:14,440
doing this right in modern times maybe just as it's possible to reclaim and

74
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:23,280
then and habit the city once the path is found it is possible to live a life with

75
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:31,240
greater freedom and ease and peace as we engage with this path

76
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,760
so elsewhere in the sutas there's a little bit more kind of a richer uh

77
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,800
description of this idea of a path that I'd like to share with

78
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:49,760
you and um it takes place in the context of uh one of the Buddha's cousins his

79
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:56,519
name is Tissa Tissa he was a monastic he had ordained underneath his cousin the

80
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:02,360
Buddha and he was having a hard time and he

81
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:09,240
says I am dissatisfied with the spiritual life you know kind of this formal language like this is not all I

82
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,320
thought it was going to be and he's saying I have doubts about the

83
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,839
teachings so here's somebody who ordained who decided to you know commit

84
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:28,120
his life to the practice and after doing it for some time is saying I'm dissatisfied and I have

85
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,640
doubts and the Buddha gives him some teachings and some of the teachings are

86
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:43,279
what a little bit what I'm going to share here is a simile so the Buddha goes um and says to

87
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:50,720
Tissa he says Suppose there were two people and one was not skilled in the

88
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:58,480
path and the other one was and that individual that was not skilled in the path would question the

89
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:05,240
one who was skilled in the path and the person who was skilled in the path would

90
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:11,279
reply this is the right way walk along it for a while and you will come to a

91
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:17,920
fork in the road avoid the left fork and go down the

92
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:24,720
Right Fork walk along it for a while and you will see a dense

93
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:32,720
forest go through the forest for a while and then you'll see a vast marshy

94
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,600
swamp go through the swamp for a while and then you will see a steep

95
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,720
slope go down the slope for a while and then you will see a level clear Parkland

96
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,760
if Park Place that's beautiful so this is a little bit more

97
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:56,560
descriptive it's like okay go to the forest and hang a right and go through

98
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,800
the swamp and over the Dell Through the Wood Woods I don't know these types of things but and then the Buddha kind of

99
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,920
like he unpacked that for Tisa well what does this mean what are the how is this

100
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:15,360
uh these different things that one would meet and walking this path and that Buddha he does give um

101
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,560
precise uh instructions or descriptions but I'm going to embellish them a little

102
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,720
bit more for modern times and make them a little bit more um relatable for us

103
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,920
rather than just um giving the simple answers that he gave

104
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:39,160
so he's so the t uh I'm sorry the Buddha explains to the Tissa in the beginning the person who doesn't know the path or

105
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:45,279
is not skilled in the path is you know everybody who's not awakened and the person who is skilled in it is somebody

106
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:52,440
who's awakened such as the Buddha and then instructions was to go

107
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:58,560
this direction and you'll come to a fork in the road what is the fork in the road

108
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:07,200
represent the fork represents doubt the sense of I'm not so sure about

109
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:14,680
this is this and this I'm not so sure about it can show up in a number of different ways like is this really going

110
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:20,199
to lead to Greater well-being or do I really understand

111
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:26,600
what the teachings are we're all sitting quiet for 30 minutes but am I doing what everybody else is doing am I supposed to

112
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,959
be doing this so we can have doubt about what we're doing we can have doubt about the

113
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:37,120
practice we can have doubt about the teachings like does this really lead to

114
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,360
where that says we could have doubt about the teacher does Diana really know

115
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:48,720
what she's talking about or we can even say this Buddha person or whatever right so there's so many different ways in

116
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:55,360
which the doubt can show up and I love that is just flat out there doubt is

117
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:02,440
going to arise instead of pretending like okay as long as as you just I don't know believe enough it'll

118
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:09,880
be fine instead doubt is part of the path it's part of the

119
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:15,160
path we are not asking people to just believe and don't have any doubt it's

120
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:25,800
the opposite it's saying doubt is going to arise and we work with doubt by

121
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:32,880
investigating there's a few ways in which we can do this one is to gain some clarity well what is it that I'm really

122
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:39,120
vacillating about what is it that makes me uh hesitate it makes me not quite

123
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:45,079
sure if I really want to do this and even just asking ourselves what

124
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:52,800
is it specifically just that activity of asking ourselves can help bring some clarity like oh I guess I'm just not

125
00:13:52,800 --> 00:14:00,560
sure if I actually can do this it seems kind of hard this whole meditate regularly thing

126
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:06,800
and people talk about Retreats I don't know if I can ever go on a retreat if I want to go on a retreat this type of

127
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:13,480
thing so first is just to investigate what is the doubt about like if you can

128
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,519
is there something that you're insure of and if it's about your own

129
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:23,759
capabilities maybe you can remind yourselves of how you have learned how to do other

130
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:29,199
things drive a car most likely ride a bicycle play an instrument

131
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:35,120
maybe different language all these different things and in the beginning there's always this feeling like I'm not

132
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,880
so sure about it if instead you have specific uh

133
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,720
doubts about the teachings Buddhists say this and in this

134
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,519
tradition they say that another tradition they say that but what's the truth and do I have to believe

135
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:59,720
everything myself myself I'll say you don't have to believe everything I really like to emphasize this tradition

136
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:06,199
emphasizes especially the way that we teach it here is about what you can experience what you can know for

137
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:12,720
yourself it's not about just taking on more views and

138
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,360
beliefs we're not asking you to just swallow everything drink the

139
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:24,360
Kool-Aid and become part of the clan or something like that instead see for

140
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,920
yourself see for yourself but if you are if there is some

141
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:37,639
specific questions ask somebody ask a teacher read a Dharma book listen to

142
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:42,920
Dharma talks ask somebody else that you know you know is there's a way maybe to

143
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:49,800
engage with whatever it is that you have doubt about and the teacher the Buddha gives

144
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:56,959
very clear uh instructions on how to investigate a teacher and even says that you should investigate a

145
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:03,360
teacher should investigate whether they are exhibiting greed hatred or

146
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:10,319
delusion so you're welcome to examine me I'm not a completely awakened person I still have some greed hatred and

147
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:17,550
delusion but you know I'm up here I'm just sharing it with you I'm not diluted that I'm not diluted

148
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:25,600
[Laughter] or but so this fork in the road is about

149
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,720
doubt and doubt often we maybe wouldn't assign the word out to it but often it

150
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,959
shows up with just kind of like this hesitation like I'm not sure

151
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:42,319
maybe I think I um think I had Gil just bringing him into the room uh an earlier

152
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:49,040
teaching that he gave I remember him early this was some many years ago I

153
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:55,680
heard him say yeah well maybe who knows maybe those who are practicing Sufi they do a lot of dancing they're maybe having

154
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,839
more fun so maybe that might be go over there so I just kind of like appreciated

155
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:07,480
this open-handedness right if this if this works for you this is fantastic and you're we're happy that you're here

156
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:14,000
but you don't have to stay of course so walking along the path you come to a

157
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,160
fork and then the instructions were don't go to the left go to the

158
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,798
right so on the left is this was the

159
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:31,880
wrong path and we and then the right is the right

160
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:37,280
path but what does that mean for those of you who are familiar

161
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:44,760
with the eight-fold path they'll be talking about you know right and these eight elements versus wrong and these

162
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:51,400
eight elements but we're using this word right not in a moralistic way but in a

163
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:57,480
way that this is like a the best tool this is the right tool screwdriver is

164
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:03,039
the best tool for for undo screws rather than a hammer for example so write is in

165
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:10,039
correct or most appropriate we could also say wise I'll just briefly say what the

166
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:18,120
eight-fold path is wise view wise intention wise speech

167
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:26,039
wise action wise livelihood wise effort wise mindfulness wise

168
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:33,440
concentration here's the pneumonic that I use [Music]

169
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:40,039
visy view intention speech action livelihood effort mindfulness concentration if you want to remember

170
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:45,280
those eight that's the eight that they are maybe I'll unpack some of them um a

171
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:52,679
little bit in a moment but the interesting thing is I think so so to go down the left would be

172
00:18:52,679 --> 00:19:00,320
to do you know wrong view wrong intention wrong speech Etc

173
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:09,120
but without going into all the details of exactly what they are I think one thing that's interesting to point out

174
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,640
is that the wrong quote unquote just wrong in the sense that it's not going

175
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:23,200
to lead you to Greater peace and happiness and Liberation in a stable way is that it

176
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:31,159
lures us it's not like innocently uh just there to the left but there's a way in

177
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:37,440
which today we have what this new word that I learned recently hyper palatable

178
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:45,280
Foods right we have things that are just designed to be as delicious and as addictive as possible they're purposely

179
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:52,880
designed this didn't exist at the Buddhist time right we have uh advertising agencies their job is to

180
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,400
convince us to do things right this didn't exist back then we have media

181
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:05,280
sources their job is to get us to click and to you know get lost into that or there's other media sources their job is

182
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:11,799
to get us outraged right so they are purposely trying to I would say maybe

183
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:17,760
like lure us you know to this other way so it's not so easy just to go to the

184
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:23,919
right path and part of it is because there isn't like maybe when you first go

185
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:30,360
down this right path there's it's you can't see very far maybe there's you have to do a little bit of chopping away

186
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:36,320
of the plants or the whatever is in the way of the Jungle or something like this

187
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:42,400
it's not like you can see so clearly like oh yeah I just have to go a few steps and everything's going to be

188
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,640
fine but the other way they are luring us with like oh yeah this is going to be

189
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,760
delicious this is going to be fun you're going to feel good so just want to

190
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:58,480
acknowledge that that it's so easy to go down the other way we all do do in

191
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:07,000
different ways and we spend different durations of time down there and if you find that happen no problem just come

192
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,559
back over you don't have to go back to the fork just hop

193
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:18,919
over I love this we start where we are and sometimes where we are is down

194
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:25,200
watching uh YouTube videos on some social thing you know for an hour and

195
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,880
realize oh my gosh you know how did I find myself

196
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,720
here while we're eating potato chips or

197
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:43,600
something so then the um instructions were avoid

198
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:51,440
the left work take the right we walk for a little while and you'll see a dense forest and then you go through a forest

199
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:59,279
so the forest we could say is um ignorance and ignorance is just find as

200
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:05,000
just not knowing just not knowing doesn't mean

201
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:13,240
you're incapable of knowing you just didn't know so this idea of ignorance is often

202
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:20,679
the reason why you know I'm imagining that it's we have to go down the Right

203
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:27,279
Fork we take that fork and or go on the path a little bit the first step in the aold path is

204
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:32,840
View and there's a way in which the Right View maybe I'll say briefly we can

205
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:41,600
understand Right View as um using a framework to view to see our

206
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:47,400
experience and there's two elements to this framework this framework or this frame

207
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:52,679
of reference is actions have

208
00:22:53,320 --> 00:23:00,600
consequences of course we do this is not news to anybody but but it's the thoroughness of

209
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:06,279
this it's that what happens in our minds has consequences what we say has

210
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:13,400
consequences you know how we are in the world has consequences and just to recognize that

211
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:20,360
everything has consequences really starts to highlight the importance of what we are doing with

212
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:25,559
our life and how we're spending our time and then when we start to pay attention

213
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:31,960
to that we start to realize oh you know but I don't actually know what my mind is doing all the

214
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:37,880
time ignorance I don't know you know what I'm saying all the time sometimes

215
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:44,400
things just come out that's one framework with Right View the second

216
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:50,840
is there is a suffering and there's reasons for suffering there's difficulties and reasons for

217
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:56,520
difficulties and there's not difficulties and reasons for not

218
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:03,039
difficulties this is isn't news to anybody either but just kind of as a framework to notice like oh yeah this is

219
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:11,880
one of those difficulties and sometimes it can be helpful to inquire and what is the cause what's underline

220
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,480
this so ignorance when we start to have a little bit of Right View we start to see how much we don't know maybe we

221
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:26,080
don't know what's underneath what's causing the difficulties maybe we don't know how to have less of the

222
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,960
difficulties and to to find a way from them or away from

223
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:39,000
them so this dense forest is ignorance and often we have to pass through this

224
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,559
and some so much of meditation practice is helping us just to learn about

225
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:51,880
ourselves notice what the Mind likes to do I'm often saying that I had no idea I

226
00:24:51,880 --> 00:25:00,559
was such a planner I really didn't know how much I planned until I started meditation practice I was was planning

227
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:08,039
everything so what other things are there to learn with meditation practice we start to do see what is our reactions

228
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:17,200
when we're physically uncomfortable do we turn to like just anger or hatred or pity or you know poor

229
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:25,320
me or you know what do we do what are the patterns of our life they start to show up in our meditation practice so

230
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:31,000
kind of like going through this dense forest is it's part of this way of working through ignorance the other side

231
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,200
just learning about ourselves learning about the world with this

232
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:44,720
practice and then maybe part of the other way to ignorance is just to acknowledge like you know what I don't

233
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,799
know nearly as much as I thought I did about myself maybe just to know that you

234
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:56,120
don't know that alone is such like a big step through this

235
00:25:56,279 --> 00:26:01,840
ignorance and then continu in this simile uh of this path after the forest

236
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:08,720
after you get on the other side of that is this vast marshy

237
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,840
swamp I like this idea of a swamp it's something where you have to tread

238
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:19,880
carefully and you have to like try to find you know firm ground from one

239
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:26,120
little area to the next and maybe take each step with uh care so that you don't

240
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:33,279
fold in with the quicksand or swampy swamp so to like seek out the solid

241
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:42,120
ground at each step so this swamp um represents this

242
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:49,799
seeking Comfort or sensuality things that are always Pleasant to the senses

243
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:54,919
incessantly we are always looking for you know to be as comfortable as

244
00:26:54,919 --> 00:27:02,520
possible there isn't anything wrong with that right we can definitely do that and still stay on um Solid Ground without

245
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:09,600
sinking into the swamp But It's tricky because we can you know slide

246
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,720
right into just pursuing pleasure after pleasure after pleasure and you know the

247
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:20,360
psychologists have been talking about this hedonic treadmill a lot for years

248
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:26,520
they recognize the same thing right then it's just never ending there is no end

249
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:34,200
we keep on thinking there will will be well as soon as I get this as soon as I do that then I'll be

250
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:45,760
happy turns out it doesn't work so well right so this endless pursuit of

251
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:51,960
comfortableness and then maybe I'll say something that uh I heard an interview

252
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:57,640
um I guess just a few days ago I heard a portion of an interview so just a little

253
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:04,600
but with David Goggins he's this Ultra marathoner he like runs like 200 miles

254
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:10,519
or you know something ridiculous like this foral former Navy SEAL and I don't

255
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:18,720
know all these like incredible things that he does and uh he says I don't like

256
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:25,360
it I don't want to do it but I'm doing it anyway and I thought oh this is

257
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,600
interesting you're like what uh helps him to do this and

258
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:36,960
um this interview was with a neuroscientist and the neuroscientist was saying you know they just discovered

259
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:43,559
that there's this area in the brain that um grows when you do things

260
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:48,919
specifically that you don't want to do it doesn't count if you didn't want to

261
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:57,279
do and now you like them then that doesn't count anymore you have to not want to do it and this as this area of

262
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:03,880
the the brain grows there's more ease and happiness I hope I'm remembering this

263
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:09,360
right with ease and happiness I remember thinking like oh I have to remember that for the Dhat talk but uh now here I am

264
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:16,000
at the Dhat talk and I can't remember precisely but this whole idea though and I think all of us know this there's

265
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,640
something that feels good when we're you know we do something that's a little bit

266
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:29,159
difficult you know to apologize

267
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:36,919
to not eat the potato chips or whatever it is these things that make our life

268
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:43,600
better otherwise our life just gets smaller and smaller and smaller like if we're only trying to be comfortable all

269
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,919
the time so the swamp of this pursuing sensual

270
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:55,840
Pleasures absolutely sensual Pleasures are part of life joy and happiness is part of life I don't want to say it has

271
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:01,640
to be austerity and nothing but but difficulty but just watch how we are

272
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:07,360
with h our sensuality we can get lost in there thinking that it finally it will

273
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,880
make it happy but i' I've said this many times here like if it did make you happy

274
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,760
you would not be here on a Monday night right you would be out there doing whatever it is that makes you

275
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:24,559
happy so after the swamp then there was this steep slope like maybe we can even

276
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:30,000
think of like a cliff or something like this and the steep slope stands for

277
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,440
anger and despair it's quite something that the

278
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,600
Buddha is just flat out saying this anger and

279
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:45,960
despair or sometimes it could be dis uh translated as anger and distress some

280
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:53,880
translators use despair but there's this idea that um sometimes we like if we we

281
00:30:53,880 --> 00:31:00,360
get a little bit angry that things aren't the the way that we want them to

282
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:07,919
be this is Dua you know the Buddha has been pointing to this but sometimes there's a way in which we feel like well

283
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:14,760
why not looks like this person has that why can't I or you know whatever it is

284
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:20,559
there's a way in such we can like feel a little bit angry or this despair like oh

285
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:26,159
I'm never going to get better things are going to be different are never going to be

286
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:32,559
different there's this way that um we have

287
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:38,720
this this strong sense of self we might say that wants to be bolstered and

288
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:46,720
protected and Polished so that we're always looking good for other people that we're looking good for

289
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:53,519
ourselves and as long as that's really strong and we're always trying to look good there will be anger and there will

290
00:31:53,519 --> 00:32:02,320
be despair because there isn't a self there isn't this core

291
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:07,399
to which everything happens instead there's just this collection of

292
00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:13,200
experiences sometimes things look great and sometimes they don't that's just how

293
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:20,279
it is so this anger and this despair are part of the path of

294
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:27,760
practice doesn't mean that you're doing anything wrong necessarily sometimes it can be but just part of reason why I

295
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:34,760
really appreciate this is the humanness that the Buddha is bringing into

296
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:43,080
this so at the and then after going through

297
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:50,399
the forest the swamp the steep slope or maybe Cliff then you get to this what uh

298
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:57,320
the Buddha described as this level clear Park so it's just easy right to if it's

299
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:02,919
level you don't have to go up and down the hills and it's a park it's designed to be

300
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:10,200
pleasant and he's describing that is nibana but maybe even if we don't Aspire

301
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:17,799
exactly for nibana maybe it's just a place that where there can be some more ease because of course there are times

302
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:25,159
of more ease too it's not always drudgery through forests and swamps and

303
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:32,200
steepness maybe there's we come to a you know a a landing a

304
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:39,600
plateau get our get our bearings rest for a minute and then maybe we can see oh yeah okay now I think I time to go

305
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:45,720
this direction and then at the end of this uh

306
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:50,840
suta the Buddha says to his cousin Tissa he says

307
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:58,960
Tissa I'm here to advise you to assist you and to teach you

308
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,880
I appreciate this very much the Buddha is saying okay you're not just out there on your own here I'm giving you some

309
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:12,118
directions and we could say that all these sutas are about instructions and directions and this idea of a path shows

310
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:20,599
up in so many different ways and he's saying I'm here to advise you to assist you and to teach you how

311
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:25,760
toine your ways through the forests the swamps and the

312
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:32,800
cliffs so with that I think I'll stop and I'll open it up and see if there's some

313
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,079
questions or

314
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:56,560
comments do you want to um thank you sometimes I question why I

315
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:03,800
meditate meditate however after I meditate I know why it's very simple

316
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:09,680
because I feel better and does that is that work is

317
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:15,119
when you're questioning why you meditate do you are you're still able to meditate

318
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:20,160
even though you're questioning like why am I doing this I don't know but I'm going to do it anyway

319
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:25,800
is it kind of like well kind of like that yeah but it's well worth it yes it

320
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:32,400
even though I have doubts yeah yeah very nice thank you thank you for sharing that okay

321
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:39,720
sure anybody else have a comment or

322
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:45,760
question maybe will it's try over here can you walk right over

323
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:54,599
to thank you this is a comment more than a question just I've been listening to

324
00:35:54,599 --> 00:36:01,200
David goggin's book on audible I haven't gotten to the place where he starts running marathons but I

325
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:07,640
do know he just got into the uh the seals so anyway it's fascinating about

326
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:14,720
the Neuroscience of that yes it is fascinating and it's a interesting R to

327
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:21,079
find that uh and I think we there's a part of us that recognizes when we accomplish something that's hard there's

328
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:27,880
like this uplift like oh yeah I did it okay yeah yeah so I think the those

329
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,680
neuroscientists they're always finding

330
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:38,838
something anybody else have a comment or

331
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:50,200
question Diana I'll um strengthen that comment about goggin

332
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:57,640
I heard the same thing from Jack Lan now most people don't even know who he is

333
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:04,480
but he when they asked him he said I don't really like going to the gym I don't really like going and working out

334
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:12,640
but he did you know and was able to make quite a career of teaching exercise and

335
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:21,440
doing these incredible you know swimming handcuffed towing a a robo behind him

336
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:28,480
didn't you ever he he tow a robo 2,000 lb in it behind him

337
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:36,680
handcuffed from San Francisco to Alcatraz that's amazing yeah wow okay so

338
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:42,079
these amazing individuals okay so they have something in them that yeah nice

339
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:49,160
but I sort of Wonder there must also be some part that

340
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:57,520
knows that there's a reward there yeah you know that that it isn't just

341
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:04,880
I'm G to do this out of just some sort of ego thing yeah

342
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,640
yeah and I think today just because we're like it's the lure of the to not

343
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:15,720
do difficult things is so strong right it's sometimes hard and then the idea of

344
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:22,000
doing something difficult looms so large in our minds like oh I can't do that and

345
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,520
because it's so much easier all I have to do is click this or you know open up the cupboard or I don't know something

346
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:34,280
and I'll have something pleasurable I don't want to do that hard thing I don't have to do that hard thing or

347
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:43,800
something maybe just having a regular meditation practice is the hard thing maybe coming to IMC is a hard

348
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,838
thing anybody else have a

349
00:38:53,119 --> 00:39:01,480
comment okay okay well thank you all and I wish you a safe travels home and

350
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:07,640
may the path home be safe and when you get to the fork of the road turn right

351
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:16,359
