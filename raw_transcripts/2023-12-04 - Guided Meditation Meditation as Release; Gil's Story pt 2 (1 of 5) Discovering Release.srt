00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:07,600
hello everyone and happy to have this time

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,639
together with you and to offer you teachings that are

3
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:19,480
close to my heart and and to share this meditation

4
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:26,039
time one of the ways of

5
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,160
translating the very important word of debana or

6
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:39,280
Nirvana is it translated as release one translator translates it as

7
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:47,120
unbinding and so often Buddhism is associated with letting go but it's sometimes for the English

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,239
speaking audience that doesn't really capture the richness the depth the

9
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:58,920
essence of what this is about and sometimes I think the word

10
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:07,400
release works really well so if we our our hand is in a tight grip we can

11
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:13,479
release our grip we might still hold on to what we're holding but we release the

12
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:20,159
grip or if we are tied up in

13
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:28,200
knots the Buddha talked about the uh untying the knots the releasing of the

14
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,360
knots that bind us or we're covered over something inside

15
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,360
is covered over and so there's an

16
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,560
uncovering there's a lifting of the weight the burden that we

17
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:53,280
carry and then there's a lightning so all these things imply something really nice that happens the release of a grip

18
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,640
there's there's a kind of an ease or relaxation lightning of a burden we feel

19
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:10,319
light lighter untying the knots of the mind and the mind feels released or free or

20
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:17,080
open so the emphasis here is on how we benefit from releasing whatever we're

21
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:25,599
holding on to clinging to so maybe this meditation that can be

22
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:33,480
the emphasis release release whatever you're preoccupied with release

23
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:42,000
whatever you're fixated on or caught in release the preoccupation release the

24
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,080
way in which you're relating to what's happening when the relating

25
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,800
is not free or light or open

26
00:02:52,800 --> 00:03:01,599
allowing step back into that space where there can be release releasing the grip on your

27
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:11,040
thoughts releasing the resistance to what's uncomfortable releasing the hesitation

28
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:18,799
to be honest with what's happening release the attempt to get

29
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:23,879
away release the drive to acquire

30
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:30,239
and attain make something happen just release release

31
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,000
so assuming a meditation

32
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:42,319
posture and lowering the

33
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:47,519
Gaze and maybe closing your

34
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:57,760
eyes and begin with an effort to

35
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:06,200
Gentle the gentling of yourself within a gentle

36
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:14,000
calming a calm gentling of the

37
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,120
heart relaxing as you

38
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,600
exhale

39
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:44,199
letting your attention roam around your body relaxing the body as you

40
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,560
exhale

41
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:31,840
on the exhale relaxing the thinking mind softening the

42
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,520
Mind softening the edges of the

43
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,479
Mind

44
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
e

45
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:01,840
and then centering yourself on the

46
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:18,520
breathing letting the physical sensations of breathing be an

47
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:28,280
invitation to feel your body more fully to feel how your body experiences

48
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
breathing

49
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
for

50
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:15,360
tuning into the rhythm of the body breathing in

51
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,039
and out the rhythm of the Torso expanding

52
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,319
and

53
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
Contracting

54
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
for

55
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:19,760
and then gently without a lot of effort a gentle

56
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:27,279
effort as you inhale let there be a

57
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:35,320
release release of your thoughts your

58
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,360
tensions the grip in the mind in the

59
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:49,040
heart not a full release but just a gentle

60
00:09:53,640 --> 00:10:00,480
opening maybe as the Torso expands with the

61
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,040
inhale things are allowed to release

62
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,480
outwards float away open

63
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
up

64
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,639
and then a gentle release on the exhale as

65
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:47,800
well release of the DI from the

66
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:03,160
Torso a releasing of things the mind thoughts feelings the grip the holding

67
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:09,480
the resistance any ways that you can let things on the

68
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:16,000
exhale just wash off slide off

69
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
relax

70
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:07,279
and letting there be a rhythm of release on the

71
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,399
inhale release on the

72
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:21,079
exhale maybe slightly different movements of release with each

73
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:31,880
one not being ambitious just loosening the edge es

74
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:37,959
softening incremental movements of releasing where there's tension or

75
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:44,680
contraction holding

76
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,040
preoccupation congestion in the

77
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
mind

78
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
for

79
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
for

80
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
for

81
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
e

82
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
for

83
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
e

84
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,519
for

85
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
for

86
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400

e

89
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
for

90
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
for

91
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
for

92
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
for

93
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
e

94
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
e

95
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:03,200
for in these few minutes we have

96
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:11,799
release even what you don't want to let go of for the at least for these few

97
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:17,840
minutes release with every

98
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
breath

99
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
for

100
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
for

101
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880

102
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
e

103
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
e

104
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:55,720
and then as we come to the end of this

105
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:01,799
sitting there is a

106
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:08,000
release that allows a more open

107
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:15,398
Attunement receptivity presence for other

108
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:23,480
people release of being guarded or holding on to

109
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:29,600
resentments or fears

110
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:37,159
and at least for these couple of minutes during this meditation in the quiet and

111
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:45,679
peace sitting here to release whatever blocks your

112
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:51,480
heart so you can gaze upon the world with Good

113
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,679
Will so that you can make a connection between your

114
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,399
meditation and wishing others

115
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:15,720
well between the ways in which you let go relax open up in

116
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:22,080
meditation and how it makes you a better person to relate to

117
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:28,880
others and in that better way

118
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:35,600
to give expression to your good will with the following

119
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:45,320

you

129
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:59,480
so hello and welcome to this Monday day when we begin

130
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:05,960
another 5 days of talks and uh I thought I would finish my

131
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:11,559
life story around in relationship to Buddhism last

132
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:17,720
week I kind of thought that was plenty of time but um there's still some more

133
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:23,760
to talk about so we ended up on Friday with um

134
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:29,000
my decision to go to Burma to follow up with my first

135
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:37,320
experiences with vipasana in Thailand and that it took a while to get the visa Burma had been they didn't know

136
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:43,399
this but was closed to any foreign or at least Western

137
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:50,279
travel and um until about maybe June or so and I was able to get

138
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:57,600
there in September I was there for eight months at a meditation Monastery and in those

139
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:06,000
eight months uh was the headquarters of what's called The mahasi Meditation movement it was probably the biggest

140
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,159
uh you know terad Buddhist Meditation movement of the last

141
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:16,960
century monk named mahasi saow kind of formulated a way of teach of practicing

142
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:22,080
vipasana that was very effective for many people and it spread very quickly

143
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:28,559
there's when I was there there were maybe 300 centers of this practice in in in

144
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:35,159
Myanmar and had spread to first to Sri Lanka and then to Thailand and then uh

145
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:40,480
uh it came to United States and one of the kind of initial people who really

146
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:47,360
got it established here was Joseph Goldstein and Jack cornfield and Sharon sburg and Jacqueline Schwarz they came

147
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,799
and had come out of that scene and in Asia and came and started teaching it

148
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:59,360
here so I went to the headquarters the source of it all and there was was a very large Monastery kind of like a

149
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:04,679
community college campus with some 5,000 people meditating there at a given time

150
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:10,039
spread around the complex and um and it was to do

151
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:17,000
intensive meditation we were supposed to get something like 4 hours a night of sleep at night and uh otherwise uh

152
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,120
practicing throughout the day two meals a day breakfast and lunch and then um

153
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:29,120
most days there was a meeting with the Abbott for about 10 minutes and most days he gave a Dharma talk around 4:00

154
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:35,679
in the afternoon and um in otherwise uh I

155
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:40,880
practiced mostly during the E months in a my small smallish room it was small

156
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:48,600
enough it was big enough to have two beds in it and I had one that I slept in and meditate on on and um often did The

157
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:56,480
Walking meditation in the room sometimes outside in the hallway and um and it was uh some I

158
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,799
would say one of of the most wonderful times of my life uh I had a lot of joy

159
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:08,679
and happiness and just Delight to be doing the practice um and I came there out of my

160
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:17,799
zen practice having you know I was still a Zen priest and I um had this idea that I was

161
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:24,240
going to continue with my zen practice which I defined to myself as an unconditional acceptance of the present

162
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,960
moment and um and but I was going to learn to do it better and that I was

163
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:35,799
going to follow the instructions of meditation teacher upand say and in

164
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:42,000
order to do that unconditional acceptance because what I had learned from doing Vasa practice is that my

165
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,200
unconditional acceptance of the present moment that I learned to do in Zen had

166
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:54,000
was very U meaningful for me very helpful for me and and I'd learned to be pretty settled

167
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,240
and calm and peaceful and um and and resilient in my

168
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:04,519
life but uh it was only kind of in the macro moments in the larger picture of

169
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:11,839
scale of things and what I learned through vasna is in the micro moments the small you know in between everything

170
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:19,679
or underneath in a deeper layer there was a lot of non-acceptance going on a lot of wanting resisting not wanting

171
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:26,398
judging critic criticalness it was very much more deeper and so the kind of the surface kind of issues of my life had

172
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:31,599
kind of been settled in a very important way but there were still deeper Roots

173
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:38,599
deeper um activation there that um I wasn't often aware of but in the aposta

174
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:45,839
practice and they more careful momentto moment attention um and the deeper concentration I could see was still

175
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:53,240
operating and so I was going to follow the instructions very carefully and uh in order to do this

176
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:58,280
unconditional acceptance this was extremely important for for me because

177
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:03,839
uh the teacher who uh upand he was very uh he was like a little bit of a general

178
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:08,960
he's kind of like a uh you know if uh um

179
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:14,160
you know he was going like um he wanted us to strive he wanted us to try hard

180
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:19,560
try harder try harder stay up all night it was always kind of pushing us to

181
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:25,800
strive and um it was some westerners under his tutelage they crashed it was

182
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:31,640
uh really difficult for some people who somehow their Western psychology didn't

183
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:38,240
match very well the striving effort that he he was often pushing for but I didn't

184
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,520
buy into it I had this resiliency and this acceptance that I had from Zen that

185
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:52,240
I did together with uh the careful attention that he wanted us to have and so um and so it worked for me

186
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:58,440
fairly well uh in the beginning first two months I was there I did kind of uh

187
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:04,200
try you know put in more effort than I usually would in Zen it was a little bit maybe in order to kind of because of

188
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:10,359
upand was so demanding you kind of okay I'm going to really try to practice here and we had

189
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:16,400
to uh run an account every day we saw him of how much sitting meditation and

190
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:24,880
walking meditation we had done in the last 24 hours we had to kind of sum it all up and um and he would hear we had

191
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:31,079
to be honest right so we had to hear how much we were practicing alone in our rooms and if it wasn't enough his

192
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:38,079
eyebrow would go up and here having this kind of fierce General's eyebrow goes up was enough to like we don't want to do

193
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:45,560
that again and so I would sit and walk much of the day much as I could and um I

194
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:52,720
would never do laundry uh on the um uh on the days I was going to see him uh

195
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:58,440
once a week we had a day off from seeing him and that was the day that I would would do my laundry and do a few other

196
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:04,520
kind of cleaning things so that because I didn't want to report less time for

197
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:11,839
meditation so I practiced along and I was happy to practice but then this amazing wonderful thing happened is that

198
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:19,599
he left for Australia for two months to teach a retreat there and as soon as he left I was poised in a nice way I think

199
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:26,800
it wasn't it wasn't conscious of this that something in me relaxed and when uh and that I had the

200
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,880
momentum and then I relax and let go and settle into a much deeper place of

201
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:37,079
well-being of peace that you know that was really wonderful and that became

202
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:43,240
then the entry point for me to go deeper into Vasan and I had uh experiences of

203
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:51,880
release and freedom that i' never had before in my life that were life-changing for me and uh teaching me

204
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:57,640
how deeply release can be I had a sense of peace I a sense of the value of

205
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:04,000
Letting Go I had a sense of clarity and a lot of things before from practice but

206
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:10,040
um uh it felt like I reached kind of the the deepest possibility of that in my

207
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:16,960
experiences there under that those eight months of practicing there and um and it

208
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:22,480
was uh I didn't realize it at the time um but that uh over time I came to

209
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:28,920
realize that this was life-changing um at some point I decided

210
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:35,200
to continue doing the practice by uh going to um uh I wanted to now tell

211
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:43,160
really teach uh practiced with Western teachers who I could really make sure that I had good um communication with

212
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:50,240
rather than through a translator and also I found that uh we didn't eat anything afternoon and I found that um

213
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:56,240
it didn't quite work for me that I would better if I could have just a little bit of a snack in the late afternoon or

214
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:02,119
early evening to sustain me you I was very thin I was I think I weighed 140

215
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:09,839
lbs and so I had no reserves to manage to get through the the evening so I came

216
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:17,200
back to America and um and I was going to go to IMS Insight Meditation

217
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:24,359
Society but um uh something um told me so at some point I felt too

218
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:31,280
weary uh to go I have was signed up to go but I felt to something inside of me some deep weariness that was not I

219
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:36,359
didn't identify what it was but I said no I'm not ready to go and so by then I

220
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:42,440
was back at the San Francisco Zen Center and I was asked to uh take a kind of leadership position there in the

221
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:48,119
meditation Hall got the meditation hall manager um for the year so since I

222
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:54,520
wasn't going to IMS and I had nothing else to do I was actually you know I was a Zen priest and you know I had no other

223
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:59,800
life plans so I was I felt very lucky to be able to spend another year back at Zen

224
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:07,000
Center practicing there and that was a nice integration practice for me from this intensity of being so full on in

225
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,119
Burma to uh then being a community and in a monastery

226
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:17,760
and and then during that time uh there was a man who had been at Burma with me

227
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:23,240
he was a monk had been a monk and um and he came to see me at

228
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:28,280
Green Gulch and uh in the conversation with with him I reviewed and talked

229
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:35,359
about what had happened to me in Burma I realized that um uh the way I practiced

230
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:42,640
I had overemphasized concentration and that I didn't realize that and uhand tried to tell me that but

231
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:49,000
I the way he told me I couldn't understand couldn't understand what to do with it and so the amazing thing

232
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:55,839
happened when my friend when I realized this and talking to my friend uh immediately that weariness evaporated

233
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:01,079
and immedi immediately I said okay now I'm ready to go to to continue at IMs

234
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:06,680
and so then I went um in the fall

235
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:15,480
of 1987 I went to do a three-month retweeted IMS with uh studying with

236
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:22,800
Sharon salsburg and Joseph Goldstein and um and to continue their

237
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:28,160
practice and um and that was also quite wonderful for me to do it had different

238
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:33,960
challenges than I had before but it was really wonderful and um and in the process of

239
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:41,280
doing that um I had a similar kind of deep releases I had in Burma that

240
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,880
clarified for me uh kind of an understanding of this possibility of of

241
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:53,800
uh what the work was about oh now I felt like now I understand that um that oh

242
00:41:53,800 --> 00:42:01,960
this is the practice at the essence of it is this deep release uh of uh all holding all

243
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:07,560
clinging but what I learned at IMs which I um which I hadn't learned before in

244
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:15,040
theas was I learned about Goodwill I learned about meta when the teachers there they didn't

245
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:23,280
do this in Asia but the teachers in America included guided meta meditation as part of their the three-month Retreat

246
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:29,720
and um as a Zen student it was that was too art official or too sweet or too not

247
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:36,000
authentic to do this kind of phrases and stuff about meta so I I tuned out the

248
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,359
teachers when they did the guided meditation until in this deep deeper

249
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:46,520
releases that I was having in practice meta arose and then I said oh that's

250
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:51,680
what they're talking about and then I had something as a foundation for

251
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:57,920
practice of meta and living from that meta full place well I did Zen practice

252
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:05,440
I was compassion doing Vasa I was metad I was good

253
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:11,640
willed I don't know if these two different movements were inherent with the practice that I was doing or whether

254
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:16,760
it was really the phases of my life because Z I really was contending with a

255
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:23,680
lot of my suffering um a lot of the conventional suffering of my life and in um in in

256
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:29,880
doing bipasa um there was not much suffering uh there was a lot of physical

257
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:36,359
pain at times when I was at IMs but not a lot of suffering and then I

258
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:41,480
um I um um and but there was a lot of

259
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:48,280
Joy a lot of happiness and it was was kind of being softened and softened and

260
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:53,480
softened in a very different way that I had been in Zen or during that Zen time

261
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:58,960
and in that there awoke in me this meta and kindness and

262
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:04,200
friendliness and then became the kind of the orientation around my practice

263
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:12,160
leaving IMS was very much had to do with um um this release this deep

264
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:17,839
freedom and this meta this warmth that came out of it and uh that seems like a

265
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:25,280
good place to leave off um and because then I came back to uh California to Zen

266
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:31,520
Center and uh wondering what to do next I'd spend that time I'd spent almost 10

267
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:39,400
years in monastic almost monastic life and uh wondering what to do next

268
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:45,319
and that will be where I pick up tomorrow thank

269
00:44:45,319 --> 00:44:48,319
you
