1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,379
so uh a little announcement to begin with is that I uh really

2
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:14,219
um value your feedback as participants and

3
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:20,779
um I'd be very interested since we're all in this together

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,039
um if you could especially give me suggestions for improvement

5
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:32,520
so thank you very much for that in advance and I can't read the chat while I'm

6
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:40,680
teaching but I'll hopefully download it afterwards and and we'll read it then so thank you

7
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,379
very much I appreciate it so

8
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:52,500
um this week we're exploring how we might

9
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:58,579
train and emptiness as a way of countering our instinctive

10
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:05,220
habitual and reactive reoccupation with the self

11
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:13,219
which is often expressed as you know in discursive thinking

12
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:21,000
so when we meditate we can allow ourselves to drop down into the flow of

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,100
our lived experience rather than reifying it into self-referential

14
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,860
thinking so for these minutes of meditation

15
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:41,100
the invitation I propose to you is to keep in mind

16
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:50,060
that we are as Vera bonellio says dropping the burden of the ego

17
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,140
so take your meditation posture

18
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,479
create a feeling of being grounded and settled

19
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:12,720
and then balancing that with being quietly energetic

20
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,340
especially in the spine

21
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:25,220
what was in the eyes that's comfortable for you

22
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm taking a deep breath and connecting with the flow of breathing

23
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:51,239
they're being friends with our body and we'll Begin by offering it meta

24
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:57,200
as we do a brief fluid scan

25
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:05,280
so we bring kindness and appreciation to this body

26
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,519
from the head down through the neck your shoulders

27
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:19,080
the arms and hands meta

28
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:25,200
in the Torso going down into the pelvis

29
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,700
and into the legs and the feet

30
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:45,840
still in touch with the flow of the breathing and breathing out

31
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,900
we light a little candle of meta in the heart

32
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:57,780
letting it warm and reassure this body and mind

33
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,860
just as we are

34
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:26,160
and now dissolving the edges of our hearts and body

35
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:33,840
we radiate arnetta unconditional friendliness

36
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,220
through all of the participants who are meditating with us here

37
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,879
May everyone in this sun go be well

38
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:55,919
letting our Metal Flow out to each and every one of the people who are here

39
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,139
today meditating together

40
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:17,100
when letting go of the words and radiating just the feeling of meta to

41
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,400
everyone

42
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:32,699
benevolence as we connect with the physical process

43
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,199
of this body breathing

44
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:47,000
dropping the burden of fabricating thoughts

45
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,320
robbing the burden of the ego

46
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:18,020
we know that it's enough just to be here

47
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:26,060
present with his beautiful sound gun breathing

48
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:32,120
no need to indulge the ego in thinking

49
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,620
and so we offer our presence to each other

50
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,720
and feeling the support knowing that we're all breathing

51
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,020
together

52
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:43,380
dropping the burden of the ego we can luxuriate

53
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:50,460
in the wholesome feeling of being present present with the breathing

54
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:54,800
and present with one another

55
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:02,760
the body and mind imbued with a sense of meta

56
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:11,180
benevolence as we stay with our lived experience

57
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:20,220
breathing together in the warm companionship

58
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,079
of our fellow practitioners

59
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:50,820
and if the ego pushes its way into our consciousness

60
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:59,720
by fabricating thoughts we see it and we say no thank you

61
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,259
we know we don't need to invest in thinking now

62
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:16,980
it's not nearly as beautiful as being here breathing

63
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,420
with this song God

64
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:48,320
thrilling in the flow of our lived experience

65
00:19:51,740 --> 00:20:00,440
empty of Fabrications empty of proliferations

66
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:10,340
just the goodness of being here

67
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:17,039
with our most important Ally

68
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:22,640
mindfulness awareness

69
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:33,500
awareness imbued with mitta

70
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:43,039
experiencing the flow of phenomena

71
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:56,100
not adding any self-reference

72
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:40,760
to bring this collaborative meditation through clothes

73
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:48,299
we each open our hearts and reopen the boundaries

74
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:51,500
of our son God

75
00:26:53,760 --> 00:27:01,460
to include well-wishing for all beings everywhere

76
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:09,860
may all beings be safe and protected

77
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:19,320
being safe may we all be contented

78
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,278
at ease

79
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:30,740
may all beings abide in peace

80
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:38,840
and may all beings everywhere be free

81
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:47,419
I do honor your practice and your sincerity

82
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:53,658
and I feel a great gratitude for this practice

83
00:27:54,299 --> 00:28:00,720
yesterday uh participant commented that it was a nice moment

84
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:09,320
when we all bow in unison around the world at the completion of the meditation

85
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:18,440
so throughout this meditation let's join our hands together

86
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,940
and bow through each other

87
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:33,900
thank you greetings everyone good to be here with

88
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,080
you

89
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:45,480
um give again a short announcement that I made at the beginning of the meditation

90
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:51,059
which is that I really value your feedback

91
00:28:51,059 --> 00:29:00,019
in the chat and uh since we're all in this together

92
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:09,080
I your suggestions for improvement would be especially welcome

93
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:16,020
and um we'll have a q a session on Friday

94
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,100
after the talk

95
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:26,760
so this week we're exploring how we might

96
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:33,600
train and emptiness as a way of countering our instinctive

97
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:41,179
habitual and reactive reoccupation with the self

98
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:46,278
offer expressed as discursive thinking

99
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:54,260
what is emptiness in the early Buddhist texts

100
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:02,120
emptiness is not that we don't exist or that we're not important

101
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:08,059
it only means that living beings do not have

102
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:13,639
substantial and permanent selves

103
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:21,720
and especially in meditation when the Mind slows down enough we can see

104
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,520
that everything is in flux

105
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:34,679
and since we're constantly changing in reality there is nothing that we can

106
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:38,778
identify as a self

107
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:48,240
so today I'd like to uh share with you um the teachings of a very important

108
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:56,580
discourse the shorter discourse on emptiness

109
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:01,740
121 and

110
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:07,919
um I'll read to you um parts of it at the beginning from my own

111
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:14,820
translation and of course I've used all the translations of all the great

112
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:22,080
um Scholars especially the monastic Scholars um and

113
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,720
I I did this as part of a course in poly that I took this past year

114
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:34,020
and my interest was to go into each poly word and study the etymology and The

115
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:42,120
Roots behind where the word came from and to choose uh renderings that best

116
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:50,460
Express this and also um as a lay practitioner I have a different

117
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:58,620
point of view than um monastics do especially male dynastics

118
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:05,640
so it's a beautiful discourse and um

119
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:10,980
it begins that the scene is set at 70 in

120
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:16,559
the palace or the Hall of megaro's mother

121
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:24,539
so this is where it's it's like a building with pillars and this is where the Buddha and his monastic song are

122
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:27,379
were meditating

123
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:38,640
then what it was evening the venerable Amanda Rose for meditation

124
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:44,640
went to the blessed one and after paying homage to him he sat

125
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:51,120
down at one side and said the blessed one

126
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:57,960
better will serve on one occasion the blessed one was living in the second country

127
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:04,320
where there's a town of the stockings named nagaraka

128
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:10,200
their venerable sir I learned from the Blessed one's own lips

129
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:15,539
you know he's quoting what the Buddha had said to him at that time

130
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:23,000
now Ananda I often abide in emptiness

131
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:30,240
and then Ananda goes on to say did I hear that correctly vulnerable sir

132
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,760
do I learned that correctly attend to that correctly remember that

133
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:43,019
correctly so you can you can sort of picture Ananda really wondering what the heck is

134
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:49,140
talking about uh abiding in emptiness

135
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:56,220
so uh the Buddha replies now Ananda

136
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:00,679
I often abide in emptiness

137
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:16,500
and um he said you did certainly

138
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:23,358
uh you heard that correct they learned that correctly attended to that correctly

139
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:30,118
remembered that correctly Aranda just as this Hall where we are is

140
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:35,720
empty of elephants cattle and horses

141
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:43,560
and there is present only this non-emptiness namely the Oneness of the

142
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:47,040
sun gun monistics

143
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:54,599
so here the Buddha is um this is the just the beginning of of

144
00:34:54,599 --> 00:35:01,099
this discourse but the point he's making here is that um

145
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:11,420
what's in important is to know what uh things are empty of

146
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:17,640
um to know not just what's present but what's absent so he used the example of

147
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:26,280
all these monks sitting in this fall meditating in the evening and saying so we we can know that there

148
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:33,020
aren't elephants and cattle and horses and other animals here

149
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:40,980
but what we do know is here is the song God and so in that situation

150
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:46,578
the Sangha is the non-emptiness the presence

151
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:55,500
and so um in the early text there's uh the use

152
00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:00,660
of the word emptiness as a noun is quite rare um

153
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:06,119
most of the time it's when the Buddha or someone is talking about

154
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:10,099
what something is empty of

155
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,680
and um what we're supposed to understand as

156
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:26,040
practitioners is that whatever is present in our experience is empty of a self

157
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:32,880
and what belongs to a self empty of what is Everlasting

158
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:41,040
or unchanging so you may have heard other teachers

159
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:46,500
talk about the Bahia sutta it's a very famous One

160
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:52,440
and um in that certain the Buddha instructs

161
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:58,980
Bahia with a really beautiful kernel of what

162
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:06,780
we're supposed to do as practitioners and the Buddha says in the scene there

163
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:12,660
should just be the scene in the herd there should just be the

164
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:18,780
herd in the sense just what is sensed

165
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:24,319
and in the cognized just what is cognized

166
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:32,760
so we stay present with whatever sensory information we're getting from the the

167
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:38,900
six senses and we know that

168
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:44,940
and we see um especially if we can slow the Mind down

169
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:52,140
and take a break from proliferations that everything is in flux and is

170
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:57,960
changing so fast that uh there really is nothing that we could

171
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:03,960
pinpoint and say okay now this right here right now is is what the what

172
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:11,280
this elephants so our job is to

173
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:19,260
um be able to stay present and emptying ourself of our

174
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:24,619
proliferations of all that mental chatter

175
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:32,180
um elsewhere the Buddha instructs

176
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:37,920
do not think of the past and do not long for the future

177
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:43,140
in the present moment want you to tend with mindfulness

178
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:49,560
for the lack of stability of whatever phenomenon there are

179
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:54,560
the whys awaken in this way

180
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:01,800
so this is what we were exploring yesterday

181
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:08,160
is by paying attention to um

182
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:13,440
the fluidity of our experience and letting the mind

183
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:20,280
uh quiet down we're able to see things as they really

184
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:27,800
are and it's there is no way that we can pinpoint anything that would be

185
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:33,240
substantial or permanent Everlasting

186
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,880
so um

187
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:46,500
mindfulness is really the uh the most

188
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:55,440
important tool in our arsenal of tools to walking the path to Freedom

189
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:01,579
because this is where we this is is by placing our awareness where we place our awareness

190
00:40:01,579 --> 00:40:06,660
is um determines

191
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:13,980
um which way we evolve if we place our awareness

192
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:19,579
in Me Myself and mind and

193
00:40:19,579 --> 00:40:27,060
proliferations of self-referential thinking or fantasizing about the past or

194
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:33,960
recriminating about the future or having pretend to conversations

195
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:39,240
um we're missing

196
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:45,420
the wholesome path which is when we we see that

197
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:53,180
in attending to our experience with an open and quiet mind

198
00:40:55,079 --> 00:41:01,560
we don't need to keep carrying the burden of the ego

199
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:06,619
we can choose peace

200
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:15,599
and um the Buddha's instructions

201
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:22,560
um for mindfulness of breathing he tells us that

202
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:27,720
the first thing we should do is to go to some place empty

203
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:33,480
so the value of seclusion is uh temporarily

204
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:39,380
um taking a break from worldly concerns

205
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:46,440
and cultivating mental seclusion as well

206
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:52,400
by emptying the mind of all our concerns and worries

207
00:41:53,579 --> 00:42:00,599
and when we do that we can taste the Pure Clean Water of The Quiet Mind

208
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:07,560
and this gives us a feeling of ease even a subtle sense of Joy when we

209
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:12,660
inhabit if only for a short time

210
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:18,320
a mind empty of proliferations

211
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:26,160
the joy of being alive or that's the overlay of Me Myself and

212
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:33,920
mine and it feels so awesome

213
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:41,579
and it's also such a relief when we drop the burden of the ego

214
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:47,599
nothing to prove we don't have to be anybody

215
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:52,820
we don't have to go anywhere

216
00:42:54,359 --> 00:43:01,400
amazing you don't have to prove anything or be anybody what Freedom that is

217
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:10,700
so please enjoy these moments when you don't have to be anybody at all

218
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:18,859
and also be patient with your tendency to proliferation

219
00:43:19,319 --> 00:43:26,220
and no that the lovely Taste of emptiness is

220
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:30,920
indeed possible for each one of us

221
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:39,859
thank you for your attention thank you for your practice
