1
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,760
so hello everyone and

2
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,560
nice to be together with you all this way and um

3
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:36,719
so one of the wonderful supports for mindfulness

4
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,840
meditation when it is available is

5
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,760
metta is loving kindness or good will

6
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,800
and when it's available it makes it a lot easier to be present for

7
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,000
whatever is here it's it means we're more comfortable being present

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,920
more comfortable with ourselves if we have meta if we have kindness love as we sit and whatever

9
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,720
arises in meditation whatever happens in meditation occurs then within the atmosphere within

10
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,119
the context of some good will good will for ourselves good will to what's happening

11
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:27,759
sometimes the inner experiences can be difficult and to meet them with good will with

12
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,920
kindness with friendliness makes a world of difference rather than

13
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,840
meeting with them with with aversion or fear or um

14
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,799
you know it's intense desire for something else metta makes a kind of a relaxed state

15
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:54,000
for it hold everything and so what allows us to sit with metta with

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,439
loving-kindness being calm helps and being gentle

17
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:09,119
and these two things gentleness and calm the opposite of them don't whatever the

18
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,239
opposite are is and maybe there's a range of things they don't make room

19
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,360
for this quiet thing this little shy thing called love or kindness

20
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,480
friendliness to exist it gets crowded out

21
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,239
and so one of the whereas mehta supports mindfulness

22
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,680
mindfulness supports meta when it helps us to calm down

23
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,680
when it helps us to shift from being so the opposite of gentle to something like

24
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,319
being gentle the opposite of being harsh is maybe

25
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:55,440
being gentle the opposite of being hostile is to be gentle the opposite of being a poking and and

26
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,599
attacking our experience and wanting it to go away is not necessarily to want it to be

27
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:08,319
there at all but to be gentle gentle with what is so perhaps for this

28
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:16,840
meditation maybe we can sit with um with an orientation towards calmness and

29
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:24,239
gentleness and a a kind of a

30
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:31,040
orientation a kind of reference of that even if you don't feel that it's

31
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,640
difficult to feel calm difficult to feel gentle maybe there's something inside of you

32
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:43,280
maybe deep down or in the corners of your heart your mind that knows little bit what those things

33
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:50,239
are and just knowing them is a lifeline to not getting swept away in their

34
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:58,319
opposites so assuming a meditation posture

35
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:06,239
that is supportive for you in being alert

36
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:15,840
but also a posture that will help you to be somewhat calm and gentle

37
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:23,440
but not collapsing and relaxing too much sinking into a couch and

38
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,040
but somehow a posture of that allows you to hold some alertness

39
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,240
together with calm

40
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,840
together with being gentle

41
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:52,320
and then gently calmly taking a few long slow deep

42
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,840
in-breaths

43
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:08,840
breathing in and breathing out and as you exhale a few long slow

44
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,600
exhales letting go

45
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:22,840
releasing the body relaxing as deep into the body as you

46
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,840
can

47
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,880
and then letting your breathing return to normal

48
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:53,840
and being easy with your breathing

49
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:01,919
being easy with how things are right now at ease

50
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:10,639
even if things are difficult breathing with that easily calmly

51
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:16,960
and part of common meditation is as if you have all the time in the world

52
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,280
to offer attention to our experience

53
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:32,000
to get to know it as if you're calmly listening to a troubled friend

54
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,599
and you sit there as if you have all the time in the world to hear hear them out

55
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,280
and to be gentle is not to intrude or push yourself force yourself assert

56
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:58,880
yourself in on what's happening but to allow your inner life to allow

57
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:05,919
your body space to show itself to be itself

58
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,639
here and now

59
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,840
softening the belly

60
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:55,120
and calmly settling into your body breathing

61
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,840
calmly

62
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:10,840
orienting yourself to experience the in-breaths and the

63
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,039
out-breaths in the body

64
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:26,879
with the exhale allowing yourself to become calm

65
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,759
slowly a little calmer more relaxed

66
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,479
calming the thinking mind as you exhale

67
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,800
in small incremental steps

68
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:55,839
if you're inclined you can very calmly say the word calm as you exhale

69
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,839
and see if there can be a gentleness in how you receive the inhale

70
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,839
breathing in and breathing out

71
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:46,080
calm and gentle in a way that supports you to be present

72
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,839
for what is

73
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,639
one thing that supports calmness

74
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:51,839
is recognizing the calm that's here

75
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,960
[Music]

76
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,190
[Music]

77
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:52,320
recognizing gentleness that's here

78
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,639
supports the growth of gentle

79
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:07,840
settling into the present moment

80
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,880
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

81
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:14,720
perhaps you can recognize whatever way that you are more settled

82
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:25,039
calmer than you were at the beginning maybe even gentler

83
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,799
and in being calmer or gentler more settled

84
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:39,760
does it give more room inside for for your heart

85
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:49,520
for your warm-heartedness or kind-heartedness

86
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,559
or a simple maybe very ordinary

87
00:27:54,559 --> 00:28:02,080
caring caringness

88
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:10,080
kindness and love and maybe not carrying that love or

89
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:17,279
kindness with you into the world so much as carrying the calmness

90
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:22,960
and gentleness that has room for the heart

91
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:31,840
room for heart qualities

92
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:53,200
and then as we come to the end of the sitting perhaps you can open up this

93
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:59,520
calm gentle space kind-heartedness

94
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:06,720
to the people in your life neighbors and friends and family and

95
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:15,200
members of your community people that you might learn about

96
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:22,320
through media and dedicate

97
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:30,240
the benefit and merit of this sitting here for the welfare and happiness of others

98
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:38,840
the kind of welfare and happiness that might allow them to go into the world

99
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:46,240
warm-heartedly may all beings

100
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:52,398
be happy and peaceful safe and free

101
00:29:53,120 --> 00:30:01,600
so that their best qualities of heart may be shared with others

102
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:09,840
maybe may we all share the goodness of our hearts with each other

103
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,919
you

104
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,840
um

105
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:04,158
so so for this week i'd like to

106
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:11,840
focus on meta loving kindness but in a particular way

107
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:19,840
on friday i heard my friend paul heller who spoke here a few weeks ago for the 7 a.m for a week he gave a wonderful

108
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:25,120
talk where he divided up the discourse on loving-kindness into four parts

109
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:30,240
it was very nice to hear him and i was inspired by this four part division

110
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:39,120
and so i thought i would do that for this week is to um take a look at the

111
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:46,080
the the kind of the fun foundational teachings attributed to the

112
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:54,480
buddha on loving kindness that's a particular uh poem that

113
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:01,919
that then it can be divided into four parts that's kind of the poem uh on loving kindness and

114
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:07,039
um and if you want to uh read my translation which is what i'll

115
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:14,480
use um you'll find it in the what's new uh in the home page of imc's website

116
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,919
under reflections from gil you also find it um the part we're going

117
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,960
to talk about today in uh in a little description of

118
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,480
the on youtube description on the on the of what's happening here in the

119
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:37,840
underneath the photograph underneath the video if you do show more uh i put this section that we're going to talk about

120
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:45,600
but please don't read it now and get distracted we'll go through it and that paul's talk

121
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:51,039
is not recorded so for for public use

122
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:56,158
so um um

123
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,440
so we find in the ancient teachings of the buddha

124
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:10,638
that loving-kindness gets emphasized a lot of the four brahmaviharas the four kinds of love that

125
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:19,040
were championed in the ancient world lovingkindness gets the most most attention and it encompasses

126
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:25,760
quite quite a bit uh but encompasses uh the desire to be friendly and all the

127
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,919
good qualities of uh that comes flows out of friendliness helping people when they're in trouble

128
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:39,520
our friends in trouble supporting people when things are going well caring for them

129
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:47,358
being kind but the fundamental way of seeing it is a good will what comes out of our good will and

130
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:52,720
the good will is a nice translation some because the opposite of

131
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:59,440
loving kindness is sometimes seen to be ill will and a certain kind of hostility towards

132
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,960
others and so in this discourse on

133
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,640
loving-kindness it's divided into four parts or can be divided into four parts

134
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:17,920
and the first part is not really about loving-kindness itself but can be seen as the the uh

135
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:25,119
the support for it the way of being in the world and being with ourselves that uh makes

136
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:32,480
room for makes uh the ability to have good will grow in us and develop and some people

137
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:38,720
will refer to this section as being ethical kind of

138
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:46,079
kind of kind of an uh ethical teaching but so

139
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:53,359
many of what's talked about is not ethical in the sense of how we relate to other people but how we are in ourselves

140
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:59,520
and um so maybe the word integrity has integrity and ethics sometimes are

141
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:05,200
considered near synonyms of each other and so maybe this is a qualities of

142
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:12,480
integrity that this involves i like to think of it as different things that makes room for the

143
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:18,079
heart qualities to come and if we want to have more metta more

144
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:23,680
kindness in our life more friendliness then it's not just a matter of of kind

145
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:29,280
of just drumming it up like if we can just call on it evoke it automatically

146
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:37,280
but rather create the conditions for where it's more likely to flow out of us more likely to be here for us

147
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:43,440
so it's a little bit of indirect way of cultivating loving-kindness not to do it directly but to prepare the

148
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:51,040
ground for it and many things that are important to do in life we prepare for it we adjust ourselves

149
00:36:51,040 --> 00:37:00,000
accordingly and so we're ready for the situation that we're going to do and um so i'm going to put

150
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:07,920
in the in the chat um the the section of it

151
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,359
and it's not quite formatted very well this way but uh so this i told you different places you can do

152
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:22,960
it you do it or you can just listen to me as like i go read it so i'll read it first and then we'll i'll discuss it

153
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:31,520
so the discourse on lovingkindness to reach the state of peace though skilled in the

154
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:39,680
good should be capable and upright straight forward and easy to speak to

155
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:46,320
gentle and not proud contented and easily supported

156
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:53,760
living lightly with few duties wise and with senses calmed

157
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:59,440
not arrogant and without greed for supporters and they should not do the least thing

158
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:06,800
that the wise would criticize so here the explicit discussion here is

159
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:14,560
not about loving kindness but to reach the state of peace and a more more kind of close reading of

160
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:22,960
the metasuta it's uh it's can be understood as being um utilizing or

161
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:28,079
being supported by loving kindness uh on the path to liberation and freedom

162
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:35,599
so rather than loving kindness being an adjunct or something you know different from the path of freedom liberation it's actually

163
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:43,200
very much on it and the cultivation of this form of love supports the movement towards liberation

164
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:49,200
and those skilled and the good and there's a lot of a lot of words in the

165
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:56,320
suttas that are related this word good my favorite is the word beautiful kaliana

166
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:02,079
skilled in what's beautiful skilled and what is beneficial skilled

167
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:07,440
and what is wholesome uh which is the topic for the last week

168
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:15,119
uh so there's a skill again this is the word skill is related to the word wholesome uh you know kusala there is skilled

169
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:20,480
in the good and and what follows is some of the

170
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:26,560
skills that we can develop and i like it think of it as skills um because

171
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:32,079
it doesn't we don't listen to this and think where you'd automatically be this way there's an ideal and therefore you

172
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:38,160
should be this way but rather these are things to cultivate to develop these are things to work towards

173
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:44,240
these are valuable states that shouldn't be overlooked and and if we want to live a purposeful

174
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:54,160
life uh this uh cultivating these are phenomenally supportive so being capable and upright

175
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:59,839
so i think the word capable here means able to apply oneself that's at least

176
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:05,280
how i understand it not so much that we're capable in doing a lot of different things

177
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,400
but rather we're capable of engaging in the practice and cultivating skills

178
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:17,119
cultivating yourself in ways and upright i think this is a in the ancient world

179
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:22,800
this idea being upright like sometimes it is in in english has a meaning of being having

180
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:28,079
certain kind of integrity and uh an integrity that allows a person

181
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:33,520
to stand upright uh without feeling uh diminished or feeling

182
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:39,280
belittled belittling themselves or feeling shy or feeling somehow less than or something because of who

183
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:46,720
they are but the kind of integrity allows in a very simple way uh to be upright

184
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:54,560
hold oneself straight and certain confidence straightforward means to be

185
00:40:54,560 --> 00:41:01,760
direct in how we speak not go round about just say things as they are in a kind of simple straight way

186
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:07,280
easy to speak to means that it means that if someone needs to give us

187
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:13,440
feedback about something that's difficult we're easy to receive that we're not

188
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:20,560
automatically defensive we don't go into the attack mode but if someone has to say something to us we're there to listen and be there

189
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:26,319
uh without automatically defending ourselves not automatically agreeing or being

190
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:31,760
pushed over by the other people but uh it's easy for people come to us and say by the way i need to talk to you

191
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:37,599
i want to talk to you about something and that was difficult for me gentle

192
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:43,920
and not proud so upright but not proud and proud here uh sometimes in modern

193
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:51,119
english the word pride has very positive connotations so what proud here means is to be puffed up a certain

194
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:56,720
kind of conceit and gentle and

195
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:02,800
which was kind of the topic for the meditation we had a certain kind of gentleness and i like

196
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:08,400
the reference point for gentle for me is to understand it better is to appreciate

197
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:14,640
the opposite of it that to not be gentle makes the heart and mind kind of crowded

198
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:19,920
usually to be harsh to be mean to be

199
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:26,880
rough with people there's a kind of engagement and involvement that that doesn't make room for freedom

200
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:32,160
for love for kindness for the kind of inner cultivation of the

201
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:38,480
heart that the path of freedom involves so in gentleness

202
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,640
and contented and easily supported so these are values that are a little

203
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:50,480
bit more focused on monastics easily but it can be for anyone monastics are supposed to be very

204
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:58,400
contented with having just a few things just enough to be comfortable and through the eyes of modern world

205
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:04,319
the monastic life can be seen as ascetic but in time of the buddha it was clearly not to be ascetic there are people who

206
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:10,400
are much more seriously ascetic than the buddhists rather the buddhist monastics to have just

207
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:15,760
enough to be comfortable just enough clothes just enough housing just enough food

208
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:24,079
and just enough medicine but not more than what's needed contented with what's what keeps us the basics comfortable

209
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:30,640
and that's kind of a fascinating reference point um content with just enough to keep us

210
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:36,240
alive healthily and easily supported for monastic not to be want a lot from

211
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:42,000
other people and you know the supporters and and trying to acquire more and more from the donors that

212
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:49,839
support them similarly living lightly and with few duties not being so busy because having a lot

213
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:56,880
to do and lots of responsibilities doesn't make space in time that this these heart qualities

214
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:03,520
need in order to flower um wise and with senses calmed and

215
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:08,880
the senses come so the eyes are calm we see the world in a calm way we're not always

216
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:17,359
darting about looking the ears are calm so that the taste buds are calm we don't

217
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:23,599
you know want more and more food something like that not arrogant and without greed for

218
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:29,520
supporters and they should not do the least thing that the wise would criticize

219
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:36,720
so for the people who in your life who you really respect and and value for being being wise people

220
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:43,760
to not do something that they would be critical of um mostly it means don't be unethical don't

221
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:49,280
be mean don't be don't have ill will but

222
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,720
to use the reference points of those who are wise uh to how to care for yourself and also

223
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:01,280
how to relate to yourself don't do the least things that the wise would kind of that's not quite right

224
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:07,920
um and uh so it's a tall order but it's kind of a

225
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:15,760
call to be careful also with how you are when you're alone in the privacy of your own life

226
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:22,400
are you also there living in a way that those who you respect would not be

227
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:30,560
critical of and so your life is transparent or harmonious whether you're alone or not uh

228
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:36,160
ready to bring these qualities all these qualities uh to your life when you're living alone

229
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:41,440
and quietly from your privacy of your for your own situation or when you're

230
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:46,640
in the world public with others that you would be capable and upright

231
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:53,119
straightforward and easy to speak to gentle and not proud contented and

232
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:58,960
easily supported living lightly and with few duties wise

233
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:04,800
and with senses calmed not arrogant and without greed for supporters

234
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:15,119
and not the least not doing the least thing that the wise would criticize so this sets the stage

235
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:23,200
then for an attitude a orientation towards others

236
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:29,119
that can be said to be that of kindness or friendliness good will metta and that will be the topic for the

237
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:35,759
next section of the matasuta tomorrow so thank you

238
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:44,079
and if you're at all inclined you might want to memorize today this

239
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:49,280
section some people find tremendous benefit from memorizing the metasuta

240
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:55,040
and this this version is not the one we usually use here at imc we use the monastic one that

241
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:01,280
comes out of the monastery abbaya gary or amaravati in england because that's a

242
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:06,720
nice kind of chanting kind of quality but either one and

243
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:11,838
and so thank you
