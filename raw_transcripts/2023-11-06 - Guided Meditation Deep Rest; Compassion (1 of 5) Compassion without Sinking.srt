1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:09,040
so um well maybe I I tend to underestimate

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,000
how much joy I'm going to feel when when I see uh all of these good

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,720
mornings all the good mornings and the reports

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:28,760
from all these locations um I'm streaming I'm streaming to you

5
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:34,120
from a different place and before now I'm nestled in

6
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:39,920
this foggy Valley uh just north of Santa Cruz at

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,320
IRC Insight Retreat Center very happy to be here doing this

8
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:51,559
and um I'm unsure about the connection so

9
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:57,320
we'll see if the bandwidth holds up if it drops off we'll just get to

10
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:04,400
meditate h a very happy to be with you as I as I heard uh Rhonda McGee put it

11
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,759
good moment not good morning good afternoon good night she just said good morning uh good

12
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,000
moment so the way I think about our our purpose in coming

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,680
together for these these sittings and dmets is uh together as a Sana together

14
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:35,200
as a community and to practice together and have some time to

15
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:42,520
prioritize the Buddhist teachings um feeding them into our lives

16
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:50,079
reflecting on them working with them together as a community so we we can we

17
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:58,840
can learn for ourselves how we want to live well how we want to live peacefully and

18
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:06,600
dharmically so the theme I I've um chosen for the

19
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:14,280
week is the Buddhist teachings on compassion and why is

20
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:20,080
that uh one of my one of my zen teachers uh frequently encourages me to give the

21
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,120
talk you need to hear and when I asked myself I thought

22
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:32,480
oh what would be nourishing this week and buddh teachings on

23
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:40,280
compassion I hope you find it nourishing too so let's start with a

24
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,800
sitting we will we'll start with a sort of sitting

25
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:57,080
that that I hope will will um care for these hearts of

26
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:04,879
ours that M I think for many of us that that um

27
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,080
really want to wish well for this ailing

28
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:17,200
world and as much as we would like to give and give endlessly sometimes the heart needs some

29
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:25,040
rest so our Focus for this morning will be rest we'll do some uh grounding and

30
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,560
balancing at the beginning of this meditation and then we'll move into the breathing

31
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:37,640
and then scan the body so that bit by bit we can relax bit by

32
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,200
bit so let's find our way into the meditation

33
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,400
posture reclining or

34
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,919
sitting turning back to this felt

35
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:34,199
body right PRI izing that aware connection with the

36
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:01,560
body maybe taking a few deep breaths

37
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,240
and feeling the steadying influence of the

38
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:35,199
breathing or maybe starting with the

39
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:44,198
ears letting the sounds call us back

40
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,479
here

41
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:43,000
as we prioritize and tune in to this body this one precious

42
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:54,919
body inclining the mind to notice its

43
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,879
groundedness maybe the ways that it's

44
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,360
solid

45
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
supported

46
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:24,600
supported firm

47
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
steady

48
00:09:52,839 --> 00:10:00,920
if this isn't the experience of your body body in this

49
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:06,720
moment maybe there's some small place in the

50
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:16,320
body maybe the soles of the feet maybe the sitting

51
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,000
base or some of the

52
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:31,040
bones that are just resting with gravity

53
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,040
balanced

54
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
grounded

55
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:56,800
staying connected to the body in this

56
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:06,240
way the next invitation is

57
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:14,440
to bring some bit of focus to the

58
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,839
breathing especially the

59
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:30,879
exhale letting the the inhale come in naturally on its own time

60
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:41,000
and then you can experiment with the exhale just being slightly

61
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,480
longer than natural just

62
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,920
enough to cue the body to

63
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:05,720
relax a little bit of EMP empasis on the exhale relaxing this

64
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
body

65
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:43,399
grounding the body inviting relaxation with the

66
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:56,320
exhale if just this is for you this

67
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:04,120
morning afternoon evening if it's nourishing please

68
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:16,919

that and this will be to bring attention

71
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,000
so the body section by

72
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:45,000
section to notice if there's any tension that's easy to

73
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:53,960
release and giving permission in a

74
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,120
way for this tension to

75
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:10,039
rest you can do this in your in your own way at your own

76
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:20,400
pace it may be the whole head and neck attending to

77
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:30,039
this any obvious tension

78

the other shoulder and

82
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,600
arm and

83
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960

back

86
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
release

87
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,880
one leg from the hip to the

88
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,240
toes

89
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:34,120

leg

91
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:59,880
release and you're invited to continue in your own way

92
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,520
giving this body permission to

93
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
rest

94
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:29,440
and in the last minutes of this sitting

95
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:45,440
feeling free to let go of any effort in these activities we're

96
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:53,600
doing to sense and appreciate any relaxation that's

97
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:59,399
come any feeling of rest

98
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:33,960
and if the sense of rest hasn't come just now may the seeds of rest be

99
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,440
planted for the

100
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:47,120
future may all beings everywhere know the deep

101
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:52,600
rest of clear knowing and

102
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:59,320
release May all beings be well

103
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:24,320
good moment hello during our meditations the rain

104
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:31,679
started how wonderful oh I'm getting a note that the Bell was

105
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:38,000
a little loud I'll adjust that for tomorrow

106
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:45,120
so welcome again as I mentioned the focus for the

107
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,519
week is the Buddhist teachings on

108
00:31:52,639 --> 00:31:57,679
compassion like to start with a story um

109
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:02,760
to illustrate this theme the inspiration the theme for the talk today

110
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:08,960
is how do we have compassion without sinking how do we have compassion

111
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:16,720
without sinking and the story comes from the very first teaching in the one of the

112
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,960
books of the Buddhist discourses the connected discourses and someone comes to the

113
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,480
Buddha and asks how does one cross the flood

114
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:34,159
how does one cross the flood and the Buddha and his care and

115
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:41,159
compassion for this being responds it's by not halting and not

116
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:45,760
struggling that I was able to cross the

117
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:56,360
flood the person ask further oh how did you do that fair question and the Buddha said

118
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:03,720
when I halted when I halted I

119
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,960
sank and when I struggled I got swept

120
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,320
away so how do we how do we have compassion without sinking how do we

121
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:26,120
practice compassion without sinking I um I asked a very similar

122
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:32,760
question to venerable an Alo recently I asked him how do we relate

123
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:39,000
how do we relate to the suffering of this world without being overtaken in a way how do we cross the

124
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,480
flood or how do we have compassion without sinking and the background for this

125
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:50,240
question I think maybe doesn't need

126
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:56,120
stating um but the word compassion fatigue comes

127
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:01,960
to my mind and I hear it from hear it from Friends often of course in

128
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:07,000
the academic sense it means something quite specific but I think in our

129
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:14,320
popular popular sense it it invokes something or expresses a kind of um

130
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:22,200
maybe weariness a challenge a challenge in these uh challenging

131
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:28,878
times uh maybe conditioned by the fact that um

132
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:35,040
we have we have in the practice something something that I might call a Dharma imperative to

133
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:40,960
sensitivity we're training in being sensitive and we're training to

134
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:48,520
care so again this question how with a with a sensitive heart do we swim without

135
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:54,638
sinking or care without being depleted um but in a positive

136
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,200
sense how do we love in a way that's

137
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:11,040
sustainable so the Buddha offered offered his teachings out of compassion it said out of

138
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:17,839
care and I think we're still we're still benefiting from that so well like I like

139
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:25,520
I mentioned we'll we will look into some of these some of these Buddhist teachings on compassion this week so

140
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:31,240
venerable analo in respon in to my question how do we how do we love sustainably how do we have compassion

141
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:37,920
and not sink he I want to say uh he was speaking

142
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,200
from the perspective of meditative cultivation of compassion so the the

143
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:50,200
practice of compassion has a broad scope uh for us as practitioners and um

144
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:57,680
in the Buddhist teaching we have the sort of meditative scope we have the what I'll call the daily life scope

145
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:02,800
and he was really talking about meditation and he pointed me in this

146
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:09,040
direction and this is what I wanted to share with you that the the first step in his

147
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:15,000
answer was to recognize a distinction to practice recognizing a

148
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:21,240
distinction that allows us to love sustainably now this was given to given

149
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:29,160
to me at the end of a a retreat so I'd had all this time to rest i' had all this time to really care for

150
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:38,280
myself and then I heard this distinction so in the in the early Buddhist sense there's a distinction

151
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:44,119
between uh keeping the heart open to

152
00:36:44,319 --> 00:36:49,760
suffering and refraining from taking it on taking on the suffering of others

153
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:55,000
like putting it on our back so the distinction here is

154
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:01,160
important and they're related to one another other so we have keeping an open sensitive

155
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:10,880
Heart part of the path and that makes possible the wish for

156
00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:16,520
well-being um and these two are they're closely related but they're distinct so

157
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:22,200
it takes some practice to start to recognize them the example venerable analo gave me

158
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:28,599
of the difference between keeping an open heart and taking on the suffering of another he used the

159
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:35,079
image of a doctor more or less saying imagine imagine a doctor meeting

160
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:40,640
patients and one comes the first one comes in and the doctor takes on takes

161
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:45,920
on the difficulty of the the person and that's what they focus on how many

162
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:53,920
people do you think they could see 2 three four five before they were

163
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:00,079
depleted so the doctor keep keeps their keeps their senses and their heart their

164
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:05,520
eyes their heart open doesn't Focus only on the ailment

165
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:11,640
but also focuses on the possibility of Health this is the prognosis this is the

166
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:18,680
way forward this these are some things we can do we can try the doctor sees the whole scope and

167
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:25,119
doesn't stop with just the ailment to just stop with the ailment would be in the Buddhist sense

168
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:31,400
contemplation of Dua which has a slight distinction from the cultivation of

169
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:37,680
compassion contemplation of duka makes compassion possible but it's not the it's not the

170
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:43,800
whole practice of compassion of course the Buddha is

171
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:49,040
sometimes talked about as the the great physician we know this and it's uh it's

172
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:54,280
understood that maybe maybe he borrowed a medical framework when formulating the

173
00:38:54,280 --> 00:39:00,920
Four Noble Truths that the U the first Noble Truth of Dua suffering of

174
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:08,640
unsatisfactoriness is like uh the doctor seeing the ailment the second Noble Truth is assessing the causes and

175
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:15,119
conditions that uh craving that leads to clinging third Noble Truth is like the

176
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:20,800
prognosis there is an end of suffering that's possible the cessation of

177
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:28,440
craving and then the fourth Noble Truth is the the treatment so to speak the noble Eightfold

178
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:36,880
so in this um in this metaphor of the doctor the the doctor sees the whole

179
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:43,319
scope here doesn't doesn't limit and dwell uh their awareness and their heart

180
00:39:43,319 --> 00:39:51,560
only on the suffering but also sees these other parts what are the causes and conditions what's the possibility of

181
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:56,800
health and then how do we get there so was venerable andal I's

182
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:04,000
encouragement was to to get get into this distinction get familiar with this distinction between contemplation of

183
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,960
Dua and the cultivation of compassion both both parts in the

184
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:17,480
service of loving sustainably in the service of not

185
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:26,760
sinking so I was considering how to how to practice getting to know the this

186
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:33,000
distinction between the contemplation of Dua and wishing well for

187
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,200
others as I was looking into the teachings of on compassion one of the things that we

188
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:45,200
notice is that there's not there's not a um very clear definition in the

189
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:51,079
teachings about what compassion is and I was a bit surprised by this but

190
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:57,359
I spec I started to speculate uh that the Buddha was a very thoughtful person

191
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:03,040
and I started to speculate that this was actually in the service of

192
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:08,680
our Humanity instead of definitions the Buddha conveys the teachings through

193
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:15,960
images and stories um that touch on and and sort of

194
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:21,000
light up in our in our modern language like light up our social system our

195
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:27,359
social nervous system that connects with other beings so uh I didn't see the Buddha

196
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:32,520
respond to the question uh dear dear the Buddha what is

197
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:38,000
compassion oh compassion is X instead he conveyed it through story and image so

198
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,319
that we connect with other beings I think I think that's

199
00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:52,000
basic because the the key the key function of the practice of compassion as we know is the wishing

200
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,680
well the wishing that another being have freedom from suffering

201
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:06,319
it's that close it's that immediate um it's right here wishing

202
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:13,520
wishing that another being be free from suffering or wishing that we are free from suffering this is the nature of

203
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:19,359
compassion in some of the some of the earlier groundbreaking research about compassion and

204
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:25,599
burnout um they found the key difference between those that those that were able

205
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:32,920
to sustain and those that weren't was simply um this wish for the well-being

206
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:39,800
of others so the the everyone in the study was exposed

207
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:45,680
to uh from what I understand a great great amount of uh pain and suffering in

208
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:55,160
terms of images and stories and those that those that were able to not sink to love sustainably the

209
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:01,119
the one ingredient was is wishing wishing others well wishing they be free from

210
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:07,280
suffering so I think there's a way in our meditation that we can we can get more and more sensitive

211
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:14,440
to this distinction and I I I feel like it may be important in in practicing

212
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:22,280
compassion to come into the meditative space and recognize suffering as

213
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:30,040
suffering as it's present recognize suffering and suffering and also sense as we incline

214
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:36,800
the Mind may this being be free from suffering and be very sensitive to what

215
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:44,480
that does there's a close monitoring that's being asked for here between the the

216
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:49,559
mind that sort of draws to draws to the suffering only kind of like a

217
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:55,319
magnet and the mind that can be with suffering with an open sensitive heart

218
00:43:55,319 --> 00:44:03,558
and also in in line the to the toward the wish for well-being May these beings be free from

219
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:11,480
suffering so this question how to love

220
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:16,119
sustainably how to practice compassion without

221
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:23,280
sinking this morning and and across these five mornings I'll be speaking about this

222
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:30,240
topic of compassion doing it in maybe a general sense I think it's important to say that

223
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:35,400
it's it's for each of us to discern what's the what is the right

224
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:41,480
healthy amount of exertion and effort and what's the right amount of rest

225
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:48,319
Discerning our wise relationship and I hope that that sharing some of these these uh teachings from the Buddha on

226
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:53,960
compassion can be part of your Reflections this week your practice this

227
00:44:53,960 --> 00:45:00,640
week so the practice of compassion may we make every necessary

228
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:05,599
effort and when it's time to rest may we rest

229
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:13,760
completely thank you for your practice this morning today

230
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:20,119
evening may all beings everywhere be

231
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:27,359
sensitive just enough and wish others well it's

232
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:34,319
possible may all beings be free from suffering take

233
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,920
care
