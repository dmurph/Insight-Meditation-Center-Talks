1
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:09,519
good day good beginning of the week

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,920
just a minute

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,560
and

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:30,080
so it's probably a little confusing for some of you that we've switched now

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:38,239
back to meeting at 7 00 am for the meditation and i think it was over many of us it

6
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:44,800
was quite wonderful to be starting at 6 45 last week and have the 45 minutes sitting

7
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,120
and the plan is to do that again next week starting on monday

8
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,280
and then we can assess for one week and then we can assess whether to

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,760
continue this way somehow or other do it once a month or not do it at all

10
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,000
and

11
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,400
so the in terms of the

12
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,799
16 steps of mindfulness of breathing we've gone through the first eight and

13
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:31,200
today is to introduce the ninth and that is to become aware of the mind

14
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:38,479
knowing the mind breathing in one knows the mind breathing out one knows the mind

15
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:45,040
and what exactly the mind is is a fascinating topic

16
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,680
and maybe there's no final

17
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:57,439
decision to be made about what the mind is some people call it the mind heart some people call it the heart the pali

18
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,719
word is chitta and i'll talk more about later but for

19
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:09,679
now i want to say that using an analogy that if

20
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:16,400
you're driving maybe on a long trip with a car and you still notice that slowly the

21
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:23,840
windshield is getting dirty it slowly slowly builds up over time and driving is so important you're very

22
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,840
focused on the traffic the road the driving itself

23
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:36,160
and so you're focusing on what's beyond the windshield and so you don't really notice the

24
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,400
windshield but the windshield is getting more and more dirty and what you also don't notice then is

25
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,920
the strain to have to look more carefully through the dirt

26
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:55,519
so this is an example of how if um we might not know recognize the filter

27
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:01,360
through which uh we are aware of things because we're often focusing on

28
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,360
something in particular just like we're often when we think we think about something

29
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:15,200
so our awareness is usually about something we're aware of but how we're aware is not really so

30
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:22,720
easily seen or prioritized and then with the driving if you could

31
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,640
stop at a gas station and wash your window and then get in the car and you go wow

32
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,080
now it's clean that is impressive and and you realize how much easier and more

33
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:40,959
relaxing it is to drive without straining through the dirty window so

34
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:48,799
so this is what the topic is for today is mindfulness of the mind and take a while

35
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,400
to kind of really explain what it is but with that introduction

36
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,799
please begin in your meditation posture

37
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:07,519
and and uh if your mind's gonna be about

38
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:13,360
something thinking about something aware of something

39
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:20,560
be aware for a few moments of your posture and to really become even more aware

40
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,800
you might kind of sway back and forth rock back and forth and re-establish

41
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,600
your posture maybe making smaller movements as you kind of really get settled

42
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,840
and kind of whatever you know make a small adjustments really feel

43
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,360
where the posture is comfortable not comfortable aligned not

44
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:57,840
aligned in a way that works for you maybe there can be small adjustments

45
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:07,039
and then letting the body become still and now the focus of attention can be

46
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,840
maybe the stillness of the body

47
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,560
just what it's like to have the body still not moving

48
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,160
and if in feeling the still body there feels like more adjustments are needed

49
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,120
herb would be good please do

50
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:39,440
and the next focus of attention can be

51
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:46,000
the breathing of the body wherever breathing is most easy for you

52
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,080
to experience in the belly the movements of the chest

53
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,479
movements of the air going in and out through the nostrils

54
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,400
and then to take a few long slow deep breaths

55
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:14,000
three quarters full and for as long as it's comfortable for

56
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,840
you a long slow exhale

57
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:31,360
long slow exhale when you get to the end of the exhale

58
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:38,319
briefly maybe then just barely perceptibly pause

59
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:46,400
before you inhale pause so the inhale

60
00:06:46,400 --> 00:07:03,840
really feels like it wants to start itself and allow it to start

61
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:13,280
and then letting your breathing return to normal and now bring your attention

62
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,720
to focus on the parts of the body that might be easy to relax

63
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,720
maybe the muscles of the face the eyes

64
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:34,160
almost like the muscles of the face can be spread wide to the side maybe

65
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:45,840
where they can sink down sliding down the bones of the skull

66
00:07:52,879 --> 00:08:13,840
perhaps as you exhale the softening of the shoulders releasing of the tension

67
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,680
and then softening the belly

68
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:30,560
if it's difficult to soften relax the belly be content to do it in very small

69
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:38,839
degrees maybe relaxing around the place of most

70
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,839
tension

71
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:03,440
and then let your attention receive the experience of the body

72
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:11,600
breathing in the belly the chest the nostrils

73
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:23,839
or globally all of that in some easy way

74
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,880
maybe letting there be

75
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,160
a little pause at the end of the exhale

76
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:45,440
maybe just barely perceptible a relaxed pause

77
00:09:48,240 --> 00:10:05,040
and then allow the inhale to start itself receive the inhale

78
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:18,480
receiving the inhale and awareness

79
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,440
riding the release of the exhale

80
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:47,839
releasing yourself with the release of the exhale

81
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,760
releasing your thoughts as you exhale

82
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,920
and as the thoughts release maybe there's more space in the

83
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:20,640
awareness to feel the fullness of breathing in and

84
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:29,839
breathing out

85
00:12:50,959 --> 00:13:00,959
and then also notice if there's any tension or pressure agitation in the mind

86
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:09,519
and as you exhale perhaps you can soften the mind

87
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,920
release the tension of the mind

88
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,839
soften the thinking muscle

89
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:37,680
maybe where the sense of the mind becomes more open expansive

90
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,480
mind has mind has more room

91
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:00,879
lots of room in which breathing in and breathing out

92
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,839
is known

93
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,360
and then become aware as you're following your breathing

94
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:27,279
become aware of how you're aware what's the attitude or mood

95
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:32,880
that comes along with being aware

96
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:41,839
what's the mental atmosphere

97
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:02,079
is the general mood or atmosphere attitude of the mind

98
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:09,839
is it pleasant or is it unpleasant

99
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:37,839
is it more on the side of contentment or of discontentment

100
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,440
is the quality of the mind field does the mind feel more small

101
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:58,399
located in a particular place or does it feel more large

102
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:05,839
expansive may be difficult to locate in any one

103
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,839
place

104
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:43,120
the general quality of your mind your inner life

105
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,840
your mind heart

106
00:17:53,120 --> 00:18:02,399
what's the emotional tone not of particular thoughts or impulses

107
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,320
but the background tone or the

108
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,840
atmosphere of it all

109
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,480
and without any kind of judgment of how it is

110
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:27,679
what happens to you as you gently honestly

111
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:33,039
recognize something about the quality of the mind

112
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:43,840
the mood the attitude the atmosphere

113
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:03,679
not to be thinking about this with more feeling or sensing

114
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:10,799
a quiet awareness

115
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:25,840
of the mood of your mind state the state of the mind

116
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:39,120
and then whatever state of mind you have if you're aware of it breathe with it

117
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:45,600
as if breathing accompanies it breathes through it

118
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:58,080
or whether or like the state of the mind accompanies the breathing

119
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:07,840
breathing in knowing the state of your mind

120
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,280
breathing out knowing the state of your

121
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,840
mind

122
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,840
in the way that you might experience humidity in the air

123
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,120
or the warmth of the sun standing in the sun

124
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:45,679
see if you can experience the state of the mind

125
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,640
the overall mood overall gestalt

126
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:59,840
of the inner mental life

127
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,600
let's say characterized by a wanting

128
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,640
characterized by an aversion pushing away

129
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,799
is it characterized by confusion

130
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:31,919
is it characterized by stability and presence or by distraction and

131
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:42,080
jumping around it's all okay just experience it as it is for you

132
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:55,840
breathe with it

133
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:05,360
and if it's possible to relax the mind or expand the mind

134
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:14,559
so the boundaries of whatever mind is are soft boundaries open boundaries

135
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:23,360
no boundaries and resting into that

136
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:33,360
expansive mind settling into the open mind

137
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,000
and breathing through it breathing with it

138
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:47,840
breathing at the center of it

139
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,320
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

140
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:03,520
maybe you can discern that or know the difference between

141
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:09,279
a mind that is small and closed and

142
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:18,158
involved in itself and the mind or heart which is open

143
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,799
open to receive and feel the world around it

144
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:35,440
maybe the difference can be like trying to talk and see someone through a

145
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:43,200
closed glass door and then having the door open

146
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,320
and then seeing them and talking being with them

147
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:59,919
to open the mind to open the heart for it to be expansive and wide and

148
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:13,840
the mood and atmosphere the state of mind receptive and available

149
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,720
and in this mode either doing so or imagining it so

150
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:27,840
be take in the people of your life

151
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:33,039
people you might see today or talk to today or

152
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,960
think about today people on the street in your

153
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,919
neighborhood and in your communities

154
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:57,760
and to let them be received or known with a heart the mind wide open

155
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:04,159
at least for these minutes or two we're sitting here at the end of meditation

156
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:11,278
a time and place where it's safe to be open-hearted

157
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:24,320
and then see if there's a greater sensitivity a greater

158
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,600
tenderness heartfeltness

159
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:38,080
in considering these people when the heart the mind is open

160
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,840
and then taking the idea of whatever benefit that's come from this meditation

161
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:54,640
practice let it be offered up

162
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:01,279
and be offered for the welfare and benefit of others

163
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:07,039
whatever calm or centeredness or peacefulness

164
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:13,760
