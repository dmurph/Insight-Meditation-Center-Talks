1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:07,700
so welcome welcome it's uh nice to see you all it's nice to practice together

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,740
and tonight I want to talk a little bit about this phrase

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,800
that I heard a number of years ago and then recently I heard it again

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,800
and it's a tribute to John Wellwood who is a psychologist as well as a Buddhist

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,700
practitioner and this phrase is that but the practice is about waking up and

6
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:40,579
growing up kind of this interesting idea like that waking up right enlightenment

7
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:46,920
Awakening you know this Peace and Freedom I like going in that direction

8
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:55,079
but growing up like maybe working with all those issues or things in our life that maybe

9
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,719
are well I like this expression that Jack kornfield uses this unfinished business

10
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,840
of the heart these things that maybe still need a little bit of metabolism or I don't know

11
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,060
what they need exactly but this idea that practice is both we can't

12
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,600
just do one without the other even though of course many of us come to spiritual practice

13
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,220
maybe kind of secretly hoping we won't have to work with that kind of that

14
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:30,360
stuff some of the difficulties some of the really difficult stuff

15
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:36,479
and to be sure we don't have to the beginning but as our practice unfolds you know our capacity to be with

16
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:43,259
whatever is difficult really grows and so then we're able to

17
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:48,900
be with or understand or hold

18
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,820
the difficulties in a different way

19
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:00,479
so if there's a a poem that talks about this

20
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,960
well I'm interpreting it to talk about this I don't know what the the poet's intention I'm not sure what her

21
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:14,000
intention was but this is how I'm interpreting it and this poem is called

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,120
autobiography in five short chapters maybe some of you have heard this

23
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,879
like this one walk down the street

24
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,920
there's a deep hole in the sidewalk I Fall in

25
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,020
I am lost I am helpless it isn't my fault

26
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:43,099
it takes me forever to find a way out

27
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:48,180
too I walk down the same street there's a

28
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:54,120
deep hole in the sidewalk I pretend I don't see it I fall in again

29
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:03,200
I can't believe I'm in the same place but it isn't my fault it still takes a long time to get out

30
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,900
three I walk down the same street there's a deep hole in the sidewalk

31
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:15,720
I see it is there I still fall in it's a habit

32
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:23,959
My Eyes Are Open I know where I am it is my fault I get out immediately

33
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:32,879
four I walk down the same street there's a deep hole in the sidewalk

34
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,220
I walk around it five

35
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,659
I walk down another Street

36
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:49,019
I kind of like this right so I walk down another street but I like this

37
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:54,120
progression like At first we don't see it but then we're like I don't want to

38
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:01,620
see it but then we see it but we have this momentum of the habits the patterns of our life that even though we see what

39
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:09,120
we're doing may not be so helpful we can't do it anyways this is part of the human experience

40
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:16,380
and then we might say you know then walk around it it's really gaining some wisdom on some

41
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:23,160
understanding but we might say that chapter 5 is walking down another Street this is maybe where some real spiritual

42
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:30,680
awakening is happening where things are seen and understood in a really different way

43
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:36,000
and one of these ways that this way came up is described as a number of different

44
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,060
ways people point to it or talk about it but one way is that there's a radical

45
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:48,240
shift in the sense of self where the self-concept is different it's

46
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:55,320
a or self-concept goes away we could say so there's no longer this idea that

47
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,780
there's a self that there's a core that there's an essence

48
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:07,320
to which one appends experiences like having this core then just all these

49
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,780
experiences happen to this core instead it's just this recognition

50
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:20,580
that's all there is are experiences right there isn't a essence or a core

51
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:26,400
like so often we might think of course we think that

52
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,620
this isn't something you have to believe this isn't something that you have to

53
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:38,720
try to make sense logically necessarily this is something that more makes sense with some meditative experiences or

54
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:45,300
experientially so and I know certainly when I first heard this I thought it was very peculiar and bewildering and

55
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:51,360
puzzling and odd so you might be having that experience too when I mentioned this idea of not

56
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,380
self but I want to talk about it just a little bit here

57
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:03,360
because Jack cornfield who's you know a senior teacher in this tradition

58
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:10,380
if not one of the most senior teachers in this tradition he talks about how this a similar kind

59
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:16,139
of an idea of a progression of towards this understanding of not

60
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:22,319
self maybe in the same way there's this growing up and waking up and maybe in

61
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:28,380
the same way the poem but the poem maybe is a little bit misleading because it's

62
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:33,539
very you know it's a poem and it just goes one two three four five making

63
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:39,060
things like this is a perfectly linear experience but of course it isn't

64
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:45,539
waking up and growing up it's maturing in our life maturing in our spiritual practice

65
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:51,360
isn't neat and tidy in a straight line it's we could think of it more like a spiral

66
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,259
we have a little bit more insight into

67
00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:03,600
understanding what our habits and patterns are and then maybe that allows our meditation to deepen a little bit

68
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:09,240
we're not so caught or triggered and then as our meditation deepens

69
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:16,620
and we can see some O's some even deeper patterns maybe we can soften those and realize oh

70
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,960
yeah that's not so helpful and then as those get let go of we can settle even

71
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,120
more and so this spiral just continues on and on

72
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,419
so it's a little bit misleading like this poem that I read and just this

73
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:39,680
idea of what Jack cornfield has but I'd like to share it nonetheless

74
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:46,020
so Jack and maybe I'll back up I'll add this before I talk about it that in the

75
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:53,280
Buddhist teachings there's really this emphasis on waking up you know I have to become awakened there isn't so much

76
00:07:53,280 --> 00:08:00,419
about this growing up like how to heal those parts of us that need healing

77
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:06,900
how to work with the real difficulties in our lives trauma or

78
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:12,240
you know there's so many things that just being in the modern world these

79
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,520
days that we need to work with so the Buddhist teachings don't address

80
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:24,599
that not at least directly but there's a different modalities of

81
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:30,479
course that do so this recognition that you know we might need more than one way

82
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,820
to approach this weekend up and growing up process

83
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:42,060
so Jack cornfield describes that first is like reclaiming and healing

84
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:47,459
our sense of self I appreciate this very much

85
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:53,720
so maybe with meditation that we we might start to understand oh some of the

86
00:08:53,720 --> 00:09:00,240
painful conditions that created perhaps this part of our sense of our self that

87
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:08,940
feels like we're inadequate or deficient or somehow not enough lacking in some

88
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:15,540
way this shows up differently for different people and for some people it's a really dominant part of their experience and

89
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:23,040
for some people it's just a minor part but to recognize some of these old

90
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:31,140
patterns of where we got them from our young life all of us gain patterns from

91
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:38,279
when we are young then these patterns get reinforced with our family our culture our education or Society

92
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:43,920
whatever it might be and then gradually ceasing to identify

93
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:50,820
as much with these old patterns just as we saw with that poem and this is a process

94
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:55,920
this is not something that happens overnight but this allows for this a healthier

95
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:02,040
sense of self to just naturally arise to be created

96
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:08,160
so there's a way in which we can like have this sense of wholeness and

97
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,580
reclaiming our feelings our perspectives maybe our voice our sense of yeah I'm

98
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:22,019
here and I matter it's not it's not uncommon that we need

99
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:27,120
like a skilled person to help us with this with this process of reclaiming and

100
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:35,160
healing our sense of self the next would be like in this protos in

101
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:42,000
this practice like developing our character and developing wisdom

102
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,399
and certainly this is where Buddhist practice can be a big support for this I

103
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:52,920
think this is like this patient training and repeated cultivation

104
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:58,680
so much about meditation practice spiritual practice is about this

105
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:05,339
training and cultivation hateful path as well as like the seven factors of

106
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:12,120
Awakening the ten parties right all these lists I'm not going to go through all these lists but maybe I'll just say

107
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,339
like in the 10 parties or things like patience and resolve or seven factors of

108
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:23,160
Awakening or things like joy and tranquility and Equanimity and Eightfold

109
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:30,320
Path or things like ethical Behavior and livelihood

110
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:37,500
so maybe we could just put big umbrella terms and say this idea of restraining

111
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:44,100
from acting on impulses that cause harm to ourselves harm to others

112
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:49,500
as part of this training and also this training is like to

113
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:55,260
systematically and intentionally direct our attention

114
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:01,860
to different things for example with meditation practice we bring that attention again and again right to the

115
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:07,560
breath or whatever our object is let me do this to kind of help settle

116
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:13,079
the mind and quiet the mind but also just mindfulness to just be

117
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:18,600
aware of what's happening so having the intention to have our attention be with

118
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:26,760
what's happening rather than remaining agitated and lost just to be aware with what's happening

119
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:32,940
as well as placing our attention or intentionally cultivating placing Our

120
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:41,180
intention on loving kindness warm-heartedness towards others towards our self

121
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:48,180
compassion towards our self and towards others so these are some of the ways in which

122
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:53,399
we can like develop our character and develop some wisdom

123
00:12:53,399 --> 00:13:01,040
this and Jack cornfield's got like this second step of this cultivation

124
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:08,579
and then the third step would be discovering this positive qualities that are

125
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:16,440
within us already and recognizing that what I'm talking

126
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:22,800
about cultivating and developing but part of that is to allow what's kind of

127
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,980
like obscuring or getting in the way of or covering over

128
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:35,100
these beautiful qualities that all of us have of course we do

129
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:41,760
of course we do but sometimes we don't have access to them or sometimes we're feeling disconnected from them

130
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:48,600
but just to make them be more of an integral part of our life and readily accessible

131
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,300
so this idea that maybe we don't have to like improve ourselves

132
00:13:54,300 --> 00:14:01,639
but just letting go of what blocks our heart or our wisdom

133
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:09,899
because when our heart is free of fear or anger or this grasping or confusion

134
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:15,779
then these qualities that we've been trying to cultivate or have been cultivating

135
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:22,260
just manifest naturally of course they do

136
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:28,380
it's a big part of practice is recognizing this and allowing it to

137
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:34,100
happen which turns out not to be so easy all the time

138
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:42,360
but maybe a part of this also is this of this process is honoring our personal

139
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:48,300
identity that recognize that there are deep patterns and archetypes that make

140
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:56,540
up our individuality we're not all exactly the same of course not we don't want to be

141
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,100
but can we allow some of these patterns and these archetypes we might use that

142
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:08,279
language within us to be transformed from this something that we are really

143
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:15,540
holding on tightly to something that allows to have this way that really

144
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:21,420
serves our life and serves others some examples that Jack cornfield gives

145
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:26,880
is that maybe we have this critical intellect but then can help support us with

146
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:32,820
discriminating wisdom or we have this desire for beauty and

147
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:39,899
this can support the force that brings Harmony or maybe we have this capacity for

148
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:47,060
intuition and maybe this could be a gift for healing ourselves and others

149
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:56,519
so then okay going along this path of uh development is the fourth step that Jack

150
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:03,899
kornfield talks about is combining this development and discovery of this self

151
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:10,220
with the realization of The Emptiness of the self

152
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:18,839
so this recognition that we need both need a strong sense of self in order to recognize or understand the

153
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:25,920
lack of an inherent self this you know we're using this word self kind of loosely in these different ways

154
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:32,519
and I'd like to talk a little bit more about that but this

155
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:39,120
one thing I like to say is this realization that there isn't this core or this Essence that has to be protected

156
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,579
and bolstered and make sure everybody else sees it the same way that we see it

157
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:49,399
and all these ways that um

158
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:58,259
often bring a lot of difficulties in suffering in our life when people don't see us the way that we want them to or

159
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:03,720
or we don't want people to see us if we have this idea about ourselves is

160
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:11,959
somehow unflattering we don't want other people to see then we don't allow intimacy with others

161
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:18,240
so this realization this recognition that there isn't a core this stable

162
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:25,020
permanent core at the center is associated with a lot of joy and

163
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:31,200
freedom and it's a sense of relief but when we think about it it might

164
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,600
sound kind of frightening and odd as perfectly fine that's our thoughts about

165
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:42,660
it but the experience is one of like oh my goodness what a relief this thing that

166
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:47,700
was so heavy and I've been carrying around I can put it down I don't need it

167
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:53,700
it's extra so in this practice we do need a strong

168
00:17:53,700 --> 00:18:02,520
and healthy sense of self we it's we needed to withstand the

169
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,679
going through these processes and part of meditation is meditation deepens then

170
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,900
there's a sense of the the sense the sense of itself starts to get really

171
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:18,900
thin and soft and sense of the body changes the sense of the Mind changes in

172
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:25,980
some of these deep States sometimes we don't experience that until we have some Retreat practice and those

173
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:31,679
type of settings but the point I'd like to say here is

174
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:37,740
that the that the development of the self and the realization of not self they kind of

175
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:44,280
evolved together and some of you might recognize or know

176
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:51,140
that this um the teaching if not self is one of three

177
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:57,120
characteristics we could have this so we often use this language three characteristics of

178
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:03,020
experience one is that there isn't an inherent permanent core

179
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:10,799
anata and Paulie not self another one is that things are

180
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:16,200
impermanent we know this we know that things change

181
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:21,299
and the second one that there isn't anything that's a lasting source of

182
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:27,960
Happiness there's not a single thing that will forever and always make us happy

183
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:33,120
in fact it's often uncomfortable and stressful

184
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:39,840
and painful duka Anita impermanence

185
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:45,500
duka it's transmitted so many different ways I'll say suffering

186
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:52,679
anata not self turns out everything has these three

187
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:59,160
qualities everything and part of practice is we start to see

188
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:05,760
that and then we stop kind of insisting that they be otherwise trying to make

189
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:11,280
things stay be permanent and stable or make us happy and in a way that they can

190
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:17,880
they just inherently can't so

191
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:25,440
I talked about these Anita duka anata as three characteristics but Gil

192
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:31,919
bronstad appreciates that sometimes he teaches them as less as a characteristic

193
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:38,640
of objects so less says nouns or

194
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:45,360
but more as adjectives or perceptions and I really

195
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:52,860
like this because it points to more our experience so not so much about

196
00:20:52,860 --> 00:21:01,679
what are some teachings that we've heard and maybe some philosophy but what's actually our experience at this moment

197
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:08,120
independent of what you know somebody has said like what's actually going on

198
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:17,100
and so we could say that nature we could translate as in constant

199
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:23,820
rather than in permanent when the mind is quiet we start to see

200
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:31,140
oh yeah there's like a fluttering or a flickering of our experience like we're not having just one single experience

201
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:36,539
all the time maybe the mind is resting on the breath

202
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:42,539
for a moment but then there's a sound and the mind goes to the sound and comes back to the breath

203
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:51,000
that's not just one constant experience or maybe there's um being with the body and then realize

204
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,980
oh yeah the body's breathing and then just being with the movement of the body in a different place

205
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:07,140
so more easily understood maybe like experience is just recognizing

206
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:13,500
it's really changing all the time and sometimes when we think it's not changing

207
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:21,139
is when it's the most difficult when we feel like oh it's going to be like this it's never going to be different

208
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:28,259
so instead to notice yeah it's changing so Anita as inconstant

209
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:33,539
all our experiences are inconstant we are not having just one experience

210
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:40,340
forever of course not and then we can look at dukkha as being

211
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:47,340
painful rather than translating as suffering maybe being painful

212
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:54,020
and so this we do have mental experiences we have physical

213
00:22:54,020 --> 00:23:00,419
experiences that are uncomfortable and it might be that part of the reason

214
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:06,900
they're uncomfortable is because they're always changing we want that to be stable we want a

215
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:13,440
place to land it's going to make us happy we want a place to just like relax like

216
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:21,600
oh okay I got it figured out finally but those places turns out doesn't exist

217
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:28,799
doesn't stop us from keeping on looking for it of course but and it doesn't matter what somebody says

218
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:38,120
we keep on looking this is something that we also have to experience but this idea of Duca is painful

219
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:44,820
just to recognize that there were it's not everything isn't like Bliss and

220
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:50,100
happiness maybe we know this but even to even notice those moments

221
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:56,760
when we do feel fantastic there's often this flickering of like oh

222
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:02,880
I hope this doesn't end oh what was I doing right before so I can make sure I get this experience

223
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:10,220
again there's this kind of flickering of that's happening just to notice that

224
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:16,080
and then to translate as I was doing earlier on a

225
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:21,480
time as not self some people translate it as no self

226
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,880
and then that gets a little bit more complicated as what does this mean

227
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:34,140
there's no self of course I have a self I'm here but not self is more like nope that's

228
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:39,539
not myself that's not myself that's not myself this not myself this isn't myself

229
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:46,140
it's kind of like pointing to how when we investigate nothing has this core

230
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:51,799
this permanent core this Essence at the center

231
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:59,520
so I appreciate that how like all these uh three perceptions we might say these

232
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:05,400
different ways of understanding Anita anata is really pointing to our direct

233
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:10,919
experience not a philosophy not a metaphysical belief

234
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:18,059
not something that we have to adopt it's more just encouragement to look into it

235
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:26,059
and to examine it or you know what's really going on in our experience

236
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:32,700
maybe like shifting our experience from we often are when we have an

237
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:38,940
experience we bring in all kinds of Concepts or personal history or

238
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:44,520
philosophy of something that we add on top of our experience

239
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:51,360
and to shift away from that towards just noticing the stream of moment to moment

240
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,899
in personal experience that for the most part we aren't controlling

241
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,820
so part of putting the conditions in place to allow this shift in perception

242
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:13,080
from things being permanent and or satisfying

243
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:19,559
or having a stable core is we don't we can't like make that

244
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:29,059
happen but part of putting the conditions in place in which that becomes more evident in our experience

245
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:38,100
is to be cultivating the opposite so just like with Jack cornfield it was

246
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:43,679
and this waking up and growing up like we cultivate the sense of self to help

247
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:51,059
us to see not self in the same way we cultivate stability

248
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:57,600
to help us see in constancy and so what does that mean to cultivate

249
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:03,059
stability part of it is our meditation practice

250
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:08,900
is we maybe sitting quietly like literally

251
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:15,000
physically being stable it turns out that this really does have

252
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:22,679
an impact on us to pay a little bit attention like to our posture to have some uprightness and some settleness to

253
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:28,380
feel connected to the ground sometimes when I lead guided meditations I talk

254
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:34,320
about feeling the sitting base like the foundation what you're sitting on the

255
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:39,720
pressure against the buttocks or the back if you're sitting in a chair with the feet are on

256
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:45,840
so feeling connected and grounded literally physically

257
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:51,360
is one way that can support a sense of stability sometimes we're often just don't pay

258
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:59,400
attention to that but we can bring our attention to that also we can use some imagery

259
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:05,279
sometimes the idea of mountains or rocks or

260
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:10,320
sort of like redwood trees you know here and uh certainly here in Redwood City

261
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,360
right but this that there are

262
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:21,059
things in our experience that have a sense of stability and we can use that

263
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:27,299
imagery to support us either in our meditation or in the way that we are thinking about

264
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:32,460
things or considering we have this expression I know sometimes

265
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:39,659
we will refer to somebody well this person was my rock when I was going through difficulties well what does that

266
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:44,700
mean that person of course moved but they were set

267
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:51,299
applied some stability so what does that mean and can we do that for ourselves or can

268
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:57,200
we do that for others so that one of the Opposites of

269
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:04,380
inconstancy of stability if you think about physical stability but also mental stability

270
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:11,640
and a part of mental stability is concentration so allowing the mind to really get

271
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:16,679
settled not to be jumping around or but instead

272
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:21,840
to rest on the sensations of breathing for example or

273
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:27,840
maybe doing meta practice and just allowing the mind to quiet

274
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:34,440
and of course this doesn't happen the first time we try it this is something that gets uh cultivated and with

275
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:43,020
practice really does happen though that there's a sense of stability can happen as the Mind quiets down

276
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:51,600
and we might use this word also like composure like being collected or this

277
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:57,840
sense of wholeness or being in harmony with ourselves and with others and our

278
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:03,480
environment so not fighting against or not pushing against her running away

279
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:09,419
from but having this sense of composure as well as you know composure we think

280
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:16,399
about keeping it together as best we can right

281
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:22,740
and all of these of course are supported by you know learning to soften the

282
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:28,559
judging of our experiences I like this I don't like that I want

283
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:35,220
this I don't want that this better go away I need more of that you know our whole life can be nothing but this

284
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:40,320
but is there a way that we can soften that like yeah this doesn't match my

285
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:47,100
preferences but it's okay yeah this isn't exactly what I wanted but I'm going to open to it and see

286
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:53,220
what's going to happen next you know instead of always always seeking seeking seeking trying to make

287
00:30:53,220 --> 00:31:02,039
everything be just like our preferences in some ways that's the opposite of stability that's just forever seeking

288
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:07,580
is there a way that we can soften our experiences

289
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:13,140
in the same way that muddy water right you know the the dirt kind of settles

290
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:18,600
but there's a way in which if we're allowing our preferences our aversions

291
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:23,700
or things that we want to be agitating the mind there's a way in which we're like

292
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:28,799
always stirring the pot and the mud never really Settles

293
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:34,980
so is there a way that you can learn to do that and of course meditation practice and all these other practices

294
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,820
support that

295
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:48,899
so in order to help with this insight into inconstancy or to notice the in

296
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:54,539
constancy in our experience we can cultivate the opposite

297
00:31:54,539 --> 00:32:01,020
ability and then to notice or to be with the

298
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:09,360
opposite to be with duka I could say painful is to cultivate a sense of well-being

299
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:16,140
and well-being is this has this really wide spectrum of terms

300
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:21,179
that we can think of joy happiness

301
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:28,799
gladness contentment these ways in which there can be a sense

302
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:34,200
of maybe uplift in the heart it's important to cultivate this it's an

303
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:41,340
integral part of our life and our practice sometimes we might think like oh that seems frivolous I have work to

304
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:49,380
do it's so important it's really important I know I certainly felt like what

305
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:55,620
Joy yeah okay that's for everybody else I really have to work hard here that's for the people that have everything all

306
00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:01,440
together you know I don't have it together I have to work hard it turns out that it doesn't work that way

307
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,620
we need Joy of course we do happiness well-being contentment even like these

308
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:13,740
really subtle things like yeah things are okay things are okay even if that's not our dominant

309
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:20,519
experience even if there's just this little part like yeah it's okay let's posture I'm in right now feels all

310
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:26,519
right just to notice those we often we like to be dismissive of them

311
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:34,919
to notice them and then we can also like intentionally cultivate appreciation

312
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:41,519
why don't we grateful for the simple things like

313
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:47,580
for me coffee in the mornings I love having coffee in the mornings it just

314
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:53,460
makes me happy I'm not even too particular about the coffee

315
00:33:53,460 --> 00:34:01,019
so you know simple things like this or maybe there's big giant things maybe you've received some real benefits in

316
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:08,419
your life and to have some appreciation cultivate some generosity

317
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:16,020
help somebody out give your time to somebody give some money to something that

318
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:21,060
you feel moved to do to be generous is a way in which kind of

319
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:26,760
always makes us feel good if it doesn't make you feel good then maybe you're doing generosity in the wrong way we

320
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:34,638
don't want it to feel like something that you have to do just do it as a way that supports a sense of well-being

321
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:42,599
and then of course the opposite of not-self I was talking about earlier but we might be able to summarize what I was

322
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:48,179
talking about with this word confidence maybe the to help seeing the insight

323
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:54,858
into not self is to cultivate confidence as I talked about earlier

324
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:00,960
and you might say well why do we need to cultivate these perceptions of Anita

325
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:08,060
duka anata in constant painful not self

326
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:15,720
deep inside into these are doorways to Awakening

327
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:24,420
our doorways to greater and greater freedom our doorways to peace and ease

328
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:29,940
so there's a way in which having some perceiving them having some insight into

329
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:35,520
them in a way that's not just thinking but that is actually like experiencing

330
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:42,599
them can be transformative it allows this deep Letting Go allows us

331
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:49,380
deep softening and opening that allows for greater and greater

332
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:57,240
freedom so growing up and waking up they happen

333
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:03,540
together and we can cultivate part of the growing

334
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:10,079
up part to help the waking up but maybe that's too simple of a way to say it they definitely have been together more

335
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:16,260
in a spiral so with that I'll end

336
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:23,420
and I'll open it up if there are some questions or comments thank you

337
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:43,800
there you go um question I feel like in my meditation

338
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:50,220
practice I get a lot of glimpses of where suffering comes from and there's

339
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:58,700
hints and it's very obvious to me I was like oh I'm uncomfortable in this suffering or I get a lot of hints around

340
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:04,200
impermanence right like breath comes goes away so I get a lot of hints

341
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:09,839
do you have easy pointers of what the hints are for not self they seem harder

342
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:15,540
for me at least to detect or get hints off like ah not self not self not self

343
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:21,780
yeah yeah it's a good question so one I could say that often in permanent scene

344
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:29,640
in permanence leads to oh well things are always changing they can't be a lasting source of happiness and why was

345
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:35,520
I identified with that anyway so it kind of the say I had a better way to I had

346
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:43,380
this better language to say that but often it's described as it starts with impermanence and leads to not sub so I

347
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:51,720
could say that but something else is uh are you familiar with this idea of vadina the like feeling tone

348
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:57,720
I'll just say briefly that every experience we have comes in three we

349
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:02,880
might say flavors Pleasant unpleasant neutral

350
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:09,060
we notice the pleasant because we want more of it we notice the unpleasant because we want less of it we often am

351
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:15,119
not noticing the neutral things like maybe the feeling of your feet on

352
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:22,380
the floor right it's maybe it's just neutral so we don't notice it it can be helpful to pay attention to

353
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:29,940
like set an intention okay I'm going to pay attention to the neutral things because often the mind just thinks oh

354
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:35,400
this is boring I want to go find something that I can want or not want

355
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:44,099
because it turns out that wanting and not wanting bolsters our sense of self

356
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:50,579
a self when we have this permanent idea or this concept of itself it's always

357
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:57,180
wanting or not wanting but if we create the conditions in which the wanting and the not wanting go away

358
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:04,500
then maybe there can be this glimpse of oh there's there isn't anything here so

359
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:09,500
I offer that this one thank you you're welcome

360
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:18,200
anybody else have a comment or a question

361
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:27,900
yeah sort of along the same line it's just a

362
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:34,380
comment but I heard somebody ask what would be left if there's no nothing left to

363
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:41,940
to solve to fix what's left and that really struck me when I

364
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:48,960
heard that it's I don't know simple but it was

365
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,160
thank you yeah

366
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:06,180
um in thinking about duka what I've been noticing is that there's

367
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:12,000
there's different levels there's the Duca that's obviously uncomfortable whether it's

368
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,780
physical pain or difficult emotions or

369
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:24,300
but then there's like a quieter level of Duca that's just like

370
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:30,540
the unescapable mundanity like

371
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:36,000
that you have to brush your teeth every day you don't have to no you don't have

372
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,040
to but if you don't that will lead to Greater no there's consequences and that

373
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:49,200
you have to eat and just these you have to get dressed but now just the the modernity that will

374
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:56,460
never stop as long as you're alive and is in some way

375
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:02,700
burdensome simply because it's and we pretend it's not we're like

376
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:10,280
celebrate eating right to avoid that feeling and we celebrate clothing

377
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:17,339
to avoid that feeling and but once all that sort of settles and

378
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:22,380
clears away there's a recognition that actually it's just a subtle level of

379
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:29,520
duka it's just an inescapable reality of Being Human and alive and

380
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,800
having bodies right we have to take care of them the burden of having a body and

381
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:41,700
just needing to fulfill these tasks and go to the bathroom and you know just

382
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:48,560
it's not you can't get away from it you know um

383
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:55,140
so just recognizing that that is actually

384
00:41:55,140 --> 00:42:00,240
a fundamental dukkha yes to existence yeah

385
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:08,900
duka shows up in so many different ways right we could say everywhere if we then settle levels we find it everywhere

386
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:15,420
and it's uh like in one way I can say it's an

387
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:23,520
unresolvable dukkha because you can't make it go away so the only resolution to it is really

388
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:31,859
anata is really it's seeing through this uh

389
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:41,460
the identification and that that resolution of our separation and sense

390
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:44,000
of Burden

391
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:54,599
thank you thank you um last week you spoke of impermanence

392
00:42:54,599 --> 00:43:01,500
and for some reason I took issue with that and I was driving home and I was like no everything can be informed us trying to grasp onto something solid and

393
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:06,720
I thought well you know if you know impermanence is guaranteed then that's kind of like a you know a permanent

394
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:12,000
solid thing that'll always be there if today's a crap day you know tomorrow and every other day can't possibly be crap

395
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:18,000
days you might just get lucky and have a good day or something but for some reason I don't know why last week I I

396
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,819
kind of clung onto that impermanence and whatnot and how do you feel about impermanence

397
00:43:23,819 --> 00:43:28,859
today well I think I just came to my own conclusion that uh that it's a constant

398
00:43:28,859 --> 00:43:35,579
so that's kind of a something solid to respond to yeah and Concepts ideas we can hold on

399
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:41,880
to those are the only things that our study are Concepts well experiences spreads they're not

400
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:49,500
steady or they are inconstant but yeah great thank you

401
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:55,460
okay so here we are at the top of the hour so thank you very much

402
00:43:56,540 --> 00:44:04,560
sure okay can space be used to cultivate neutral

403
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:10,800
feelings can space be used to cultivate neutral

404
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:16,619
feelings so I'm assuming that this is talking about cultivating space as one of the elements

405
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:22,740
do you think you I'm not sure to cultivate neutral feelings I would

406
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:28,079
say we don't have to cultivate well if we're using feelings as vadana

407
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:33,859
then um we don't have to cultivate them just neutral vedana happens all the time

408
00:44:33,859 --> 00:44:40,800
neutral experiences but neutral feelings maybe they're meaning not being for or

409
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:46,319
against and I would say that's equanimity and maybe I'll just say really quickly

410
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:51,540
maybe a part of equanimity is seeing the big picture of things rather than

411
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:56,640
getting lost in it so maybe space can help with that so there we go

412
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:04,640
there is this my uh answer hope that was helpful okay thank you
