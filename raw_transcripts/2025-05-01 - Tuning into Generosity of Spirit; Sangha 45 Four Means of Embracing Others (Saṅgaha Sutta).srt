kalana beautiful friendship uh the different ways of uh being a good friend

13
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:28,280
how can we be a good friend and recognize good friendships uh instead of superficial friendships

14
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,920
and and today uh I'd like to um

15
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,240
transition to uh both doing a practice and also later speaking about um

16
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:47,159
building bonds through the four means of embracing others from the angutaranaya

17
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:53,280
432 and um this is from the sanaha suta

18
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,960
which means son means together ga means to hold to gather to grasp which

19
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:07,319
basically literally means to gather together to support one another to embrace one another what are the ways

20
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:15,280
to support include embrace care for gather protect um there are different

21
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,680
meanings that we can we can bring here and these four ways I'll say them because I'll bring them into the

22
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,920
meditation these four ways that are mentioned in

23
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:34,879
this saha suta which by the way sounds like sa right sauta but sahasuta ways to

24
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:41,120
to create social cohesion these principles these grounds for social

25
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,720
cohesion and relational harmony

26
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:57,640
are dana generosity giving pavaja kind speech affectionate

27
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,680
speech aacharia beneficial action

28
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:10,040
service and samaata sama ma nata which is

29
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:18,560
impartiality equal equality treating others fairly without bias um and in a

30
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:25,000
humble in a fair equitable way as as equals so so these are the four

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,239
principles that um in in this suta that

32
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:37,519
the Buddha talks about how they they create they they are the principles for

33
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:46,799
creating social cohesion harmony relational harmony so in the in the guided meditation I'd

34
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,799
like to invite us after we get settled of course with our bodies uh into a

35
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,239
sense of presence um I'll invite this feeling into each of

36
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:04,840
these one by one as a member of the community us as a

37
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:11,840
kalyanita as how in my heart can I tune into these frequencies as if you know

38
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:20,639
these old radios they had they had dials and and and how can I tune into this frequency

39
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,840
that is that is present in my heart to make it more audible to make the song of

40
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:35,440
generosity more audible the the song of of kind speech more audible etc etc so

41
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,720

48
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,479

74
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:27,080
refuge softening our brow especially if it's furoughed

75
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:34,080

outreath or it's most accessible to be known

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:12,399
and as we're sitting the sense of embodiment feeling

80
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:19,279
the breath receiving the gift of this breath the

81

generosity of this lifegiving breath breath we

82
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:32,000
soften and land into a field of

83
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:40,480
generosity that has supported us through our life that we've been a part of this

84
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,120
giving and

85
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:55,959
receiving allowing our heart to feel a little brighter

86
00:16:55,959 --> 00:17:02,000
perhaps recollecting in our heart the sense of a recent act of generosity

87
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,438
we've received not just with money or

88
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:16,480
resources or things but maybe with time with kindness with a

89
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,480
smile

90
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,360
with someone's

91
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:43,400
care again not making this into a thinking practice but dropping this reflection into the

92
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:51,160
heart tuning into this frequency and allowing the

93
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,559
heart to be uplifted

94
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:16,640
the more we tune into this frequency of generosity the more we see it and the more we act out of it

95
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,120
ourselves perhaps now allowing ourselves to

96
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:30,600
recollect some act of generosity maybe a kind word a smile a time some time we

97
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:36,559
spent extra time caring for someone or resources our

98
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:42,240
material resources stepping out outside of

99
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:50,760
ourselves allowing our hearts to be uplifted by this act of generosity donna

100
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:06,120

complicated in breath outreath very simple

108
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:11,520
also to say sometimes when we want to recollect goodness the opposite could

109

oh I think there was one bell right somebody said no bells for me i thought

145

148
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:20,120
um Yeah so many conditions in life

149
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:30,500

00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:37,679
[Music] um on community on friendship on noble

151
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:45,039
friendship spiritual friendship kalana on sana really this relational aspect of

152
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:51,120
the practice which the Buddha has said sana is all of the path it's not just

153
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:59,360
half of the path it's the entirety of the path is is this friend's spiritual friendship is is support of of

154

likehearted like-minded likehearted practitioners

155
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:13,120
so continuing in this theme today I'd like to talk about um what I mentioned a

156
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,440
bit earlier this suta um from the angutra nikaya

157
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:24,080
432 which is called the

158
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:30,519
sanahuta sanahuta the

159
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:38,480
sanahuta excuse me is son again meaning together god to

160
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,679
grasp to hold together literally means gathering together embracing supporting

161
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:52,240
these are the four means of inclusion embracing supporting care gathering

162
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:59,919
uh protecting etc and in this um suta the Buddha says

163
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:06,519
these are the four means by which one sustains and gathers people

164
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:14,158
together and the saha here refers to the principles

165
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,839
and grounds for social cohesion and relational harmony it's what glues it's

166
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:27,358
what binds a sana together it's the ethical emotional glue that binds any

167
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:33,839
group together trust fairness care service it's what binds us together as

168
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:41,679
humans as communities and the uh different teachers by the way

169
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:48,638
different translators have have translated these four have given them different uh titles the the phrase in

170
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:55,280
Pali is Vati and Bikubodi says the four bases of

171
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:01,520
social solidarity tanisariku says the four grounds for embracing others i like

172
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:08,000
embracing it's there's a sweetness to it um sometimes in the Mahayana context

173
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,599
this shows up as the four means of gathering and in interpretive one is uh

174
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:19,119
four ways of creating unity and a less common translation is the four means of

175
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:25,640
support so just in giving you nuances of these four these four are generosity

176
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:34,520
donna kind speech a vaja beneficial action service acting

177
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:41,560
helpfully aiding others supporting others is uh atacharia

178
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:48,800
atacharia and the fourth one is uh impartiality equality participation

179
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:56,400
uh the poly word is sama sama which is relating to others out of without pride

180
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,599
or bias being humble being fair being open inclusive

181
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:08,720
i like to say a little bit about each of these because again so important

182
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:15,599
communities friendships relationships don't happen out of happen stance they

183
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:25,520
take deliberate conscious intentional action to to uh foster this this um a

184
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:30,640
community a sa could be a sa of two sa of three could be a sana of hundreds as

185
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:36,560
we have here so the first and the foremost as mentioned and also by the

186
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:42,240
way in the guided meditation I mentioned them briefly and I also mentioned uh

187
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:48,640
generosity of spirit because in many ways we can think of generosity of spirit

188
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:55,680
uh really capturing all four of them when there's generosity of spirit there's also generosity in action with

189
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:03,440
our resources there is um kindness in speech there is acts of service support

190
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:11,040
and there's also this u seeing others as equal embracing others not with pride or

191
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:18,560
con you know looking down upon anyone but there's a generosity of spirit has humility as a part of it so I I like

192
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:24,320
that as a shorthand and yet we're going to unpack each of them a little more in

193
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:29,920
the time allowed so generosity dana dana

194
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:36,839
the Buddha says in This saha suta on gutra

195
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:43,440
432 through giving one wins the affection of others and generosity is

196
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:50,400
not transactional here of course it's a fundamental relinquishment of clinging

197
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:57,280
that opens the heart imagine opening the hand it opens the heart and it nurtures

198
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:06,160
the field of relationship of friendship And this act of relinquishment opening

199
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:13,119
the hand letting go is is the same act of generosity the hand that lets go of

200
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:21,520
something can give it to someone else al you know it's also the same act of letting go of of um what we're clinging

201
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:27,359
to or maybe even resentment etc it's the same the same liberating act of opening

202
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:35,400
the hand of letting go of softening our grip and and there is

203
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:43,839
um there is modern psychological research that um acts of giving

204
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:50,560
generosity when we are generous ourselves it it activates it the the

205
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,839
reward system uh in our brain pain in our in our bodies the reward system

206
00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:01,839
promoting happiness and social bonding so generosity literally brightens the

207
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:09,880
mind literally lights up the mind and strengthens um social ti social

208
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:17,200
ties a few words about kind speech pavaja pyavaja

209
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:23,320
um as as relational nourishment the Buddha says through kind speech one

210
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:29,599
binds our others to oneself i love the way he puts that through kind speech one

211
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:34,880
binds others to oneself and kind speech

212
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:42,560
again I think I spoke u some some time ago in these series about kind about why

213
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:50,520
speech and and can expand it to a whole week so there there's a lot of teachings on why speech and kind speech but uh it

214
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:59,079
also includes truthfulness timeliness and it it being beneficial uh uh in from

215
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:06,560
majikaya 58 um and also speech that is uh gentle pleasing to the ear

216
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:13,599
affectionate etc agreeable to many from Angutra Nikaya 5198 so there's a lot about wise

217
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:19,119
speech and kind speech uh and and first and foremost right to be truthful

218
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:27,599
truthful timely kind and um yeah there's so much to say

219
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:32,800
about speech I'm just going to to mention very little here in saying that

220
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,640
of course kind speech wise speech beneficial speech timely speech truthful

221
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:46,800
speech it it as the Buddhist says I I can't say it any more beautifully than he has it one binds others to oneself

222
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:54,720
one binds others to oneself so kind speech strengthens trust and

223
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:00,640
communal bonds couple of word a few words about

224
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:08,079
the next of these uh four the third one which is called beneficial conduct which

225
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:15,480
is atacharia atachara atacharia there's the last ah is long

226
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:22,960
atacharia which is the grounds of goodwill uh in action and the Buddha

227
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:31,200
again in this suta in angutraaya 432 says through acting for others welfare

228
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:36,640
one enders oneself so it's it's such a beautiful way that he's talking about

229
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:44,640
right we're both uh being of service to others um as well as there's benefit to oneself

230
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:51,319
benefit to oneself and others through these acts of of welfare for the sake of

231
00:41:51,319 --> 00:41:56,800
others and these acts of welfare of course include offering help in the

232
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:03,760
times of need emotional or psychological support um actions that arise from

233
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:11,440
compassion and non-harming and often described as karuna in action compassion that moves

234
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:17,680
compassion that moves and there are so many Jataka Jataka tales and Jataka

235
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:22,800
tales are the stories of before the Buddha became a Buddha he he was reborn

236
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,839
as so many different animals and in every lifetime

237
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:34,400
uh when he was a bodhicattva he had this vow of of awakening um he there's so

238
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:40,400
many stories he offered limbs and lives and time and effort and energy to the welfare of others and of course his

239
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:46,720
teaching has been an act of of care um for the welfare of others it is said

240
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:53,760
that after he woke he awakened under the bodhic tree he didn't want to teach because he thought nobody would get it

241
00:42:53,760 --> 00:43:00,960
it's so obtuse what he teaches and and out of compassion out of care for the benefit of others he took on the

242
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:09,400
difficulty of being misunderstood and you know all the stories and the sutas of of of uh of

243
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:15,280
teaching so and there's also of course modern research uh which aligns with

244
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:21,200
this that helping uh behavior predicts increase relational satisfaction and

245
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:28,640
trust and there's research uh by Algo and Jonathan H uh that uh that supports

246
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:35,240
that acts of service build build deep reservoir of mutual

247
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:44,680
goodwill and the last one I'll say it very quickly impartiality which is sama nata samaat

248
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:51,440
sata sata fostering respect the Buddha says through treating others equally one

249
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:57,040
dissolves divisions through treating others equally one dissolves divisions

250
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:02,400
so here the idea is having a stance of humility which is free from superiority

251
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:10,480
conceit favoritism and being evenminded with equinimity and unshaken by social

252
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:18,560
status and blame blame um and gain and gain and uh treating others basically

253
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:24,000
breaking barriers of hierarchy and fear and treating others um and and and

254
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,079
Buddha demonstrated this by treating kings untouchable monks lay people with the same basic

255
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:35,680
respect and presence so can we treat one another and other people we meet with

256
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:42,640
the same basic respect and presence in fact I'll just add something very quickly here in this village that I am

257
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:48,880
in Tuscanyany this friend of mine here was commenting that what is what is so beautiful here in this village the

258
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:54,079
barista at the at the coffee shop is treated with the same level of respect

259
00:44:54,079 --> 00:45:01,640
as as anybody else in town and and that's really uplifting to to really see that in a small village in this small

260
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:07,280
community so three reflection questions today again which of the four relational

261
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:12,720
practices of that I mentioned are most alive in me today which of the four

262
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:18,319
relational practices are most alive in me today where could practicing one of

263
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:25,599
these transform a strained or stagnant relationship where could practicing one of these

264
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:30,880
transform a strained or stagnant relationship and lastly do I offer these

265
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:38,960
to all or only to those I already prefer do I offer these to all or only those I

266
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:46,040
already prefer so again which of the four of these is more alive in me today

267
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:52,480
um where could practicing one of these transform a strained or a stagnant

268
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:59,040
relationship for example is there a challenging relationship that by bringing more generosity by giving that

269
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:04,800
person a gift could open my heart uh will open their heart without any

270
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:11,440
expectation of return at all but just to open my heart and give them a gift and

271
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:18,920
um do I offer these all to to everyone equally or only those I prefer

272
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:26,000
so so thank you all thank you for your presence your generosity of presence to

273
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,839
to hold together uh to hold each other in this way in this community and

274
