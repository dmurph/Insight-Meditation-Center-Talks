1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,399
so

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,480
so the topic much of this week is

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,320
step nine of mindfulness of breathing

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,720
and this is the step where we're

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,160
experiencing the mind

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,800
and i hope that the way i'm presenting

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,480
the mind is something

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,439
that's not not trying to define it in

9
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,279
ways that you have to fit your

10
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,320
yourself into the definition but rather

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,920
that it's um

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,559
i think it's uh pointing to how you

13
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:39,760
experience

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,600
the mind the mental state mind state

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,559
heart state that there's a lot of room

16
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,360
here

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,360
for you to find your own way to this

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,000
and um but one of the ways to appreciate

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,800
it

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,160
is that um we're moving into

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,520
the the

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,680
the the the sum total

23
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,119
of how we experience the mind

24
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,200
the pasta practice often has a big

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,520
emphasis on particularity

26
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,000
really seeing the particularity of the

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
in-breath the out-breath of sensations

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,439
that they occur

29
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,240
my you know the particular particular

30
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,840
activities of the mind as they come in

31
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,280
to go

32
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,400
and and

33
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,720
uh and uh but there's also some way that

34
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,759
part of the particular is also the

35
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,880
harmonious working of all this together

36
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,119
or the kind of the awareness or the

37
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,600
knowing that knows it all

38
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,880
and exactly whether mind and awareness

39
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,840
are the same

40
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,720
knowing is the same or not you know it's

41
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,079
very hard to kind of pin

42
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,759
down these things to know exactly what

43
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,200
the mind is or

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,960
consciousness or all these kinds of

45
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,438
things that are belong to this rather

46
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,840
i don't know if amorphous is the right

47
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,799
word

48
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,640
but uh difficult to define uh

49
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,599
qualities or experiences of our

50
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,800
interiority of

51
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,480
inner life and

52
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,879
and you'll see now in a moment maybe why

53
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,000
it's difficult to kind of

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,200
put words on it and define it exactly is

55
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,440
that

56
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,040
the concepts that we live with the ideas

57
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,040
that we have

58
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,920
about our experience actually shapes our

59
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,280
experience

60
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,519
we are not innocent bystanders of our

61
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,720
experience

62
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,560
that whatever happens to us whatever

63
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,920
experience we're having

64
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,440
that it's only happening to us

65
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,080
we're also contributing to some degree

66
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,920
to that experience

67
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,560
that certainly there are clear things

68
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,120
that happen to us

69
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,879
so to choose something relatively

70
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,280
innocent perhaps

71
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,640
if i go out um

72
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,920
well i'll give you the example i've

73
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,760
taught many times and i was thinking

74
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,239
about it

75
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,319
today when i was biking down here it was

76
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,040
cold biking down here this morning

77
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,480
is um kind of a revelation from you many

78
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,319
many years ago was living in

79
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,200
central california and going to college

80
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:21,760
at a

81
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,879
college called davis and um

82
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,840
and it was um that is fog early morning

83
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,400
fog

84
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,200
thule fog and in the winter time the

85
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,519
cold fog was really cold

86
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,920
and and i didn't have any gloves and i

87
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,519
would bike to school

88
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,440
and the first five ten minutes of being

89
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,080
in class i couldn't actually use my pen

90
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,400
because my hand was still frozen and so

91
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,360
you know so

92
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,680
it was so cold so i used to uh

93
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,360
for a while i was biking to school this

94
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,000
way and kind of feeling miserable

95
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,439
sorry for myself and it was so terrible

96
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,959
this cold that i felt and

97
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,360
and then at one point i kind of had a

98
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,879
memory

99
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,560
that exactly the same feeling of cold

100
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,439
that i was having biking to school was

101
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,040
as far best of my memory

102
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,040
exactly the same feeling of cold i had

103
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,320
in my fingers

104
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,479
as a kid when i used to go skiing and

105
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:22,320
and that skiing it was exhilarating it

106
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,400
was fun it was fantastic it was part of

107
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,040
the

108
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,160
richness of the whole experience and i

109
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,320
realized that

110
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,320
that how i was experiencing the same

111
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,320
sensation

112
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,639
vary depending on the interpretation i

113
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,960
had it the context i put on it the ideas

114
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,720
i had about it

115
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,040
and after that biking didn't become so

116
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,320
difficult anymore

117
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,880
i realized that i was adding something

118
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,800
to the experience of cold

119
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,639
i was adding self-pity and this is going

120
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,479
to be tough and hard and i don't know

121
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,240
what i was adding exactly

122
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,080
and then it became just a matter of fact

123
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,080
and simple to have the cold

124
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,680
it was still cold and a little bit

125
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,080
painful but i didn't complicate it so

126
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,600
much with all the

127
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
ideas that were kind of subconscious

128
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,199
almost i didn't really realize how much

129
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,479
i was doing

130
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,479
i thought it was just the cold the cold

131
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,919
was the cold was painful was bad

132
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,320
but we contribute to the experience we

133
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,680
have interpretations

134
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,160
meaning making predictions of what it

135
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,120
means

136
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,080
we have self-referential feelings about

137
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,280
it this means that

138
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,080
i you know if maybe have self-pity about

139
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,320
things are difficult or

140
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,960
self-congratulations for things that are

141
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,919
good

142
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,320
and these inner movements of the mind

143
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,160
may be very subtle we don't necessarily

144
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,360
see them

145
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,919
but they are kind of helping to shape

146
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,560
our experience

147
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,120
and give kind of the totality the

148
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,720
gestalt of it

149
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,440
as we practice mindfulness we can start

150
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,000
teasing apart

151
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,400
the different component elements that

152
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,160
are all glum together

153
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,160
we can see that self-pity is self-pity

154
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,919
it's different than the cold

155
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,479
we can see that the the way that we're

156
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,080
worried about the future

157
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,199
that comes pulls into the my experience

158
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,560
of cold for example

159
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,720
is just my thoughts about the future and

160
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,800
we begin kind of teasing apart all this

161
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,720
the component elements

162
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,080
and and as we do that we begin actually

163
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,759
freeing the mind

164
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,639
we begin rather than glomming on or

165
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,160
focusing on it

166
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,960
then we begin to free it because not

167
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,120
only is our experience

168
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,880
you know like for example of me of the

169
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,160
cold partly shaped by my relationship to

170
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,199
it

171
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,319
but it's also shaping how i might

172
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,400
experience the mind

173
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,560
the mind gets contracted it gets tight

174
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,919
it gets small

175
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,240
the mind gets hot agitated and you can

176
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,400
the inner mood the state of mind that we

177
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,360
have

178
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,240
shifts and changes also depending on

179
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,840
what we're focusing on and how we're

180
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,560
focusing on it in relationship to things

181
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,840
so we're also in a sense shaping how we

182
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,440
experience the mind or how

183
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,800
the mind can be felt whether that's the

184
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,919
mind itself who knows what the mind is

185
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,479
but how we experience the mind is what

186
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,599
we're really working with

187
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,360
in this practice here and so the mind is

188
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,520
also being shaped

189
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,080
and and the language of the early

190
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,280
tradition

191
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,800
is that the concepts we are focusing on

192
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,720
fixating on creates limits

193
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,960
creates a boundary to the mind an edge

194
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,720
to the mind

195
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,960
but as we stop focusing so much on the

196
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,120
things and our preoccupations and

197
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,120
all this activities of the mind the

198
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,840
activities of the mind get quieter and

199
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,479
quieter

200
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,680
the shape the way which we kind of shape

201
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,680
the feeling of the mind the sense of the

202
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,639
mind

203
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,280
begins to lose its edges its its

204
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,319
coagulation

205
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,440
its contraction its its gathering

206
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,240
together

207
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,440
and it becomes more open more spacious

208
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,240
and

209
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,759
after a while you can almost feel like

210
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,280
there's no boundaries to

211
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,319
the mind or no boundaries to awareness

212
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,039
or

213
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,400
no boundary uh boundaries to the state

214
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,919
that we're in

215
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,479
and to use a little bit dangerous word

216
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,120
from what i said earlier

217
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,639
no boundaries to consciousness

218
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,840
and and it isn't so much again important

219
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,240
what

220
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,440
all these words point to

221
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,800
the wonderful thing is the experience of

222
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,000
no more edges no more boundaries

223
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,360
and the mind starts feeling

224
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,640
large great expansive

225
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,720
wide and and this is one of the things

226
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,200
that

227
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,680
can be experienced as we deepen this

228
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,200
meditation practice

229
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,160
is the mind becomes expansive becomes

230
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,279
wide

231
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,720
in zen they called it a big mind

232
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,760
and uh as opposed to the small mind

233
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,920
and the expansive mind rather than the

234
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,760
contracted mind

235
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,480
the and the the more expensive it gets

236
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,920
the calmer it becomes the less agitated

237
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,800
it is

238
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,519
in the similar that the space empty

239
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,240
space

240
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,360
you know kind of has no agitation and

241
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,480
they say that um

242
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,040
it's um you know that mind becomes

243
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,720
similar to space

244
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,160
so less and less agitation and calm it

245
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,399
also helps make the mind more malleable

246
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,839
and shapeable

247
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,519
because when we're really fixated on

248
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,519
something the mind becomes

249
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,320
hard maybe even brittle and kind of

250
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,760
fixated also and

251
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,839
if you do the same habit of mind over

252
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,760
and over and over again for decades

253
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,600
the mind gets kind of locked into being

254
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
a particular way it's hard to

255
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,160
soften it but with meditation enough

256
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,720
time it begins to soften and relax and

257
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,519
it becomes malleable and shapeable and

258
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,760
one of the ways the mind can be

259
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,880
and then more what happens when the mind

260
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,880
becomes more shapeable or malleable

261
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,279
or soft and is it's easier and easier to

262
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,880
train the mind

263
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,760
it's easier and easier to get the mind

264
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,640
focused and

265
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,320
centered settled and

266
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,800
and that allows for some of the more

267
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,160
beautiful qualities of the mind to shine

268
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,320
the mind that's fixated and bounded and

269
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,839
limited by its agitation and

270
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,440
preoccupation

271
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,440
doesn't really allow for the luminosity

272
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,920
of the mind to show itself

273
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,040
the clarity of the mind the cl

274
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,000
the mind feel that feels clean the mind

275
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,920
that feels

276
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,320
bright

277
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,440
so

278
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,079
this gestalt this wide sense of

279
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,800
the attitude of mind the state of mind

280
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,560
the mood of mind the quality of

281
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,079
awareness

282
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,519
that is so wide that it includes

283
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,440
all things and it includes our suffering

284
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,240
not to deny it but to give it a very

285
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,240
different context

286
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,120
than if our relationship is is like a

287
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,320
locked on

288
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,440
to our suffering and it's possible to

289
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,079
suffer

290
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,440
of different kinds and

291
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,200
and not lock on and to feel that

292
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,720
the suffering being held or existing in

293
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,360
this much

294
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,480
wider broader context has certain kind

295
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,640
of ease or calm

296
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,120
that also allows to have compassion for

297
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,000
suffering

298
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,800
there's space for friendliness and care

299
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,680
for it

300
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,360
as a that's maybe more difficult when

301
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,240
we're locked into it

302
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,839
so there's a lot of benefits to

303
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,440
discovering

304
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,000
the this mindfulness of the mind

305
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,639
and for an anapanasati the mindfulness

306
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,240
of breathing practice

307
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,800
we train ourselves to breathe with the

308
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,839
mind

309
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,920
breathing in one breathes with one

310
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,760
experiences the mind breathing out one

311
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,760
experiences the mind

312
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,639
and as always with anapanasati this

313
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,040
rhythm of breathing in and breathing out

314
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,279
is meant to keep us from getting fixated

315
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,720
on anything

316
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,000
including fixated on the mind so they're

317
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,079
just a fluid and relaxed

318
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,680
with the breathing breathing in with the

319
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,959
mind breathing out with the mind

320
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,600
so um how about taking care of one's

321
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,200
body by getting mittens

322
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,079
or wool socks over hands these days i

323
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,279
drive i bike down

324
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,800
with mittens on my hands on with gloves

325
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,800
i just was not smart enough when i was a

326
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,240
college student

327
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,920
for that even to occur to me i didn't

328
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,920
have gloves and never

329
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,440
never passed my mind so some of us um

330
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,160
you know it takes a while to become wise

331
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,399
about how to take care of ourselves

332
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,320
but in the meantime i got a very good

333
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,959
lesson from my story with uh

334
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,920
with the um you know my cold hands

335
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,040
so thank you very much

336
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,120
you
