so so for our practice um this evening what I wanted to do is

6
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:38,040
actually um uh try something a little different which is not say so much about what I'm

7
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:45,300
going to do sometimes I frame it sometimes I give a little darmet ahead of time and sometimes I do the guided

8
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,760
meditation and say something about it afterwards so tonight what we're going

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:57,239
to do which is different which is what I do but but not as frequently is let's just sit together

10
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,879
let's just sit together and and explore with a sense of curiosity these

11
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,240
invitations for for settling in the body with the heart with

12
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:16,200
[Music] um yeah with meta with kindness Good Will with sense of presence and and see what

13
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:23,040
what unfolds with a sense of curiosity let that let that lead us so

14
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,540
so without further Ado Let's uh let's sit together

15
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,540
her sitting in a chair there be a sense of Integrity to our

16
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:48,060
body maybe sitting a little more upright be rolling our shoulders back

17
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,520

flat on the Earth if you're sitting on a chair

19
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:05,820
a sense of integrity of course you could be lying down

20
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:12,480
if that's what the body needs right now make sure maybe your arm is at 90 degrees or

21
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:19,080

73
00:12:55,019 --> 00:13:01,560
project rolling to breath no let the breath happen just as it has

74

or others for ourselves

164
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:35,640
so today's practice was subtle I admit

165
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:42,440
but that was the intention not so much the words of

166
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:48,780
meta but but the subtleness of Goodwill that can be very subtle really imbued in

167
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:55,020
the fact that we're showing up for ourselves with others there's so much good will so much meta

168
00:37:55,020 --> 00:38:02,280
and The Meta of of non-entanglement in what arises subtle

169
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:08,700
but profound cherries as well what a nourishing practice

170
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:14,579
thank you for their reflection Jerry I'm glad it it felt it was nourishing for

171
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:21,380

and also nothing that has to be said it's it's all okay

185
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:54,180
it was nourishing right it wasn't maybe there was one

186
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:59,339
nourishing moment yay celebrating that beauty that

187
00:39:59,339 --> 00:40:06,060
that goodness yeah maybe I'll say one more thing if there

188
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:13,020
are no reflections and that is this this idea this concept of

189
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:20,820
living a beautiful life and it's not an external concept it's an

190
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:27,780
internal it's not you know there's so many different concepts of beauty it's not about things

191
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:33,000
it's not about ease in in the external setting of our world but it's there's a

192
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,359
sense of internal beauty internal wholesomeness internal goodness living a

193
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:45,900
beautiful life internally there could be plenty of challenges plenty of pain in the body challenges in our lives

194
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:54,240
difficult emotions it's all part of it but moments of Grace Beauty touching

195
00:40:54,240 --> 00:41:03,740
into this this dimensionality of of of life that is both ours and and Beyond

196
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:11,460
Beyond ours big bigger than and me there's a sense of perhaps interdependence that arises maybe it's

197
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:16,920
through all maybe it's through love through loving kindness through just the

198
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:22,740
sense of ethical Integrity there's a sense of beauty living a beautiful life

199
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:30,180
and can feel very simple it's not complicated somewhat like the invitations tonight

200
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:34,640
very simple but profound

201
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:46,280
[Music] so how about we turn

202
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:53,170
now to uh sit together in small groups

203
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:59,280
[Music] um in maybe group sizes roughly size of

204
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:05,390
three we'll see how it turns out and the invitation is

205
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:10,920
[Music] um is to maybe share if you if something

206
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:16,740
arises you don't have to talk you can just hold silence High silent presence

207
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:24,900
with others um it's a gift to yourself as a gift to others and the prompt is I'll give you a

208
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:33,960
prompt actually um feeling into an internal internal sense of beauty an

209
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:39,060
internal sense of beauty internal sense of beauty when I invite

210
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:45,599
you to conjure up or feel into a sense of beauty

211
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:51,780
um internal beauty living a beautiful life in a way or however those words

212
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:57,660
might work for you sense of beauty sense of Grace sense of presence sense of

213
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:03,300
service love whatever that however that beauty expresses for you maybe you say a

214
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:09,180
few words if you wish about that or maybe not maybe sense of beauty internal

215
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:14,220
beauty is expressed for you by holding silent presence for others like oh yeah

216
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:21,780
this is how I offer my internal beauty tonight it's perfectly fine if you do share intend to say something say

217
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:27,000
something brief make space for another person maybe they say pass

218
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,420
or maybe they say something and then the next person and then they'll come to you so you can go around and round if you

219
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:40,859
wish or you can pass every time but then be patient no sense of inner beauty

220
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:47,460
sense of Beauty in her life Beauty what is the sense of beauty that yeah maybe

221
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:55,920
you have an inkling towards maybe there's a sense of oh yeah I feel sense of beauty when I'm I'm aligned with my

222
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:02,160
ethic with my ethics when I don't just open my mouth and just say whatever

223
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:09,599
comes like actually you know there is a sense of beauty there's a sense of goodness maybe that's when the sense of

224
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:16,079
um Beauty shows up or maybe when I'm really serving or loving or or whatever

225
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:23,160
it might be so so with that I'm going to open the rooms
