okay welcome welcome folks good morning to uh to those for whom it's morning

2
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:15,179

3
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:20,520
and uh guide a guy to say it anyways lovely to see

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,720
so many familiar names YouTube crew going strong

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,020
ah to Sangha okay

6
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,700
um let's uh let's sit together

7
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:30,140
and when someone says to you let's sit together start meditating

8
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,298
what do you start doing

9
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,780
what gets tight what loosens up

10
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:05,100
to where do you retreat in the headquarters of your own

11
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,100
perspective

12
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,879
and if I

13
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:00,019
told you to stay just where you are

14
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,720
but stop meditating

15
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:12,440
what would you stop doing

16
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,879
and what cannot be stopped

17
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,019
thank you

18
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:21,620
I told you to stop being aware you couldn't do it

19
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:38,539
as we begin whatever cannot be stopped

20
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,639
rest there

21
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,080
foreign

22
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,880
just open receptive

23
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:58,580
and we don't let the fact that we can direct our attention direct the attentional spotlight

24
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,979
to the breath or to whatever we don't let the fact that we direct the

25
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:12,259
attentional spotlight distract us completely

26
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:17,880
from the openness

27
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,139
of awareness

28
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:41,060
from a kind of awareness that

29
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:45,300
in no way depends

30
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,819
on what we call me okay

31
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:31,700
foreign maybe what I'm trying to say

32
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,860
as we begin with wise View

33
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,839
we launch our efforts from Wise View

34
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:37,800
it is a often useful to

35
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:45,540
draw some line that distinguishes the

36
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:50,540
object of attention

37
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:56,360
from everything else

38
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:10,699
however wide you draw that Circle may be useful to draw it

39
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:27,060
and often useful to draw the circle right around

40
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,860
the sensations of breathing

41
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:45,139
receiving the rhythm of your own breathing

42
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:08,660
this breath that some sense registers everything else

43
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:18,199
and so to attend to the breath is to honor the rest of your life

44
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:53,240
being nourished by uh cycles of your own breath

45
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:07,919
just because we draw the circle of attention around sensations of her

46
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:14,100
breath doesn't mean that everything outside

47
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:20,520
that Circle is

48
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,520
suspicious

49
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:35,460
all experience is equally innocent

50
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,360
be treated as such

51
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:06,260
and gently inclining towards

52
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:13,160
inside the circle of attentional space

53
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,779
letting your mind take its cues

54
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:32,600
from the cycles of the breath

55
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,778
foreign

56
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,380
foreign

57
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,559
okay there's two uh nice to sit with you

58
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:23,940
so um I forgot to introduce myself I'm Matthew

59
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:29,039
um uh yeah happy to um

60
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:34,940
that's not a good introduction on Matthew I teach meditation

61
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:41,760
um I'm happy to uh I was happy when Gil asked me to to uh spend time with you

62
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:48,659
all and um yeah we'll um I'll be here this week so

63
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:53,880
so I I thought to do a list of five uh

64
00:31:53,880 --> 00:32:00,000
and um the five faculties five spiritual Powers

65
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,520
um uh faith and energy mindfulness samadhi

66
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:12,679
concentration wisdom and uh when

67
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:20,760
if you look at that list that's a powerful powerful combination of forces powerful

68
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:27,659
combination of forces so so faith

69
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:35,039
um the path really begins not so much with faith but with a

70
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:40,158
doubt and the doubt is

71
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:45,899
um this isn't gonna work out

72
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:51,480
that launches us into the sincerity of practice and the sooner we realize that

73
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:59,880
the better this isn't going to work out the way I've been approaching

74
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:06,720
my life the way I've been trying to govern some Sarah this ungovernable

75
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:12,679
realm this can't actually work out

76
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:18,720
and that recognition sets us on a kind of

77
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:26,760
course and so how how is how is Faith born

78
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:34,140
usually we understand suffering as an effect suffering is the effect

79
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:40,380
of craving clinging but suffering is also a Cause

80
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,760
causes things

81
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:54,539
says faith has a supporting condition I say it does not lack a

82
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:59,640
supporting condition and what is the supporting condition for faith

83
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:04,278
suffering should be the reply

84
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:11,158
and Gill puts it this way

85
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:17,700
um just as one first must know oneself to be lost in order to search away for a

86
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:24,179
way out of the Jungle so one must know one is suffering in order to start a process that frees one from that

87
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:31,560
suffering between knowing one is suffering and starting to walk a path to Freedom

88
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:37,440
there needs to be adequate confidence in the path and in one's capacity to walk

89
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:46,679
it this type of faith is not dogmatism it

90
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:52,260
has a certain kind of respect for the empirical Sensibility

91
00:34:52,260 --> 00:35:00,839
the Buddha was very sophisticated on these questions and

92
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:06,420
we know that uh you know again and again clinging to views is one of the

93
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:13,500
Wellsprings of suffering and whatever the opposite of fundamentalism is

94
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:18,079
the Dharma is a path to it

95
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:25,200
uh ajan ajanamara says um belief fills

96
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:33,839
um belief fills the unknown with certainties Faith trusts the implications of your

97
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:39,060
experience trusting the implications of your

98
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:45,380
experience I was

99
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:51,660
I was interviewed a few few days ago

100
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:57,420
about dharma's stuff and um the interviewer asked like how did you

101
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:03,480
get into practice how did you become committed to to the path

102
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:10,920
and it struck me that um it's a little like asking why did you

103
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:16,980
fall in love with that person so when you ask somebody ask a couple

104
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:23,540
people okay why'd you fall in love tend to give very

105
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:29,040
kind of superficial answers not very believable

106
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:34,760
you know they say things like well we both like spicy food or something

107
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:40,740
it's like okay that's nice yeah like spicy food

108
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:47,820
too it's like I'm not so sure you know why you fell in love with that person yeah

109
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:53,700
and uh who knows why we fall in love

110
00:36:53,700 --> 00:37:00,540
with anything it's often seems to me quite opaque to oneself

111
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:10,519
and a faith faith is a kind of form of Falling in Love

112
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:19,619
it's not so much a commitment to these propositions agreeing with these tenets

113
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:25,880
or something it's like Falling in Love and

114
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:33,540
yeah the heart in some sense of recognition the hard

115
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:37,280
returning to its native ground

116
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:46,140
Emerson said the the definition of spiritual should be that which is its

117
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:52,380
own evidence and teachers

118
00:37:52,380 --> 00:38:01,859
teachers try to nudge Us in this direction yeah but um you can't force anyone to fall in

119
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:08,040
love with anything and

120
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:13,619
you can never really know where love is going to go but you know that you have

121
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:17,000
to see through

122
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:29,579
now just as one doesn't fall in love with a static person you cannot hold

123
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:35,700
the another being still the sense of the path and the love

124
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:42,619
for it that evolves too it changes to um

125
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:51,839
Maggie Maggie Nelson says uh whenever the lover utters the phrase

126
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:57,599
I love you it's meaning must be renewed by each use

127
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:05,420
as the very task of love and of language is to give one in the same phrase

128
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:12,980
inflections which will for uh which will be forever new

129
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:20,280
I take refuge take refuge in Buddha dhamma Sangha I

130
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:26,480
love you these phrases are renewed renewed new

131
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,560
inflections each time

132
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:41,700
as uh as a teacher I see people across a certain

133
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:47,160
threshold where the faith is stabilizes or it's strong enough that

134
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:54,540
there's no there's no going back to leave practice would be uh to abandon

135
00:39:54,540 --> 00:40:02,940
One's Own Heart and there's a certain kind of Security in that because up until then

136
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:09,140
there's a certain a wobble maybe in the path

137
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:14,579
and I associate

138
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:22,700
associate Faith with relaxation with relaxation

139
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:28,680
with a certain kind of ease we relax into our faith

140
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:34,140
and one of its gifts is that where

141
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:41,400
not um excuse me we're not compulsively looking for

142
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:50,099
evidence that we're on the right track we're not uh just trying to Ping to some Metric

143
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:57,780
the of our okayness that that this is our path it's like no that's actually settled

144
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:06,500
heart has returned to its native ground and we become naturally just less

145
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:12,619
self-absorbed in faith in our confidence it's less about me more about

146
00:41:12,619 --> 00:41:18,500
path or kind of humble efforts to walk it

147
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:26,040
as we we develop this um this confidence in our practice

148
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:31,800
confidence in our heart in a sense

149
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:39,599
um on each the changingness of all things becomes at least a little bit less

150
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:47,280
intimidating faith means that however however life

151
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:53,160
unfolds we we know our practice will

152
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:57,799
will be there and uh

153
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:07,740
yeah we have a certain a confidence confidence in the potency

154
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:15,060
of awareness and love and there's a certain kind of coziness I

155
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:21,980
associate with that yeah it doesn't mean that that uh

156
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:29,540
samsara the cracks in samsara have been healed by any stretch

157
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:38,180
and um of course experience will be difficult times

158
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:43,980
sometimes overwhelmingly so maybe

159
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:49,800
but um our faith the the Dharma confidence in

160
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:55,200
it will always be at least a subtle

161
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:01,220
consolation and often profound one

162
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:08,720
and so we breathe a little more easily and

163
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:15,318
rest and keep going

164
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:23,940

165
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:31,099
care consideration please pick up what's useful leave the rest behind

166
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:40,920
okay so uh so thank you thank you all
