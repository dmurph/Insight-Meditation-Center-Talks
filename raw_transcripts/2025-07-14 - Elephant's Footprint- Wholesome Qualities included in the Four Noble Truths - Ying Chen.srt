1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,520
So, good morning. Can I check the sound again? If it

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,360
changed anything, it's good. All right. Um,

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:18,960
and a good day for those who are joining through the the uh invisible

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:26,720
electrons and the web. So, I'm very happy to be here. Feel like

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,160
I haven't been here for a while. So it just really uh evoke a sense of a coming

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:39,719
home and so good to be with you all this morning. Um

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:51,039
so I brought a teaching today um that's inspired by um a suta. This is called

8
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:58,160
the simile of the elephant's footprint. Some of you may know this and those of

9
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:06,240
you who are interested in uh reading sutas might have come across this um

10
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:13,360
and and this particular simile elephant's footprint um this teaching is

11
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,040
deeply connected with the teachings of the four noble truth

12
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,240
um and I'll say more about this particular teaching

13
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,960
um and the for noble truth um is something that um taught across many

14
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,240
different Buddhist traditions quite well known

15
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:43,520
and uh the perspectives that I will be drawing um from uh for this teaching

16
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,439
will come from uh something that's inspired uh by this particular simile

17
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,680
and by this particular teaching and as well as um some of uh my ongoing

18
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,320
reflections. So the teachings of the four noble truth

19
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:10,640
uh I'll just uh briefly mention it and then we'll uh dive in a little more

20
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,480
and so uh this is um uh there are four

21
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:23,280
truth maybe enobbling truth and I personally feel a little shy

22
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:30,400
saying the word truth because it evokes many different associations with it that

23
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:37,519
may or may not be helpful. Um, but I like the sometimes the translation of it

24
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:45,360
um, saka and the pali word and and also means real, something that's real that

25
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,599
we can feel tangibly uh, in our own lives, our own experience.

26
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:58,160
And so the uh first thing that's real called the truth is the noble truth of

27
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:05,920
aduka. Um translation of aduka might be suffering stress and this is where the

28
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,920
challenges starts. Um often in our cure culture we don't

29
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:19,280
like it. So uh you know it's easy to skip over very quickly from the first

30
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,840
one. But it continues and that there is also

31
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,120
uh the origin or the cause of duca and

32
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:40,000
that is craving, grasping, clinging and there is the end of dooka

33
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:48,080
uh which is the craving the very craving can end grasping can end

34
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:56,080
as it gets better. sometimes they don't listen long enough to get to. And

35
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:04,319
there is a practice path that allows us to cultivate our own hearts and minds

36
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:10,159
that um allows the fruit of ending duka

37
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,280
to come forth. So it does get better as this teaching

38
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,479
unfolds. And this is a rather signific

39
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:27,440
significant teaching and that the insights into this four

40
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,840
noble truth is what liberated uh Gautma

41
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,960
for Goatma to become the Buddha. And so it's insights into this four things that

42
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,440
are real in our lives that brought liberation for the Buddha.

43
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:54,479
And and the tradition uh sometimes holds that

44
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:00,639
this is the first teaching the Buddha offered. And some of you may know this.

45
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:08,800
This is the uh the teachings on setting in motion the dharma wheel. And so the

46
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,960
teachings began to turn from the very first teaching that the Buddha offered

47
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:22,800
and it began to roll on and on and on all the way to today this point.

48
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,680
And so it's a first turning of the dharma wheel. And this is the teaching

49
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,759
the Buddha offered uh which is the four noble truth and the insights the 12

50
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:42,199
insights that arose through the practice.

51
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:50,720
And yet uh the teaching can often be overlooked and and then practitioners sometimes can

52
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:59,199
uh feel that I got it, you know, I know this and and um in uh kind of a culture

53
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:07,360
um maybe modern culture that uh we're not always so friendly to pain and

54
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:15,120
distress. And so we can be uh conditioned to quickly uh skip over the

55
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:22,360
teaching and it just kind of turning away from it.

56
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:30,880
And so our relationship to this teaching uh can be on the surface level.

57
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:37,199
And Ajang Suchito uh said this four noble truth teaching is an advanced

58
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:44,880
teaching. Um uh it calls forth our attention, our curiosity,

59
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,080
our interest in this. In the first turning of the dharma

60
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:58,080
wheel, the Buddha uh before he taught um he uh

61
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,440
contemplated and he thought, you know, like a who

62
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:10,720
should I teach first and um uh it occurred to him, you know,

63
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:18,160
he couldn't just go on the street and tell anyone, you know, look, this is what I'm going to teach you. And uh he

64
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,400
actually reflected he thought oh uh maybe it's this um uh he was

65
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,960
practicing with the five aesthetic um practitioners for a long time. his

66
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:37,759
aesthetic um companions uh who had practiced with him in various

67
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:44,560
ways in the spiritual training spiritual practice before uh the Buddha

68
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,639
uh went on his own uh and all the way uh led to his awakening.

69
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,720
So he thought well uh and this is a a a group of people

70
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:04,240
uh who may have little dusts in their eyes. You may have heard this phrase

71
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,440
and that maybe I should begin with them.

72
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:15,759
So he went about and found the five aesthetic practitioners, aesthetic

73
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:22,080
um companions and uh offered the teaching uh of the

74
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,360
four noble truth and the 12 insights to them.

75
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:34,159
And we're very fortunate uh in the course of unfolding uh this particular

76
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:43,919
teaching, one of the five got it. So this is uh venerable uh Kondania.

77
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:51,760
So uh the suta said he opened the dharma eyes. He saw it, he felt it and the

78
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,959
Buddha felt it. He got it. Wow. You know, so the Buddha got really fired up

79
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:03,200
and he said, "Wow, okay, someone will understand this."

80
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,800
And so he went on started teaching the remaining four and

81
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:17,279
he just kind of kept on going and right from there it launched his 40 plus years

82
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:24,399
of teaching career and I feel very fortunate you know and

83
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:31,120
this is the beginning of a forming of the SA beginning a forming of the long

84
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:38,080
teaching um uh uh endeavor that the Buddha uh

85
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:44,640
launched in and then we are the beneficiaries of this first turning

86
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:52,720
and sometimes I would imagine what if none of them got it what would happen

87
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,160
so I didn't let myself thinking about that too much but so here we are so I

88
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:04,880
feel very fortunate and And uh

89
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:12,160
what I was also struck uh is uh in the parini pana suta which is a

90
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:22,079
long suta that uh documented the last days um of the Buddha's life. Um

91
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:28,000
and here the Buddha again highlighted the teachings of the four

92
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:36,959
noble truth. Then I want to read uh a little from this. And then he said, "Practitioners,

93
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:44,079
due to not understanding and not penetrating the for noble truth,

94
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:49,440
both you and I have wondered and transmigrated

95
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,640
for such a very long time.

96
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,800
I feel so tender. Just listen to this.

97
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:08,000
He knew and he didn't say just you you and I you and I because we didn't

98
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,560
understood this for noble truth and really penetrated it

99
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,920
that we wandered and transmigrated for

100
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:29,279
such a long time. It really touches me to hear this.

101
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:36,560
And then notice also uh the words that are used and that is uh not

102
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,760
understanding and not penetrating it.

103
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:48,720
And so this is not this a kind of a surface level we just got it you know we read it somewhere and then we just okay

104
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:55,519
now I'm done with that. But it's penetrating it. Penetrating it have a

105
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:02,480
flavor of kind of there's a fullness of human life knowingness

106
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,480
not just in our intellect. And I've been reading uh this book um by

107
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,639
Philip Moffett called Dancing with Life um the four noble truth and then 12

108
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:22,079
insights teaching. And so uh here uh he says in this book

109
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:29,200
the for noble truth uh is not just a summary guideline a creed or a statement

110
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:35,360
of a philosophy but an actual practice of insight and a

111
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:45,880
realization in and of itself. It's a teaching on how to live wisely.

112
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:56,160
That's quite something. How to live wisely through this? Is this our something

113
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:02,040
real? It's in our lives.

114
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:08,320
So I am um personally affected um by

115
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:18,079
um my dharma teachers, my teachers and u maybe their teachers in how um they have

116
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:23,920
spent decades reflecting uh articulating practicing with this

117
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:33,120
teaching and I know for for Gil Gil Franto for probably decades in IMC See

118
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:39,920
um the first teaching of the new year is the four noble truth teaching. Some of

119
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:46,000
you may know this may be aware of this. Every year new year the first talk that

120
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:54,360
Gil Gil gives is around a for noble truth and it's never the same.

121
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,399
Um and uh uh Philip Muffet who wrote this

122
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:06,720
book, Dancing with Life, and he would tell us that he spent years to write

123
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:15,760
this book because he had to practice with it. He had to reflect it, contemplate it um a

124
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,880
lot and it's ongoing process to this day.

125
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,639
And so uh for me, you know, I dedicated my life this year around the for noble

126
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:32,160
truth. So you're kind of receiving a little bit of vibe through my own

127
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:38,160
reflection and contemplation and practicing with it. And I have to

128
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,839
say confess that I haven't gone very far in this whole process. I feel like I'm

129
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:49,279
kind of repeatedly going from um the basics

130
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:56,160
and I feel like I'm not in a big rush and I really enjoy the process of it

131
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:05,279
and so uh today I hope and this also evokes some curiosity in you.

132
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:11,519
So um I want to go back to the simile of the elephant footprint.

133
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:17,519
And so this is suta the teaching was offered by the Buddha's great disciple

134
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:24,560
one of the chief disciples Sar Puta and he offered a very detailed

135
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:30,880
elaboration of the four noble truth and he started this with a very powerful

136
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:38,880
simile. So this is what it says. The footprints of all creatures that

137
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:44,000
walk can fit inside an elephant's footprint.

138
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,959
So an elephant's footprint is said to be the biggest of them all. In the same

139
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:56,079
way, all skillful or wholesome qualities

140
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:01,720
are included in the four noble truths.

141
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:08,240
And for me often in this similes I like to just stop kind of imagining a little

142
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:16,240
bit what what does it feel like? What does what what evokes in me? And so I

143
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:25,199
paused and just thought a little bit, you know, about all the animals I can think of that walk

144
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:31,040
how big their footprints are. And I realized this feels right. You know the

145
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:37,279
elephant footprint is probably the biggest that can hold hold it all. And

146
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:46,320
so in this way the four noble truth teaching has a flavor of encompassing.

147
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:53,120
It's all encompassing in some way. And sometimes you may hear uh the

148
00:16:53,120 --> 00:17:01,440
teachers would say like you know um uh the Buddhist teachings can fit all fit

149
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:08,798
in the for noble truth teaching and the Buddha taught uh duka and voduka

150
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:16,079
and and kind of that's the short hand but this particular statement uh is a

151
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:23,520
little different uh from that particular inter uh uh um kind of uh pointing

152
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:31,520
and here Saruta said this that is very specific and he said all wholesome

153
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:39,440
qualities are included in the for noble truth. The poly term is a cusola sometimes also

154
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:47,520
translated as skillful qualities. So all skillful wholesome qualities are

155
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:54,240
included here. That's very specific

156
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:00,400
and it's uh for me it's intriguing. It's re intriguing. It caught my

157
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,320
attention when I read this and um it's somewhat

158
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:12,080
ironic uh because often uh our associations

159
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:18,320
with the for noble truth teaching is a little bit kind of

160
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:24,960
grim a little bit like ah we had to kind of grind our teeth or something. But here

161
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:34,120
it says all wholesome qualities are here are included in this.

162
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,400
I just loved it. You know that caught my attention to kind of keep going. What is

163
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:46,880
he pointing to? And uh I thought that's a fantastic way

164
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:54,240
and wonderful way to begin this teaching. So how do we understand this?

165
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:02,400
And Saruta is uh quite an uh kind of amazing teacher. And so he unpacked this

166
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:08,520
uh in a great detail uh for the rest of the suta.

167
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,000
And I also say a little bit about Sar Puta maybe that help uh us understand

168
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,880
how he was unpacking this teaching. uh he's a quite a unique teacher and

169
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:31,919
unique practitioner. He has a very unique mind and quite detail oriented and uh has a

170
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:39,360
um um well maybe I'll just read this that uh Ajang Sugato who commented on the

171
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:46,480
Suta speak about spoke about Assari Puta's quality and his contribution in

172
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:56,080
teaching the dharma at the times of the Buddha and maybe all the way down to today. So he said this suta is a master

173
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:03,919
class on the methods employed by the Buddha's greatest student Sar Puta.

174
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:11,360
He begins with the four noble truth then proceeds to unpack them systematically

175
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,480
leading to a lengthy analysis of the four elements.

176
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,640
But the unpacking takes a surprising directions as the Sariputa draws on

177
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:29,200
unexpected layers of the dharma to illustrate a familiar teaching in new

178
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:35,840
ways. All the while he conveys warmth and compassion

179
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:42,720
illustrating in his manner of teaching the connection that is also the topic of

180
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:50,480
the teaching. Sar Puta's emphasis on forable truth is

181
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:57,120
shown elsewhere as well where he's said to focus on teaching new

182
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:03,840
students as far as a stream entry. The current suta illustrate how he did

183
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,120
this carefully explaining uh fundamental

184
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:16,640
concepts and showing their realworld impacts while offering pragmatic and

185
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:23,039
reassuring uh advice along the way. He introduces

186
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:30,400
all the major wisdom teachings demonstrating exactly how they fit into the four noble

187
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,679
truth. That's quite some skill, isn't it?

188
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:42,960
And I really appreciate the Saruta quite a lot. And he seems to have a capacity to kind

189
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,960
of uh in a way flip the ladder down all the way to the ground. So we can kind of

190
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:55,039
go this step by step to kind of understand the teachings.

191
00:21:55,039 --> 00:22:02,240
And so sometimes um his teachings are uh not necessarily what uh exactly the same

192
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:09,360
as the Buddhas. But the Buddha often appraised to him um because he has this kind of capa

193
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:17,520
capacity to allow people to know and uh maybe sometimes the teachings are

194
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,360
offered as kind of a dropping breadcrumbs

195
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:29,600
but you can't quite feel the whole thing and then you know and then the Sar Buddha has this capacity to really let

196
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,799
you see the see the whole thing in the whole picture and then also know the

197
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:42,919
details in some way. So how did he unfold this?

198
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:49,360
So he started with the overarching teaching uh the noble truth of

199
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:56,720
suffering, the origin of the suffering, the sessation of the suffering and the

200
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:04,720
practice that leads to the sessation of the suffering. But then he didn't just stop there. He

201
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:11,760
went deeper. Um

202
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:19,840
and he drilled down um by teasing apart this higher level uh

203
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:28,880
concepts, ideas into a more more granular and uh immediately

204
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:35,840
felt kind of experience. So for example, he first explained kind of teased apart

205
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:41,919
what does it mean by duka? what is it? You know, so he kind of unpacked that

206
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:47,679
with a list. You know, there's illness, aging, death, and there is association

207
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:54,559
with the things that we don't like, we don't want, and not getting what we really liked. And so there is all this

208
00:23:54,559 --> 00:24:00,480
unpacking he was doing. So we can begin to relate to this for ourselves.

209
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,600
Yeah, that's right. That's right. But again, he didn't stop right there

210
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:11,600
because that is a still at the conceptual level that we're understanding.

211
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:18,559
And so she he unpacked all the way to the immediacy of the felt sense of

212
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:25,279
experience uh which the teachings sometimes pointed to as the element.

213
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:32,640
The elemental nature of our experience that this embodied experience

214
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:39,760
has the earth element and our bones, our teeth that is solid,

215
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:47,200
firm, steady and there are uh water element that the

216
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:56,640
fluidity of it and so it's dropping down to the immediate felt sense experience.

217
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:04,000
And so you can see that that the the ladders got flipped down, you know. So

218
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,120
now he's talking about this duka not at

219
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:16,799
our thinking level but it's our experiential level that the experience

220
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:22,159
is like this. Sometimes is pleasant, sometimes it's

221
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:27,919
unpleasant. And so for me sitting here, I have a

222
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:34,320
fair amount of tightness and tension around my hip. And

223
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:40,240
then there's some pain that's been there for a while. And that's immediate

224
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:46,559
here. Oh, this is how it feels like.

225
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:55,679
And for me uh this is rather gamechanging that we are uh beginning to uh deepen in

226
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:01,240
this process of a penetration penetrating

227
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:10,000
and um Saruta invited us to drop in our experience here and now

228
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,720
and this is where the wholesome qualities begin to emerge.

229
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:23,279
And so in this process it almost feel like uh as Puta was taking the students

230
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:30,000
on a meditative journey. Now you're feeling and sensing in your immediate

231
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,720
experience and several effects began to emerge in

232
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:42,799
this process and this is my own reflection. I may be

233
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:50,240
departing a little bit from the suta that the first one I wanted to point out

234
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:57,120
um the first wholesome qualities that many of us might begin to feel as we

235
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:05,520
drop into the immediacy of our experience is that we are in a raw

236
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:13,440
direct relationship with our lives. The vibrations in the body, the flow of

237
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:22,279
the breath, the tinkling sensations, the vibrations of the sounds.

238
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,679
What you're feeling is a kind of aliveness.

239
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:33,679
Wow. Sometimes I have this feeling. It's like

240
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:39,039
I'm in this really alive feeling with my

241
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:45,440
own life. And just now as we were sitting

242
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:51,520
that was the sound of the fan air conditioning and sound of the people

243
00:27:51,520 --> 00:28:00,640
moving sound of the breath and the inner sound at this this kind of

244
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:07,120
soundsscape. It just feels like the the vibratory feeling of life

245
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:12,480
and that's enlivening. I don't even know what all all the words

246
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:19,039
that we might describe, but there is a certain kind of wholesome quality when

247
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:29,760
we're in the immediacy of our experience. And what it can contrast is our ongoing

248
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:37,720
uh movements of wanting, not wanting, pushing away that actually is deadening.

249
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:44,720
we can begin to know this for ourselves. So the first wholesome quality that the

250
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,880
Sar Puta is pointing out in my own experience is when we're dropping in in

251
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:58,159
this experience and instead of trying to push away, deny, avoid all the pain we

252
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:04,760
have and then trying to get on to the things that we really want.

253
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,679
There is aliveness that comes forth

254
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:16,640
in maybe in the midst of the difficulties in the midst of the pain

255
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:23,520
there can be aliveness and it's meaningful. It may not be a meaning that you even

256
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:28,720
know what the words to say about it but you can feel and this is a meaningful

257
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:36,000
meaningful way of relating to our lives. And then the second quality

258
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:43,279
is as we began to stay with this experience just as it is in this raw

259
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:52,240
form in this a more direct form. And what Sar Puta was pointing out was

260
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:58,080
that more and more clarity began to emerge.

261
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:06,720
We can begin to see how the experience of pleasant and unpleasant

262
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:13,440
is different from our reactivity to the pleasant or the unpleasant.

263
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:20,480
They're not the same thing. Sometimes when we're not seeing this clearly, they just kind of lumped together as a jumbo

264
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:27,360
or like it's automatic. It's not good. But what we can see is oh pleasant is

265
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:33,360
just a pleasant and our judgment of whether this is good

266
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:39,840
or bad is another thing is a separate thing. They don't have to automatically

267
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,440
connect and our identification with it is yet

268
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:51,840
another thing. You know, maybe someone criticized you.

269
00:30:51,840 --> 00:31:00,000
Actually, I was criticized last week or two and it was unpleasant.

270
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,320
And I I won't say it's pleasant, it's unpleasant.

271
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:11,279
But our often the knee-jerking reaction of I need to defend myself would just

272
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:18,240
come up, right? But in that moment, fortunately, I did not have um I wasn't

273
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:25,679
present for it. I just let myself feel the unpleasant and that wasn't a kind of this

274
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:34,159
reactivity coming up. And what allowed for me is to notice,

275
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:42,640
oh, there is a more to this criticis criticism than what it sounds like.

276
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:49,519
It was very intuitive in my system. I didn't even know what it was, you know? I just felt like, "Oh, there's more to

277
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:56,960
this." And so I paused. I didn't respond. I didn't react. And I

278
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:03,440
just kind of let it go. There was a space for it.

279
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:09,600
and and a while later, maybe hours later, I discovered

280
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:16,519
and the person was going through some real challenging diagnosis.

281
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:26,799
And so this capacity to be able to drop in this um felt sense experiential way

282
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:34,559
gives us opportunity to tease this apart. So here is something ouch you

283
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:42,640
know it's a dooka and here is the reactivity and in this reactivity of judging trying

284
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:51,360
to fix this we actually have choice if we're not flowing with our reactivity

285
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:59,200
and we can say oh I can let this go I don't need to flow with my judgment

286
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:07,919
that I am a a failure that's just extra. So that's another um

287
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:13,519
quality of a wholesome quality that can flow from this.

288
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:18,799
And then yet another wholesome quality can emerge

289
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:23,919
in this process. And that is as we begin

290
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:33,200
to notice that more and more that there is this choice in us that can let go of

291
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:39,559
the grasping, the cleaning, the judging, the fixing.

292
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:49,120
There is actually more freedom. There is more peace and a harmony that's

293
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,640
available in us. And so this is being pointed to as the

294
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:04,240
third noble truth. that possibility of oh if there is no continual feeling fueling

295
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:11,280
this wanting mind there can be moments of harmony peace

296
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,480
with what I'm experiencing whether it's experiencing in our own

297
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:24,040
hearts or what we feel in the surroundings that we're interacting with.

298
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:31,320
And so that also becomes available to us.

299
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:42,398
And and we will not or we will also notice in

300
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:48,200
this process is um

301
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:54,960
we lose our mindfulness and uh it's not automatic

302
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:02,480
that we are able to simply somehow stay with our experience in this direct immediate

303
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,920
way and you know losing to our stories, our beliefs and

304
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:17,440
and uh we began to notice, oh, this heart and mind is to be

305
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:23,200
cultivated. And so yet another wholesome quality

306
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:30,160
that can emerge which is being pointed to as the fourth noble truth is we give

307
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:36,480
ourselves over to the practice. We offer ourselves to practice

308
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,480
sincerely.

309
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:51,040
And so um so in this way um what is

310
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:58,320
being pointed to uh in this four noble truth each of each of the four noble

311
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:06,880
truth began to um uh manifest themselves as wholesome

312
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:12,960
qualities. wholesome quality of being with our

313
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:19,839
experience as they are including uh the pain and the pleasure, difficulties,

314
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:24,880
challenges and then that's a wholesome quality and

315
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:31,920
then pointed to as the first noble truth and the wholesome quality of clarifying

316
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:38,079
our lived experience the first arrow versus the second arrow you know the

317
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:44,720
reaction reactivities. And so we can begin to clarify this in ourselves

318
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:52,800
and the wholesome quality of possibility of having freedom and ease

319
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:58,960
that's available to us when we're letting go of our claiming existing

320
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:04,480
demanding and wholesome quality of giving

321
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,800
ourselves to the sincere practice.

322
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:20,000
sometimes and I know some people would ask you know um

323
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,079
if things ever get easier through the practice.

324
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:33,160
I like that question and I I I reflected about that question a lot.

325
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:40,320
You know, on one level, the conditions of our lives are often

326
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,359
not under our control.

327
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:51,280
It's hard to say how things might be getting easier or hard,

328
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,800
whether it's because of broader environmental were in or because

329
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:04,240
individual situations. Yeah, in my household there was a

330
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:09,599
broader household there was a car accident.

331
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:16,800
Not easy, very difficult, very difficult for many people involved.

332
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:24,320
Um but this practice through this practice what we're

333
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:33,040
learning is to cultivate a kind of a capacity that allow us to relate to our

334
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:41,280
lives and our life events, life situations with more and more or or in more and

335
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:48,880
more wholesome ways that allow us to have a sense of ease, a

336
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:54,079
sense of a harmony in the midst of a difficulties.

337
00:38:54,079 --> 00:39:00,320
And so in that way, whether you call it easier or better, I

338
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:06,320
don't know. But there is a possibility. There is a

339
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:11,599
possibility. And this kind of a wholesome orientation

340
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:18,240
is more and more independent of the life situations or the conditions that we're

341
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:24,720
in. And this is what this teaching is pointing to

342
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:30,040
that how we relate to our lives

343
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,440
is the empowerment that each of us has.

344
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:46,800
And so as uh all of us connect to this teaching in some way maybe in very

345
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:54,000
moderate way you know we just we just heard this you just have us a little sense of it.

346
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:01,920
Um my invitation is um to know what is

347
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:08,079
called forth from this teaching is to let the teaching come alive.

348
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:15,720
So it's real. We can have a real felt sense of it

349
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:24,200
and let that guide us in how we relate to our lives.

350
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:29,880
So, thank you. Thank you everyone for your attention.

351
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,240
Um,

352
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:44,320
we only have a few minutes. Maybe just, you know, a short comment or

353
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:53,040
um a question. I'm happy to stay over and after and uh respond in any way that

354
00:40:53,040 --> 00:41:00,640
I can. Anyone like to share a comment or share your own reflection or a question?

355
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:05,240
Just a short one before we end.

356
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:12,800
Um yeah, thanks for the talk. I I think uh one of the things I'm learning and

357
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:18,880
maybe you can speak to it is that I don't actually want I'm not actually interested in freedom

358
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:24,319
as much as wanting what I want and then the path is like getting me to be more

359
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:30,400
peaceful or more this or more that. Is that something that you've

360
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:36,160
encountered yourself this like I don't actually want to be free, I want to be happy kind of thing.

361
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:45,680
Yeah. So that's good. I don't know what all the words might be, you know. And so, uh,

362
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:53,040
it might be worthwhile, uh, to turn that question around to see if this is what,

363
00:41:53,040 --> 00:42:00,079
uh, if this is my aspiration, um,

364
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:07,760
how am I relating to this aspiration? How does it manifest for me right now?

365
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:14,960
if that's what's uh aspiring for me. Yeah.

366
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,640
Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you.

367
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:25,599
If there's another short one or a short comment, there's one right

368
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:30,599
here. Right here. Yeah.

369
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:38,720
I just I really appreciated the piece about pleasant and unpleasant and

370
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:45,440
how we think about that. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. We have a lot of

371
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:52,079
associations about pleasant, unpleasant, what can mean to us. So this is a a real

372
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:57,280
worthy uh process in our practice is to begin

373
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:03,200
to tease that apart. kind of like what Sar Puta is pointing to. It's like, oh,

374
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:08,880
there is a pleasant, there's unpleasant. How do we associate with this? You know,

375
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,640
it's like immediately I don't like this. I would rather it go away

376
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:19,839
or um I'm fearful, you know. So, so we can

377
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:28,000
begin to tease apart all of this. So, it's great. Thank you. Yeah.

378
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:37,359
So maybe we'll end uh with a dedication of marriage together and I really um

379
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:44,319
feel grateful for us to uh have this opportunity to practice together and to

380
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:50,640
learn the dharma practice um and to learn the dharma teachings together.

381
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:57,359
Um I still feel that resonance of this first turning of the dharma wheel kind

382
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:05,839
of we're in this long stream and then so um may whatever benefits that arose out

383
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:12,560
of our own practice and our own learning may it ripple out

384
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:19,760
in all directions. So all the beings everywhere may they be

385
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:26,400
benefited in some way. Maybe it's a kind of ease of the heart,

386
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:33,440
clarity of the mind or healthy vital bodies.

387
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:41,760
May they all be happy. May they all be peaceful.

388
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:47,880
And may we all everyone everywhere

389
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:54,560
experiencing liberating wisdom and compassion in our own hearts and minds

390
00:44:54,560 --> 00:45:02,680
and everywhere for all beings. Thank you. Thank you everyone.
