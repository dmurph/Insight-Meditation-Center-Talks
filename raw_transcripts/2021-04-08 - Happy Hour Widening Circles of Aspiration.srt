7
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:53,039
poem in the evening as a talking to bed poem that's one of the

8
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,160
poems so and i've been reflecting on it it's such a beautiful

9
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:05,920
poem so it's very short here we go the poem is by relka

10
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:14,640
reiner maria rilke and the name of it is in my life in my life

11
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,680

12
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,280
love poems to god so

13
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,479
so the poem is i live my life

14
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:40,079
in widening circles that reach out across the world

15
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:48,000
i may never i may not ever complete the last one

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,880
but i give myself to it i may never i

17
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,159
may not ever complete the last one but i give myself to it i want to say a

18
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,280
few words and then we'll do meditation

19
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,520
so in this practice when we practice the brahmaviharas we

20
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,920
practice them in widening circles as you've noticed we start with ourselves

21
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:24,560
we go to our benefactors our good friend the neutral person

22
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:31,599
person we're having difficulty with they all being so all

23
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:39,519
widening circles we practice expanding our heart we live this practice in widening

24
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,959
circles that reach across the world as rilka

25
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:52,720
says the last category all beings reaches across the world our good will our

26
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,280
kindness reached across the world and we may not ever complete the last

27
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,920
one the last circle completely with every being in every condition every

28
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:13,680
situation but we give our hearts to it we give ourselves to it it's an act of

29
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,720
dedication it's an act of honoring it's an aspiration

30
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:25,120
not an expectation that we will make sure every being everywhere is

31
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,319
definitely okay and it's it's an aspiration we give our lives

32
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:37,120
to cultivating this goodwill this friendliness to all beings everywhere

33
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:44,159
and given that meta compassion the practices of the

34
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,840
heart are intertwined with awakening we can also think of this poem

35
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,080
as a dedication to awakening that we may not ever complete the last

36
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:02,000
stage of awakening in this life we might we may not

37
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,959
as upandita the title of his book this the the master of meditation master

38
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:15,519
upandita the title of his book was in this very life in this very life so who knows

39
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:22,079
maybe in this very life and yet if we do not get to complete

40
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:29,600
the last one this last circle the last stage we give ourselves to it we dedicate

41
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:36,560
this moment to it our life to it it's a part of our path when we are sitting when we're walking

42
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,080
when we're interacting with others can we bring kindness to mind can when we're interacting with

43
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,639
ourselves can we bring kindness to mind can we be kind can we be

44
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:57,840
aware can we not be caught

45
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,280
so now with those words i like to read the poem one more time

46
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:09,759
and let it land let it land for you and er in any way that it inspires you

47
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:17,120
and it provides aspiration i live my life i live my life in

48
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,240
widening circles i live my life in widening circles

49
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,638
that reach out across the world

50
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:36,240
i may not ever complete the last one but i give myself to it

51
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:44,240
i may not ever complete the last one but i give

52
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,800
myself to it

53
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:59,280
so with that inspiration of giving ourselves to it our hearts to it let us

54
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:06,479
practice so getting into our meditation posture

55
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:12,240
whatever it might be lying down

56
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:21,840
sitting up straighter see what is most supportive to you

57
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:35,840
and landing in this body in this moment

58
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:54,400
so turning our gaze inward at first

59
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:02,639
the breath with this body to arrive to settle to relax

60
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,199
to greet this moment to greet

61
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:17,840
this body however it is inviting it to soften to relax

62
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:31,840
to settle

63
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:59,520
after thoughts are rising concerns stories ask yourself

64
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,520
do i need to be thinking this right now

65
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,199
ah i'm smilingly with humor

66
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:22,080
letting the balloons of thought go opening your hand let them float away

67
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:41,839
ah let yourself sink into this body oh

68
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,120
feeling comfortable comfortably supported

69
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:55,680
by the earth giving your weight to the earth landing

70
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:02,080
in your chair your cushions no need to contract or hold up any

71
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:09,839
muscles yourself

72
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:40,880
do just taking a few minutes to arrive with

73
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:51,680
the breath in the body for the mind to settle

74
00:09:51,680 --> 00:10:05,839
to collect

75
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,600
how is the heart right now

76
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,760
how is the body in this moment

77
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:06,240
how is the mind just lightly lightly curious

78
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,720
aware

79
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,399
of whatever is arising

80
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:31,839
arising and passing it's okay

81
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,839
so

82
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,229
[Music]

83
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:10,080
now i like to invite you with this reflection for practice

84
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,840
considering considering your life

85
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,000
the arc of your life

86
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,120
living living your life

87
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,760
living my life

88
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:47,600
as real ka says in widening circles living our life

89
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:57,760
what does it mean to live my life

90
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,919
to cultivate my heart

91
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:11,280
my mind

92
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:25,840
the aspiration to live our life in widening circles

93
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:38,000
not an expectation with pressure but an aspiration

94
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,759
a dedication to dedicate our life

95
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:52,480
our bridgening our growth

96
00:19:52,480 --> 00:20:00,880
to these expansive expanding widening

97
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:21,840
ways of being relaxing widening circles

98
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,200
living

99
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:20,329
loving caring [Music]

100
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:31,840
being friendly

101
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,559
being open

102
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:45,840
being curious

103
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,640
being generous

104
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,000
being happy for others happiness

105
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:13,840
being compassionate with pain

106
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:27,840
and ever widening expanding circles

107
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:43,600
as if with each breath being breathed

108
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:49,039
into our abdomen into our heart center in the middle of

109
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:58,240
our chest as each breath in breath and out breath

110
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:06,480
touched to our aspirations any of the aspirations i mentioned

111
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:15,840
growing in generosity and kindness

112
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,639
in gladness in widening circles

113
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:43,840
imagining each breath touching into this aspiration

114
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:52,639
and expanding to widening circles

115
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:01,120
and we may never complete the last one

116
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:11,840
but to give our lives our hearts to it it's an aspiration as a direction

117
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:22,159
this is important to me this is how i want to show up in the world where i

118
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:28,799
want to be who i want to become

119
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:39,840
in the widening circles expanding

120
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:53,840
into a more expansive complete realized version of myself

121
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:04,880
setting intention aspiration reconnecting with the aspiration with

122
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,840
every breath

123
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,960
reconnecting reaffirming

124
00:28:52,640 --> 00:29:13,840
our aspiration intention with each breath

125
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:50,080
what is your aspiration the way you like to grow

126
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,440
in widening circles

127
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:05,840
in wisdom love equanimity

128
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:23,919
generosity connecting with each breath

129
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:47,840
with these widening circles

130
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:49,838
i'll read the poem one more time and let it wash over you

131
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:57,679
i live my life in widening circles

132
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,839
that reach out across the world

133
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,040
i may not ever complete the last one

134
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:17,838
but i give

135
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:31,839
myself to it

136
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:08,079
and for the last minute of this practice period

137
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:18,960
reconnecting with our aspiration our intention for our life

138
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:27,838
these widening circles

139
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,800
and seeing ourselves

140
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:44,960
and image just for a moment as if a visitation

141
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:55,838
from the future from a future version of ourselves

142
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,400

00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:55,520
and you can do this thank you thank you don

170
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:07,838
yes you can do this you can do this

171
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:21,838
the floor is open

172
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:32,720
neil please so first of all that was quite lovely um

173
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:39,680
at some point you know i found myself worrying that i was gonna you know not

174
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:45,920
be able to achieve my desires you know i found you know perhaps you know another way to say it was i

175
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,520
felt overwhelmed by the you know the magnitude of what i was wishing for

176
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:59,599
you know and i seem to be able to kind of back away from it but i wonder if you have any you know tricks or tips or something

177
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:06,800
yeah yeah thank you for that i really appreciate you bringing that question in that aspect of of

178
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:13,280
overwhelm and um and how to work with that and not to

179
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:18,480
problematize that yes with any with many of the other

180
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,839
practices that we've talked about in order for the practice to find its

181
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:29,680
stride sometimes it goes too far in one direction and too far in one other direction right

182
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:35,680
and what you're describing is is it going in the direction though oh

183
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:41,040
my goodness i want i want this is extraordinary and and not the the other direction

184
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:47,119
could be many different things for example one not connecting with one's aspiration like oh i can do it

185
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:52,960
also so there are many different places so so no problem just notice that that's

186
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:59,040
where you are as you have noticed i'm saying this more generally not just for you neil but notice you know this is what's

187
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:05,760
happening okay so what can be the healthy relationship and the healthy relationship can be ah

188
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:12,640
oh this is beautiful neil self oh this is beautiful all these beautiful aspirations so let

189
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:19,520
the heart be buoyed and the same way that say you know if for example what i'm holding

190
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:26,480
here are the aspirations if i were holding them really tight like ouch right instead of oh aspiring to so

191
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,960
notice that contraction in your heart in your body notice it physically when there's like i

192
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:38,160
want i want which can lead to the overwhelm but what if you hold it lightly as oh

193
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:46,000
that is beautiful as a sense of like brightness of heart beautiful what gorgeous aspirations what

194
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:52,480
beautiful aspirations what sacred aspirations to be lifted up by them instead of being

195
00:43:52,480 --> 00:44:00,880
weighed down by them which is kind of what you were describing kind of weigh weight down with the overwhelm of it

196
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:06,480
thank you thank you neil thanks so much for bringing that in

197
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:12,400
and jerry asks why are we filled with self-doubt regarding aspirations

198
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:21,040
yeah um [Music] yeah good question

199
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:29,359
i think what the what you're bringing up i think it would be a couple of ways i would invite working

200
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:39,119
with that one is actually maybe doing it as an inquiry if there are doubts ah doubt interesting

201
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:44,960
what's let me get to know you what instead of pushing it away but really

202
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:50,960
getting to know what is the doubt what's underneath it getting to know the doubt so

203
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:57,280
investigation dhamma victoria which is the second factor of awakening so having curiosity about the doubt

204
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:02,800
let me get to know you without believing it but having curiosity about it and then

205
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:09,520
another is to just call it it's doubt it's just doubt it's just doubt not

206
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:15,599
believing it so calling it out so so as you're asked why are we felt so

207
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:22,960
an investigation might actually reveal itself and you know doubt is

208
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:29,760
just a voice in our heads right so what i was inviting you at the end was

209
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:35,880
just a different way of seeing just shifting and as human beings we really

210
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:42,079
underestimate the power we have to see things differently so

211
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:47,119
the voice of doubt comes up habitually for whatever reasons in our past history

212
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:52,400
conditioning doubt oh can i really do this i can't do this then bill we believe it

213
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:59,040
so okay we'll say well thank you don't really appreciate your opinion but then actually what if i bring up i

214
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:06,720
can do this yes yes in this very life yes trust

215
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:14,000
i am a human being just like all the other human beings who woke up just like the bunda

216
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:20,640
we share 99.99 of our dna i'm not so different he was a human being i'm a human being

217
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:25,839
i can expand and grow in love and compassion in way of course

218
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:32,880
yes i can so just bring that thought up you have choice and see what that feels like experiment

219
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:38,400
with with um with wholesome wholesome thoughts

220
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:47,200
um so just a couple of thoughts there so i'd like to invite us to

221
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:53,440

225
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:18,800

226
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:25,520
trust that others can have in us yes you can yes you can see what that can feel like

227
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:30,800
in a small community of trusting each other supporting each other

228
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:37,040
in in committing and committing to your aspiration it's just a commitment it's just a

229

giving ourselves it's a dedication it's a dedication so

230
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:48,079
