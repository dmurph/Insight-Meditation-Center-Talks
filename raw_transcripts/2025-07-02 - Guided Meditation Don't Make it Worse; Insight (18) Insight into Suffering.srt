1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,319
Welcome to our morning meditation and

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,599
I in coming down here this morning I Good

3
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:18,640
morning. I felt uh kind of happy uh with the idea of what I'm going to

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,000
talk about today. Then today I'm going to introduce the second insight which is

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,679
the conventionally in English we say uh the insight into suffering

6
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,920
and uh and why someone like me would be happy to come down talking about it um

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:46,960
when it could be a seemingly very depressing thing to talk about maybe as part of the the message.

8
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:54,000
So for today's meditation uh I'd like to suggest um four words

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,320
that can guide you through the meditation. And uh the four words are don't make it

10
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:09,920
worse. Whatever you do when you meditate don't make the situation worse for yourself.

11
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,280
And um and to um go further with it,

12
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:22,159
I'll do a little bit of guided meditation and set the stage for why this is so useful.

13
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,920
But um uh track yourself, monitor yourself. A

14
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,439
very important part of mindfulness is this selfmonitoring.

15
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,560
And so you know what you're doing. You know, if you

16
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,159
start thinking about things and uh having that train of thought is not good

17
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,920
for you, it's making the situation worse. If you're tracking about how you're

18
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,759
relating to the meditation practice, uh maybe you're straining or judging it,

19
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:04,640
your experience, and you can feel how it makes things worse. It makes you feel worse. It drains the energy or is, you

20
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:11,039
know, difficult. And uh don't believe that you have to

21
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,800
have these thoughts, these attitudes, this way of practicing. Make an adjustment.

22
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,480
Choose the choose the choose to not make the situation worse.

23
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,680
At least kind of go back to doing what you were doing before you started to do that.

24
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,159
So to assume meditation posture

25
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,360
and gently close your eyes

26
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,519
and in a slow comfortable way

27
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,040
take some fuller breaths.

28
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,560
And as you After you breathe in fully,

29
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,000
comfortably in a comfortable way, have an extended

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,599
exhale. Ride the exhale to the end.

31
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,920
And then to Keep doing that for a few moments. But

32
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,959
as you exhale, relax your body. Soften

33
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,680
into here.

34
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:14,920
And then to let your breathing return to normal

35
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:22,639
and to start the important work

36
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:29,440
of relaxing as you exhale.

37
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,840
Relaxing, softening the muscles of the face.

38
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:42,960
Breathing normally, but feeling the face as you inhale, relaxing

39
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,440
as you exhale.

40
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:06,720
As you inhale, feel the shoulders.

41
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,960
On the exhale, soften the shoulders.

42
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,199
And then as you exhale, inhale,

43
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,880
feeling the belly, softening the belly on the exhale.

44
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,280
As you inhale, feel the thinking mind.

45
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:18,120
And as you exhale, soften the thinking mind.

46
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:41,120
As you breathe in, feel how you are emotionally, mood,

47
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,479
attitude. And as you exhale,

48
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:55,560
relax, soften around your mood, how you feel.

49
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,000
And then finding the settling place, the grounding place

50
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,240
for your breathing. Maybe where the exhale ends,

51
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,160
the inhale begins.

52
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And as you exhale, relax into settle into the grounding place.

53
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,720
As you inhale, allow breathing to arise from that

54
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,720
place.

55
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:29,039
As you breathe in, feel whatever calm

56
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:36,120
there might be here. And as you exhale,

57
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:46,120
let the calm spread. Open to receive more of the calm.

58
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:14,080
As you breathe in, feeling whatever degree of ease,

59
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:20,040
easy feeling of being alive that you have.

60
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,000
And as you exhale,

61
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:34,360
let yourself settle more into a sense of ease.

62
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:10,320
And now from the vantage point of your ease,

63
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:18,560
whatever calm or relaxation you have, let that highlight for you, help you see

64
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,680
and feel any way that you are make you make it

65
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:29,680
worse. Any ways that you strain or

66
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:35,519
contract, any way you start

67
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:41,120
being caught in thoughts, ideas that

68
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,800
make the situation worse for you.

69
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:54,399
And for these few minutes, any thought or idea you have

70
00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:01,920
that that somehow makes you feel worse, makes situation worse.

71
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,600
For the duration of the meditation, you do not need to believe those

72
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,519
thoughts. You don't have to believe what you're believing.

73
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:21,399
that makes the situation worse for these minutes.

74
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:28,560
Let go of whatever makes it the situation worse. No matter how small the

75
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:35,880
movement is, stay close to your ease

76
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:43,240
and notice when you start losing it.

77
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,040
There's a way that being caught in thoughts,

78
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:35,959
even good thoughts, is a form of alienation.

79
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,199
Separation from a deeper sense of inner well-being.

80
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:51,959
That maybe is felt to be in intimately connected

81
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,079
to the inner sensations of breathing.

82
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,639
An easeful breath.

83
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:02,559
Find find within you where you feel the most ease

84
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,360
or the most calm.

85
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:15,840
and let go of anything that takes you away from that

86
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:23,158
for the last few minutes. Breathe with your ease.

87
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:30,000
Breathe with your calm, trusting

88
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,840
that the best place to be is right in the middle of it.

89
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,320
And as we come to the end of the sitting,

90
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:50,120
taking a few moments to appreciate

91
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:56,320
if you can that there can be an inner reference

92
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:03,039
point of calm, of ease,

93
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:10,760
of stillness. Maybe spaciousness

94
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,039
that can be an important reference point

95
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:30,520
for seeing more clearly how you lose those

96
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:41,360
how they're reference point for notice. Noticing what you start doing that loses

97
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,919
touch with that.

98
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,200
And right there with that information

99
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:03,158
is where wisdom can support us.

100
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,520
The wisdom not to sacrifice our well-being

101
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:18,320
for the activities of mind that bring stress,

102
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:24,520
tightness, agitation.

103
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,919
Don't make it worse.

104
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:52,000
And in being ready to go into the world of people and work and activities,

105
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,760
communities. How might this

106
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,880
simple phrase support you

107
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,559
to be in the world in a nice way? supportive way for others.

108
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:14,960
Don't make it worse. If what you're going to say or do is

109
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:22,440
going to make the situation worse, maybe don't do anything

110
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,440
until you can find what makes it better.

111
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:39,720
May it be that this meditation practice, mindfulness practice

112
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:47,039
supports us in not making this world worse,

113
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:51,799
not challenging our relationships.

114
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:58,559
May it be that we go about our day caring for

115
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:06,278
everyone, including ourselves. And in that care,

116
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:15,158
may we keep in the forefront the idea that may others be happy,

117
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:24,360
may others be safe, may others be peaceful,

118
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:31,398
may others be free.

119
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,919
And may we contribute to this.

120
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:52,210
[Music]

121
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,679
Thank you.

122
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:14,799
So hello and welcome to this next talk on the insight series

123
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:21,039
and I've decided that uh it's time to move on to the second insight.

124
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:28,320
The first insight is is insight into the inconstant nature of our experience.

125
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:35,279
the impermanent changing nature of experience as we experience it.

126
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:42,080
And there's a lot of wisdom that comes from becoming attuned, seeing clearly the

127
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:49,360
impermanent in constant nature of it all. And part of it is the ability

128
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:57,440
to uh to hold our ground to be present in a non-reactive way to find our

129
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:04,960
stability in the face of change and this becomes invaluable

130
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:11,200
when we come to the second insight and in English is usually said to be the

131
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:19,120
word that for duka is translated as imper is as translated as suffering.

132
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:25,440
It's a big word and maybe it's not quite the best way of characterizing the word

133
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,960
duka, the poly word, ancient word, but for now

134
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:37,919
uh what's wonderful about this word suffering is people do suffer.

135
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:44,159
And the second insight implies that we're learning how to

136
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:50,880
be present for suffering. Not to turn away, not to close our eyes, not to uh

137
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:59,360
avoid, but a very honest and clear recognition that there is suffering.

138
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:04,640
And uh this ability for Buddhists, this orientation for Buddhists to be very

139
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:11,360
clear, clear clearheaded, clearminded and have be a willingness to yes their

140
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:18,240
suffering uh is a radical thing to do when many people are avoiding their suffering at

141
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:25,039
all costs. Some people are unwilling to be present for their discomfort, present

142
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:33,440
for their distress. They distract themselves. They uh medicate themselves.

143
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,799
They uh run away, escape,

144
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:46,240
distract themselves. And um sometimes there's wonderful strategies

145
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:51,360
of blaming and attacking and looking outside.

146
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:58,640
Sometimes we do things of feeling suffering, but we don't just face it directly and see it. We believe in it.

147
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:04,480
We got overcome by it. We uh collapse into it.

148
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:10,560
And what Buddhism is saying is uh yes there is suffering in this world. Be

149
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:18,480
present for it. See it clearly. See it from a place of stability.

150
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:25,520
Not in a certain kind of way. Uh attitude that's not for or against it.

151
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:32,878
Even if there's suffering we're going to fix and try to change, there's ability to hold a place of just being willing to

152
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:40,000
be present, to see it clearly, and to be honest about it, an honest recognition

153
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,358
that this we have suffering in ourselves, in the world around us.

154
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:51,358
And then um and then to appreciate

155
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:57,599
that it's invaluable to see it, to know it. If what we want

156
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:04,079
to do is to become free of it, if what what we want to do is to address the

157
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:09,200
suffering uh in a beneficial way. All the ways of

158
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:14,640
avoiding it, all the ways of being collapsing under the weight of it uh

159
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,920
tend to make the situation worse. And the idea in Buddhism, don't make it

160
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:27,440
worse if you have a choice. And when there's suffering in the world and there's huge,

161
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:34,640
you know, challenges in our world, it's always been there. Um and um and it's

162
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:40,640
very unfortunate that uh the attitude, the beliefs, the

163
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:47,440
emotions, the reactions we have to what goes on in the world around us, we're actually making it worse.

164
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:55,280
Um it's bad enough some of the things that go on but then uh we despair or get

165
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:00,640
angry or blame or or um or

166
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:06,079
all kinds of ways in which we respond to it that we're adding second arrows.

167
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:13,760
We're adding to the weight of the suffering. So uh so for example

168
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:20,640
if um if I'll give a silly little example that

169
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:27,520
um if someone invites you to their house and they

170
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:34,960
um for a meal and and you come and just as you come they burn the meal

171
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:42,400
and uh so they're angry with themselves, they're angry with the food, they're angry with their stove and they're even

172
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:48,480
irritated that you're there and it's very uncomfortable

173
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:55,520
and it's an uncomfortable situation. How can we make the situation worse? We

174
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:01,119
might make it worse by being angry with them. We might make it worse by blaming

175
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:09,280
ourselves for coming too late. We might whatever. We might make it worse by by

176
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,800
um um running away. We might make it worse by

177
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:22,720
um trying to fix the charred food. Um there all kinds of ways we make

178
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:28,640
the situation worse than it has to be. Our contribution is to show up and react

179
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:36,320
in such a way that we make that we're contributing more suffering to the situation making it worse. It's bad

180
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:42,800
enough to begin with. Don't add it add anything to it. And so when things are

181
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,000
happening on a national level or global level and people are doing things which

182
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,240
we feel quite distressing and upsetting that they're that they're causing a lot of suffering.

183
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:59,520
Don't add even more suffering to the world by your reaction,

184
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:05,440
but do have a clear le level-headed looking at seeing this is suffering, but

185
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:12,640
I'm not going to suffer because of it. That is a radical thing to do.

186
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:19,440
That is a phenomenal thing to do to be able to see and be present for suffering

187
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:26,800
and show up in such a way that we're not going to suffer because of that

188
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:33,359
suffering. Even if someone is harming us

189
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:40,880
which that we should stop but we can make it worse for ourselves

190
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:47,760
for the attitudes the attachments the reactions that we have. And so as we learn to meditate in

191
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:53,440
mindfulness as we learn to be present for experience not trying to have a good

192
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:59,280
experience not trying to avoid being uncomfortable. One of the most powerful things about

193
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:06,320
mindfulness practice is learning to be comfortable with being uncomfortable. A

194
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:12,400
willingness to be have a stable, clear, honest mindfulness. And we really be

195
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:17,839
present for what's there. If we only know how to be present when things are

196
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:23,359
deeply going well and calm and relaxed and peaceful and we're riding on a cloud

197
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:30,560
of samadei, uh we're not really getting the benefits of this practice. The benefits of the

198
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:38,880
practice come when we're able to be calm and still enough to be able to look

199
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:46,560
suffering right in the eyes, say, "I see you." and not add more suffering on top of it.

200
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:53,200
So even if we're suffering personally inside to learn to be able to see that clearly,

201
00:39:53,200 --> 00:40:00,000
kindly, openly, and don't add second, third, and fourth arrows to it.

202
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,079
This is invaluable and very important. And so that's why we're learning to

203
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:11,839
track ourselves to see, oh, I'm making it worse now. And as we meditate and get

204
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:17,040
calmer or more settled, um, one of the benefits of that is not to stay calm,

205
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:24,240
not to identify with the calm and say, "Oh, I'm such a calm person now. This is great, but to appreciate the calm gives

206
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:31,359
us a vantage point to see more clearly when we start losing that calm.

207
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:36,960
When we have a sense of ease, we learn how we lose that ease. And in that

208
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:43,520
losing of it, that might be where uh we are making the situation worse. That is

209
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:49,920
where we have left behind our ability to just be present and to see clearly. Oh,

210
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:56,880
this is difficult and I'm going to be here. I'm going to hold be present and see it and be mindful. Even if I don't

211
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:03,599
know what to do, at least I know not to make it worse.

212
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:11,680
So this very simple exercise that maybe is difficult to do and simple to explain

213
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:17,920
it goes this way. Set yourself at ease. Whatever ease that

214
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:24,640
you can and notice what takes you away from it.

215
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:31,119
Notice what caused you to lose your ease and see, are you contributing something

216
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:38,720
to make it worse that you actually don't have to do? It's extra to the situation.

217
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:45,440
Maybe you don't have to make it worse. Set yourself at ease and see what takes

218
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,960
you away from it. So that's my recommendation for what you could do for

219
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:58,400
the next 23 hours until we meet again. And um and this is an entry point now

220
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:05,520
for this deeper dive into the second insight, the insight into uh suffering,

221
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:11,119
duka. And in order to do this well, we need to

222
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:18,000
be able to learn not to add suffering to suffering.

223
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:27,520
We need to learn well how to stay with our ease, stay with our stability and calm even when we're feeling u lousy.

224
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:35,440
And that is a phenomenal thing to learn. And that's where you can start finding your freedom. And you might even find a

225
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:46,680
smile at a time when you're suffering in some way that in the past it uh despared you,

226
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,520
saddened you, upset you. But with mindfulness of it,

227
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:59,520
it your suffering won't bring you a smile, but your mindfulness might bring

228
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:08,400
you a smile as you find this wonderful capacity to be present without adding

229
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:14,800
without making it worse. So, um I hope that you enjoy and or at

230
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:22,720
least value this turn that we're taking now. And uh remember we're building this

231
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:28,160
on the foundation of all that we've done now over this year so far. Samadei and

232
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:34,960
insight. And now there's a dive for the next week or so into this world of um

233
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:40,960
the second characteristic the second perception the second insight into uh

234
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:47,240
duka suffering. Thank you.
