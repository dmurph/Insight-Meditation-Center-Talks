1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,440
so welcome again and

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,240
uh what i started to say is that uh this meditation

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:18,439
practice leading to deep insight has more to do uh when

4
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:25,519
we um what we don't do than what we do

5
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:31,359
there's a lot of uh uh ways in which we are so actively involved in our minds

6
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,440
and our thoughts that it interferes with the natural capacity for

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:43,200
insight and one of the kind of the core principles almost of buddhism is that we

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,800
have a profound natural capacity profound natural abilities that uh we're learning to get

9
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:58,879
out of the way of and the analogy would be if you were going to go canoe

10
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:05,640
comfortably down a comfortable safe uh nice

11
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:15,280
slow narrow river maybe maybe a stream a creek and um and uh so there's a few

12
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,640
things you have to do you have to untie the canoe from the dock

13
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:28,080
um and you have to release your hand from holding on to the dock and then you have to somehow stay

14
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,960
in the middle you and you don't want to reach out to the side and hold on to a branch coming down uh you want if you

15
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:41,040
see a sandbar up ahead you want to avoid getting stuck on it so there's a few things we have to do but there's a

16
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,119
natural capacity if we stay in the middle of the river to float and carry

17
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:55,040
on same way with u this meditation practice uh and the the world of insight is what

18
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,719
opens up when we let go of the dock we untie the rope we allow ourselves to

19
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,000
flow in the river and uh the way that we get grab

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,560
onto branches and get caught on sand bars is by thinking a lot and thinking

21
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,800
and living in concepts living in attitudes are what

22
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,640
kind of solidifies or raifies or makes the world solid makes the self solid

23
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:33,760
solid rather than the self being fluid and moving and constantly shifting and

24
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,360
changing in a free liberated way um through the conceptual world and through

25
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,879
our attachments and our fears and our resistances and our wantings we kind of

26
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:52,400
solidify and it's hard to see the change we form that big tangle that big knot

27
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,160
where uh experiences sensations direct contact

28
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,920
with the world uh is entangled with our concepts of it entangled with ideas of

29
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:11,959
self entangled with our attitudes and our desires our aversions and so things get all uh globed

30
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:17,440
together and so it seems like there's something solid here and permanent and

31
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,560
this is the way it's going to be forever but we let go we untie the rope

32
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:30,239
from the dock we learn to trust deeply and it's almost like uh it's what

33
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:37,200
we don't do it's a lot of letting go not because we're letting go into nothing

34
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:44,080
we're letting go into this natural capacity to flow and to move and to flow

35
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:51,440
into a really good direction the metaphor of the flowing in the river is used in buddhism

36
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:57,200
uh to go from small little streamlets and creeks that flow into bigger lakes

37
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:04,000
into bigger rivers into bigger rivers and finally flows into the big ocean and

38
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:12,000
so this idea that the flow of impermanence the flow of the changing nature and the river of change um it's

39
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,680
not just that itself is not a static thing uh that if moves on to better and

40
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:29,040
better but the cost in a sense of doing this is is is to let go is to let go

41
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:35,520
untie from the dock of concepts and ideas of past and present and also to

42
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,880
untie ourselves from or let go of holding on to the branches of self the

43
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:48,199
branches of ideas and philosophies and and of self that we might be carrying

44
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:55,120
along so it's a lot about not doing and when we don't do we'll feel and see that

45
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:03,600
the river is flowing will flow with it so the insight are what comes deep

46
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,080
insight comes when we're no longer holding on to

47
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,400
something so to assume a meditation

48
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,039
posture if you get into a canoe you kind of have to be in a good posture of

49
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:29,000
balance in the middle upright can't be leaning one side to the

50
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,680
other you can't can't sunbathe laying down in the canoe if you want to

51
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:42,880
stay flowing in the river and tracking what's going on

52
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:50,880
so to take a good posture and to close your

53
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,240
eyes and without doing anything else as you're sitting as you're in your

54
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,919
meditation posture can you

55
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:12,160
feel the hum of sensations the vibration of

56
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:17,720
life can you sense or

57
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:24,000
observe the way that so much is changing and shifting in you as you just sit here

58
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,600
doing nothing being

59
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:41,400
still even if you're preoccupied with thoughts the thoughts the images the

60
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,000
words are coming and going and

61
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,800
shifting rather than looking at the content of

62
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:59,000
thoughts now notice how the details of

63
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:08,960
thinking belong to a world of change changing words changing sentences changing

64
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:22,479
images and whatever degree of change you can experience here

65
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:28,440
now in the middle of it all from deep within begin

66
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,520
a comfortable fuller

67
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:43,800
inhale and a longer easeful exhale

68
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,560
with whatever sense of ease you can

69
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,960
have easefully take just a bigger fuller

70
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,160
breath that keeps the ease

71
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,440
and a long longer slower

72
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,759
exhale that settles you into an inner

73
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:38,039
ease and then letting your breathing return to normal

74
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:52,880
right there in the breathing the body's experience of

75
00:08:53,320 --> 00:09:00,920
breathing you can observe change shifting

76
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,160
you might not see the changing sensations of breathing if you

77
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:17,040
hold your breath but if you allow the natural

78
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:27,360
rhythm of breathing there'll be a natural shifting and changing flowing river of

79
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:34,120
sensations physical sensations associated with breathing

80
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:51,040
and if you lose touch with that because you're thinking a

81
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:58,160
lot then those thoughts are going to interfere with

82
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,320
seeing change those thoughts put you in a

83
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:12,959
world of holding on to a branch still being tied to the

84
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:23,760
dock relax the thinking mind and settle yourself into the canoe

85
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,240
of your body

86
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:47,720
where awareness is settled in your body

87
00:10:54,839 --> 00:11:00,200
riding the river of change

88
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,600
all things are changing unless

89
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,639
we get caught up in

90
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:23,360
thoughts or we get caught in ideas and feeling of

91
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:35,320
self cross the river of change

92
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:09,000
when awareness is pulled into the world of

93
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,959
thinking the world of clinging holding

94
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:21,760
on then the awareness

95
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:29,280
cannot rest in the river of

96
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,679
change the changing

97
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:42,960
sensations the changing energies of the present

98
00:17:51,960 --> 00:18:01,399
moment let go and let go so you can rest

99
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:11,720
float in the river of change

100
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:25,320
and then as we come to the end of this sitting perhaps relaxing a few moments

101
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:32,320
into whatever is shifting and changing in your direct experience

102
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:38,120
not chasing it or looking for it but allowing it

103
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,919
to move through

104
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,080
you allow it to show itself to you

105
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:07,988
we're opening and relaxing and [Music]

106
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:16,120
receiving change i i can

107
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:22,480
highlight how we get out of the river we get stuck in the

108
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:28,679
river when we get caught in thoughts

109
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:55,559
and a lot of preoccupation and thoughts clearly separates

110
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:59,440
us from a deeper

111
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:09,080
intimacy with a natural process of dharma

112
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,399
unfolding the

113
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,559
river carrying us

114
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:31,440
along as it grows and flows and opens up to greater and greater happiness and

115
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:40,840
peace may we appreciate how letting go of

116
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:47,440
preoccupations and attachments gives room for deeper

117
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:54,799
healthy process to unfold deeper peace

118
00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:02,639
happiness and may we understand that this works interpersonally

119
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:12,880
too that we can bring kind and respectful attention to

120
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:18,440
others where they don't have to react to how we are don't have

121
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:24,720
to cling or resist or

122
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:31,278
want may it be that our way of being with

123
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:40,320
others helps them to relax helps what's the natural capacity

124
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,480
for peace that they have as a chance

125
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:53,760
to unfold may all beings be happy

126
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,559
may all beings be safe may all

127
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:06,960
beings be peaceful may all beings be

128
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:15,100
[Music]

129
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:23,639
free thank you

130
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:25,679
so hello and welcome to this series on insight the kind of insight that we

131
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:33,840
emphasize in insight meditation and uh this is the end of the this

132
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:40,080
week's uh topic that covers the five different areas that we can call that

133
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:45,880
involve insight that we might define or describe as having insight into

134
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:53,000
something and the way that it unfolds is that um the way that this week has been

135
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:00,158
discussed is that um there is

136
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:08,480
um there is um uh that one way of understanding that

137
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:16,720
i just got distracted someone came here that uh that the un it unfolds kind of as

138
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,880
process there's an unfolding here just like samadei is an unfolding and this

139
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:29,520
one of the reasons to give this the whole series on samadei before insight is that we can understand better

140
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:35,279
appreciate better how the unfolding of insight the deepening of insight is a

141
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:40,799
form of samadei itself and some of the qualities and characteristics of samadei

142
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:50,000
come into play as we go along here and uh so the uh the first insight

143
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,919
from monday the personal insight is very valuable to have but from the point of

144
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:02,960
view of the samadei of insight it's settling personal issues enough that uh

145
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:10,799
we can give ourselves over to the process of meditation we don't have to be concerned about fixing something or

146
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:16,080
healing anything in ourselves because now we can kind of settle enough in

147
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:22,840
ourselves that we can kind of go in into this process and so as we go

148
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:28,559
deeper the uh uh then into it part of

149
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:33,600
this uh is to get quiet enough calm enough that we can see the distinction

150
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:40,159
between appearances and the recognition of them the mental knowing of them the

151
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:45,360
the uh simple way of saying it is the sense the sense experience we have which

152
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:51,679
belongs to direct experience and to um the names we have the concepts the

153
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,799
recognition we have for it so we tease those apart for the purpose of being

154
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:02,240
able to see even more clearly each thing so we don't have everything kind of

155
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:08,480
lumped together in one big general conceptual way and so then that allows

156
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:14,559
us to see conditionality and that's invaluable because then we see that it makes a

157
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:22,320
difference how we are that we do condition ourselves that if we get caught up in thoughts and hostility or

158
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:28,640
greed that has a effect on us that is not so beneficial if we let go and are

159
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:34,159
settled and open up more fully there in a kind supportive way that that has a

160
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:41,919
beneficial effect on us so conditionality helps us to see that how we engage is beneficial and a lot of it

161
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:47,520
has to do with appreciating how powerful it is meaningful it is to not be caught

162
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:53,679
not be uh tight around or resisting or uh having attitudes of aversion or

163
00:30:53,679 --> 00:31:00,919
judgments or despair or all kinds of things that are added on top of our

164
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:07,600
experience and uh and then as we move on further then uh we start seeing uh much

165
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:14,159
more appreciation of how things are always changing and how uh the idea of

166
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:20,080
self doesn't have to be so u applied to it projected onto all

167
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:26,240
our experiences that they all are my experience or or uh they all have some

168
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,600
reference back to me and so there's a beginning to understand an understanding

169
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,679
of uh how changeable things are how things flow and are

170
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:43,039
impermanent and constant and how it's possible to be in that world without a

171
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:49,120
lot of uh self-p preoccupation self-consciousness and uh and self

172
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:54,559
doesn't have to be uh be defining everything in its own terms and that to

173
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:59,960
do so is unsatisfactory brings more suffering and so as we move along here with

174
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:05,600
insight um uh at some point we enter into the approach stage that we have

175
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:12,559
with samadei approaching into janna and um and so as we keep going here there's

176
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:21,039
a feeling of an onward leading mo movement this is good this is the right place to be and uh and some of the vanic

177
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:27,519
factors come into play there starts to be some joy and happiness in the mindfulness practice itself and the

178
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:33,200
clear seeing being there present for experience in this more direct way that

179
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:39,279
is so direct and so immediate it's much more of a of a of an observation a

180
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:46,880
seeing a sensing a receiving than sometimes it is when people practice mindfulness where the mindfulness uh

181
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:54,320
does involve kind of a higher order level of recognition now the recognition or the knowing is

182
00:32:54,320 --> 00:33:01,519
really simple really uh immediate and and not a wider understanding that this

183
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:10,799
applies to all of life and um and we enter start entering into uh a very direct uh experience

184
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:16,360
experiential sensing feeling knowing observing of

185
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:22,320
how all the building blocks of all the concepts building blocks of sensations

186
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:29,360
that we have that they all um they're all coming and going they're in constant

187
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:35,120
they're constantly a flow of change of arising and passing and that's a classic

188
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:40,840
language is we enter into the stage of things just arising and passing and and

189
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:47,120
and in this stage we've kind of in this approach stage it enters into something

190
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:54,799
that's something like uh comparable to the first janna in that uh the mind is

191
00:33:54,799 --> 00:34:00,320
not really going to wander off anymore it's not a lot of work to be present to

192
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:07,519
keep coming back keep coming back now uh it we're in the flow of the samadei

193
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:12,679
we're in we're in it and you might wander off a little bit but you're coming back

194
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:18,000
easily coming back easily just here it's like this massage of going away and

195
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:25,440
coming back and being here and rather than being absorbed in um in a samadei

196
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,560
in a in u like joy or something there might be joy there might be happiness

197
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:35,760
there might be many of the factors that happen in samadei but it's a very clear

198
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:43,200
that we're observing that we're present for the shifting and changing nature of the of

199
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:49,599
reality of reality of our direct experience of it and so now we're

200
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:57,280
entering into the world of of what classically is called the three characteristics and that is uh the big

201
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:04,920
emphasis the kind of the the the insight meditation for vipasana the capital i

202
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:11,400
insight is a deep seeing a deep experiencing a deep direct

203
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:16,560
sensing of the arising and passing of sensations the rising and passing of

204
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:24,920
thoughts the rising and passing of everything that we start just to see it comes and goes and comes and goes and

205
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:30,920
um and uh and so that's the the characteristic of uh all experiences

206
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:36,560
impermanent the second is that um in all these direct immediate experience of

207
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:43,760
sensations uh we cannot find a self uh sometimes it's called uh you know the

208
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:52,160
the characteristic of not self and the third is um duka and that there's uh uh

209
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:59,200
that there's some profound uh form of suffering of of uh uh

210
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:04,640
unsatisfactoriness uh in any movement of the mind to hold

211
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:11,560
on to resist to want anything to do with all these sensations that are moving

212
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:17,280
through so there's a higher sensitivity now in the modern terravada

213
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:24,400
it's called the character three characteristics in the time of the buddha these were called the three perceptions or the

214
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:33,280
three recognitions and um sya and uh these um and that makes a

215
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:40,520
huge difference because when it started becoming called characteristics then uh the three

216
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:48,000
characteristics uh there was a tendency to make into a kind of buddhist metaphysics philosophy that now we're

217
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,960
seeing the true characteristics of everything in the universe all things everything in the universe is

218
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:01,960
impermanent and constant everything is um is

219
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:08,920
um not self everything is suffering and that kind of univers

220
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:16,000
universalization of these three characteristics is not useful for deepening the practice and maybe not

221
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,079
even you know it's it's it's going in a different direction than the buddha really wanted us to go if we come back

222
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:28,680
and understand them as a three perceptions the three characteristics the focus is three three

223
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:34,000
recognitions the focus is not on the nature of what's out there but rather

224
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,160
the nature of how we perceive it so if i hold this bell and i tell you wow this

225
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:46,880
bell is impermanent and constant is con constantly shifting and changing and coming and going this bell is not self

226
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,960
this bell is suffering uh you'd probably think i was a little

227
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:57,280
crazy but uh what's inconstant is that

228
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:03,119
my perception of the bell turns out that yes the bell is has a certain constancy

229
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:09,440
but the mental activity of perceiving of recognizing the bell is a sh a shifting

230
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:15,440
and changing um flow of sand um and um

231
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:23,119
flow of river the idea that um this u this is my bell that's a mental concept

232
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:28,560
as well that's a mental perception and recognition seeing that idea of this is

233
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:35,680
my bell seeing it come and go and it rises out of conditions there's no self

234
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:41,680
that makes that thought that this is my bell it just thought that arises and so

235
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:48,960
there's no self in that thought exactly and there's no self that i'm projecting

236
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:56,800
now onto the bell and then there's the suffering when i say it's my my bell i want this bell i

237
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:02,160
should have it um so there can be we perceive the suffering in relationship

238
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:09,520
to it so there's these three very profound ways of perceiving or recognizing the

239
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:16,000
movements of the mind that take things as being permanent or constant take

240
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:22,880
things as me myself and mine that take things as um as these this is a source

241
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,079
of happiness if i just hold on to it and cling cling to it and rather than that

242
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:33,680
there's in this kind of samadei state almost as you go deeper into this almost

243
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:41,280
johnic state um so remember we're going to a deeper state this is where we start

244
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:48,800
uh perceiving uh in a deep deep way we observe in a deep way uh it's so

245
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:54,400
satisfying because we're in this nice state this onward leading state we see

246
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:00,920
that everything the flow of change the river of change everything that all

247
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:06,640
perception all sensing all acts of knowing all those

248
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:12,079
are shifting and changing and moving and coming and going whether or not there's

249
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:19,680
a bell out here which has some constancy uh that is besides the point uh the

250
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:27,359
world of freedom belongs to this world of of not making this into a permanent

251
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:34,560
thing not taking the perception of the mind and and making this mine not

252
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:41,160
suffering because i want to cling to it and want it um those the mind's

253
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:46,240
activities are in constant in a certain kind of way the

254
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:52,480
mind's individual activities is not self there's no self in those activities and

255
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:58,319
there's um and there's um and it's suffering to cling it's suffering you

256
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:03,400
can see the suffering of how we relate to it things if we look deeply into the

257
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:10,119
mind and so these are some but in this this uh uh fifth insight to really have

258
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:17,839
it as deep inside itself it is a kind of samadei deep samadei where we've cleared

259
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:24,880
the the veils of perception so that we can really see deeply into the mind and

260
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:30,240
see what the mind does that it make it projects permanence projects self and in

261
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:37,280
a kind of certain way not doesn't project but creates suffering in the deep samati then we

262
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:44,319
start seeing the opposite we see yes it's there's a we're in sensing the

263
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:51,720
inconstant nature of perception or recognition the inconstant nature

264
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:58,640
of the the notself nature of perception the not suff the we see that there's

265
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:05,200
suffering in in how we relate to it and how we can let go and this letting go

266
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:11,880
this not participating in this deep way allows for a deeper and deeper entering into a deeper deeper

267
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:18,480
samadei and uh my teacher in burma sometimes called called this vipasana janna

268
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:25,760
uh in this deeper way and so in understanding appreciating there's samadei here you might understand that

269
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:31,359
the thinking mind has gotten really quiet and the filters of concepts by

270
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:36,640
which we see is dropped away so these are the three these are the

271
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:44,000
five areas which insight becomes into play as we do this mindfulness practice

272
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,520
and uh for the next two weeks i'll be away on retreat and uh and i'll pick

273
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:56,000
this up again when i come back i think on the 16th of june and um and uh we'll

274
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,680
do a week on each of these three perceptions called three characteristics

275
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:07,200
in the modern world and um and uh appreciate kind of a deepening process

276
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:14,760
that that happens with each of these three um perceptions um these three

277
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:22,440
insights so thank you very much and i look forward to coming back in a couple of weeks
