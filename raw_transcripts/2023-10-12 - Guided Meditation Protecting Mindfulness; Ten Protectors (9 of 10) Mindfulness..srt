1
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:06,720
my friends welcome and happy to be here

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,719
with you and to greet you with my delight that we have this time

3
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,240
together and

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,400
um so there's a saying about

5
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:31,080
mindfulness that is mindfulness is easy remembering to do

6
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,120
it is difficult so the act of mindfulness in

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,879
of itself is meant to be phenomenally simple so simple it's sometimes hard to

8
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:47,480
trust it so simple that it's uh maybe hard to remember to do

9
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:53,039
it and um and uh a lot of the practice

10
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,960
is remembering and coming back and coming back and um at some point in the

11
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:06,159
history of Buddhism uh the word Sati translated as mindfulness um was understood to be

12
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:12,880
remembering it has a really to related to the word memory or remembering so part of it is to remember

13
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,680
to do it and uh because it's so difficult to remember the mind wanders off it gets

14
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,520
caught up and thinking a lot um then

15
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:31,560
um there's a second practice that we can do that um

16
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,079
uh helps us to keep us in the flow of mindfulness it's also a way of

17
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:43,640
protecting ourselves mindfulness is meant to be protective so that we're protected from

18
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:50,040
picking up uh thoughts and impulses and

19
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:57,159
motivations attitudes which are harmful for ourselves or harmful for others and

20
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:02,479
it protects others it protects ourselves and so this not picking

21
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:09,119
up uh sometimes uh so when whatever happens when when you notice you're

22
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:15,480
not being clearly mindful in the present moment uh but you're kind of leaning

23
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:22,400
into or getting involved in or picked up in anything else let go of

24
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,120
it or if you see it arising don't pick it up let it

25
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,599
be so for this meditation certainly be mindful but

26
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:39,680
maybe the emphasis can be don't pick it up if you've picked it

27
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:49,760
up let it go if you can't let it go let it be let it be so so you stay in the in

28
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,480
mindfulness to do this not picking up and letting go require some degree of

29
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:02,239
mindfulness of awareness of what's Happening not picking up letting go let

30
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:09,080
you kind of settle back just be aware now of the breathing of the body be aware of what's Happening rather than

31
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:17,519
leaning into it or caught in it or reacting to it and um and this doesn't have to be

32
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:26,159
how you live your life but uh it can be very effective as a relaxed approach to

33
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:33,000
meditation so you stay a little bit alert let go don't pick up let things be

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,640
and stay in the Contin continuity and let that help you remember to stay

35
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,799
present so to assume a meditation

36
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:50,519
posture and a a posture that given you

37
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,439
the conditions of your body mind and

38
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,840
life uh allow you or support you in being aware in the present moment here

39
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,879
and now that can

40
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:15,359
be any one of the four Great postures the

41
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:21,160
standing so walking standing sitting and lying

42
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:28,600
down and perhaps gently closing your

43
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:34,280
eyes and with [Music]

44
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,520
some sense of dedication

45
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,759
devotion spend a few moments arriving here and

46
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:52,360
now if you have some preoccupations or something that's

47
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,720
strong happening to you acknowledge it kindly acknowledge it

48
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,560

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:11,479
it recognize it maybe feel how it is to be this way

50
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:28,479
now and then take a few long slow deep

51
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:35,000
breaths for now letting go of the thoughts and

52
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,199
tensions and concerns that you have let go the best you can at least the

53

for

56
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:07,240
and then letting your breathing return to normal and continue with a few rounds of

57
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:14,759
breathing to relax in your body relax any tension in your body

58

59
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:28,440
with whatever way you might be feeling it's okay to be how you are but let go

60
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,319
relax

61
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:05,720

70
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:55,640
you go to your home base your default way of staying in the

71
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:02,320
present and as you do so be alert

72
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:10,680

by not picking up by letting [Music]

go something profound within is protected

115
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:41,080
BR if mindfulness of awareness has us connected to a deep

116
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:47,720
root of presence of wisdom or

117
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:55,679
Freedom then not picking up and not put not not picking

118
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:03,240
up Keeps Us close to

119
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,919
that treasure

120
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:18,480
within we do have something within to protect valuable to

121
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,039
protect that we lose all too

122
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,600
easily

123
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,600
for

124
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:13,120
there is a place within that's underneath the reactive

125
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:19,200
mind underneath the discursive mind story

126
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:29,519
mind where wisdom and

127
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:38,880
patience kindness

128
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:50,960
resides when not picking up when letting go and letting be can keep us close to

129
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,919
this deep root

130
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:01,720
inside we're protecting something

131
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:09,279
deep and as we come to the end of the sitting May our capacity to be

132
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:16,600
aware support us to stay

133
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:22,440
close to our deep inner capacity for

134
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:28,000
wisdom for kind attention patience

135
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,960
for generosity and

136
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:43,519
love and from there to gaze upon the world with good

137
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:49,000
will a good will that is a

138
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:58,440
well-wishing wishing everything in all directions well may all be

139
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:03,600
beings be happy may all

140
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:11,159
beings be safe may all beings be

141
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:15,679

[Music]

143
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:34,858
free [Music]

144
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,600
thank

145
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,320
you

146
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:52,278
so welcome to this ninth talk on the 10

147
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:57,760
protectors and this idea of uh

148
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:03,960
there are practices we can do that protect protect us and protect others

149
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:09,760
implies that there's something valuable to protect and

150
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:16,200
um and one of the discoveries through things like

151
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:22,960
meditation practice and spiritual practices of different kinds and other ways of being in the

152
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:31,519
world we discover that there is uh uh a place within of

153
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:37,480
well-being a place of happiness or peace a place of

154
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:44,159
wisdom a place that uh where there can be a phenomenally

155
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:51,240
wonderful easeful caring for the world even in the midst of great

156
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:58,039
tragedy that we don't have to sacrifice this valuable place within

157
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:05,559
and uh not sacrificed by the the strong human Tendencies for

158
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:13,240
anger for hostility for hatred for greed

159
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:18,360
for um jealousy and envy

160
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:23,399
for self-righteousness for

161
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:30,840
um you know to be caught up in anxiety to be caught up in fear to be caught in

162
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:36,799
ignorance these are common human Tendencies which tend to cover over tend

163
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:42,320
to restrict and are obstacles for this deep place where wisdom and compassion

164
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:50,559
can operate in a nourishing way in a healthy way so in uh there's a story that's told

165
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:56,480
by the Buddha kind of a fable and he talks about um that the ancient world

166
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,679
there are two acrobats and um and the AC the master

167
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:09,600
acrobat and The Apprentice and um and uh it turns out The Apprentice is

168
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:16,399
the name and the literal meaning of the name at least the way it appears to us and who know a little bit of Polly is a

169
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:23,720
frying pan and so I don't know you know jumping out of the frying pan or something why they name that that way

170
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:29,279
but um maybe it's you know you know irrelevant to the certainly

171
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:37,120
irrelevant to the story perhaps but the two acrobats and the master acrobat uh and

172
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:44,799
so the The Apprentice is going to climb up and do acrobatic Feats uh balanced on

173
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:51,679
the master acrobat maybe you know stand on one hand or a strong Master acrobat

174
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:57,519
is going to hold up um the with one hand the

175
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:03,559
The Apprentice who will do various acrobatic Feats um on this one hand of

176
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:11,200
the of the senior you know uh acrobat so so the

177
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,560
senior acrobat says um watch over me and

178
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:21,839
I will um and then we will both be safe

179
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:30,440
and I'll watch over you and that way we'll both be safe and The Apprentice said no that's not how it works um I'll

180
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,878
watch over myself and then we'll both be safe and you watch over yourself and

181
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:43,398
then we'll both be safe so in telling the story the Buddha said yes that's the way it is but he

182
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:50,599
doesn't quite then he goes on to do teaching which kind of little bit changes it even though he says uh he he

183
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:58,839
prefers the the the instructions from The Apprentice but he says yes and the

184
00:34:58,839 --> 00:35:04,000
way that we protect others by first protecting ourselves is

185
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:12,079
by practicing the four cultivating the four foundations of mindfulness to cultivate our capacity to

186
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:19,320
be aware in an embodied way aware of our body to be aware of our feelings the

187
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:24,920
feeling tones that we have to be aware of our mind states to recognize them and

188
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:30,680
know them well and to be aware of the mental state

189
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:37,760
mental activity of the mind that either creates tension the tension of

190
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:45,280
attachment or releases that attention that that tension and uh and reveals the

191
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:52,800
beautiful qualities of the Mind the seven factors of Awakening the Deep Insight that leads to

192
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,960
Liberation and so the mindfulness that uh cultivating those four foundations of

193
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:03,760
mindfulness that's the way we protect others and um and I suppose the

194
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:09,200
protection the way we're protecting others we're protecting them from ourselves remember the analogy of the

195
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:15,560
acrobat is uh there there are two people who are doing these amazing kind of

196
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:21,760
interrelated interactive um Feats

197
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:27,400
exercises and for the people who we were in direct contact with um in the ancient

198
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:34,560
world of the Buddha that was primarily where the influence and the effect that people had on each other was directly

199
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:40,200
with each other there was no uh social media in the time of the Buddha and uh

200
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:45,880
the communication lines were all through people's uh uh oral contact with each

201
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:51,240
other so it was even you know it gets more complicated in our modern world but

202
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:57,280
in the ancient world the Buddha reference point was how we're relating to people

203
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,800
directly when we have contact and in that world we protect others when we

204
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:09,400
protect ourselves and um when we cultivate the four foundations of mindfulness we're

205
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:15,800
not going to give in to Greed hate and delusion we're not going to get into the kind of ways in which we get caught up

206
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:21,160
and intense and reactive to what's going on and then people are protected from

207
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:26,800
our reactivity um and so the Buddha said so

208
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:32,160
then that would have continued and this is where he makes so first he agrees and this is how it's true and then he goes

209
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:40,200
on to say something little bit more inclusive he says um by um uh we protect

210
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:45,319
others by protecting ourselves by cultivating these four foundations of

211
00:37:45,319 --> 00:37:50,720
mindfulness we protect ourselves by protecting others when we

212
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:57,560
practice patience uh loving kindness uh sympathy

213
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:06,240
uh and um there's one more I forget what it is and um and uh so uh this idea of

214
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:13,160
kindness idea of patience with people the idea of um having sympathy for them

215
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:18,319
uh if we have those attitudes towards others that's a way of protecting

216
00:38:18,319 --> 00:38:23,640
ourselves so the protection goes you know in both directions that there are

217
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:31,000
certain things we do for ourselves that protects us from the kind of

218
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:38,480
unhealthy reactivity we might have and thereby protecting others and there's C things we can do for others uh which is

219
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,880
has to do with healthy supportive uh attitudes of Goodwill

220
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:50,040
towards others that then that in return protects ourselves we don't protect

221
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:56,960
ourselves when we meet people with hate we don't protect others when we meet with people with kind of a coldness and

222
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:04,880
indifference not really understanding where they are we don't understand others if we

223
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,000
are um impatient with them or intolerant

224
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:16,440
the word kti that's usually translated as patient uh can also mean uh tolerant

225
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:23,920
of others certain tolerance being intolerant in English usually is kind of not a very good thing to to way of

226
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,720
being and so to um and that's how we protect

227
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:36,640
ourselves and um so but the so now in this ninth protection of the 10

228
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:43,599
protectors uh what's um uh what it is is mindfulness Sati

229
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:49,480
awareness that um and it it's significant to me that it's the ninth of

230
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:55,839
these 10 that um that be practicing harmless that's

231
00:39:55,839 --> 00:40:01,440
the other one for anyway protecting uh um uh

232
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:07,680
harmlessness learning the Dharma well uh being devoted to the

233
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,760
Dharma uh being uh loving it uh there's

234
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:18,119
all these things that we've been talking about that that lead up to our support

235
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:25,160
and protect one of the greatest protections we have which is mindfulness and

236
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:30,640
um and so to practice mindfulness not just for the sake of

237
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:37,920
mindfulness but because hopefully at some point as we practice we know there's something valuable inside within

238
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:43,160
us we have we have uh access to a source

239
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:49,000
to a profundity to a place a

240
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,800
a a activity of of wisdom of compassion

241
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:00,520
of love of kindness of generosity of uh

242
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:06,760
non-harming of insight of being really grounded in a place of

243
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:12,960
non-attachment this is worth protecting and we protect it by being mindful

244
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:19,720
because if we mindful we'll see very the greater the mindfulness the

245
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:27,119
more acutely will see the movements towards reactivity the ways in which attachment

246
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:32,960
operates where we get involved we lean into we get caught up in we just even

247
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:41,880
justify reactivity and um and but to come back to that deeper place and to protect that

248
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:49,240
in doing that we protect others and we protect ourselves we do that and then we

249
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:56,599
have the opportunity to offer to others uh the good will the kindness that is a

250
00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:02,599
kind of extern protects us externally for mothers it tends

251
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:11,640
to uh the opposite of these things intolerance impatience uh harming others

252
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:17,240
uh ill will U being unsympathetic to the

253
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:22,559
situation of others that doesn't contribute

254
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:28,160
to others wanting to care for us

255
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:34,880
it contributes to the opposite so um so

256
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:40,280
mindfulness is a protector and the more

257
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:46,599
we're practicing mindfulness more we stay aware the more we have the opportunity to protect something that's

258
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:54,160
really precious within and from that we begin protecting others and uh and have

259
00:42:54,160 --> 00:43:03,400
the possibility of living a life where hopefully we're all protecting each other we all have a capacity deep inside

260
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:08,680
for beautiful qualities of being and if we want to find that in the

261
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:15,200
world and spread that in the world um let us become transmitters of it let us

262
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:21,520
be be people who demonstrate that this is possible and if no one demonstrates this

263
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:28,079
POS this is possible then how are people going to learn it

264
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:37,839
so thank you so we have one more protector for tomorrow and I very much appreciate this chance to talk about

265
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:43,040
these things and um May you protect

266
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:49,680
yourself and today if you can maybe practice mindfulness through the day

267
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:55,440
perhaps uh you'll you know whatever you remember to be mindful check in and

268
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:02,200
reflect on how you are and what just happened for you what's been going on the last minutes for you and see did you

269
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:08,559
lose your mindfulness and in losing the mindfulness did you get involved in a reactive way did you get involved in

270
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:13,920
something that ideally you would have been protected from some way of being

271
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:20,240
caught in a tense way or and maybe in that in seeing that maybe you'll say oh

272
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:25,680
yes mindfulness is a protector and um and it was it's wor it

273
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:31,000
would have been worth it being Mindful and been mindful so I didn't get so caught

274
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:37,000
up and if you didn't have any caught upness during the day then um the end of

275
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:44,760
the day you can celebrate thank you
