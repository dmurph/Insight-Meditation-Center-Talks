1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:08,160
okay welcome welcome folks uh I got uh the feedback on the

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:18,520
Bell this too quiet I've been ringing the bell at that level for like seven

3
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:25,519
years this is the importance of feedback it may render differently on YouTube

4
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:31,039
than when we're all uh on Zoom anyway

5
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:39,600
I will uh take that into account in half an hour when we are done officially

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,320
meditating and um yeah lovely to see uh See all these

7
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,960
names and be with you this week so

8
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,520
um okay let's uh settle in for uh some practice

9
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,920
together

10
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,920
e e

11
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:13,319
maybe just beginning with u whatever gratitude you

12
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:17,239
have for having a

13
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,519
path and even though you could say I was

14
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:41,159
pretty happy before finding

15
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:49,280
practice there was another way in which life

16
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,280
felt

17
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,840
unworkable that there were

18
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:09,000
existential questions challenges that I

19
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,560
had absolutely no answer

20
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:19,440
for and the path didn't answer

21
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:23,720
everything but it answered

22
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:31,200
enough and for that

23
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:37,200
there might be some good bit of

24
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,200
gratitude in your life in

25
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:58,560
mine so just let the the Gratitude uh you have for your

26
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,480
path just soften your heart as we begin

27
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720
here

28
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,680
e e

29
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,400
then where the attention goes is much less

30
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:43,560
important than the qualities of the

31
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:56,960
attention shinzen Yang defines mindfulness as a threefold

32
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:05,440
skill set working together concentration Clarity and

33
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:15,039
equinity the concentration the sense of

34
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:21,199
stability the stability of the attentional focus the

35
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:29,880
telescope gazing at the stars shaking

36
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:38,000
we uh miss the Grandeur of the sky we

37
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,400
stabilize the

38
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:52,759
attention that means we detect distractors that

39
00:06:52,759 --> 00:07:01,840
go nurture this stability this Fidelity to the object of

40
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:22,199
attention and

41
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:32,160
Clarity perceiving phenomena that much higher

42
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:43,919
resolution could say both temporally and and spatially that we're

43
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,680
perceiving time in thinner

44
00:07:50,159 --> 00:08:01,039
slices we're perceiving the object with greater magnification

45
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:09,919
higher resolution picture of the breathing or our body or

46
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,919
whatever

47
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,320
the equinity

48
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:20,279
becoming uh frictionless in the face of

49
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,560
samsara

50
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:33,480
frictionless even given the tides of pleasant and

51
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,680
unpleasant the tides of change

52
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,560
an we might still have

53
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:05,880
preferences but equinity Settles the compulsive energies to enact those

54
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:22,519
preferences for our purposes of Freedom everything becomes good

55
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
enough

56
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

57
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240

58

e e

64
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,839
maybe the anchor is your breathing or your body more

65
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,639
broadly maybe it sound

66
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,639
maybe the anchor uh is uh everywhere

67
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:50,880
nowhere we're cultivating concentration Clarity equinity Moment by

68
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:01,199
moment undaunted by the

69
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:09,240
pole of frenzy and

70
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:13,000
muddiness and

71
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:33,079
grasping we have some reverence for for the power of those

72
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:42,319
forces but we're undaunted just humbly Moment by

73
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:50,120
moment nurturing a kind of alertness and

74
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:59,040
stability higher resolution fr frictionless

75

76
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,760
e for

77
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:16,320
sometimes it seems like each moment is freedom beckoning us

78
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:36,840
and maybe I can't be totally free right now

79
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:44,559
but I will rehearse my freedom in this

80
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,320
moment I will not underestimate

81
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:04,240

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,320
don't let your mind to land

89
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:47,158
anywhere don't give it the security of

90
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:57,440
conclusions the security of having a place of having a ground of having reference

91
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,960
points having a

92
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:10,799
story don't give it the security of doubt and

93
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:23,679
spectatoring don't give it the hope that greed or hate might work out

[Music]

105
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,080
e

106
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:20,320
okay so um that's been good good to be with you this

107
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:25,759
week appreciate it um our

108
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:32,679
time so uh uh for me getting uh getting

109
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:40,840
into practice I think uh I saw Jack cornfields P path with heart early in

110
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:48,919
practice and what I I remember is maybe a chapter or something like that where

111
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:54,840
he suggested that at the end of our life uh one question will Loom

112
00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:02,159
large did I love well and it was

113
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:10,360
like that just felt very true and it was sort of like how do I do that what can I

114
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:16,480
do tell me what to do

115
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,080
and it's a beautiful question and fair enough to wonder what do I

116
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:29,200
do but it strikes me that uh we we've maybe

117
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:36,039
overemphasized Cho overemphasized choice and choiceful in

118
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:42,159
Dharma and sometimes underemphasize the training

119
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:49,320
Dimensions so we often you know talk about how Dharma

120
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:55,000
allows us to make wise choices we come to a kind of fork in the road we choose

121
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:04,399
the healthy the wholesome rather than the UNH wholesome we respond rather than we react we choose Letting Go rather

122
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:10,840
than holding on and um fair enough fair

123
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:18,559
enough but it somehow doesn't really capture the flavor of practice for

124
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:25,760
me and it strikes me that some of the emphasis on choice is about our

125
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:33,720
preference for control and doing this and a kind of instant

126
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:40,559
gratification o of uh just giving the agitated energy a

127
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:46,960
channel into which to flow right because we talk about

128
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:53,919
being being beingness something like this but a lot of what Dharma teachers

129
00:32:53,919 --> 00:33:00,880
including myself like say is like do these

130
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:09,039
things and whenever I say something like okay here are four things to do people

131
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:14,120
just take out their pencils and act like it's the the most important part of what

132
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:19,279
I'm going to say and I don't mean to belittle it

133
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:24,679
there's a place for that right

134
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:34,200
but the training aspects the kind of very quiet accumulation of Merit in the

135
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:44,200
heart made over a long period of time made by maybe many little micro

136
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:51,039
choices that strikes me as where the the heart of the Dharma is

137
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:58,720
and sometimes say that the Dharma is s better at preventing fires than

138
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:06,519
extinguishing them in other words it it is a training about creating good habits good

139
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:14,398
momentum elevating the trait level of mindfulness and equinity and love so

140
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:20,320
that it doesn't feel like a a choice we have to make to love rather than hate

141
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,760
hate is actually off the table but we don't know when that

142
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,960
possibility fell off the the

143
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:37,280
table if an athlete are being was being coached right in sports match or

144
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:46,320
something there might be some strategy make these choices do this but mostly it would be about trust your training right

145
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:53,960
you've been practicing for 20 years right you've been playing basketball for 20 years trust your

146
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:59,040
body right and so we commit to to

147
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:05,480
training and part of what that entails is a measure of patience you know that

148
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:11,880
the impulse to choose something now is that's sometimes right but

149
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:17,640
sometimes kind of naive we don't have to see everything

150
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:26,000
change now part of what we're doing is is trusting the logic of the

151
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,520
path the unfolding of the path uh and just making very small gestures of the

152
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:37,160
heart today not hoping to be totally free of

153
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:43,560
dukka right now but uh in training ourself in a

154
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:51,160
Dharma life and part of what that grants us is that we're less compulsive in our

155
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:56,920
evaluation how am I doing how's it going how free am I right now how much

156
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:02,800
suffering is is this it's like we're not we're not sampling ourselves every

157
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:09,200
moment to see how we're doing and in this interpersonal realm

158
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:15,800
we're not shocked or heartbroken when we get tangled up in the same way we used

159
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:21,200
to we just recommit to

160
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:29,040
training the the budha was was not a coup's

161
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:34,280
counselor or family therapist or organizational

162
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:42,240
consultant but at the same time so much of what was offered you know so

163
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:51,760
much of the Buddhist path is a training in loving well this gradual cultivation in loving

164
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:58,079
well there's really no obviously the Dharma is is aimed in a

165
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:03,599
sense we could say at freedom but we might also say there's no

166
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:09,079
part of the Dharma that should make us more annoying to

167
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:14,640
others you know that's sometimes like my main aspiration like what's your highest

168
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:22,000
aspiration Matthew it's like I just want to be a little less annoying I know you you all you stayed

169
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,880
through the week so you don't think I'm annoying but a lot of people do I'm trying to be less annoying that's like

170
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:35,480
my Peak bodh satva vow you know all of the teachings all of the

171
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:43,800
teachings are a way of um making us

172
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:50,280
actually uh bringing the the P the practice is

173
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:58,200
bringing the blessings of this path will inevitably spill into interpersonal life

174
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:03,359
Sila Samar PA you know ethical training mind

175
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:08,400
training wisdom this is all a training and loving

176
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:15,599
well and so CA we train in becoming a kind of

177
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:21,400
Refuge for others of gradually increasing our ethical sensitivity of

178
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:27,680
becoming more and more exquisitely attuned to our impact on others

179
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:33,359
this is um an aspect of CA but also an aspect of our

180
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:45,119
Clarity and as our ethical sensitivity grows we we feel more um cleanly bad

181
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:50,480
when we do harm muddled bad guilt and

182
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:57,000
this whole self story The muddled bad sometimes guilt is just the defense

183
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:03,160
against the the simple pain of remorse we start to feel cleanly

184
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:08,760
bad oh that wasn't quite

185
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:16,640
right no big thing wi uh no just we feel it and we

186
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:23,440
consolidate Our intention to love well to be careful with the hearts of

187
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,640
others and this Same Love Actually helps us begin to understand the care that

188
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:35,520
we're worthy of right we won't always get

189
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:43,040
it but it helps you understand the care the love you're worthy of we learn what

190
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:49,040
we're worthy of by loving well we don't decide to be good this is

191
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:55,920
not a choice we become gradually more and more devoted to minimizing harm that

192
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:03,280
is a training the the the Mind mind training samadi

193
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:10,680
this kind of broader sense of Mind training that is gradual it has profound dimensions for

194
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:16,880
our interpersonal life on Wednesday evening was talking

195
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:25,480
about the place of attention in attention in sexual sexual life

196
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:31,680
intimate life and attention obviously the training of

197
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:39,599
our attention has profound place in the whole of our interpersonal

198
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:46,000
life what does it mean to love is it like the deepest feeling the

199
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:53,079
strongest commitment is it un ambivalence no no it's not we can love

200
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:58,440
even with quiet feeling without the strongest commitment with ambivalence we

201
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:06,280
can love even with that a friend and colleague Mar beler

202
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:13,599
said um that love is the willingness to pay attention to love a person is to be

203
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:19,240
willing to pay attention to them it's not more complicated than that actually

204
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:25,960
paying attention to self or another is Love In

205
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:34,920
Action Maybe we say like no no no no it's got to be more than that Love's got to be more bells and whistles and

206
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:41,760
fireworks to love a person is to be willing to pay attention to

207
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:49,200
them deeply right to be genuinely

208
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:55,800
willing that's Love In Action when you actually cultivate what what it means to

209
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:02,599
pay attention you can sense how much love is in

210
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:10,119
that so we train in the receptivity of awareness we stabilize it we learn to in

211
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:15,480
this mind training we learn to tolerate more and more energy coursing through

212
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:21,720
our body and staying poised that's training a lot of the harm we do

213
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:27,400
interpersonally is when the body is overrun by energy

214
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:32,680
and we cannot stay poised we train in that

215
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:39,720
Poise we learn how to deeply melt into the field of awareness to experience

216
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:44,760
self and other within the same

217
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:53,160
space our wisdom about um our

218
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:59,200
existential condition becomes through our clarity through our understanding it

219
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:07,200
becomes um more poignant it makes love more urgent we learn we learn and then

220
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:15,559
love becomes more urgent to let anicha truly inform our

221
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:23,160
love this is a product of learning training in wisdom that we cannot take that in in

222
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:30,119
one gulp cannot take in a nche in one gulp we train

223
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:35,400
in living not in light of

224
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:40,440
immortality but with the understanding of finitude

225
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:45,078
we live in the light of

226
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:52,119
finitude n said that truth is a portioned to one according to their

227
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:55,119
strength

228
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:04,558
Dharma training makes us stronger makes us

229
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:12,160
stronger we understand more about craving and love and kindness and re

230
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:18,760
renunciation if we don't understand that we cannot love well if we don't understand

231
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:25,119
self-deception and the ways in which much of our life is a confabulation of

232
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:30,400
greed and aversion it's hard to love well we

233
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:39,599
are uh stepping out of self deception Rodney Smith

234
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:47,920
said when we're living in that we confuse ourselves confuse others become

235
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:54,720
defensive uh we're training in wisdom all of this

236
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:03,520
is a training and we often look for the kind of

237
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:09,800
fireworks moments of breakthrough Insight but often we just do not detect

238
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:17,880
the slow melting of Dua the slow accumulation of the parames of the

239
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:23,680
the strengths of our heart a function of

240
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:29,280
training maybe it sounds like all this training yeah but it it it's like isn't

241
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:38,280
