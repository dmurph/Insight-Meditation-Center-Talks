1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:11,200
so good day and uh it's actually feel quite wonderful to be

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,600
here with you all and not only is there an opportunity to

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:26,800
meditate and talk about the dharma it's also remarkable to

4
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:38,320
feel the good will and the warmth and the gratitude that uh comes through the chat

5
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,960
and i'm sure represents many other people who don't participate in the chat

6
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,760
and for all of us to be sharing in this together quite remarkable and maybe it's

7
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,920
almost uh certainly adds the richness of the meditation we do to feel like

8
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:04,799
we're doing it in such a friendly community so thank you very much

9
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:13,840
and um

10
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:23,920
when doing meditation it's really best not to try to be a perfectionist

11
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,680
any attempt at perfection probably goes in the opposite direction

12
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:36,000
it makes it harder we strain more and maybe it gets more brittle

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,040
and i think that the idea is to be at ease with how things are

14
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,119
not how we think they're supposed to be to be at ease with how things are not

15
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:53,439
with what we think they're supposed to be and to have that and then and to have

16
00:01:53,439 --> 00:02:00,399
that ease not be perfect so that not looking for perfect ease and what

17
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,320
this means is that we're partly

18
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,560
learning to hold [Music]

19
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,760
ourselves be mindful of ourselves without it needing to be all one way

20
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:24,000
but we have an ease with holding things together that are maybe some good and some not so

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,640
good some some pleasant some not pleasant some uh you know what we think this what we is

22
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:38,319
what's happening is what we think is supposed to be happening what's happening is not what we think was happening all these things can co-exist so for

23
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:44,480
example people associate meditation with a quiet mind not thinking so much or not

24
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:51,040
thinking at all and so people some people that are trying to have that no thinking state

25
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,160
i think it's better to be at ease with the mind that thinks certainly it's nice to let go of

26
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,760
thoughts and quiet the mind and it's nice to come to a place where the mind is not thinking so much

27
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:09,840
but even better is not to be disturbed by your thoughts and to be at ease with them and

28
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,120
in that way it's possible to let some thinking just recede into the background

29
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,640
and rather than being preoccupied by with the idea of having no thoughts at all

30
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,720
it's um it's uh we could just um let some you know some thinking can just

31
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,879
go on in the background and we can kind of know what we're thinking or maybe not as long as

32
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:39,519
in the foreground we're just staying with the breathing or staying with our present moment experience and

33
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:45,840
so these two can coexist and uh and so but it when thinking comes

34
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,200
into the foreground then we learn to practice with it but even then the idea is to be at ease with

35
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:59,280
it and the same with uh discomforts in the body some people have like a homing

36
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,360
instinct uh maybe because of fear to just kind of really tune into

37
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,519
uncomfortable painful sensations the body be worried concerned um but you know and expecting they're

38
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,959
supposed to be completely comfortable all the time but also comfort and uncomfortability

39
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,320
can co-exist and sometimes it's just fine to have a certain

40
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,240
level of pain discomfort also be kind of in the background or just be part of the overall environment

41
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,759
and not needing to zero in on it and focus on it and that allows us to kind of open up

42
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,800
and focus on all this allows us to then gently focus on what is

43
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:45,199
onward leading what is really supportive of us to develop the meditation further it's

44
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:52,560
supportive to focus on that part of our experience where we're not thinking a lot where we're feeling and quietly calmly

45
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,080
feeling the experience letting the thoughts be in the background at some point in meditation

46
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,360
it's onward leading um to uh to become aware of the pleasant

47
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:11,600
sensations that um they're not there because of some we're getting you know some wonderful ex

48
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:18,320
sensual experience but rather uh as we settle as we settle and feel

49
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,160
more content here more then then we feel uh kind of the meditative

50
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:31,759
contentment meditative comfort and pleasant pleasantness of the experience and that is a useful

51
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:38,080
thing to open to and in the background there might be discomfort but if it can just be in the

52
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,280
background don't worry about it too much and gently open to the pleasant to the

53
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:50,320
meditative pleasure joy contentment that might be there or the feeling of rightness the feeling

54
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:56,160
of this is good to be here so there's a wide range of kind of

55
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,520
pleasant enjoyable or right feelings that might come as we meditate

56
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,680
and to open to those and let them spread or i like the notion of just opening the body to them and

57
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,720
so they they fill us more or they expand more

58
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:21,120
so taking a meditation posture and gently closing your eyes

59
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,919
and and kind of settling into your posture

60
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:35,039
and here also we don't want perfection with a posture i like the expression just good enough

61
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:40,240
just good enough for you to be here and settle settling in

62
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:53,520
and then if you can set yourself at ease

63
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:02,080
set yourself at ease in your body

64
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,120
and that can mean to be easy be easy with what's happening in your

65
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:16,319
body ease up a bit around the body

66
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:31,840
and then as you exhale settle and relax the body further

67
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:45,840
and then set yourself at ease in your heart in your emotional life

68
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:54,240
let yourself be easy with whatever feelings and emotions you might have

69
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:03,199
ease up on them a bit not to make them go away or make them different but ease up

70
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:09,680
be easy with it all an easy

71
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,840
relationship

72
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,960
and then set yourself at ease in your mind with the things you're thinking about or

73
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:30,639
concerned with see if you can let yourself be easy

74
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,399
with the activities of your mind

75
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:43,279
easing up the pressure easing up the heaviness the contraction

76
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:55,360
around the concerns

77
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:03,600
and then as you exhale to relax your emotional

78
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,839
being relax and soften in your heart

79
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:23,839
as you exhale relax and soften in the thinking mind

80
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,680
maybe the notion that you're making lots of space for your thinking mind

81
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:51,839
so you start feeling the peacefulness or the calmness of the space around it

82
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:05,760
and then settling into your body and feeling your body

83
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:13,760
globally in whatever easy way there's

84
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:20,320
maybe a broad awareness baby awareness that gently slowly

85
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:33,839
roams around the body to touch into things to be aware of the body

86
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:46,640
as you exhale softening the shoulders

87
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:52,959
as you exhale softening the belly

88
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:06,399
as you exhale settling in to your body your posture your place

89
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,839
here

90
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:27,279
and then to if it's possible if it's available

91
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:34,480
perhaps you can feel some modicum of contentment

92
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,880
or allow yourself yourself to feel some degree of contentment

93
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:48,399
to just be sitting here quietly peacefully

94
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,880
aware of whatever is here for you whether it's comfortable or

95
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:01,839
uncomfortable pleasant or unpleasant

96
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:10,959
it's very significant and valuable to be aware of how things are

97
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:16,720
and to be content with just this opportunity to be quiet enough

98
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,240
to be aware of it all pleasant and unpleasant

99
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:31,120
difficult and easy it's all okay just to be here aware

100
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:53,839
maybe letting go of perfection that things have to be just so

101
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,040
and then feeling your breathing more fully

102
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,560
being at ease with whatever way you're

103
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:27,279
breathing being easy with your breath even if it's labored or tight

104
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:35,120
be easy ease up

105
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:42,240
not needing the breathing to be perfect it's okay for it to be unpleasant

106
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,600
if you're feeling it

107
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,639
it's okay for it to be pleasant if you know it

108
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:03,040
and maybe there's a little bit of both with breathing

109
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:09,519
as you go through the cycles of in-breath and out-breath some of the experiences of breathing a

110
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,600
little bit more pleasant some are a little more

111
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,839
unpleasant

112
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:31,120
offering yourself the gift of knowing just knowing how it is and just knowing

113
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:39,839
is enough as you go through the cycle of in and out expanding and contracting

114
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,959
inhaling and exhaling

115
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:13,839
settling in to breathing

116
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:29,279
and in the breathing itself as you exhale relax

117
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:41,839
and let go soften go with the releasing

118
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:50,639
like you would let go of at the top of a slide just like to slide down

119
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:57,279
let go with the exhale sliding down the

120
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,560
length of the exhale

121
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,839
let go

122
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:31,440
and then as you inhale receive the full inhale

123
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,839
allow your body space to breathe in

124
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,558
and then as you're breathing breathe with whatever is

125
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:16,720
pleasant letting the unpleasant be there but not focusing on it so much

126
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:26,558
any feelings of contentment or comfort or pleasure

127
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:34,080
delight or joy happiness or well-being

128
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:43,440
maybe a subtle glow or a subtle warmth or a brightness

129
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:49,120
tingling or vibration

130
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:58,840
or maybe a pleasant energy that seems to come along with breathing through the

131
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,840
body

132
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:15,200
sliding down the exhale allowing for the inhale

133
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,919
sliding down what is pleasant

134
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:29,840
allowing for what is pleasant the joy the happiness well-being

135
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:45,919
letting the thinking mind become quieter so you can better feel the goodness of

136
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,679
just being here breathing

137
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:59,679
allowing that goodness the pleasure to fill you to spread throughout everywhere

138
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:10,559
even the places where there that are uncomfortable let those be touched and filled

139
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:25,840
by whatever degree of well-being that might come meditating

140
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:24,799
so as we sit here to remember that things don't have to be

141
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:33,278
all one way or we don't have to focus on just one aspect of our experience

142
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:40,880
there's a way in which we can be at ease and inclusive of all of it the pleasant and the

143
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:50,240
unpleasant but then open more to the pleasant side

144
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:56,080
not at the exclusion of what's difficult but to better more bowel in a more

145
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:01,919
balanced way to hold it and be with it

146
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:08,880
and if we turn our attention now to the suffering of the world suffering of people you know and

147
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,960
suffering of this covet time and

148
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,279
so many people challenged

149
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:27,520
there can be a strong tendency to focus on the suffering

150
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:37,120
exclusively to feel the suffering the pain of the world or of other people

151
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:44,640
and think that caring about it means you have to really focus on it exclusively

152
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:51,919
i believe that compassion is richer fuller

153
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:58,399
more compassionate if it doesn't exclusively focus on

154
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:05,120
the suffering but realize there's always more there's

155
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:13,840
always the pleasant the non-suffering that's happening at the same time

156
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:22,399
and to include what is good and what is

157
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:27,760
healthy and has sense of well-being to it or

158
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:35,120
goodness in it and to have a broader field of attention

159
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:42,399
so we the suffering can be held together with or inside of

160
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:49,120
a sense of well-being or sense of subtleness or ease

161
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:57,600
and so we can better recognize that the people were thinking about or focused on

162
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,120
they're more than just suffering people

163
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:12,000
and you are more than someone who just focuses on suffering

164
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:20,799
there's a wider context in that wider context of well-being and

165
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:27,200
wellness and not wellness allows compassion to be fuller and

166
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:35,039
more penetrating and more pointing to the end of suffering

167
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:42,480
so as we end this meditation now may it be that our ability to be

168
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:49,200
inclusive of it all allow us to meet the suffering of the

169
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:55,440
world with greater care and kindness and compassion

170
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:04,320
may it be that the meditation we do is a direct support for us to enter the

171
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:10,240
world with compassion for all

172
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:15,600
may all beings be happy

173
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:22,799
may all beings be safe

174
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:28,960
may all beings be peaceful

175
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:47,840
may all beings everywhere be free
