1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:08,240
so hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:16,639
and happy to be here so

3
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:25,080
to continue into our meditation there's a

4
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,080
wonderful important

5
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:41,160
kind of complementarity between two things to do in meditation and that is on one hand to be

6
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:48,840
committed to being present and uh be committed to being

7
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,199
mindful here and now in the present moment to be aware to stay awake

8
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:59,440
aware so a sense of commitment a sense of choice making a decision yes this is

9
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:07,200
what I want to do and I'll stand behind it I'll I'll be um involved with this

10
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,000
this is what I'll put my life energy into for these minutes so that's one

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,600
hand the other hand is uh to have the

12
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,360
awareness practice the mindfulness practice be

13
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:31,880
calm be light be easy

14
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:37,880
going be maybe even have a sense of happiness

15
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:44,399
or joy as part of it to feel the goodness the

16
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:50,920
wholesomeness of being present so putting those two together

17
00:01:50,920 --> 00:02:00,840
it's a commitment which sounds like a heavy duty word a commitment to being light

18
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:08,239
commitment can seem like a word that requires us to Bear down and be

19
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:15,519
serious but it's a commitment to be easy to be

20
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:22,879
soft to be happy even if it's accessible to have a

21
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:30,000
joy so it's hard then to make the commitment be heavy and

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,200
a serious and kind of there's a there's a lightness and a

23
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:45,879
forgiveness a willingness to start over again and again where commitment is not so much

24
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:53,640
holding the course but over and over again in a light happy engaged way choosing to

25
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:59,959
start over again and again where the choosing over you feel so fortunate to

26
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:07,159
be able to do this because the alternative maybe is is

27
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:13,200
worse so commitment to being present in a calm

28
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,080
way so assuming a meditation

29
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:27,200
posture and there so much that can be expressed in the posture and now today a posture that is

30
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:34,799
expresses a commitment to be here be rooted here in a relaxed

31
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,080
way and it's for each of us to find the posture that has to balance between

32
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:48,040
those two and then gently closing the

33
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,200
eyes and as a beginning of this

34
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:02,079
commitment you know the word commitment in it uh I understand the Latin root has

35
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:09,760
the word to touch in it to touch together to stay connected stay in

36
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:18,120
touch and that works very well for mindfulness a commitment is to stay in

37
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:25,880
touch with our present moment and to begin by being in touch

38
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:31,560
with breathing by taking some

39
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,800
enjoyably Pleasant deeper

40
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,080
breaths and relaxing on the exhale

41
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:12,600
adjusting the arms a little bit so that the shoulders can relax

42
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:35,199
more then breathing Norm normally and as you breathe in a normal

43
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:44,479
way scan through your body to see what you can relax soften

44
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:19,400
and sometimes it's possible to do a global relaxation and a sense as you

45
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:25,919
exhale to relax or calm the whole body

46
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:48,759
and similarly to relax the thinking mind maybe there's a gentle way of

47
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:53,800
scanning the mind for the places where there's

48
00:06:53,800 --> 00:07:01,520
contraction or tension or pressure as

49
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:17,479
agitation and the relaxing calming of the thinking mind with every exhale

50
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,759
and then find some sensation in the body maybe in the

51
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:02,039
hand that is relatively neutral doesn't have any pain in

52
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:06,800
it uncomplicated place of

53
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:17,080
sensation and for a minute or two to be aware mindful of the this part of your

54
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,800
body experimenting to see how you can be aware

55
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:31,159
calmly lightly a light touch

56
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,279
not so much activating the thinking

57
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:47,959
mind but rather activating the calm

58
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,160
hand so the awareness almost flows out of the

59
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:01,440
hand being aware of Sensations in a calm soft way

60
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:25,640
where awareness has no agendas around being aware of the

61
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:33,720
hand where awareness is maybe receptive and open open and soft to the

62
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,279
hand or you're whatever you're paying

63
00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:03,000
attention and now in the same way to be aware of the body

64
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:09,040
breathing finding a location where it's relatively easy to be aware of the

65
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,360
sensations of the body connected to

66
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:22,720
breathing and to be committed to being in touch

67
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,760
but the commitment being soft and relaxed and

68
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:57,639
calming being committed to as continuous as

69
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:01,240
possible soft

70
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:08,079
awareness that has a very light touch to

71
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:18,279
it and if the mind wanders away don't rush back to the

72
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:26,440
breathing reestablish a calm awareness soft

73
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:31,240
awareness and invite the breathing back in

74
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
and

75
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
for

76
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
for

77
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
for

78
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,079
for for

79
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:04,839
whatever is agitated with within you know it

80
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:13,040
calmly a calm light awareness that is not

81
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:18,880
reactive it's simply knows simply

82
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
aware

83
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
for

84
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920

e

87
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,840
for for

88
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,799
a gentle soft

89
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:43,919
commitment to being present more than wandering off in

90
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
thought

91
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,720
e for

92
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:07,520
and if you can touch into a calm

93
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,039
awareness light

94
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,400
awareness is there any feelings or

95
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:25,000
sense of wellbeing in the awareness

96
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,480
itself any goodness

97
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:38,440
any Delight or Joy however

98
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:46,919
mild in this amazing capacity we have to be

99
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:56,559
aware here and if there is

100
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:05,158
breathe with that open to that

101
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,880
well-being make room for it to be here

102
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
too

103
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
for

104
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

105
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

106
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
for

107
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
for

108
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
for

109
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,360
for for

110
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,240
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

111
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:08,080
to take a few moments to feel whatever degree of

112
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:15,360
well-being that might be here for you maybe together

113
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:23,520
with something that's a little more troubling where's the

114
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:29,279
well-being some sense of calm subtleness

115
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,279
some sense of happiness or

116
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:52,360
inspiration some sense of rightness or goodness of being present with what

117
00:26:52,360 --> 00:27:00,120
is in whatever way degree we can it's good

118
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:07,720
soon enough we'll go about our day and we probably will be less present

119
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:15,720
less aware in this intimate close way of Our momentto Moment

120
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:30,159
experience it's good to have time to do this to feel the goodness of it

121
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:45,880
and then to consider is there any appropriate

122
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:53,120
way of offering this out into the world to support

123
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:58,640
others is there any appropriate way

124
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:04,840
to bring with you your this practice so you can make this world a

125
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:10,360
better place for

126
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:17,279
others may all beings be

127
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:26,440
happy may all beings be safe may all beings be

128
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:31,480
peaceful may all being beings be

129
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:37,799
free and may we contribute to that

130
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:50,109
[Music]

131
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:00,039
possibility thank you

132
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,080
for e

133
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,159
so hello and welcome and uh this will be the

134
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:22,120
beginning of a four-part series following the five-part series on the

135
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:30,360
four noble truths which are the truths of suffering and now I'll offer you uh four

136
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:37,200
truths of happiness and uh these don't come directly from the Buddhist teachings but

137
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:44,360
hopefully uh I've been so involved in the Buddhist

138
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:49,518
teachings for so long that this can be a kind of

139
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:55,919
a reformulation reformulating it in some way that is useful for you

140
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:01,080
all and begin with theide idea is that happiness is a very important part of

141
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:10,080
Buddhist practice that uh it might be overlooked if the emphasis is so much on uh

142
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,840
suffering some people are quite inspired and maybe even inspired in a happy way

143
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:23,039
when they've people have told me this that they've come to hear heard a Buddhist teachings some Dharma teacher was

144
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:29,080
emphasizing that uh how much suffering there is in the world and aiming it directly

145
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:35,000
and that it was such a relief to have someone say that that there is suffering in this world there's lots of suffering

146
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:42,039
in this world that we're suff we suffer a lot because so many of the people around

147
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:48,320
were denying it or trying to pretend otherwise or painting it over with some

148
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:54,120
kind of you know bright picture of how things

149
00:31:54,120 --> 00:32:00,720
were you know wonderful and inspiring or always just ignore it and something like

150
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,639
that and so to hear someone name it so that we say that

151
00:32:06,639 --> 00:32:13,960
um you know I like to say that we in Buddhism we stop for suffering we stop to look at it to spe with it to be to

152
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:19,159
see it for what it is to study it to find our way through it but not so that

153
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:26,200
we can suffer better but rather so we can become free of suffering and in that

154
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:32,559
freedom to find Happ and one of the primary description of

155
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:39,440
someone who has matured in this Buddhist practice is uh emotional description is

156
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:45,480
that they are peaceful and they're happy and uh in the time of the Buddha

157
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:51,880
there was people who were surprised to be around the the Buddhist monastic

158
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:59,120
Community to see how much they smiled how happy they were the joy that was there

159
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:06,639
and uh and so to come to a place of Happiness to come to a place of Joy uh

160
00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:14,880
without denying that they're suffering without becoming the victim of the world's suffering without becoming

161
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:21,120
the the uh reacting to it but finding a whole different way of being honest in

162
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,919
the middle of it and finding some way to have a genuine appropriate kind of

163
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:32,440
well-being there is happiness in this world so

164
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:37,519
that's the first truth of Happiness there is happiness there's possibility of

165
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:42,679
Happiness it's U it's U it's healthy to

166
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:49,240
experience that happiness it's okay to experience that happiness there are religious traditions

167
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:55,440
and cultures including time on time of the Buddha that mistrust joy and

168
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:02,519
happiness and I've had people come and uh asked me explicitly uh as a Buddhist teacher is

169
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:07,799
it it really is it okay to experience Joy because somehow way they G grew up

170
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:13,839
Joy somehow belonged to the world of of um I don't know of

171
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:19,760
indulgence and to really be a good religious person you're supposed to suffer better actually you know supposed

172
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:27,040
to suffer and if you suffer well then you know something good will happen to you after you die in the time of the

173
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:32,599
Buddha uh he this was something like that was happening time of the Buddha that when

174
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:40,440
the Buddha discovered a deep meditative joy that uh uh one of his first big

175
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:46,440
insights was this is a healthy Joy this is a joy that's onward leading to

176
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:52,520
Greater freedom and he said this is a joy not to be afraid

177
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:57,800
of so this there is happiness and to not

178
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,920
dismiss it to not Overlook it to not think that there's other things that are

179
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:10,200
more important um it would be like saying that um

180
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:17,400
um there are really important things to do in the world people take care of do all kinds of things that we don't

181
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:23,200
shouldn't really stop to eat any meals we shouldn't stop to eat any meals

182
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:30,320
and enjoy the meals while we're eating them um but in fact it's healthy to eat

183
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:37,720
we should stop and eat take care of ourselves and it's actually healthy to stop and eat calmly and clearly in a way

184
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:43,160
that enjoys the food enjoys the occasion all kinds of things can kind of go

185
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:49,880
better physiologically for us if we're not living in a stressful hurried

186
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:57,680
way and so happiness is a phenomenally important possibility for human beings

187
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:03,000
and it's a condition it's a support for all kinds of other things happiness is

188
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,400
almost like opening certain kind of joy and happiness dharmic happiness is

189
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:16,400
almost like it opens the door to the depths of our hearts depths of our inner

190
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:24,520
life recently I saw someone Define the soul not in a in a religious way but

191
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:31,359
more of a psychological way as uh the soul is the um is the inner depths of a

192
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:38,560
person and inner depths are often not uh experienced and felt and made time for

193
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:46,599
and uh and part of the function of being settled and calm peaceful and happy is

194
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:52,640
to have it the conditions in place to receive and sense and feel our depths

195
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:58,480
the wisdom the creativity the challenges the processing the unresolved issues

196
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:05,640
that are there that um all uh do well to be seen and received in Consciousness in

197
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:11,520
a deep way and uh and so what is the happiness

198
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:17,280
you have in your life can you Avail yourself of more happiness joy

199
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:23,520
well-being uh is there are there small Joys through your day that you you are

200
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:31,640
overlooking because you have such important things to do or you're in a hurry Hur or you're on a on a device

201
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:38,119
that you know uh surfing the web and maybe with a little bit of addictive uh

202
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:46,480
mindset you know going to the next click the next click looking and not quite able to get off when time is to get

203
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,599
off and um so uh and what how does that

204
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:58,839
limit you could you stop and just look out the window and uh and enjoy and feel happy

205
00:37:58,839 --> 00:38:04,160
about what you see uh some people now are experiencing winter starting and

206
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:11,079
there's snow outside the window or there's a foliage of changing color or

207
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:16,720
all kinds of things it might be a squirrel that's bouncing around but the

208
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:22,720
um uh there might be small Joys there might be small Joys and to experience

209
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:29,920
with the food you eat take time to eat it and appreciate the fact that you have food not everyone does and not to feel

210
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:35,599
guilty for it but to feel a certain kind of um uh

211
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:41,000
well-being joy happiness safety to take time to

212
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,560
walk when you you have to walk from a parking space with your car to some place you're

213
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:52,920
going um to show up a little bit early and take your time to walk even if it's

214
00:38:52,920 --> 00:39:00,480
just a couple of hundred feet maybe take a longer walk than the most direct walk so you can walk uh close to some nice

215
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,720
trees and just appreciate the trees or appreciate a little view

216
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:12,160
or see something that's kind of enjoyable for you to don't overlook the

217
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:18,160
small Joys the small enjoyments the small Pleasures when they're

218
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:24,319
available don't have to chase them don't have to Crave them don't have to try to

219
00:39:24,319 --> 00:39:29,720
make them up too much but there might be through the day all kinds of things that

220
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:36,680
just slow down a little bit look around pause see and there might be much more

221
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:42,720
well-being than you usually allow yourself to feel even in emotionally

222
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:51,200
difficult states that are quite you know difficult and maybe emotionally painful um there are things we can do to

223
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:56,800
bring some joy and happiness in in in with us I suspect that um this is part

224
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:02,079
of the function of cat videos that some people it really takes them out of their

225
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:09,800
own um difficulties because it's so they so delighted by kitten Behavior or cat

226
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:18,079
behavior and so I'm not necessarily recommending that but there are things we can do that um we can bring sprinkle

227
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:24,599
more Delight joy happiness through the day and not just that but as we

228
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:31,040
experience it to allow ourselves to experience to let it register in a deep

229
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:38,839
way so the first truth of s of happiness is there is

230
00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:46,240
happiness there might be more happiness and well-being that we can Avail ourselves than we usually do and it's a

231
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:51,680
good idea to do it has a good effect on us to do that it supports other good

232
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:58,640
things to come that there is a happiness that opens the doors of the heart and uh
