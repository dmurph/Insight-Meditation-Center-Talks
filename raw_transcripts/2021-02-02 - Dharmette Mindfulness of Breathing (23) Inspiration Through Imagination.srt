1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,840
so my friends

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,520
that the

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,040
kind of subject for this week is

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,679
the fifth and sixth step of mindfulness

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,519
of breathing which is to experience

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,720
joy and happiness in meditation

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,320
and it's certainly not easy to

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,119
experience that and you can't just do it

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,199
just because the instructions say so you

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,880
should do so

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,920
but to explore this territory of joy and

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,640
happiness

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,120
meditative well-being and some of the

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,520
conditions that support it some of the

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,559
things that bring it about can be very

16
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,079
helpful

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,079
and so that's a topic for today this

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,200
week

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,559
and so

20
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,280
um so there's uh the precursor

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,520
uh often the suttas for joy and

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,559
happiness

23
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,079
is gladness and uh the word is

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,640
pamoja p-a-m-o-j-j-a

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,960
and uh pamoja comes from the

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,119
the kind of the root word we don't never

27
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,080
know if the

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,960
root or the etymology is that important

29
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,880
for the people who spoke it but

30
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,400
it's certainly a fun game to play

31
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,759
and so the paw is the prefix can mean

32
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,040
either outward or upward and

33
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,280
the moja comes from the word for face

34
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,400
mukka and um so

35
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,560
the the uh

36
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,799
the idea of you know something of the

37
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,200
face uplifting face

38
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,320
a face that's rising up or maybe a mouth

39
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,520
sometimes the mouth is

40
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,320
closely associated with his word from

41
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,600
for face

42
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,600
and it's the uplifting of the lifting of

43
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,640
the mouth

44
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,040
i think of it as uh uplifting up the

45
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,079
corners of the mouths to make a smile

46
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,159
so is that which and uh lip makes a

47
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,280
smile

48
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,280
or a kind of maybe a beatific kind of

49
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,599
out upward gazing at what inspires us

50
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,760
and in fact and for the buddha the

51
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,800
the he encouraged people

52
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,360
when there's difficulties in meditation

53
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,640
to think about

54
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,239
or imagine an inspiring something that's

55
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,840
inspiring

56
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,640
or but inspiring not in a way that's

57
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,080
activating because the word for

58
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,360
inspiring

59
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,480
also has the meaning for

60
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,760
confidence or peacefulness or kind of

61
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,200
brightness

62
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,760
so that which brings brightness or

63
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,640
confidence

64
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,400
or um or peacefulness

65
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,200
kind of a peaceful confident brightness

66
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,720
maybe

67
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,800
so we'd say in simply in english kind of

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,400
inspired

69
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,920
and and and to be inspired

70
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,280
uh when we sit down to meditate involves

71
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,720
activating

72
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,000
the imagination and

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,599
and we find that imagination

74
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,720
is regularly referenced

75
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,159
in the teachings of the buddha in

76
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,400
relationship to meditation

77
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,239
and this was certainly very different

78
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,159
than how i was introduced to both

79
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,120
vipassana practice and zen practice

80
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,360
where the explicit and the implicit

81
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,400
instructions

82
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,560
was not to not to be involved in

83
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,840
thinking so much

84
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,280
and certainly not to be involved in

85
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,959
imagination

86
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,560
this was the meditation practice about

87
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,239
just being present for things as they

88
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,680
directly are

89
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,239
unmediated by concepts unmediated by the

90
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,000
imagination

91
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,440
just the experience in and of itself and

92
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,000
the direct sensations direct contact

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,360
with things

94
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,200
uh and um and uh and that's definitely

95
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,319
true

96
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,959
but it becomes it becomes true as the

97
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,040
meditation gets more and more centered

98
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,680
in the present moment

99
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,840
and but to get ourselves centered in the

100
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,360
present moment and centered and present

101
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,799
moment with some

102
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,840
joy some well-being imagination can be

103
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,599
harnessed can be utilized for that

104
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,200
purpose

105
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,440
and and so the buddha encouraged people

106
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:19,840
to

107
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,560
think of an inspiring topic and some of

108
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,400
the things that he

109
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,160
talked about that were inspiring uh

110
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,800
to think about that the buddha himself

111
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,240
think about someone who

112
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,639
you're really inspired by their practice

113
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,080
by their being how they are in their

114
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,880
life

115
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,440
in a way that kind of is inspiring

116
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,520
enough to really want to sit here and be

117
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,560
here and

118
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,040
kind of kind of puts to rest other

119
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,560
thoughts and concerns that

120
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,400
keep you distracted and

121
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,440
or to

122
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,080
the encouragement is to be inspired by

123
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,919
your own virtue

124
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,759
and of course that requires us to be

125
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,039
virtuous

126
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,639
and but the word virtue has

127
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,840
really means virtuous conduct so you

128
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,960
don't have to be

129
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,039
inspired by what you're feeling on the

130
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,720
inside

131
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,280
the buddha's teachings are be inspired

132
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,440
by how you act in the world

133
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,960
and if you're acting in a world without

134
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,039
causing harm if you're not you haven't

135
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,039
stolen any money from the bank lately

136
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,039
or you know it killed any of your

137
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,520
neighbors late recently or

138
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,560
you know done all kinds of things

139
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,000
then that's a source of being inspired

140
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,160
and it doesn't mean you have to be 100

141
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,440
virtuous

142
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,840
but to recognize the way that we are

143
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,320
living a virtuous life even if it's just

144
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,800
for today

145
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,520
not to be burdened by the past so much

146
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,680
and but rather be inspired by what is

147
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,080
good

148
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,199
and beneficial and so to be inspired by

149
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,560
one's own virtue

150
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,000
maybe that's a hard thing for many

151
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,560
people to imagine to experience

152
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,000
but it's certainly one of the teachings

153
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,600
of the buddha and one of the purposes of

154
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,039
being virtuous

155
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,840
is to create the inner context to be

156
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,840
inspired and gladdened and

157
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,960
uplifted so we're more so it's easier to

158
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,880
stay present

159
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,600
and the other thing that the buddha

160
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,240
makes explicit about what's inspiring

161
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,400
is

162
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,680
his mudita

163
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,039
the appreciative joy to think about the

164
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,240
things in the world

165
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,960
that bring you a wholesome nourishing

166
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,759
kind of joy

167
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,080
like so to share in the joy of others

168
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,080
who are doing wonderful things

169
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,360
and um and be inspired by that and so

170
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,520
this idea of being inspired

171
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,280
uh by things is um

172
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,120
is not meant to take us away from the

173
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,800
present moment or it'd be a spiritual

174
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,160
bypass

175
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,240
it's not meant to for us to dwell there

176
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,520
just kind of keep thinking about

177
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,000
thinking about and fantasizing about it

178
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,199
but rather to do it just enough that uh

179
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,319
it really orient us to the present

180
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,199
moment

181
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,599
it brings this uplifting kind of

182
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:10,639
feelings

183
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,199
and goodness that we're capable of then

184
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,319
feeling

185
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,639
and then writing those feelings into the

186
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,919
present moment

187
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,840
it's sometimes easier to be present if

188
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,360
there's some modicum

189
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,639
of well-being that's here as well

190
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,560
and it's not meant to be again

191
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,800
overriding or a bypass of the challenges

192
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,759
we have or the

193
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,039
suffering we have but it is

194
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,360
helping to create a context where it's

195
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,440
easier to be with the challenges

196
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,360
to work through them and meditate with

197
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,440
them breathe with them

198
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,800
and so the principle here that i think

199
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,400
that supports this idea of using the

200
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,000
imagination

201
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,479
for something that's inspiring is that

202
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,080
is that to to do it when the alternative

203
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,120
is worse

204
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,879
human beings spend a lot of time in

205
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,240
their imagination

206
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,000
imagine the future what's going to

207
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,360
happen the terrible things are going to

208
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,080
happen

209
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,960
imagining the past remembering you know

210
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,199
some percentage of our memory

211
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,599
is fantasy we it's well known that we

212
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,280
don't necessarily remember accurately

213
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,720
what happened in the past we're telling

214
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,639
ourselves a story we spin it a certain

215
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,440
way

216
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,759
we spin it around the things that really

217
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,440
have a charge for us whether it's good

218
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,319
or bad

219
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,440
and we kind of kind of stretching

220
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,000
certain parts of the story the memory to

221
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,039
fill the space of memory

222
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,240
in a way that not completely accurate

223
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,399
and uh and so sometimes that can be very

224
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,680
depressing and

225
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,959
agitating uh certain fantasies can be

226
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,320
not helpful at all and uh so if

227
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,240
we're doing that anyway in the

228
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,600
imagination

229
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,760
then uh it's possible to use the

230
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,279
imagination

231
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,680
don't fight the imagination then and try

232
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,440
which might not be working

233
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,480
but harness the imagination uh

234
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,160
to help you be here in the present

235
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,120
moment to gather together

236
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,120
and and then when you're here enough

237
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,519
then you can let go of the imagination

238
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,240
and then sit here and be present

239
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,320
so you know i've in the course of this

240
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,120
teachings i've offered some imagination

241
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,160
imaginary kind of scenarios images to

242
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,240
help for example

243
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,360
as i love this image for breathing of

244
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,080
the

245
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,240
of the waves of the ocean washing up on

246
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,920
the sandy shore

247
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,000
and kind of i have this image of myself

248
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,120
of of the

249
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,080
especially when the waves once they're

250
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,120
washed ashore

251
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,120
there's they're washing up across the

252
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,519
sand and making the sand wet for a while

253
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,000
and then they're receding and then as it

254
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,880
recedes it's

255
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,120
the sand is wet but then the the water

256
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,320
kind of that's

257
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,920
the surface kind of gets pulled into the

258
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,200
underneath the sand and so you get a

259
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,440
whole different texture feeling

260
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,360
of receding and absorbing

261
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,760
and this image of this of then of like

262
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,399
the

263
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,240
i use it different ways in meditation

264
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,560
but imagining the breathing

265
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,200
experience of breathing are the waves

266
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,160
and my

267
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,279
body is the sand or the experience of

268
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,120
breathing

269
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,200
the sensations that come and go the

270
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,560
cycles of

271
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,320
up upswelling and and receding

272
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,160
with the exhale is um washing across the

273
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,640
shore

274
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,760
the sand of awareness and it kind of

275
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,079
that's

276
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,560
that image kind of keeps me there and

277
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,839
involved

278
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,519
i've known some people who have one

279
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,959
person in particular who used

280
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,959
the image of a large bird maybe a

281
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,480
i don't know some large wonderful

282
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,320
majestic bird

283
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,040
flying in the sky and the inhales and

284
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,079
the exhales

285
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,880
were the with the the flapping of the

286
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,680
wings

287
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,519
the slow long just flapping in

288
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,160
the wings of the bird and uh and that

289
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,480
kind of kept her engaged and involved

290
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,040
and

291
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,160
flying along and

292
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,519
so to use the imagination

293
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,040
to help us be connected and then

294
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,199
to use it to help us be inspired

295
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,360
and and to know as i've said how not to

296
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,800
overuse it

297
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,079
how to use it so it's onwardly leading

298
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,360
in the direction i talked about

299
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,600
yesterday that we're going towards

300
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,480
uh doing less and less activity to quiet

301
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,279
or still or

302
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,640
states of mind and um to more

303
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,640
from courser to the more refined more

304
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,800
active to the more peaceful

305
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,600
and so we use these things to support

306
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,959
that process

307
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,120
knowing at some point we have to let go

308
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,079
of it

309
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,360
not relying on it too much not um

310
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,160
overdoing it not depending on it not

311
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,920
using it as a

312
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,600
antidote so we don't have to face our

313
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,680
difficulties or work through them

314
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,480
but rather as a way so that we can be

315
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,120
present

316
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,160
in an effective way

317
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,160
so um so to

318
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,000
particularly i want to end now with the

319
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,240
idea of inspiration

320
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,320
with that which brings a brightness and

321
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,360
uplift

322
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,560
a delight brings confidence

323
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,600
brings trust brings

324
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,319
willingness to engage in practice and

325
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,320
this idea of an inspiring things

326
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,399
and i would encourage you for the next

327
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,160
24 hours

328
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,519
to consider what inspires you

329
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,360
and stay close to thinking about it and

330
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,320
visiting it being with it somehow be

331
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,440
connected to it

332
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,680
or maybe there's many things maybe you

333
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,279
can talk to others

334
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,519
friends or anybody who you strangers

335
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,120
but you have this assignment to talk

336
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,200
about what inspires you and

337
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,480
and you'd like to share a little bit and

338
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,959
hear from them what inspires them and

339
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,839
and maybe in ways that are spiritual in

340
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,200
nature or

341
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,120
has to do with some of the fundamentals

342
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,519
of what gives their life purpose or

343
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,760
value

344
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,360
and in doing so i hope that you have

345
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,440
some wonderful conversations and

346
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,800
and some wonderful um time

347
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,800
uh thinking uh time with yourself

348
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,000
what is it that inspires you and maybe

349
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,200
that you can stay close to that so thank

350
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,240
you very much

351
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,600
and we'll continue a little bit this uh

352
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,800
the way the buddha uses imagination for

353
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,320
meditation

354
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,839
tomorrow thank you
