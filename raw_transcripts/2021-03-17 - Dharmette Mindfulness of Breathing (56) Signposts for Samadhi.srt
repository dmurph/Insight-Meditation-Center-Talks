1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,920
so

2
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,400
some people are fond of reading books

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,639
about buddhism

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,920
and if they want to learn about

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,960
meditation they might go find a book

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,760
or maybe nowadays some people go find an

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,720
audio recording

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,760
for the book people

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,680
the book we're trying to read is

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,040
found within ourselves we're learning to

11
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,960
read

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,559
ourselves read the signposts the

13
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,760
symptoms the movements the

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,960
process of meditation that unfolds

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,680
within us

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,640
that's the book to read or that's the

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,640
audio recording to listen to really

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,960
listen deeply into what's happening here

19
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,079
and sooner or later

20
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,280
all that we are to discover in buddhism

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,360
is meant to be discovered here in our

22
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,880
own body in our own experience

23
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,960
so to learn to read the signposts to

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,000
read the

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,400
to you know to leave to read what's

26
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,680
happening is part of with the skill

27
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,880
and uh for samadhi for developing

28
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,799
concentration

29
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,680
they the stability this composure this

30
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,560
unification of mind

31
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,680
there are signposts and

32
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,799
the pali word for signposts

33
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,840
usually translated into english as signs

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,240
is nimita n-i-m-i-t-a

35
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,680
and it's it's used in

36
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,360
very different way different ways down

37
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,119
to the history of buddhism

38
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,280
it has different meanings what this is

39
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,720
sometimes it's

40
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,799
reduced in meaning to being a visual

41
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,119
image that some people will see when

42
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,719
their concentration gets strong

43
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,600
maybe they're seeing a light maybe a

44
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,680
white light or yellow light this this

45
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,200
it kind of lights up as they get

46
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,680
concentrated and so the the

47
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,000
image is called the nimita but in the

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,080
early buddhist tradition animata is any

49
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,520
kind of sign

50
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,319
or indicator of the presence of

51
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,000
something or that something is about to

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,920
happen

53
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,680
and uh and so the the buddha said that

54
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,120
the nourishment

55
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,519
for samadhi what feeds and supports

56
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:32,879
somebody

57
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,000
is uh is two of these tasks two

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,400
of these signposts that we can find and

59
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,720
we can read we can recognize in

60
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,080
ourselves

61
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,280
and one of them is this

62
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,680
word samata sam s-a-m-a-t-h-a

63
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,720
and which means tranquility or calm or

64
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,560
quietude

65
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,840
and the other is a word that means

66
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,000
something like

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,480
non-dispersal or non-fragment

68
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,000
or non-um agitation of our thinking mind

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,159
and so as part of this unification

70
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,200
process

71
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,360
this gathering together being centered

72
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,480
here

73
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,879
we're not being de-centered by spinning

74
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,120
out

75
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,400
and and

76
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,040
i think the pali word that's translated

77
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,480
as non-dispersal

78
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,319
could maybe uh be read as a

79
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,040
non-decentered

80
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,799
uh as a as a

81
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,560
you know so and so so these these are

82
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,040
nimeta so as as we start getting

83
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,159
concentrated as we start getting settled

84
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,760
in sort of steadiness of mind then

85
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,640
to recognize these signposts to

86
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,799
recognize that there is a quietude or a

87
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,159
tranquility

88
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,640
or serenity however we want to translate

89
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,280
this word

90
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,120
samata and and to recognize we're

91
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,439
starting to be non-decentered

92
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,599
we're starting to be not scattered or

93
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,439
dispersed in our minds and

94
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,040
the mind's not jumping around and

95
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,799
chasing every thought that comes along

96
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:13,280
and

97
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,799
we're wandering off for minutes at a

98
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,479
time in our fantasies or our thoughts

99
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:20,720
but there's a real feeling now of being

100
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,600
gathered in

101
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,040
being non-dispersed being here and uh

102
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,880
that doesn't have to that neither one of

103
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,080
these have to be very strong at first

104
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,800
and this is where learning to reckon

105
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,280
know that these are signposts

106
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,919
they're kind of pointing the way so

107
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,600
there might be a lot of agitation there

108
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,880
might be a lot of dispersal of the mind

109
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,080
but if we keep focusing on those we

110
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,199
it's too easy to reinforce those

111
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,479
and the nourishment for somali is to

112
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,280
take in

113
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,960
to allow our son to experience to

114
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,440
experience or to

115
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,400
be supported by tranquility and

116
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,479
non-dispersal of the mind

117
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,280
this centeredness of the mind and

118
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,400
and so this and so even if there's a lot

119
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,840
of agitation

120
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,320
uh to recognize maybe in the cracks of

121
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:14,880
it

122
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,960
behind it in the back room of it in the

123
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,800
attic and the basement

124
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,280
somewhere inside to recognize oh there's

125
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,960
a little bit there

126
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,080
yes i'm agitated but in fact

127
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,360
a little bit in my sternum there's a

128
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,840
little feeling of tranquility there

129
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,720
a little bit in my hands my hands feel

130
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,440
steady

131
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,639
and confident and a little bit uh

132
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,639
calm tranquil and so to find where it

133
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,039
might be

134
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,120
don't manufacture it and don't worry too

135
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,120
much if you can't find it

136
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,639
we're talking about now as meditation

137
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,240
deepens and deepens

138
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,160
not just from you know just sitting down

139
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,080
and boom there you have to be able to do

140
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,880
this

141
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,880
but as you begin feeling yourself

142
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,039
settling and feeling yourself getting

143
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,960
more and more here and calmer than you

144
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,840
were before

145
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,000
that's when you start feeling that's

146
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,160
where the to appreciate

147
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,360
to affirm to validate these signs

148
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,960
these signposts this is good this is the

149
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,919
path forward this is the direction to go

150
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,120
this is the

151
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
now i'm now i've picked up the book

152
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,680
where the chapter where i left it

153
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,000
this is where where you know now i'm

154
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,440
picking up again where

155
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,520
you know the place where my practice is

156
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,240
really deepening

157
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,039
and and so to recognize these um

158
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,440
um

159
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,319
you know these these signposts so i see

160
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,000
there's a for the other

161
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,560
uh nimita there's two nimitas in pali

162
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,919
what is samata

163
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,039
and the other one is

164
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,479
a v y a g g a

165
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,240
and aga could mean like center and

166
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,639
and the vui is divided or separated

167
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,160
and a means not not separated from the

168
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,639
center

169
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,800
so this idea being centered um

170
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,759
so there are other signposts for samadhi

171
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,520
there's a lot of them

172
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,599
and so over time you might learn these

173
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,039
different ones

174
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,319
that um that uh

175
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,560
can support us oh this is good now that

176
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,000
we're in the territory

177
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,800
this is the direction forward because uh

178
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,560
to recognize it not so much to

179
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,039
be a not at all to be attached to it or

180
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,199
try to engineer and work too hard to get

181
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,639
concentrated

182
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,919
but simply to not

183
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,680
for the mind to begin recognizing that

184
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,319
this is the way forward this is the path

185
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,080
in the forest

186
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,400
as opposed to being distracted by every

187
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,120
little

188
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,160
troll and bird and insect and butterfly

189
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,479
off into the forest and we go chasing

190
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,919
after it and we lose the trail

191
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,800
so to gather ourselves together

192
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,280
to start feeling and recognizing these

193
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,639
signposts so

194
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,840
some of the other ones are as some

195
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,680
people feel have the physical sensations

196
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,199
that shift and change that show they're

197
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,639
getting concentrated

198
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,400
there can be tingling feeling of

199
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,639
lightness a feeling of

200
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,960
warmth the glow the feeling there might

201
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,159
be

202
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,800
some people there's a strong feeling of

203
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,959
physical pleasure

204
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:39,518
sometimes a little bit of pressure

205
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,880
vibration that begins

206
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,039
happening someplace some sometimes in

207
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,720
the forehead the people feel it there

208
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,920
sometimes in the chest

209
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,959
sometimes the belly

210
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,000
and sometimes parts of our body like the

211
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,880
arms

212
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,560
start feeling so light and maybe even

213
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,320
they seem to disappear because

214
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,279
things are so tranquil so peaceful there

215
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,279
or other parts of the body

216
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,120
the there might be a

217
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,680
visual signpost like i said there might

218
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,240
be

219
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,880
uh the field of vision starts it might

220
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,760
get completely

221
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,200
white or some other color sometimes

222
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,399
there are

223
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,080
some people when they get concentrated

224
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,680
will see little shapes

225
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,120
in their field of vision sometimes

226
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,279
geometrical shapes

227
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,600
and um it's important not to get

228
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,760
distracted by these things by the by the

229
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,800
visual

230
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,959
uh images especially if there's like

231
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,000
geometrical

232
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,880
signs or shapes or something but they

233
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,120
are

234
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,519
supportive and so to take them kind of

235
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,640
like

236
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,959
in the background of your experience oh

237
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,640
i'm on track i'm getting this is this

238
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,160
this is a signpost that i'm getting

239
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,680
concentrated that i'm

240
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,440
deepening here and uh

241
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,920
and is is

242
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,440
and then there are um what could be

243
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,160
considered may be more mental

244
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,279
signposts or emotional signposts a

245
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,959
common one is joy

246
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,320
and feeling a joy welling up

247
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,160
delight the kind of pleasure sometimes

248
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,839
it's even a sense of rapture

249
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,079
when the samadhi gets strong but there's

250
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,480
a feeling of delight of gladness

251
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,680
of relief that might be there and um

252
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,240
sometimes uh it's a deep sense of

253
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,360
happiness

254
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,519
something is more sublime more subtle

255
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,360
more more of a sense of contentment a

256
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,680
deep contentment in the quietude

257
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,720
here and sometimes a sign of getting

258
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,560
concentrated is that the mindfulness

259
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,399
gets clearer and clearer

260
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,880
the awareness gets clearer and clearer

261
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,880
and there becomes more equanimity

262
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,320
in that clear awareness which is

263
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,760
equanimous we're less likely to be

264
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,360
reactive to things

265
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,120
and feeling that equanimity feels so

266
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,800
good

267
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,480
and so don't expect all these things to

268
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,560
happen at once

269
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,880
and maybe don't even memorize don't even

270
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,399
try to memorize and look for all the

271
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,360
things i've said

272
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,360
i've talked about the two things that

273
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,399
buddha

274
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,519
emphasized as nimitas was this

275
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,399
tranquility

276
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,640
or calm quietude

277
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,160
or this non-de-centeredness the

278
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,720
non-dispersal non-scatterness of the

279
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,519
mind

280
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,399
the mind being composed and both of

281
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,399
those are supported by the two

282
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,440
actions verbs that buddha used

283
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,839
when he instructed us for what in

284
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,000
english we might say

285
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,320
become concentrated he didn't use the

286
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,839
english word concentrated because he

287
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,200
didn't speak english

288
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,800
he used two words one was the word um

289
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,800
to settle and the other is to steady

290
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,880
to settle on something and to steady

291
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,639
oneself on something

292
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,839
so the those four can be your signposts

293
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,959
uh um

294
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,000
settle settle the settling on the

295
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,079
breathing or in your experience

296
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,920
a steadiness with your breathing a

297
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,680
delightful warm

298
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:17,279
content of quietude tranquility

299
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,600
and and and a non-de-centeredness

300
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,560
a feeling ah this is good to really be

301
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,680
here not scattered anymore

302
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,399
and perhaps you can read the read at the

303
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,040
inner book

304
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,399
read yourself and see if you can find

305
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,040
the you know that supports you and

306
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,240
guides you and

307
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,279
gives you kind of more something to

308
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,360
in the good sense of the term hold on to

309
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,440
as you're developing concentration and

310
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,839
and or be cheerleaders or support from

311
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,120
the side to stay there

312
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,279
be there this is good this is keep

313
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,000
opening to this keep opening to this

314
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,600
and if you're not ready for that or if

315
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,440
you're not you know

316
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,880
if it didn't it doesn't work because

317
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,200
you're trying too hard or you're not

318
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,040
you know it's too much work just put it

319
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,880
aside

320
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,279
but sooner or later hopefully you begin

321
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,800
begin recognizing

322
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,760
your signposts for what it means when

323
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,760
the goodness of samadhi goodness of

324
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,800
being settled

325
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,160
and unified begins to come into play

326
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,399
and then to appreciate that to validate

327
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,440
that to

328
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,480
affirm that so the mind knows

329
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,040
this is what's important this is what's

330
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,480
valuable

331
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,880
thinking about trolls and butterflies

332
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,000
and all the other

333
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,040
things are useful sometimes but not for

334
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,240
the purpose of meditation

335
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,920
so thank you all very much

336
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:52,880
and and we'll continue tomorrow
