1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:07,720
so hello everyone and

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:16,800
welcome and I just uh feel kind of delighted to sit down here and

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,800
see uh your names for those of you who are chatting I think there's something

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,080
feeling very something very beautiful about names maybe the beauty I'm seeing in

5
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:34,960
them is their is what they represent they represent the beauty of each of

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,960
you or somehow the specialness or somehow a deep appreciation

7
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:48,000
of who's behind those names you I justed to feel very happy and contented to sit

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,440
here and see all the names and telling you a little bit because I'm

9
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,920
surprised by that's what comes up first sitting here so thank you for being

10
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,920
here

11
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:11,600
so today uh for the meditation I'd like the theme to be

12
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:21,119
Simplicity and the overall overarching theme of this week is um this the uh the

13
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:27,439
consequences of letting go con consequences of release of non- clinging

14
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:33,399
non- clinging which is at the heart of the goal of Buddhist practice is a quite

15
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:40,840
a profound involves quite a profound transformation or change and to only see it as non-

16
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:47,000
clinging the absence of clinging misses some of the ways in which you fills in

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,360
or expands out into a very rich sense of being alive and being here and being

18
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,159
creative in this world that we live in so learn to recognize some of the

19
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:07,080
consequences of this Letting Go non- clinging supports the richness of the

20
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:13,640
experience and so Simplicity is one of them

21
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:19,280
to cling is complicated especially if we're clinging to many

22
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,959
things to be distracted is complicated being undistracted is simple just being

23
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,720
with what's here to be

24
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:38,640
uh re reactively thinking and story making and having discursive thought in relationship to what's going on is

25
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:46,200
complicated to have a Simplicity of being and just being with things in the simplest way without clinging without

26
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,440
being for or against does not curtail does not limit

27
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,640
our intelligence or understanding but it adds a a through line through our life

28
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:03,360
through our experience where something inside of us maintains a Simplicity of

29
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,519
being so that we're less distracted

30
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:17,440
less conflicted less confused less scattered and less jumping around less

31
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,959
um uh involved in the complicated world of clinging clinging

32
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:31,799
inevitably not inevitably but more often than not um involves story and meaning making

33
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:37,439
and wider purposes and sometimes they involve conceit in the complicated world

34
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:43,840
of identity and who we are and who we want to how we want to present ourselves to people and prove ourselves clinging

35
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,319
is a complicated world something inside of us get becomes simple when we don't

36
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:56,239
cling something inside of us becomes quieter it doesn't mean that what we're

37
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,319
involved in is not complicated we still live in a complicated world

38
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:10,159
but we address that complicated World in a simpler way maybe without with less need with

39
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:19,519
less attachment so for this meditation let's uh have Simplicity as a

40
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:26,440
reference point and if you don't feel a Simplicity of being as we sit here even just the

41
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:32,680
idea of Simplicity can um just be like a highlighter that

42
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,680
highlights how actually what we're doing here is

43
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,720
complicated so assuming a meditation

44
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,479
posture and gently closing your

45
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:57,520
eyes and Beginning by a simple

46
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,720
acknowledgement that you are where you're sitting are you're where you're

47
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,680
meditating this is the

48
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:16,198
place and generally when we sit down to

49
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:26,199
meditate we're entering into a world that is somewhat removed

50
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:34,120
somewhat free of needing to answer the phone cook foods go

51
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:42,560
shopping solve issues take care of our responsibilities for these

52
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:51,319
minutes we're allowing us ourselves the gift of a Simplicity of being here in

53
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:54,479
this place in this

54
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:05,918
body and taking the time to feel the

55
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:17,720
body the body can have a lot of different Sensations in it sometimes it's complicated our

56
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:24,880
relationship to the body is complicated but to sit

57
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,599
quietly with your body in your body

58
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:36,400
can allow the tensions of the body to begin to

59
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:46,599
soften allow the body's wish to be soft

60
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:53,680
relaxed settled to have a chance to

61
00:06:54,199 --> 00:07:03,280
unfold it's rare that the body wants to be tense it's where the body wants to be

62
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:13,120
agitated it's almost like a deep wish in the body to release

63
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:24,319
relax the body likes to be simple there's a very strong movement in

64
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:31,520
the body towards homeostasis towards balance to wholeness

65
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:47,039
and within the body as part of the body becoming aware of the body

66
00:07:55,159 --> 00:08:01,440
breathing the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out

67
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,039
can be a settling

68
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,000
Force like a massage from the inside

69
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:35,440
out as you sit here allow that rhythm of breathing to have an influence on your

70
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,159
body a connecting relaxing

71
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:06,600
influence take give time to feeling your body feeling your body

72
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:13,600
breathing so that you're moving towards a Simplicity of being here without a lot

73
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:21,240
of desires that things be different Simplicity of being with how

74
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,560
things

75
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
are

76
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:05,240
to offer a simplicity of attention to the thinking

77
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:18,760
mind the thinking mind itself can have a wish a deep

78
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,399
wish to

79
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:32,800
rest to unwind to soften its

80
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:48,760
tensions gently slowly on the

81
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,480
exhale begin a process of quieting the

82
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:01,240
mind letting the Mind relax and settle

83
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
for

84
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
for

85
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
for

86
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:43,240
and [Music] perhaps an ongoing

87
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:51,320
support for an ongoing Simplicity of being can be the rhythm of the body

88
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,880
breathing in and breathing

89
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,519
out yes Simplicity where not much needs to

90
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,360
happen except staying here

91
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:18,399
present where in the Simplicity you can find non-

92
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:26,240
clinging where in nonreactivity you can find

93
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
simplicity

94
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

95
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
for

96
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
for

97
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
for

98
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
for

99
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
for

100
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
for

101
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
for

102
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

103
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
for

104
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
for

105
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

106
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
for

107
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:21,520
are there ways you are more complicated now than you need to

108
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:29,799
be find your way back to a Simplicity of being

109
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:37,440
without the complexity of a lot of thinking a lot of wanting or not

110
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:45,679
wanting without trying to make something happen

111
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:53,640
content to be aware content with a simple

112
00:20:53,640 --> 00:21:00,600
awareness of what is

113
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

114
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

115
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
for

116
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

117
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
for

118
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
for

119
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
for

120
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
for

121
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

122
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

123
00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:00,080
so as we come to the end of this sitting

124
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:08,240
you might want to take a few moments to consider how being simple our Simplicity

125
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:14,760
of being how and when it might be a a great

126
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:21,399
gift to give yourself maybe there are times when it

127
00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:24,200
can feel like a

128
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:34,279
relief maybe there are times it can feel like Freedom

129
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,640
itself and how your way of being

130
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:55,519
simple in Social circumstances can be a gift to

131
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:03,320
others and one way to understand that is that being

132
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:09,399
complicated is the opposite of a gift being complicated can

133
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:16,960
be confusing sometimes there's no room for other people in the complicated

134
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:25,519
mind if we're caught up in complications we can't see very

135
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,760
clearly we can't be with other others very

136
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:44,519
well maybe it's through a Simplicity of presence of

137
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:51,200
attention that we support people to be themselves to be respected as they

138
00:28:51,200 --> 00:29:00,039
are to feel safe to be able to relax around us

139
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:07,679
may it be that what we learn through this practice helps us to support the

140
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:15,440
well-being and happiness of Others May our life

141
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:21,039
contribute to the welfare and happiness of

142
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:30,039
others and one way to do that is not

143
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:40,679
complicated but to offer a simple presence a simple attention a simple accompaniment of

144
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:49,159
Others May all beings be happy may all

145
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:57,039
beings be safe may all beings be

146
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:02,360
peaceful may all beings be

147
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:10,399
free and may we discover how profound it

148
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:16,039
is to share with each other a mutual Simplicity of

149
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:19,960
being a mutual

150
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,760
contentment with being simple Here and

151
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,960
Now

152
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:42,130
[Music]

153
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,840
thank

154
00:30:56,919 --> 00:30:59,919
you

155
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:29,919
e

156
00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:01,159
so hello everyone and welcome to this

157
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:06,799
talk on the signs

158
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:13,080
symptoms um consequences of non-

159
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:19,159
clinging and um these are this non- clinging is a synonym for Liberation for

160
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:25,639
Freedom kind of a spiritual Freedom Buddhism talks about and

161
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:31,840
um the symptom or the indication of non-

162
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:38,919
clinging that I'd like to emphasize today is Simplicity clinging is complicated

163
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:45,360
clinging involves a whole background of conditioning of beliefs of desires of

164
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:53,200
wishes of uh relationship to other people of memory of projection into the

165
00:32:53,200 --> 00:33:00,399
future clinging can involve a complicated world not non clinging is

166
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:05,639
simple it's the absence of clinging and in that absence an absence

167
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:12,000
of that immense complicated edifice that keeps clinging in

168
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,919
place so when we learn to not cling to when we learn to let go when we become

169
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:24,720
free of of clinging we can feel that Things become

170
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:30,760
simpler in ourselves the world around us might remain May remain

171
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:39,559
complicated and the and but to uh have a through line that runs

172
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:44,880
through how we engage in the world be an inner sense of

173
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:53,320
Simplicity and of course we have to deal with many things that are complicated but one way that helps that is to um

174
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:59,360
simply do one thing at a time it's compc at to multitask it's

175
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,760
complicated to do many things at once some of you maybe are quite capable

176
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:11,560
and proficient at multitasking but it comes as a at a cost

177
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:19,520
and the cost is we stay in a more complicated world and we keep spinning hold you know

178
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:24,878
um um juggling lots of balls in the air when we're

179
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:32,118
multitasking and so there's very little opportunity Unity to appreciate freedom

180
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:39,200
to appreciate Simplicity to appreciate non- clinging more likely where there's a

181
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:44,638
certain distractability in multitasking that we don't see what's

182
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:51,720
behind all the things that we do we don't see what the drives are what the fears are what the desires are what the

183
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:58,280
aversions are uh we don't see the conceits that are operating because we're so busy doing so much

184
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:04,760
that um that it obscures the kind of clarity that arises if we're just kind

185
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:10,560
of doing one thing at a time hearing listening to One thing or

186
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:17,400
doing one thing being with one person at a time listening

187
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:26,640
well and um and so when we do one thing at a time maybe we get more less things

188
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:32,800
done but we also maybe get things done better so we don't have to redo

189
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:38,880
them maybe there's uh when we're at ease and relaxed that we do things in a

190
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:44,920
better way I found that um sometimes when I feel like I've too much to do and not

191
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:51,079
enough time paradoxically I find that if I sit down to meditate for 10 minutes

192
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:56,760
somehow I have plenty of time afterwards that in the complexity of

193
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:02,720
having a lot to do there's a kind of tension that builds up in the mind a kind of pressure in the

194
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:08,200
mind that um uh that makes do doing

195
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:13,760
whatever I'm going to do more difficult not as and not as intelligently or not

196
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:19,880
as creatively or not as fully that gives contributes to the sense there's not

197
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:25,880
enough time so a Simplicity of being that's may

198
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:31,880
be con connected to a content M but these words like Simplicity and

199
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:37,520
contentment can be off-putting uh because our lives are

200
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:44,000
rich and wonderful and complicated ways and doing many things at once and many things and Rich things and complicated

201
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,480
things is enlivening and vitalizing maybe so but there's uh even

202
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:55,880
there there's a way of staying simple in the middle of the

203
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:01,440
many things we do I was once a fast order cook at a restaurant after being

204
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,599
for almost three years in the Zen Monastery and um there was a lot of

205
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:13,599
activity going on and U fast and quickly quick and tracking many different things

206
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:20,480
but I would say that uh in the middle of it all I was there in a very simple

207
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:27,200
way that I was not caught up in a lot of desires a lot of memories a lot of what

208
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:33,119
was happen happening tomorrow what happened yesterday I was fully completely there for this amazing dance

209
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:39,839
in the kitchen and uh I would leave the end of my shift feeling more settled more

210
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:45,480
peaceful more simple more concentrated than when I started my shift it was a delightful

211
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:51,560
feeling so there was a kind of Simplicity of being of just being doing

212
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:59,960
doing the just doing the complicated Act of f fast order cooking and um and

213
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:07,480
um so just because we have a lot to do doesn't mean that we can't find that

214
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:13,040
Simplicity through through line through this as well this as well if we're

215
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:18,359
distracted a lot if we're caught up in thoughts a lot that's a complicated

216
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:24,720
world if we're fretting over things and anxious about things I propose to say

217
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,960
that's a complicated world if we're living in our memories too much

218
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:36,400
and reviewing and thinking about things that's a complicated world uh if we're trying to figure

219
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:44,520
things out too much it can be too complicated of course we have to figure things out but um sometimes uh we figure

220
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:50,800
things out better if our minds are clear and open and sometimes I uh things that

221
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:57,000
are difficult to figure out sometimes I I don't figure them out sometimes I'm

222
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,119
reflecting on and thinking about them but then I'm doing something else the answer

223
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:09,880
comes um sometimes when I don't remember a word or someone's name um if I stop

224
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:16,040
searching for it then 30 seconds a minute later it comes up if I stayed in

225
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:23,119
that complicated mode of searching and wanting and concerned and worried about not remembering it keeps obscuring the

226
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:28,200
mind's capacity to find its way

227
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:36,520
so look for so when you are able to let go when you're able to find some modum

228
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:44,000
of non- clinging to things to appreciate it better look for what feels like

229
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Simplicity Simplicity of being a Simplicity of perception a Simplicity of

230
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,319
thinking a Simplicity of care for the situation maybe even love for the

231
00:39:56,319 --> 00:40:01,440
situation so this is the theme for this week is not that you have to be

232
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:08,040
simple but rather if you're able to stop clinging let go of the grasping you have

233
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:14,160
or the resistance you have appreciate some of these result

234
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:19,520
what results from that and for today appreciate the a feeling or sense of

235
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:26,319
Simplicity that comes from that Simplicity of being something becomes less

236
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:32,520
complicated and um so it's complicated to want to and expect and ask people to

237
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:37,800
be simple but I'd propose that it's simpler

238
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:45,240
to suggest notice the Simplicity that arises when you are no longer

239
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:53,520
clinging and then appreciate that take time with it be nourished by it let it

240
00:40:53,520 --> 00:41:00,960
condition you let it recondition you in a way that maybe begins to heal from the

241
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:06,400
conditioning that comes from being overly busy there's a huge cost of being

242
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,480
complicated and doing too much and running around and juggling too many

243
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:18,599
balls um it can really wear a person down out it can really cause a lot of

244
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:26,359
stress and so as we begin appreciating the Simplicity of being that can come from non- clinging it's actually a

245
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:32,640
medicine for a a reconditioning medicine from the

246
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:40,920
unhealthy conditioning of living in a way too complicated inner world and sometimes in outer

247
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:45,599
world so

248
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:52,440
simplicity so as you go through today uh you might look for

249
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:58,119
opportunities to not cling maybe there simple moments

250
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:03,200
throughout the day that maybe you're taking a bus somewhere and you just sit

251
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:11,319
on a chair and in the bus and just don't look at your phone don't do anything but just be there and in in letting go of

252
00:42:11,319 --> 00:42:17,760
the drive the desires is to always be doing something and see if you can find the blessing of

253
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:23,650
Simplicity standing in a line in a store waiting

254
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:29,400
[Music] for a computer to St start if you turn it

255
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:36,440
on don't fill that time with something else maybe waiting for the water to

256
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:42,839
boil maybe don't try to be efficient to do other things at the same time maybe there's a way of just

257
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:48,480
standing and looking out the window or sitting down for a few minutes and breathing and being

258
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:55,559
mindful that overcomes some of the clinging you go through and You Begin appreciating a Simplicity of being

259
00:42:55,559 --> 00:43:02,078
allowing something else to I condition you through the day than always being on the

260
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:07,520
go so thank you very much and uh I wish

261
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:14,119
you the joys and blessing of certainly of non- clinging today but also the joys

262
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:19,520
and blessings of Simplicity thank

263
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:23,319
you
