1
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:17,420
good evening welcome welcome nice to see you all

2
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:26,160
hmm you're welcome to move chairs or to

3
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,040
sit um a place that's come for those of you that are on the floor you're welcome to stay where you are but you're also

4
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:38,360
welcome to move chairs so you don't have to sit behind something

5
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:46,620
so I'd like to give a talk that builds on a talk that I wait maybe before I go

6
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:52,980
there I'm going to say happy first day of spring I feel kind of happy about this the

7
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:58,140
Spring Equinox even though I spent a few days I just

8
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,539
got back from New Mexico where it was snowing and it's hard for me like oh it

9
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:10,439
is spring I felt like it's actually winter but here is spring I guess it's spring there too

10
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:16,799
but okay so I wanted to build on a talk that

11
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,780
I gave last week and I was talking about this idea that there's a difference between like direct

12
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,860
experience like what were experiencing in the moment

13
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,960
an example would be like stabbing throbbing

14
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,540
spacious attracted tight notice how these are just like

15
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:45,540
adjectives there there's not like a sentence it's just an adjective that's

16
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:52,380
the whatever the experience is and then as humans we put a label on

17
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:59,700
them and then we often have a relationship with the label not so much with the experience for example there

18
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,340
might be stabbing in the knee throbbing maybe Heat

19
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:11,220
as soon as we label it pain then we have a relationship with the

20
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,319
word pain and then you know I don't know about you guys but I don't like pain

21
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,540
right and there's fear that comes up and all this kind of stuff right so but

22
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:27,300
something like this stabbing or throbbing that feels a little bit more manageable

23
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:35,160
like okay this is just this experience right now and might even bring a little bit of curiosity in

24
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:43,800
and so much of our practice is about getting clear about this distinction about what's actually happening

25
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,500
and then the label we put on it and of course we need labels I'm not saying we're not going to do that

26
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,840
but often the label can be a springboard for all kinds of story making and

27
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:03,680
thinking and sometimes we use this a Brutus word that there's a fun word papancha I think

28
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,420
it kind of has this feeling of popcorn or something

29
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,940
you know everything that's going afterwards so in the example that I gave

30
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:22,860
about with the pain is that we might the human mind has like

31
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:31,200
this tendency to like elaborate and kind of like spread out on pain oh my knees

32
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,780
bothering me from that bike accident that all those years ago and I can't

33
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:44,580
believe that person did that and caused me to have that bike accident and that reminds me I need to do this or that you

34
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:50,459
know then you know like just off we go based on just having this throbbing

35
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:56,159
sensation or stabbing sensation and so papancha this idea of this

36
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,860
proliferation or this effusion of this mental commentary this story making that

37
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:09,540
happens or maybe like this thinking run amok as opposed to just thinking of what's

38
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:17,040
needed in the moment to solve a problem or to plan or communicate

39
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:24,000
right of course we all need thinking for that but papancha is just that proliferation

40
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,730
yeah and I'm noticing that you're looking at the light to the slickering light is this annoying

41
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:38,479
[Laughter] can we turn off that light and leave other lights on is that is that possible

42
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,600
and then there's a light yeah there's a thirds maybe we can

43
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,440
maybe that's

44
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:10,080
yeah okay so we'll be a little bit more cozy that's better than the flickering light I think yeah yeah

45
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,939
thank you Jim thank you Bill

46
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:27,240
[Laughter] those who didn't hear Jim said he thought maybe it was the metasuta in

47
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:33,900
Morse code short short long long short kudos to you if you can do some Morse

48
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:40,919
code so

49
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:47,699
I'm gonna part of the way that I want to explore this is uh with a suit up passage which is a story on Kevin I want

50
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:53,460
to like give this story and kind of like annotate or maybe my own version of

51
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:59,639
papancha with this story some of you will know this story it's uh

52
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:05,520
well known but I want to maybe emphasize certain parts that uh

53
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,698
aren't necessarily emphasized usually

54
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,759
and I'm not going to tell you the title yet you'll figure it out because then you'll like slap a label on

55
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:25,979
oh I've heard this before and it's all about this but when we can just be with the experience of what's unfolding here

56
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:33,840
so this starts like this thus have I heard for those of you who don't know most who does start this way thus have I

57
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:40,139
heard at one time the Buddha was staying near saviti in jetta's Grove and at the pindicus park

58
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:46,139
now at that time Bahia of the bark cloth was residing by suparaka on the ocean

59
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:52,520
shore so just to put this into perspective the Buddha is in sovere tea is one location

60
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:59,039
Bahia of the bark cloth somebody who wore a clothing made out of bark is near

61
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:05,759
the ocean about 1200 miles away this is a long time distance right at the time

62
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:12,120
when there's no pavement there's no roads you know that's a long distance

63
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,639
to walk without established roads or

64
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:23,220
okay so Bahia was residing by suparakan the ocean shore where he was honored

65
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:30,060
respected revered venerated and esteemed and he received robes alms Foods

66
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:37,800
lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sick so a few things we can say about this

67
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,440
he's of the bark cloth so that means that he's not a Buddhist practitioner

68
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,479
that just like today we could tell the difference from a Tibetan monastic from

69
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:55,680
a turban monastic from a Zen priest by the clothes that they wear just in the same way we can tell by this that he's

70
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:02,340
uh not of the Buddhist and he's a we could say he's esteemed

71
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:08,300
and well-respected spiritual leader enough so that people are venerating him

72
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:16,259
and supporting him in the same way that they might support some Buddhist petitioners

73
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:21,900
and then the suta continues when Bahia was practicing in seclusion

74
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:27,539
this line of thinking appeared to his awareness hmm

75
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:33,599
of those who in this world are arhads somebody who's fully awakened or our

76
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:40,560
Huts or have entered the path of our hardship am I one

77
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,560
so here's a little bit of doubt he has the oldest attention of other

78
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,500
practitioners they venerating him supporting him but he's wondering hmm am

79
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,540
I really awakened what my experience do I think that I'm

80
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:05,279
really awakened I appreciate this that he wasn't just complacent thinking that okay because people treat me a certain

81
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:13,620
way I must be that way but instead he's like trying to like he's open to the

82
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,259
idea that there's more to learn more for him to do

83
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:28,500
but not only that that he allowed this doubt in his mind to remain there for a

84
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:36,300
little bit you'll see why in a moment what happens next so he doesn't like immediately bat it away so like oh

85
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:43,440
that's silly I must be awakened everybody treats me as if I'm awakened but he and he doesn't get into Pancha

86
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:51,620
about it he's just this thought arises am I awakened hmm

87
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:58,140
so he doesn't ignore it or pushing away but this willingness to stay present

88
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:03,420
with this openness maybe this kind of like doubt this question about his

89
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:09,680
practice then allows what happens next

90
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,980
then a Deva this is a

91
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:22,080
disembodied Spirit we might say a diva who had once been a relative of

92
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:28,260
bahia's and who was compassionate and Desiring but he is welfare and knowing

93
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:37,220
with her own awareness the line of thinking that was in bahia's Awareness went to Bahia and said to him

94
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:45,360
you but here are neither in our heart nor have you entered the path of our hot

95
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,420
ship you don't even have the practice whereby you would become an R hunt

96
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:57,779
so this is quite something right that David just says to him straight out

97
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:03,779
you're you're not awakened nor will you be you're doing something completely

98
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:11,640
different they never say what this practice is but uh just straight up you're not maybe as

99
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:17,839
awakened as you thought you were not as awakened as everybody else thinks that you are

100
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:24,600
and so some Douglas Phillips who is a zen teacher

101
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:32,519
and sometimes teaches a little bit of the teravada also he likes to interpret this Deva that that's visiting Bahia is

102
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:37,740
saying as some feminine wisdom that maybe but he was completely disconnected

103
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:43,200
from but it's when he opens up this question am I awakened and is able to

104
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,980
just stay with that inquiry and then allows maybe something else to rise maybe

105
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:57,920
something in his mind to arise so that's one way we could interpret this idea that the Deva comes

106
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:05,940
and so she's like challenging him kind of her directness is well maybe we might

107
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:11,399
even say brutal or maybe it's just fantastic the way that she's not

108
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:19,800
beating around the bush right she's just saying nope you're not awakened and you're not even on the path to Awakening

109
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:27,000
so despite his many years of practice and all of the practitioners that support him

110
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,500
and so maybe we are not visited by David that says hey we are not awakened but it's

111
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:39,600
not unusual for us to sometimes have doubt about our practice

112
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:47,820
in so many different ways maybe we find ourselves yelling at a loved one and we realize really after

113
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:53,100
all these years of practice I'm still upset or I still get triggered by things

114
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:59,820
I'm still really reactive or or maybe we find ourselves thinking like

115
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:05,519
hostility towards people who are doing something that we feel like is really

116
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,620
against our values harming others harming the planet or just causing harm

117
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:16,740
in the world and we find ourselves our hearts getting constricted and not

118
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:22,980
being generous in our thoughts towards them maybe we have doubts like is this

119
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:29,820
practice really working I've been doing all this meditation listening to Dharma talks reading Dharma

120
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:36,959
books whatever it might be so maybe there's some way in which we also have had doubts

121
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:43,200
there's so many different ways that Stouts can show up it can be about ourselves maybe I don't have the

122
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:49,260
capacity we might have this idea or we might think well those teachers

123
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:54,779
they I'm not sure they really know what they're talking about they're not they don't seem to be perfect

124
00:13:54,779 --> 00:14:00,420
or are they teachings might not seem compelling like maybe there's something

125
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:08,700
oats that's more it's easier or faster or whatever it is

126
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:15,600
that we're looking for maybe we had this you know expectations about the practice that just aren't

127
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:22,079
being met and doubt arises so when doubt arises there's a few things

128
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:30,660
we can do one is kind of go down the path of some maybe bitterness or resentment like I

129
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:37,920
can't believe I spent all the time practicing and it's I'm still the same or

130
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,980
this kind of Road of thinking maybe some self-judgment comes in or maybe even

131
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:51,480
some despair I thought this was going to help and if this nothing if this doesn't help maybe nothing can

132
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:57,000
that's one way to go when we feel like our expectations aren't being met

133
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,339
it's a legitimate way and for many of us we might have to go

134
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:09,180
down that road for a while before we start to realize that's really not leading towards more

135
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:15,060
freedom instead it just kind of really restricts our freedom limits so as we start to kind of like

136
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:24,480
collapse and feel disempowered but an alternative way is to just fold

137
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:31,199
it into practice feel like okay I I feel unsure about

138
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:37,680
myself and these teachings what can I do one if you could be mindful this is what

139
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,800
it feels like to feel unsure or to have doubt

140
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:49,079
or we can investigate we could talk to a teacher we could talk to other people we

141
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:54,120
can read Derma books listen to Derma talks there's we don't have to just kind

142
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,459
of say well this didn't work maybe different teacher maybe a different style a different tradition within

143
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:05,100
Buddhism or maybe not even Buddhism at all but to not just like give up and

144
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:11,300
collapse around it but instead to take it as a

145
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:18,560
an indication or an opportunity to explore and investigate

146
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:27,240
so then we'll get back to this after hearing from this Deva that he's not awakened and he's not only that he's

147
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:36,480
not on the path towards Awakening the suta continues without hesitation Bahia asked the Deva

148
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,000
but who in this world is actually an our hunt

149
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:49,139
and has entered that path that David knows she says Bahia in the

150
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:56,519
northern city of saviti lives the blessed one the Buddha a rightly self-awakened our heart he is

151
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:03,139
truly in our Hut and teaches the dhamma that leads to our hardship

152
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:09,120
then Bahia deeply chastened by the Deva left separaka and traveled all the way

153
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:14,280
to where the Buddha was staying like you just okay that's if that's what

154
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:20,520
it takes this is what I'm gonna do Pax his bags or I don't even know if he had bags right so we might have just been a

155
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:26,880
monastic 1200 miles walks halfway across the continent or

156
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,040
subcontinent quite something because right this could

157
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:37,080
have been an opportunity for a lot of papancha a lot of how dare you talk to

158
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:42,360
me what do you know or you know there's so many different ways we can uh respond

159
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:47,640
to this but instead he's like oh okay I'm not awakened well what can I do to

160
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,860
get awakened who can teach me at this time right there's not books or

161
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:58,679
anything else to inform a person except another person so this is why he's

162
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:05,059
asking who is that's the way of saying where can I find the teachings

163
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:12,720
so he doesn't defend and rationalize deny blame he just wants to go to find

164
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,860
where he can find the teachings that can make him awakened

165
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:27,120
so then we'll continue with the suta so Bahia walks all the way over to where

166
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:33,360
the Buddha is and when he's there he finds a number of Buddhist monks that are doing walk-in

167
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:41,340
meditation and he asks venerable sirs is where is

168
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:48,000
the blessed one stain where is the Buddha I must see him immediately

169
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,640
he was told that the Buddha and then the monastics told Bahia that the Buddha had

170
00:18:53,640 --> 00:19:01,039
gone into town for alms he's like he's on his lunch break kind of like I don't bother him

171
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:08,100
but here he immediately turned to the city where the Buddha was the Buddha had

172
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:15,299
gone into the town for alms rounds and Bahia went in there and then but he had found the Buddha on

173
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:22,260
alms round then Buddha was moving with great calm his mind at peace tranquil

174
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:29,820
and poised with the restrained senses of a great one so but he had notices right away

175
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:35,760
that the Buddha is different there's something about him he has this calm and

176
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,520
tranquility and Poise that even before Bahia has spoken to the Buddha can tell

177
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:48,660
something's different about him he approached the Buddha threw himself

178
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:55,980
to the ground before him with his head to the Buddha's feet and said this is a sign of extreme respect to put your head

179
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:02,100
at the feet of somebody else in Ancient India this is a real sign of respect

180
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:09,419
and he says to the Buddha teach me the Dharma o blessed one teach me the Dharma O Holy One so that it will be for my

181
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:14,360
long-term welfare and happiness

182
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:21,539
he traveled all this way he wants to hear the teachings the Buddha said to him this is not the

183
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:28,159
time but he uh I have entered the I'm on the alms round

184
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:35,340
and but he had pleaded with the Buddha a second time Holy One it is hard to know for sure

185
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:40,740
what dangers they may be for the Buddhist life or what dangers there may

186
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:47,760
be for mine please teach me the Dharma o blessed one so that I may be free and happy

187
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,799
so but he is saying we don't know when we're going to die I might die before

188
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:59,220
you finish alms around or you might die the Buddha before you finish alms around

189
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:05,580
and again the the Buddha said by here this is not the time for me to give a

190
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:09,080
talking I'm on Ohm's

191
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:19,200
so but here he's persistent he has this uh idea that he wants to have they

192
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:25,980
receive these teachings but not only that he has a certain amount of wisdom about impermanence that

193
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:34,020
recognizing that none of us are guaranteed the next moment none of us are guaranteed that

194
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:39,120
after our next meal where everything's going to be fine

195
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,299
so he has some wisdom that you know things are inconstant

196
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:50,720
impermanent we don't get to there's no guarantees

197
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:59,820
so getting back to this pleaded his case a third time to the

198
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:07,140
Buddha and this time the Buddha relented and said well but here

199
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:13,740
you should train like this in the scene

200
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:20,280
will be merely the scene so scene like uh what is seen like what is visually

201
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:26,580
known like what is seen and the herd will be merely the hurt

202
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:33,179
like what sounds are heard I'm saying this because somebody told me

203
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:40,100
a few years ago that they thought it was like seen like a pastoral scene with Rolling Hills and

204
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:46,200
s-c-e-n-e so and it is kind of like that but then they heard they thought well maybe it's

205
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:51,539
like a herd of cows or deer you know they had this whole like pastoral scene

206
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:58,380
so uh that's why I'm kind of like spending a little time to say it's the like Visual and hearing

207
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:04,020
and the scene will be merely the scene and the herd will be merely the herd and

208
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:10,700
the sensed will be merely the sensed and the cognized will be merely the cognized

209
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:18,600
saying simple Poncha nothing extra

210
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:24,600
just for each experience be with that experience including the experiences of

211
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:30,840
a thought cognized there you the word here is like what arises in the Consciousness or

212
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:36,299
something like this and then the Buddha continues

213
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:41,880
he says when for you there will be only the scene in reference to this scene only

214
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:48,600
the heard and reference to the herd only the sensed in reference to the sense to only the cognized and reference to the

215
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:54,419
cognized then there is no you

216
00:23:54,419 --> 00:24:00,539
in connection with that and when there is no you in connection

217
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:06,000
with that there is no you there and when there is no you there you're neither

218
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:14,840
here nor Yonder nor between the two and just this is the end of suffering

219
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:22,620
and upon hearing this brief explanation from the Buddha but he is mind was

220
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:28,520
immediately freed from the defilements and he became awakened

221
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:34,620
so what's an interesting thing here is like that's added at the end so not only to

222
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:41,520
keep it simple and not not to do with Poncha or just you know allow our thinking to run

223
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:47,760
amok after each sense of experience but the Buddha is also pointing to this

224
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:55,380
is how we create our sense of self for this is how the sense get sense of self

225
00:24:55,380 --> 00:25:00,500
gets created for example

226
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:06,320
we'll get back to like stabbing sensation in the knee something might be like

227
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:12,960
I don't like it perfectly reasonable

228
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,240
but there's all of a sudden this eye that has a problem that has to get rid

229
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,280
of it as opposed to something like and this is awkward we wouldn't normally do

230
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:28,440
this but for illustration purposes I'll say instead of saying

231
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:35,279
um the sensations of stabbing have it risen or stabbing is known

232
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:40,320
something like this that's different than I am experiencing pain or I'm

233
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,659
experiencing stabbing I admit that this language is awkward

234
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:51,779
and clunky but there's a way in which there can be experiences without having

235
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:57,600
to say there's an experiencer because as soon as we start to say

236
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:04,140
there's an experience sir then all kinds of extra stuff comes along

237
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:10,620
things we like and we don't like and we have to like protect

238
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:15,779
and bolster and make sure everybody else sees us the way we want to be seen and

239
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:21,539
that we see ourselves the way we want to be seen there's all kinds of extra stuff

240
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:27,179
that comes up soon as we create this self

241
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:35,539
or maybe like and we're not doing this intentionally so maybe I should say as soon as his self is created

242
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:44,039
a sense of our self that with our stories as opposed to

243
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:48,740
there's this experience that's happening right now

244
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:56,460
it's unpleasant there's a wish for this experience to go away

245
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:02,240
these are all true but it's uh there's a Glenn there's a

246
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:08,460
cleanness about it because this sense that

247
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:15,720
I am experiencing this stabbing and I don't like it and I want it to go away there's a certain amount of getting

248
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:22,080
tangled up with it a certain way in which we're clinging onto it or grabbing onto it or

249
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:28,380
this self is so way in which we're not just allowing the experiences to rise

250
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:33,020
and pass away but instead to

251
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:40,260
create the conditions in which we are I'm trying to see if there's a better

252
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:46,980
way to to describe this often

253
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:53,340
when we I can describe maybe this sense of self as when there's a sense of me

254
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:58,799
against the world or us against them then there's a real strong sense of oh

255
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:06,059
there's an entity me here and everything else is out there and we

256
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:12,600
have to make sure that everybody look thinks the right things about us whatever we want them to think that

257
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:18,480
we're smart or capable or attractive or whatever it is that we might want others

258
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,900
to think then we have feel like we have to show up a particular way

259
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,779
but it turns out that's extra we don't have to do that and there's so

260
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:35,820
much Freedom that's available if we're able to put that down and even if we

261
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:42,900
can't put it down to just soften it to not get

262
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:48,260
[Music] um filled with um

263
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:57,179
anxiety about trying to bolster the sensor self or trying to

264
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:02,220
make it be different than how it is trying to change our experience the

265
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:08,880
reason why we want to change our experiences because it doesn't match a sense of self that we might be creating

266
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,640
or something like this so we might consider that these

267
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:20,220
instructions that the Buddha gave is what it's like when the self

268
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:25,500
disappears and the scene is just the scene and the

269
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:31,080
hearing is just the hearing and the sensed is just the sensed and in

270
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:37,440
the cognizance is just the cognized so there's still perfectly fine able to

271
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:44,940
move through the world without this extra without this extra self

272
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:52,440
which is the fuel for the papancha the proliferation of thinking that that we

273
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:57,500
like to do so

274
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:05,220
what this teaching is also pointing to is that whatever is happening in our in

275
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:11,820
this present moment whatever it might be impatience

276
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:17,100
sleepiness confusion annoyance

277
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:24,779
pain in the knee whatever it is we can turn towards that and experience

278
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:32,220
that directly and just that turning towards and experiencing it directly like stopping

279
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:39,120
any contention with reality we might be having but just like Yep this is the experience

280
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:45,740
that's the doorway to Freedom whatever is happening if you're annoyed

281
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:51,840
if you're happy if you're tired if you feel Restless

282
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:58,740
just to be with the experience in a clean way

283
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:04,679
as best we can and if you feel like I don't even really know what she's talking about this seems kind of weird

284
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:11,220
or maybe you're like yep I know exactly what they're talking about just the sense of

285
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:17,520
is there a way that we can hold our experience without

286
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:24,059
trying to make it different without trying to add on to it

287
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:30,419
without I'm going like this with my hands open so to hold this way as opposed to this way but to hold it this

288
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:35,820
way without being in contention with it or trying to

289
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:42,179
manipulate or manufacture or engineer The Experience so that it's different in

290
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:48,179
some kind of way so this is the good news sometimes we

291
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:55,799
might think like okay they'll be more freedom as soon as the neighbor's dog starts stops barking

292
00:31:55,799 --> 00:32:02,640
so I can meditate or as soon as I get a chance to do a lot of retreat practice or as soon as I find the right teacher

293
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,740
or teachings we might have this idea that in the future the conditions are

294
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:14,720
going to be okay or better and then we'll be able to find some more freedom but this is pointing to

295
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,520
this precise moment this moment this moment

296
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:28,020
whatever you're experiencing we don't have to wait for the conditions to get better

297
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:34,140
let's let's just will be more seen hearing sensing and cognizing that's the

298
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:39,740
only thing that we will be doing ever so why not now

299
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:43,700
why not this moment

300
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:52,500
then maybe I'll just close with this learning to live in this

301
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:59,039
way live fully being with our experience

302
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:06,059
as opposed to thinking like okay well sometime in the future that'll be better then and then I will

303
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:15,260
be with my experience but instead to live this experience this is a way in which

304
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:23,519
opening the door to more freedom now as opposed to in the imagined future

305
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:30,500
some other time to live our life fully

306
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:39,980
okay so with that I'll open it up to some questions or comments

307
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:59,279
thank you so much for that I was just wondering in this story what does what is cognized refer to is that that we

308
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:04,919
added interpretation to the experience or just that we thought about it in some way or what

309
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:11,398
does that mean yeah this is such a great question it's kind of a clunky translation I would say what we thought

310
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:19,320
I would say we would just say thought I think that's probably a better word to say so just recognizing that thoughts

311
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:25,020
arise and then just to be with the thought without saying like oh I shouldn't think this I can't believe I

312
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:31,819
thought that or do anything like that or just say that thank you for asking that question it's a good question

313
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,320
back here

314
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:47,760
thank you um thanks for that talk I I guess I have

315
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:54,300
a question of at the end when you say you can still move through the world after having these realizations

316
00:34:54,300 --> 00:35:00,599
how does that work necessarily if you know you're really only experiencing your senses really deeply not having

317
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:08,280
thoughts about them how do you continue having like motivation to do things day to day or to go about the world like like you

318
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:13,800
described just kind of would be interested to hear your thoughts on that yeah yeah do you want to say a little bit more

319
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:19,320
about uh your concerns about this or you're saying like how do we do it

320
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:26,040
without motivation that we'll turn into couch potatoes yeah I guess from the description of it of someone who hearing

321
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:32,220
is only hearing yeah seeing is only seeing it sounds to me like kind of a passive Observer of everything that's

322
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:38,460
happening and I just I don't know what it feels like to be in that state but it seems like someone who

323
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:43,800
is um you know I just can't imagine someone in that state

324
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:49,440
getting up and eating breakfast and you know going to work et cetera so I'm just curious how it

325
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:55,440
fits into day-to-day actions when you've reached that point of just what you're describing yeah thank you thank you

326
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:03,540
that's a legitimate question so eating breakfast happens

327
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:08,660
getting out of bed happens getting dressed happens

328
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:15,300
planning happens work happens everything happens but there isn't so much of a

329
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:20,880
sense of like I have to make it happen there isn't this sense of I have to

330
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:27,420
engineer manufacture create and do everything to make it happen instead

331
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:36,480
there's a a more allowing it's it's quite something actually that we aren't

332
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,579
as we're not as in control as we think that we are and we're not creating

333
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:47,339
things as much as we think we are but when we step back still everything that needs to happen

334
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:52,460
happens and there isn't this extra um

335
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:58,320
thinking you know what are people going to think about me oh I better do that or take care of this there's so much more

336
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:06,480
energy and Clarity that uh actually a person can have more impact

337
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:12,300
in the world and can be doing a lot more just because they're freed up from so

338
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:20,760
much of the things that we are that tie us up in knots I don't know is that an okay answer yeah

339
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:25,859
I wish I could say precisely something that uh but that is kind of like

340
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:31,980
breakfast eating happens [Laughter] what was that bill

341
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:40,820
oh okay anybody else have a have a comment

342
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:50,579
yeah yeah right here the person who's uh spoke

343
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:57,920
earlier we're just using so everybody can hear no right right here Jim

344
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:04,760
another question that I had was what do you think is the

345
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:11,700
instructive element of the story in the part where he's asking for the

346
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:16,859
Insight while the teachers on their lunch break and in

347
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:22,140
sort of repeatedly asking and being told no and then

348
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:27,240
he concedes and does give that you know share that Insight while on the lunch

349
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:33,540
break like what what is that part about do you think so a few things that this

350
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:43,320
is a kind of a shows up in the tradition a number of times to be asked three times it's a

351
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:49,740
it's a cultural thing I think from ancient India to ask three times it still exists sometimes in some Buddhist

352
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:54,960
Traditions you have to ask three times for a teacher or for certain things

353
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:03,180
but I'm interpreting it that uh the bahio is persistent and these are and

354
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:09,180
maybe some version of this did happen

355
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:14,400
I'm not going to say this is a true story because I don't know but we can

356
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,800
imagine that maybe there was a time when something like this did happen say well you know actually this is not the time

357
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:25,320
and then there's the tradition of Eskin three times so that's my interpretation

358
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,740
of it

359
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:39,540
yes right so I didn't finish the the whole suit done no I just said that the final piece is

360
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:45,180
he dies so maybe that was why we can't know we

361
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:52,140
can't know where there's a real story but the parable right is that he dies and so

362
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:59,520
um that urgency was very relevant in this context that recognition of impermanence yes yep

363
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,560
yep he's telling the Buddha well you may die I may die we don't know I don't know

364
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:11,579
and then I come to find out Bahia dies soon right thereafter I don't know if he knew he was afraid he was going to die

365
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:17,960
right yeah yeah thank you for that

366
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:27,000
maybe I'll just add a little bit of how he dies this is very this is like part of

367
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:33,300
um a cow he gets killed by a cow so like that's

368
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:38,579
not really explained but uh the interpretations he got between a newborn

369
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:46,020
calf and its mother or something like this and got trampled by a cow this is a curious part of the story

370
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:52,640
but he is not the only one in the suit does there's other people who get killed by cows too

371
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:57,140
I don't know what to make of that

372
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:04,800
but he became awake and he was awakened thank you and between the teaching and the glory

373
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,060
and that's absolutely right

374
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:27,960
it's interesting that um you know the David tells him

375
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:34,740
that he's not on the path you know he's in his current practices not leading to Enlightenment and yet he

376
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:41,520
laid he clearly laid the foundation you know clearly he'd been cultivating parmies

377
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:46,680
um and been cultivating samadhi and so that then when he received the

378
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:52,820
teaching um he was he was well prepared for insight

379
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:58,380
so it's he wasn't on the path and yet

380
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:05,460
he was cultivating his mind in ways that made him very

381
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:11,520
receptive yeah so that his attainment was rapid yeah

382
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:19,020
great great thank you thank you for pointing that out and we know like then the earlier in the

383
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:25,079
suta these pointed out that you know he was venerated by others and stuff so we knew he had it was a spiritual leader of

384
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:30,480
some sort but uh much on this particular path but

385
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:37,279
it makes heart and Minds were being cultivated so that he was receptive

386
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:49,040
okay oh yes one more question okay here we go this will be the last one

387
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:58,680
okay I struggle a little bit with or a lot um I mean so human beings are

388
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:05,160
pretty naturally sense making creatures right and and so this kind of teaching

389
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:11,160
is inviting us to lay that down completely and just it

390
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:17,160
sounds to me I'll frame it as a question um it feels like to me that it's

391
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:24,480
inviting us to experience what we're sensing just as what we're sensing to experience our

392
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:31,020
thoughts just as thoughts that or maybe that's that's the place where we can have thoughts which are probably meaning

393
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:39,599
making but we don't get attached to those specific stories and cognizances or you know

394
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:45,359
maybe that's where the trick is or the the skill is of yeah

395
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:53,099
that it's okay to make have to be to have thoughts that are making meaning but to observe those and not become

396
00:43:53,099 --> 00:44:00,000
attached to the particular narration yeah I I would say and and not get this

397
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,940
proliferation of thoughts right not just going off on uh tangent or you know something like this

398
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:13,140
but of course I don't think it's possible for us to not make meaning yeah yeah of course we'd do that

399
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:19,800
thank you okay okay so thank you for your

400
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:26,599
attention and wishing you a wonderful evening thank you

401
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:32,539
questions
