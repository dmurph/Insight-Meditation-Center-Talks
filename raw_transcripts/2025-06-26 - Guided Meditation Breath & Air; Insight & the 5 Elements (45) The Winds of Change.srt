1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:09,679
good morning good day good evening this is the fourth of five talks and

2
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:16,640
meditations on the five elements or five qualities or properties of embodied

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:25,680
experience as they can support insight and today we'll be covering air

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,359
so um the main focus for our meditation today will be

5
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,599
on breathing

6
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,079
the invitation is to take a step back

7
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:54,920
mentally and feel into this body

8
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,320
maybe take a couple of longer slower breaths

9
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,400
noticing the feeling of air on your skin

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,640
and allowing your attention to move inward downward

11
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:31,560
exhaling tension and inhaling a sense of awareness

12
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,000
then allowing the breathing to be natural

13
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,400
normal

14
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:01,399
and noticing however your breath is for you today

15
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,760
is there warmth or cool in the air as it comes through the nostrils

16
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,319
it's on the throat

17
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:30,120
noticing a sense of motion in the chest and rib cage

18
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,680
noticing especially movement of your life's breath

19
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,120
in your diaphragm and abdomen

20
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:05,000
the flow of inb breath and out breath

21
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,640
noting perhaps gently in the mind

22
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,760
rising as the chest or abdomen rise

23
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:27,719
falling as the exhale happens

24
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,269
[Music]

25
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:51,560
noticing moisture or dryness of the air as it becomes breath

26
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,159
feeling

27
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:05,640
your body rooted grounded in the moment

28
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,680
and especially attuning

29
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:30,440
to the language of the body the vibrancy

30
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:40,759
maybe a sense of stretching or pulling on the inb breath

31
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,720
releasing relaxation from the outreath

32
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:06,680
noticing the very beginning of the inb breath

33
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:19,680
the different changes in the abdomen diaphragm and chest

34
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:27,240
through the whole inhale rising expanding

35
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:42,280
tuning into the feeling of fullness at the top of the inb breath

36
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,759
and then that feeling of release softening

37
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,039
falling chest falling abdomen

38
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:06,759
warmth of air being breathed out

39
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,560
allowing any thoughts of future or past

40
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:48,039
to be known acknowledged with kindness and to fade to the periphery

41
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:57,240
inviting awareness mindfulness to the forefront of attention

42
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:06,199
this breath this moment of breath

43
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:20,120
this moment of warmth or cool motion or stillness

44
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,800
heaviness or lightness

45
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,758
immersed in the momentum

46
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:28,279
if perhaps the attention is here just a little more

47
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:39,399
the invitation is to really dedicate the mind the meditation to the details

48
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,399
of moving movement and air

49
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:53,320
noticing the difference between the beginning of the inb breath

50
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:02,680
a few pulses in as the abdomen or chest rise

51
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,680
all of the different sensations of expansion

52
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,640
as the lungs fill

53
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:25,360
tiny moment of transition where the inb breath ends and the

54
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,160
outreath begins

55
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:40,040
and noticing perhaps even noting the falling of the chest and belly

56
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:46,240
back down through the entire life cycle of the

57
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,240
outreath

58
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:06,399
resting when it occurs in that small still point

59
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,360
at the end of the outreath

60
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,800
softening allowing

61
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:27,240
the cycle of movement the cycle of life to continue

62
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,480
in the last moments of our meditation together

63
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:50,120
the invitation is to feel into all of your experience

64
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:57,679
movement and stillness warmth and cool groundedness

65
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,919
or lightness

66
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:13,960
moisture or dryness and open to the heart and mind

67
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,960
how you are in this moment

68
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:30,799
especially attuning to any benefits peacefulness

69
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:38,120
attention calm kindness

70
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:46,000
and soaking in them letting them percolate through your system

71
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,120
nourish your heart

72
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,000
and from that place

73
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:04,159
casting your internal gaze outwards towards all the others your

74
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:09,000
life touches directly and indirectly

75
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:16,960
wishing that they may be happy healthy

76
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:26,360
safe peaceful at ease and free

77
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:38,559
may all beings benefit from our practice here together

78
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:44,720
and may our practice be a cause and condition for greater love

79
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:50,278
liberation and peace in the world

80
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:18,720
[Music]

81
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:29,799
thank you for the sincerity of your practice

82
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:16,640
so welcome to this fourth of five talks

83
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:24,720
on the five elements or five um qualities properties that we're

84
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:30,799
covering this week in direct experience and more metaphorically inspirationally

85
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:38,720
to support insight so so far we've covered earth water and

86
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:44,720
fire and today we are on air or wind

87
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:53,360
and um here we're starting to move into territory where the the um translation

88
00:31:53,360 --> 00:32:00,080
of datu the poly to element starts not to make quite so much sense of course

89
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:05,440
air element you could think of it as air molecules that makes total sense and it

90
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:12,799
can also be more of a property a potential indirect experience

91
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:18,720
the ancient teachings describe the direct experience of air being movement

92
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,760
pushing pulling stretching expanding contracting

93
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:34,159
just like I read that meditation where the chest the belly or the diaphragm might expand contract rise or fall

94
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:42,000
the function according to the ancient teachings is to convey that air or wind conveys

95
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:49,600
which makes sense if you think about kites for example or birds kiting soaring

96
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:55,440
more fancifully if we combine the air element with the heat element

97
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:03,398
fire element we might get the conveyance of a hot air balloon or a blimp

98
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:11,519
so how it shows up in meditation is that movement of breath movement of

99
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:18,640
the chest or abdomen or belly and also in feeling the contact of the breath on

100
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:24,240
the inside of your nose or your throat your lungs

101
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,760
and air is of course the literal experience of breath and in stiller

102
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:35,840
moments of practice very quiet moments it's actually possible to feel the

103
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:41,679
transpiration of the air without any movement of

104
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:47,360
breathing at all it's kind of cool

105
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:54,640
there's also um in the ancient discourses different kinds of sensations

106
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:01,600
and different kinds of feeling to inve great and not pleasant unpleasant neither are likened to winds from the

107
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:08,158
north south east and west that all kinds of different feelings can be associated

108
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:14,398
with those winds and speaking of wind internal and

109
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:22,079
external contemplation can be particularly evocative for practice with this element

110
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:29,280
playing with the exploration when does the air around you become breath

111
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:36,240
and when does that internal breath return to air not an intellectual answer

112
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:43,520
to that or a conceptual answer but a felt sense when does it happen

113
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,320
in your own experience

114
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:55,280
external wind a breeze on our face or wind all around

115
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:01,839
us if we're in a windy or gusty area meditating outside or just sitting outside

116
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:08,280
that can be a very powerful meditation object

117
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:14,800
there's this inconstancy of the touch of wind on our skin or even the in the sort

118
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,320
of indirect feeling of it through clothes or a jacket that

119
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:25,680
is a direct experience teacher of ana

120
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,920
and constancy

121
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:37,280
and not a few practitioners that I've known including myself have meditated in

122
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:45,440
the breeze and the wind and then when the wind stops there's a very interesting process that

123
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:54,960
can happen in your own meditation that constant contact stopping can allow

124
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,920
a powerful dropping away of body

125
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:07,680
and then a little bit more shall we say an emotional or mental

126
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:13,200
exploration of this is notice for yourself

127
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:20,079
differences and how your heart how your mind how your body respond

128
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:26,320
to breezes or wind based on conditions they could be conditions of warmth or

129
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:33,119
cool or humidity or dryness dustiness or clean clarity sweet breezes with perfume

130
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:39,680
of flowers or they could be more internal conditions

131
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:44,960
the same wind one day might feel bracing invigorating

132
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:51,359
and another day feel overwhelming or like too much

133
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:59,559
so this brings us to other air and wind simileies that the Buddha used

134
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:05,760
the eight worldly winds is a very famous teaching also translated as the eight

135
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:11,680
worldly vicissitudes which are pleasure and pain loss and

136
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:17,359
gain praise and blame and status and

137
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:24,359
disrepute or fame and disrepute it's sometimes glossed

138
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,920
so I don't know about you but many many people in my life and at many points in

139
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:38,640
my life those have been quite consequential for me in terms of emotional life responses

140
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:47,520
general attitude and then as practice begins to deepen

141
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:54,079
as wisdom begins to gather as maturity begins to happen

142
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:59,839
those vicissitudes those winds don't blow us around quite so much

143
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:07,839
but instead there's a stability mindfulness can be like the ballast

144
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:14,079
to hold us steady in fact the Buddha talked about a wise person being like a

145
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:22,599
large boulder in the wind unmoved by praise or blame

146
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:29,440
or the other eight worldly winds for that matter a steady friend is also talked about

147
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:36,000
this way a true spiritual friend who doesn't abandon you in bad times or

148
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:44,040
flatter you and try to snuggle up close just because times are good and there's something to gain

149
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:51,920
a fully awakened person in a hot is described as completely unruffled by the

150
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:58,280
worldly winds or any wind for that matter

151
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:06,400
so we see that wind air element

152
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,599
is associated with more than just the sensations of pushing pulling movement

153
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:17,520
conveying it's also about pushing and pulling

154
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:25,520
forces of life and the way we move the way we convey ourselves navigate through

155
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:30,560
the physical and metaphorical winds

156
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:37,359
and there's wind power so the Buddha advised his son Rahula

157
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:45,599
to make his meditation like air like wind if you make your meditation like wind

158
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:52,240
sun agreeable and disagreeable contacts will not invade your heart and mind and

159
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:59,359
remain and he goes on to say if disgusting or

160
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:06,000
unwanted things are thrown at the air or wind

161
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,680
they don't stay they don't stick

162
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,680
but instead

163
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:24,560
there's no response so this ties into another teaching of

164
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:32,720
the Buddha to practitioners in daily life about wind and air

165
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:38,079
and that is not to respond

166
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:43,599
not to take it personally to allow the wind just to blow through it said that

167
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:49,599
wind is not trapped by a net and we can consider that the net of our

168
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:57,440
opinions the net of our views the net of the way we want things to be

169
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:03,280
and instead the wind just untrapped

170
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,440
so we can be free like the wind

171
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:18,640
so we'll close with a poem from Rosemary

172
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:24,800
Watla Tramer wonderful um indigenous American poet

173
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,839
and this ties together um some of the elements the properties we've been

174
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:35,280
talking about this week you'll see

175
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:41,760
she writes "Sometimes a person wakes believing they are a storm

176
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:50,319
it's hard to deny it what with all the rain pouring out of the gutters of the mind all the gusts blowing through all

177
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:58,079
the squalls all the gray but by afternoon it seems obvious they

178
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:06,079
are a garden about to sprout by night it's clear they are a moon

179
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:12,560
luminous radiant faithful

180
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,760
that's the danger I suppose of believing any frame

181
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:25,440
let me believe then in curiosity in wonder in change

182
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:31,680
let me trust how essential it is to stumble into the trough of the unknown

183
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:40,560
and marvel how trough becomes wings becomes faith becomes math

184
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:49,640
let me trust and certainty is a sacred path

185
00:42:53,440 --> 00:43:00,720
