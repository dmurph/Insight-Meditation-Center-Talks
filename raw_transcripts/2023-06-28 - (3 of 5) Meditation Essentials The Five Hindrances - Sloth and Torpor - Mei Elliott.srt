1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
anyone welcome back my name is May Elliott and this is day three of our

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,700
five day series on the 5 hindrances so for those who struggle being present

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:19,380
during meditation I found that studying the five hindrances it's really an essential practice for understanding why

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:26,580
it is that we're losing presence you know what is it exactly that's clouding the mind and inhibiting our ability to

5
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:32,099
show up and what's often the case is that one of

6
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:39,020
the five hindrances is present um the mind gets stirred up in thought you got the root desire ill will

7
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:45,180
restlessness or doubt might be fueling the thinking mind or maybe you were just so sleepy and

8
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,280
foggy that we just can't be present and then maybe sloth and torpora are clouding the mind

9
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,520
so today we'll be focusing on sloth and torper also known as sleepiness so in

10
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:03,539
the meditation we'll play around with the classic antidote to sleepiness which is cultivating energy

11
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:09,320
so to begin please find your meditation posture

12
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,799
and to uh to bring forth energy in the practice it

13
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:29,340
can be really helpful to have an upright posture sometimes if we're really cozy and

14
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:35,220
comfortable and maybe leaning back on the back of a chair and a couch it's

15
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:41,040
really easy to get sleepier um that's a prime recipe for falling

16
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:48,500
asleep so um see if you can find an upright posture that's both alert and relaxed

17
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,520
stupid

18
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,720
I'm starting with a few deep breaths

19
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:18,080
and this signal for the body to land and show up

20
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:41,280
so we'll take a little time to [Music] um to connect with

21
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,640
with the present moment uh by making contact with our primary anchor so maybe

22
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,860
that's the breath maybe it's a global sense of the body posture sitting maybe

23
00:02:52,860 --> 00:03:00,959
it's the soundscape this takes some time to land in your body with your sense Gates

24
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,580
seeing what it's like to be here

25
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:25,880
having connected to a felt sense of the present moment

26
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:36,199
let's take stock of the energy in the body kind of doing an energy inventory

27
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:43,919
so you might just check to see whether the energy is high or whether it's low or somewhere in between

28
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:51,060
on one end of the end of the spectrum we have a very energetic maybe excited

29
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:58,979
high energy on on the other end low heavy tired energy falling asleep

30
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:01,280
energy

31
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:10,039
so what's the energy like in your body and mind right now

32
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:16,819
foreign

33
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:49,020
we might find that the body is alert but the mind is sluggish

34
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:54,300
or sometimes the other way around where the mind is sluggish or dull but the

35
00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:00,300
body is somewhat awake there's energy in the body so we're just exploring to see what we

36
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,478
find

37
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:23,099
so during the meditation I'll offer some antidotes to sleepiness to sloth and

38
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:29,580
torpor but even if your energy is high or well regulated even if you're not tired

39
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:34,800
during this meditation you might still just play around with some of the energy

40
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,260
practices that I'm offering um just so that you get a body memory of

41
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,039
how to do this

42
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:53,160
so to begin one of our classic antidotes to sleepiness is uh just to sit up

43
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:59,160
straighter like I mentioned at the beginning of the meditation if you find the mind getting too sluggish

44
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:06,480
just bring a little bit more energy into the posture a little bit more space between the

45
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:13,220
bones of the spine a little more lift in the back of the neck

46
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,000
and that can bring in a little more energy

47
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:33,440
another way to do this is by opening the eyes rather than meditating with the eyes closed let some light in

48
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:55,740
and it's fine if you want to change your posture or close your eyes again we're just trying these on a little bit here

49
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,560
you don't need to do each thing for the entire meditation

50
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:11,040
and we won't do these next ones now but it can also be helpful to stand up if

51
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:18,300
you're really falling asleep you can stand up and that's actually fine to do during the meditation now if you'd like

52
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:24,300
um others that we won't do include splashing cold water on the face

53
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:32,480
or going for a brisk walk these are energizers for our Bluetooths

54
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:49,320
you also might try Wheeling down the body if you're feeling sleepy

55
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,500
taking off the sweatshirt or opening a window

56
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:10,760
so if you'd like to try that you can see how that impacts energy in the body

57
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:16,579
and you don't need to you don't want to create too much movement

58
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:47,000
so these are all physical ways that we can change the energy in our practice

59
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:55,079
going forward I'll offer some some options to keep you still and seated in

60
00:11:55,079 --> 00:12:01,519
your meditation things you can do with your eyes closed and your typical meditation posture

61
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,600
and for this you might bring to mind something that inspires you about

62
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,940
practice this is a reflection

63
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:34,380
often that which inspires us brings forth energy

64
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:42,079
so what brings forth energy for you maybe it's the final goal of Liberation

65
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:49,700
freedom from suffering the Deep wish to be free

66
00:12:55,019 --> 00:13:04,100
or maybe there's a wish to be in service in the world living by The bodhisattva Vow

67
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,540
to save all beings from suffering

68
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:14,700
or maybe to be kinder to your family or to be less anxious at work

69
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:19,579
all of these are valid reasons for practice

70
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:26,160
so taking a moment to connect with what inspires you to practice what's

71
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,940
your motivation

72
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:09,060
so can you feel the way that this reflection brings a little bit more oomph to the breathness

73
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:14,959
a little more effort oh yeah there's a reason that I'm sitting here doing this

74
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:22,040
now a reason to bring the effort in

75
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:47,339
another way to bring forth energy in our practice is to increase the Curiosity

76
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:54,660
and bringing bringing forth this factor of Investigation so if we can become curious that can

77
00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:01,699
really increase increase the energy here increase the effort

78
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:12,180
so you might get curious about noticing the exact moment the breath turns from an inhale to an

79
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:16,880
exhale and from an exhale to an inhale

80
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,779
you could be curious about the shape the breath takes maybe at Billows at the beginning and

81
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:29,060
then it gets small at the end maybe it's a thin narrow short breath

82
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,339
maybe it's smooth and even for the entire inhale

83
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:47,339
or choppy and staccato what's the shape and texture of the

84
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,639
breath

85
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:31,940
is the inhale longer than the exhale or the other way around

86
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:13,380
so this practice of cultivating curiosity which brings forth energy can

87
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:19,140
be done at any of the scent stores you can do it with a felt sense of the

88
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:27,480
breath how we just did where we can feel any other part of the body that brings forth interest for us

89
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,340
we can do it with a soundscape

90
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,840
maybe sensing into the nearest sounds

91
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:51,260
maybe sounds from one's own body

92
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,320
the sound of the breath

93
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:03,559
maybe sounds from digestion in the belly

94
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,580
or sounds in the room

95
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,460
and what are the far away sounds

96
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:42,620
bird calls water City sounds

97
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,179
can you catch each one

98
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:33,360
so now for a little creativity and playfulness

99
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:39,080
we can use the imagination to increase curiosity

100
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:49,399
so you might imagine for a moment

101
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:57,299
that you are inhabiting a body that's not your own Maybe

102
00:25:57,299 --> 00:26:03,419
maybe you're an alien that was sent from space and you are inhabiting a human

103
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:08,940
suit to wear for the day so this is not something you'll find in

104
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:14,520
this utas um so we can employ our imagination to um

105
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:20,760
to bring forth curiosity in our practice so maybe this is your first time on

106
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:27,419
Earth and you're responsible for really getting to know what it's like to be in

107
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:33,299
a human body so can you explore the present moment

108
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:36,380
from that place

109
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:48,019
your first time being human what's it like to have senses

110
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:55,559
what's it like to feel so you can take the last few minutes of the meditation exploring in this way or

111
00:26:55,559 --> 00:27:02,179
doing whatever other practice is supportive for you for cultivating curiosity

112
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:33,899
May the beneficial energy of our time together

113
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:43,700
benefit all being so they may be happy healthy safe and free from suffering

114
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:32,340
all right welcome back folks for those just arriving I'm mate Elliott

115
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:38,120
and we're continuing our series on the five hindrances

116
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:45,120
so um when I was a teenager one of my favorite things to do was to go

117
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,460
backpacking um we would go deep into the back country

118
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:55,860
carrying everything we needed on our backs and we'd hike out to remote lakes and

119
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:01,740
mountains and this part of this experience we needed to hike from water source to water source to refill our

120
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:07,919
water bottles and sometimes this would be from a tiny spring or a creek or a large lake

121
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,960
then we carried these little these little hand pumps that filtered out bacteria

122
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:21,000
I remember many peaceful afternoon sitting by a creek deep in the forest pumping water into my bottle

123
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,399
and the filters were pretty good but if the water we found was too murky or

124
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:31,500
filled with silt or too too overgrown with moss then the filters wouldn't be

125
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:37,320
able to do their job and we couldn't drink the water um so we really needed our water to be

126
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:44,120
somewhat clear in order to sustain us and to continue on our journey

127
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:49,980
similarly you know the Buddha compared the five hindrances to a pond with

128
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:57,240
unclear water so in an unafflicted mind the water's clear but in a mind that's afflicted by

129
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:04,980
the hindrances the water is unclear so the doubtful mind was compared to murky water you can't see through it

130
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:10,140
it's not the Sleepy mind is like water overgrown with moss

131
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:16,500
the restful the Restless mind is like stirred up water the mind with ill will

132
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:22,500
is boiling water as though a lot with anger and the desirous mind is compared

133
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:28,260
to water filled with colorful dye or a shade that's uh so enchanting it can

134
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:34,679
entrance us you know we're drawn to it so our mind is a little like the water

135
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:41,039
we'd find on these backpacking trips when the mind is clear it can be life-giving more like fresh spring water

136
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:46,559
if the mind's too agitated if it's too murky too overgrown then it's not clear

137
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:53,159
and we can't be nourished by it so today we'll focus on the third

138
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:59,519
hindrance sloth interpreter yeah now lots of these terms

139
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:06,360
um were translated when Victoria was Queen of England so the term sounds a little archaic but all sloth and torpor

140
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:12,358
really refers to is sleepiness other ways it might appear in our practice are

141
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:18,780
um and these words might be more resonant for you drowsiness fatigue lethargy

142
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:25,138
illness Etc um and in our practice we might come across

143
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:32,280
just a run-of-the-mill sleepiness where the body just um physiologically needs more sleep and

144
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:38,158
this technically isn't sloth and torpor it's not necessarily a hindrance if we're just physically needing more sleep

145
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:43,378
or under slept so then torp as a hindrance occurs when there's a

146
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:49,099
psychological cause to it for example boredom or indifference disinterest

147
00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:56,158
complacency hopelessness so these are all things that can lead to

148
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:02,640
a dull mind that can lead to a mind that wants to go to sleep and I should also note that sloth

149
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:08,640
typically refers to a mental sleepiness and torpora to a physical tiredness

150
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:15,000
um and sloth interpreza hindrance are products of an attitude we have

151
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,880
so for example during daily life we accrue stories about ourselves and we

152
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:26,000
often replay them like blockbuster hits in our meditation

153
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,520
during meditation as the Mind learns to let go of these movie reruns sometimes

154
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:40,560
the lack of entertainment makes the Mind get sleepy um so as we develop a taste for the the

155
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:47,880
peace and Stillness at first it can it can register as boring and sleepiness

156
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:53,820
can arise we're not used to um the screen with a movie projected on

157
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:59,820
it so this would be an example of sloth and torpor resulting from a psychological Source rather than a lack

158
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:06,300
of sleep um or sometimes the energy expended from replaying the blockbuster hits has

159
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:13,619
exhausted us physically and mentally so we experience sloth and torper as as a result of writing the intensity of the

160
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:18,900
highs and little off lows often there's a Kim's notion in the body when when

161
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:24,000
we're riding the highs and lows and that can actually make us tired also

162
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,859
or sometimes we experience sloth and torpor because the mind doesn't want to experience a certain State

163
00:36:30,859 --> 00:36:37,560
such as grief disappointment or self-judgment so in the same way that the Buddha

164
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:43,320
compared sloth and torpert to a pond overgrown with moss sometimes we want to

165
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:49,140
pull the metaphorical covers over our head and go to sleep rather than feel a

166
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:56,060
certain difficult emotion so the sleepiness actually functions as a strategy of avoidance

167
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:03,180
so as we move into this third hindrance of sloth interpreter we can see that it's really an energetic State you know

168
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:10,140
that's what we explored in our meditation the fourth hindrance of restlessness is also energetic so we

169
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:15,480
could say these two um or kind of two sides of the spectrum sloth and torber presenting as low

170
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:20,539
energy and restlessness muffin presenting as high energy

171
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:27,480
when I was sitting early my early meditation Retreats I had a lot of

172
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:32,579
sleepiness it was a lot of like the routine

173
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:41,640
um and this was really unpleasant for me and I spent a lot of time fighting it

174
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:48,480
um but what I learned through that was that much much of the suffering with sleepiness was actually my resistance to

175
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:55,020
it my sense that the the sleepiness shouldn't be there so for me it was actually a version that

176
00:37:55,020 --> 00:38:02,160
was making the experience a suffering State sleepiness itself is karmically neutral it's not bad

177
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:08,700
um so what was happening for me is I was having a multiple hindrance attack the combination of sleepiness followed by

178
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:16,320
aversion let's go on to take just a little detour to mention how a version crops up in relationship to the other

179
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,480
hindrances um because the hindrances themselves are

180
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:27,480
often unpleasant in addition to the primary hindrance like sleepiness it's

181
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:35,220
not uncommon to have a version arise so if you can have our version arise with any of the hindrances it can arise even

182
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:40,920
in relationship to aversion so a version to a version like we're trying to get rid of our anger

183
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:47,339
and this is one of the reasons I call a version the tag along hindrance because it often

184
00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:52,800
tags along with the others so as you practice with all of the hindrances no

185
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,900
notice if there's an attitude like oh no this shouldn't be happening or this

186
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:03,180
sleepiness is ruining my meditation a lot of my mind is so Restless there's

187
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:10,500
too much thinking I should know better often we when we see the aversion clearly we can begin to reorient and

188
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:15,599
learn to relate to the initial hindrance with more patience and kindness

189
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:21,900
so all to say you don't need to resist sleepiness or get aversive to it instead

190
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:28,920
can you befriend your sleepiness you can just make you can make friends with the

191
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:36,500
peaceful State it's a tranquil State that's not a bad thing and you can just bring mindfulness to that tranquil state

192
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:41,940
we can continue to be with the breath from a tired place

193
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:49,200
and it's fine if there are times when the mind isn't crystal clear if a period of meditation is is sleepy

194
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:54,300
then just be sleepy Buddha we shouldn't abandon a meditation

195
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:59,579
session because of sleepiness and it's a great training to be sleepy

196
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:05,700
because we will always have sleepy moments in our life so how can we learn how to be with them in a skillful way

197
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:12,780
come on so again the basic instruction for

198
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:18,180
sleepiness is to recognize it and we've talked about this practice each day so

199
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:24,540
far and we'll continue to so first we recognize the Sleep sleepiness and then we practice feeling it the second step

200
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:30,000
of feel so recognize and feel that's our primary practice for all the hindrances

201
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:37,200
um now for um while sleepiness I find it's actually easier to recognize than the other

202
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:42,420
hindrances when we feel sleepiness and we actually sense it in the present

203
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:50,520
moment I really want to emphasize something that I pointed to a lot in the meditation which is curiosity so if we

204
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:56,940
can sense more experience with curiosity that really turns up the dial on energy

205
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:02,760
so curiosity raises energy so that's that's what I really suggest when you

206
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:08,700
recognize and feel and the second step of getting to know the sleepiness with

207
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:14,400
curiosity feeling it with Curiosity has actually been revolutionary in my

208
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,560
practice with this hindrance sleepiness has actually become very interesting to

209
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:24,660
me so just as an example of some of the things that I would get curious about in

210
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:30,060
my my sloth and torper practice um sometimes I explore where is the

211
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:35,220
sleepiest spot in my entire body you know I'd find the epicenter of the

212
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:41,520
sleepiness and sometimes it might be the epicenter might might be right behind my

213
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:47,220
left thigh and if I go to that spot oh I dip out and if I kind of move away from

214
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:52,700
that spot in the body sometimes I'd be able to maintain the energy a little longer

215
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:58,440
or I might see if I could find the exact moment the mind slips into a sleep

216
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:06,420
States so that that crossover from awake to asleep in that first moment of

217
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:12,060
um a shift in state or I might check to see if I can I

218
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:18,240
notice if I fall asleep on an in-breath or an out breath or if I'm counting my breath from one to

219
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:23,540
ten um where do I lose track am I falling asleep

220
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:28,680
on breath two or do is it you know maybe I'm there for breaths one through five

221
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:34,260
and then I lose track around six and seven so these

222
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:41,940
are just all different ways that I found to to explore the experience um and and what I found is sometimes the

223
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:47,640
mind is just way too heavy uh too dull to notice any of that and then sometimes

224
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:54,300
there's other flavors of sleepiness where um there's a tiredness in the mind and there is that falling asleep but

225
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:59,940
it's a lighter feeling and it's um I'm more able to explore what's happening

226
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:07,140
there so you can just play around with these and see what you discover those are always just to to bring some

227
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:12,740
curiosity towards what it is that you're feeling and what you're noticing

228
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:20,040
so as mentioned um many times today um the antidote for sloth interpreter is

229
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:26,760
energy during the meditation I mentioned a few but just so you can hear them again if you're sleepy try opening your

230
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:33,839
eyes sitting up straighter taking a few deep breaths um if you were on Retreat and intending

231
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:39,060
to be sitting for a long time you might get up and go for a Brisk wash walk or

232
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:44,460
Splash cold water on the face um and if you need to go take a nap

233
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:52,260
there's no crime in napping one thing that was really helpful for me was making the bot the body colder so rather

234
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:58,079
than bundling up in a cozy way in the meditation hall or in my room sitting in

235
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,240
a T-shirt If the room is cool or opening the window and that brings my energy

236
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:09,300
right back up but if you're someone where you think

237
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:16,680
that it might be defensive sleep or you're you're becoming sleepy so then you don't

238
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:21,839
have to feel something or if you maybe if you just notice the pattern of sleeping is happening a lot you might

239
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:28,680
ask yourself is there something underneath this you just drop in that question is there

240
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:36,060
something underneath this um and that can at times reveal whether you know is there is there something

241
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:42,660
else that I'm feeling here and that can reveal what's going on unveiling any

242
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:49,619
underlying emotion or feeling that the sleepiness is masking and then lastly as

243
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:56,700
with all the hindrances notice when the sleepiness passes you know notice when those those clouds

244
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:02,040
clear and The Sun Shines again when the Mind perks up from the sleepiness and

245
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:07,640
there's energy that returns notice when the mind is bright

246
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:14,339
so just a few more notes on the attitude in meditation uh with this with the

247
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:19,740
hindrances um the Buddha was visited by hindrances up

248
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:27,000
through the night that led to his Awakening so it's not something to be so hard on ourselves about no need to judge

249
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:33,900
yourself for having hindrances instead we can relate to them as valuable Messengers that have come to teach us

250
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:40,740
you know can we respect our hindrances as teachers our role is to meet them not

251
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:46,020
as a diversion From the Path but as the path itself we can think of the

252
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:52,500
hindrances as whatever it is that we're dealing with we can think of that hindrance as the next stepping stone on

253
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:57,780
the path so when we we can meet a hindrance with

254
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:04,440
um with recognition with curiosity with patience we're simultaneously

255
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:12,140
cultivating a wholesome state so this isn't something going wrong when you can be present with a hindrance

256
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:17,700
so many wholesome qualities are being cultivated seeing a hindrance can actually bring

257
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:22,920
joy and Delight so working with the hindrances is cultivating these

258
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:29,280
beautiful qualities so today if you find yourself getting

259
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:36,359
sleepy rather than immediately reaching for the cup of coffee maybe just postpone the

260
00:46:36,359 --> 00:46:42,839
coffee for a few minutes to explore what sleepiness is like what can you recognize and feel it can you get

261
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:50,099
curious about it how do you cultivate energy um is there a mental state causing the

262
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:57,180
sleepiness such as boredom when I was in high school doing my math homework I was sitting in my desk chair

263
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:03,180
often before I knew it I'd find myself waking up with my head on the desk so

264
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:09,420
you can guess how I felt about math in high school so clearly my attitude during that activity put me right to

265
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:17,160
sleep um what does sleepiness show up for you is the sleepiness serving as a mask to

266
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:25,560
block an emotion so there's plenty ways of it to explore with this and I hope that you uh you

267
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:31,560
enjoy it now you've had just enough sloth interpret today today that you

268
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:39,720
have the opportunity to cultivate all sorts of wholesome states of Mind in response thank you so much everyone

269
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,740
have a lovely day
