1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,120
good evening welcome

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:17,400
welcome so there's a story that sometimes gets told it's uh in the PO Canon I kind of

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:25,119
like this story briefly it goes like um an individual is uh wandering in the

4
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:32,279
forest and they we could say stumble upon P like this what looks like a path

5
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:38,600
like they could tell that you maybe the all the jungle plants aren't quite the

6
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:45,399
same in this little area so in my mind they're like hacking away

7
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:51,399
and they uh discover oh yeah this is actually a paved Road or was a paved

8
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:58,960
Road and they follow it and hacking their way through and they get to what

9
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,158
was an ancient city and with a little bit of work they start

10
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,920
to see oh yeah like here's a wall of a part of the city and looks like of some

11
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,520
uh ponds or lakes or something like this so they don't clear the entire city but

12
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:23,840
uh enough to get a sense of what was there wow like uh what a

13
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,520
discovery and then they go back and uh tell the king hey I discovered this old

14
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:36,479
ancient city that's see with this old ancient Road and tells the king that you

15
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,720
know you should maybe like you excavate uh this road and uh the

16
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,880
city and the King does and then and starts to inhabit the city and lives

17
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,680
happily ever after it's one of those kind of

18
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:02,039
stories and so uh in the poly Canan the Buddha is telling a version of the story of of course you know I'm doing a a

19
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:09,879
summary of it uh adding a little bit of some of my interpretation in there but the uh Buddha he's saying that

20
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:15,640
actually he's this is a story where he is the one who made this

21
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:23,440
discovery and so he's pointing to and this path that he found is the aold path

22
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:30,640
and this beautiful ancient town is freedom freedom from grief hatred and

23
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,160
delusion freedom from suffering and the King that he goes to tell and that

24
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:44,040
clears the path and inhabits it is us we're we're the royalty we're the the uh

25
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,560
I don't know Majestic in some kind of way I kind of like this it's not like oh

26
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:56,000
we're those poor people that have to have everything uh figured out for us but no he's like hey go there and you

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,519
can do some of this work and you can live in this city too so there's this sense of like there's

28
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:08,599
this path that goes to a destination like you could say a journey

29
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:16,760
and we often say this right we have this expression the spiritual journey and we could also say this

30
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:22,319
other typical story that's associated with Buddhist studies that is probably

31
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:28,439
many of you here are familiar with this that is the story of the Buddha himself

32
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:34,280
his spiritual Journey having there's many different

33
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:41,720
versions of this story but uh part of the the gist in the version that I'll tell right now is you know having grown

34
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:49,159
up a life with Incredible privilege everything he wanted everything that was needed and a

35
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:56,439
lot of extra stuff right so a way to indulge whatever sensual pleasure one

36
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:02,599
desired I have a way for that to be um have that have those

37
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:09,400
experiences and uh he was sheltered his father had some concern about what would happen to him when he was late when he

38
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:16,120
was older so made sure that he had this really sheltered pleasure-filled

39
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:25,840
life until he's a young man and he leaves this beautiful palace and

40
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:32,919
encounters old age sickness and death death and some and different

41
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:40,400
individuals and maybe even uh some versions of the story says he encountered uh monastic as

42
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:46,880
well and deeply affected by

43
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,759
this that Goa he's not the Buddha yet we'll call him Goa he wants to find a

44
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:59,759
way there's got to be a way where there isn't this suffering this terrible suffering I don't think he had the idea

45
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:07,360
that he could end old age or that he could end sickness or that he could completely end death but the suffering

46
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,039
part of it and this is part of the practice right is to be able to recognize there's

47
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:19,720
this inevitability of the pain we might say the discomforts the extreme

48
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:26,440
discomforts we might say and distinguishing that from the suffering which is the all the story making and

49
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:33,360
all the things that the mind is doing associated with it they shouldn't be like this why is this happening to me

50
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,960
these types of things so when he go to my realizing the

51
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,680
futility of these worldly pleasures goes off and seeks the end of suffering and

52
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:52,080
practices with a number of teachers some teachers realize yep that's not it went in a different

53
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,479
direction yeah that's not it either and then near

54
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:04,120
death having almost starved him himself to death he uh gains some

55
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,919
sustenance has some insight it's not about avoiding all worldly

56
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:15,680
pleasures but it's about using pleasure in a way that's

57
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,599
supportive sits underneath the bod tree that's his dedication he's going to

58
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:29,280
find suffering at the end of suffering he probably he did find suffering while sitting also of course he did but he

59
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,120
also encountered the end of suffering and there's this way that in

60
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:42,440
so many different ways this journey that he went on afterwards he says you know about the middle way he had one extreme

61
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:49,840
of this Indulgence and another extreme of aestheticism was one of the teachers he followed and he comes back and shows

62
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:56,160
the middle way this middle path the journey is in the middle not one extreme

63
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:03,000
or the other so this whole idea of spiritual journey of this like movement towards

64
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,919
something this development towards something just starting one place and getting in another place as a journey

65
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:16,800
it's a common theme and certain this uh tradition but something happened this

66
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,960
weekend that made me think about this a little bit differently and I like this idea of a

67
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,080
journey and I could you know talk about my own journey and I'm sure all of you also could talk about Journeys that

68
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:38,199
you've been not spiritual or otherwise literal or metaphorical but uh somebody said

69
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:44,960
um I'm looking forward to this adventure kind of like talking about

70
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:52,840
practice and I thought oh Adventure I want to go on an

71
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:58,720
adventure like Adventure that sounds like fun it sounds like oh something that's

72
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,520
exciting and thrilling and uh you know that would be uh

73
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:13,039
enjoyable whereas sometimes this idea of Journey for me it feels like oh

74
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:19,520
okay okay I guess it'll be a lot of some drudgery and tring through the tough

75
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:26,240
stuff and you know we have this idea of a hero's journey I don't even know exactly what all the steps are but I

76
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:32,159
know there's lots of difficulties there's part of them and so I kind of associate that with

77
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:39,880
journey and so I just started to think about well what would it be like if we considered this practice if we just

78
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:45,080
changed the language a little bit and started to talk about it as an

79
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:52,320
adventure instead of part of this spiritual journey this journey because there's

80
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:59,519
this way in which the language that we use definitely has an impact and I noticed that the way that I

81
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:05,480
speak or think about things or experience things you know gets expressed differently and maybe that's a

82
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,640
whole another talk on like how I just myself use language a little bit

83
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,560
differently or how we might do that but all of us know that language has an

84
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:23,560
impact I mean right this is we have whole advertising marketing agencies that are you know built on this and

85
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,760
politicians right all this kind of stuff it's about how we use language so what

86
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:36,079
if it's an Adventure instead of a journey what of this

87
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:42,279
idea so what I have some some ways that maybe

88
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:48,959
to think about this is an adventure also maybe implies some novelty like

89
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:54,839
something new like oh to like maybe discover something like maybe that first

90
00:09:54,839 --> 00:10:02,279
story that I told about was maybe it was an adventure for this person maybe were just out in the woods or the forest or

91
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:09,920
jungle whatever and wow this is like such an adventure to discover something and Raiders of the Lost Arc type of

92
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:18,440
thing you know this like some archaeological find but there's this way in which uh we

93
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:25,279
might say that the purpose or intention of Journeys versus Adventures are a

94
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:31,600
little bit different and we might look at this and see as a ways it can support our

95
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,519
practice a journey usually has a defined

96
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:43,600
destination usually it has or or a purpose spiritual journey I'm going to

97
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,320
develop my spiritual life I'm going to discover more freedom peace ease nibana

98
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,680
whatever it is Enlightenment Awakening happiness whatever it is for

99
00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:00,560
you there's this way where there's not only is there like a destination

100
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:08,120
Journeys right we can journey to San Jose also but also there's a sense of there's

101
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,519
a progression step one step two step three we go from one place and then the

102
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:20,519
next and then the next it's only maybe after the completion of step one that we go onto the step two it's only after

103
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:26,360
getting onto the freeway that we then head south for

104
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,920
example but there's a way

105
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:39,279
that an adventure maybe has a sense of

106
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:46,000
spontaneity or this sense of uncertainty it's not so clear what

107
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,040
exactly step one and step two is and it's not so clear like is there a

108
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,680
particular outcome a particular destination and there's this way that

109
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:02,360
that maybe there's a more of an emphasis on just the

110
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:09,320
enjoyment of the experience like part of being on an adventure is is the

111
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:16,760
experience it's not the destination and it turns out this is so

112
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:22,680
important in this I would say this path of practice using that type of

113
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:29,959
language not only to like be present for what's happening to be here

114
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:35,600
now so the sense of time is different or it's not like about a destination that

115
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,760
will be reached in the future but it's about an experience that's being had

116
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:49,199
right now and a sense of enjoyment there's a sense of the Delight

117
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:55,160
of being alive the Delight of being present for our

118
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:03,240
life even if our life is difficult because it's guaranteed there will be difficulties there will be pain this is

119
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:11,279
what it means to be human it's unavoidable as much as we would like to avoid it it's not

120
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:18,800
possible so there's this way of an adventure there's more of this spontaneity and uh emphasis on just

121
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,920
being in the present of okay what's happening oh okay what's happening

122
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,560
next instead of like okay I got to do this okay I did that okay check GNA do

123
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:35,560
the next check right it has a different uh a different attitude a different way

124
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:42,480
to bring to one's experience and with this is the sense of

125
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,880
adventure is also the sense of exploration like what the sense of

126
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:58,199
curiosity what's happening what's happening now and with that is um maybe as an

127
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:05,880
example is this um this idea that if we have this sense

128
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:13,399
that there's a destination then a difficulty that arises let's say for a meditation period for example we have

129
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:19,480
the sense of okay I want to be settled I want to have some calmness I want to have some

130
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:26,880
ease and then we sit down to meditate and we find that uh we're really

131
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:35,000
drowsy and we just find our s like drifting off has that ever happened to

132
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:40,880
anybody yeah right right this is part of what happens it's and then if you have

133
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:48,000
this real clear sense of like okay I want something in particular to happen then this is a real problem this whole

134
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,199
falling asleep and you have to fix it and what are the strategies I have to come up and what did I do last time and

135
00:14:54,199 --> 00:15:01,240
have I learned anything about it or dang it when is this dang meditation period going to end so that there can be uh uh

136
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:06,360
more energy in the room and I'm not going to fall asleep so much you know there's this whole thing that

137
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:12,000
happens whereas if this sense of like okay this is an adventure as opposed to

138
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:20,519
this journey that I have to get to the end of uh when the bell is going to ring then the sleepiness the drowsiness

139
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:25,920
the sloth and torper what if that's part of the adventure like

140
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:32,920
wow look at this the mind and the body are like shutting

141
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:38,800
down and just noticing like wow what is that like I mean this is amazing that

142
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,920
human bodies do this right that they go go go go go and then you know they

143
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:51,240
sometimes they go to sleep and what's the difference between sleep and awakeness and how does the Mind do this

144
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:59,120
is it all of a sudden a a shut off or is it a slow slide or is there this long

145
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,720
time where there's this in between so if it's an adventure there could be like some

146
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,759
curiosity and I can recommend this I've spent a lot of time doing this it's

147
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:17,440
fascinating to bring some mindfulness when you're really tired and bring some mindfulness as best you can to this

148
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,360
watching the I'm doing this with my hands because it kind of feels like this it is feels for me like a slide

149
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:29,199
into into sleep and sometimes even the mindfulness can follow into into a

150
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:34,560
little bit of the sleep it's really amazing so it's the same experience

151
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:40,399
sitting down to meditate and encountering a lot of sleepiness but instead of this journey

152
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:47,319
like okay I got to get it done it's like oh okay this is part of the adventure I'm just going to be with what's

153
00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:52,959
happening and this is what's happening wow what is it

154
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:59,440
like and this shift in relationship this turns out to be what

155
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,760
practice is all about this is what practice is all about

156
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,079
is this shift in

157
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,798
relationship so there's this so first is this Journeys we might say have this

158
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:23,199
defined purpose and destination whereas Adventures have more this spontaneity

159
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,799
and maybe some unpredictability so I also talked about how Journeys are like step one step two

160
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:35,559
first you go down if you want to leave here and get to the freeway you would

161
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:41,480
probably find your way [Music] to I forgot the name of this street that

162
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:48,799
I drive down so many times it's a it's a very nice street I'm sure but I can't remember the

163
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,840
name and you get Hopkins pH that's

164
00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:01,400
it just go down Hopkins and get on El Cino you know this type of thing um

165
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:07,400
there's this idea of you know step by step and then there can be a sense of

166
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:14,280
have I finished Step One is it time to do step two or I can't wait till Step One is finished whereas with an

167
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:19,799
adventure it's just oh I wonder what's going to happen next so there's this

168
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:25,559
curiosity this openness and this openness this

169
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:33,440
curiosity what's going to happen next instead of okay okay I'm going to check this off and go to the next step this

170
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:40,039
curiosity is what helps support this sense of being present and it also

171
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:47,159
supports this shift and relationship to our experience which is where the freedom is which is where the peace and

172
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:54,400
well-being lie with this shift in our relationship because all of us have tried to have our life turn out perfect

173
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:00,600
you know have all the Ducks lined up and I mean even if we do get them lined up

174
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:06,720
they tend to just swim away and do whatever Ducks do right they don't stay that

175
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,000
way so this idea of an adventure is like just having this curiosity what what's

176
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,320
going to happen next I'm not sure and it allows this natural unfolding of

177
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:24,159
things because often there's this way that uh

178
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:30,880
we might we want to try to control things of course we do we we want have

179
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:37,280
this idea we have this notion that okay if the Ducks were in a row then finally

180
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:43,320
I'll be happy and it'll be like this lasting reliable happiness if I could just get

181
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:49,120
these one more duck I got all these other ones and I know my life feels like

182
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:54,679
that too in some kind of way we could say just like accumulating Ducks but it just seemed like there was endless

183
00:19:54,679 --> 00:20:00,559
always needed more always needed at least one more and then oh no two more

184
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:09,120
then you know on it goes so this idea of

185
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:15,400
um having a I'm sorry I just kind of like lost uh

186
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,799
the train I was on there I looked at my notes and my notes have something completely different

187
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:28,159
here um I was talking what was that you were

188
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:34,600
adventuring I was adventuring thank you I was talking about this idea now I

189
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:40,400
remember uh about wanting a sense of control so in some ways we do prefer

190
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:47,880
like this sense of a journey but I mean we all because it's seems like it would be predictable and

191
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:54,159
reliable and that it's going to lead us to where we want to go but we can also

192
00:20:54,159 --> 00:21:01,440
remember this idea of you know I'm sure all of us as children for me that's what comes up with this idea of Adventure and

193
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,919
I was remembering I think it's true that uh I think Disneyland has something it's

194
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:12,559
called a California Adventure right this yeah right so this is something that you know you want to

195
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:19,880
go on and I said to myself California Journey that sounds like a history class

196
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:25,520
you know it doesn't sound like the same doesn't have the same sense of you know

197
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:33,080
what what's going to happen here so we like having this sense of control

198
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:38,200
but the truth of the matter is we don't

199
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:44,679
control we don't control nearly what we think we do as much as we think we do

200
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:51,120
all of us know this I was just telling this little business about ducks right that's just a good example the Ducks are

201
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,159
swimming away or doing whatever they want to do and in the Buddhist language

202
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:04,760
we would say that things are arising because of causes and conditions we're tired during

203
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:10,320
meditation there's Myriad of reasons it could be maybe we just don't have enough

204
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:18,200
sleep maybe we ate a lot maybe we feel really warm or maybe the mind doesn't

205
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:26,640
really want maybe it touched into something it's not quite ready to be with yet so it's a way to distract or

206
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:33,320
not be present for something or I mean there's maybe we have took

207
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:38,840
some medication it has as a side effect to sleepiness right maybe we don't even

208
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:45,840
know but there's some physiological reason maybe we're getting sick sometimes we feel tired I know I start

209
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,960
to feel tired as a sign that I'm like headed towards some

210
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:58,600
illness there's so many causes and conditions that we don't even know and we don't control so things arise

211
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:05,760
due to causes and conditions we don't control them we aren making things happen in the

212
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:11,360
way that we think we are so in some ways the truth of the

213
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:18,120
matter is it is an adventure we're trying to turn it into a journey but it

214
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:24,640
is an adventure in the sense that it's not we're going to go from step one to step two to step three and arrive

215
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:31,159
exactly where we want to go even let's say you are going to drive to San Jose and maybe this this is a commute that

216
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:38,919
you do regularly or something like this it's not always the same the traffic isn't the

217
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:45,640
same the what you're if you're listening to the radio that's not the same the thoughts that you're having isn't the

218
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:51,480
same the mood that you're having isn't the same it's never exactly the

219
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,919
same you might have like a brilliant idea one day and the other one other day

220
00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:01,960
maybe you're just stewed in something I can't believe they said that and getting

221
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:07,080
stuck in that or something the truth is it's always an

222
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:14,600
adventure in some kind of way if we allow it to be and then our life you know comes has

223
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,640
some Vitality some juice to

224
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:24,919
it and maybe one thing that I'll say also is that some of you might know this

225
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:30,080
this uh there's these seven factors of Awakening these Seven Elements these

226
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,799
seven qualities that support greater peace ease and

227
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:41,840
freedom damama Vaya is one of the factors of Awakening

228
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:48,279
this often gets translated as investigation but we could also

229
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:53,520
translate it as exploration or maybe like

230
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:59,480
curiosity like just being open to what's happening so what I'm pointing to here

231
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:07,279
is a support for awakening it's not I'm I'm not just pulling this out of thin air and uh offering it to you but it's

232
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:15,080
recognized that this is what's required to find more ease and peace is

233
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,440
it's also what as I said makes our life more

234
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:28,840
interesting so there's this way in which maybe obstacles can be the ADV

235
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:34,559
Adventure being in the present moment can be an

236
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:39,960
adventure this uh even the idea of wow I

237
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:46,679
wish things were different and how they are maybe that's an adventure opening up to what's going

238
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:52,320
to happen next because things don't stay the same

239
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:59,080
we know this you don't need me to tell you this they don't stay the same and it's really amazing if present for it

240
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,679
and all the different ways in which they

241
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:12,000
change so I'd like to end with a poem this won't be surprising I'm on a kick

242
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,480
when I'm often doing this a different poet

243
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:26,799
though yeah this is a a poet it's John odonahue he's a was a Irish poet and

244
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:34,360
philosopher it's a a little bit different style but

245
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:41,120
um different style than some of the poems um I've read in the in the

246
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:48,840
past and this poem it starts off going one uh Direction and then it makes a

247
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:54,720
turn and there's a number of different things that we could pull out of this poem but

248
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:01,158
this idea of having an adventure I hope is one that will come out of

249
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:08,600
this so This is called for a new beginning by John

250
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:15,240
Oahu for A New Beginning by John O

251
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:23,600
Donahue in out of the way places of the heart where your thoughts never think to

252
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:32,399
wonder this beginning has been quite medely forming emptiness growing inside

253
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:40,120
you noticing how you welded yourself on still unable to leave what you had

254
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:47,960
outgrown it watched you play with the seduction of safety and the gray promises that

255
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:55,440
sameness whispered heard the waves of turmoil rise and relent wondered would

256
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,120
you always live like this

257
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:08,600
then the Delight when your courage kindled and out you stepped onto new

258
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:15,279
ground your eyes young again with energy and dream a path of plitude opening

259
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:21,760
before you though your destination is not yet clear you can trust the promise

260
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:28,399
of this opening unfurl yourself into the grace of beginning

261
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:35,279
that is at one with your life's desire awaken your spirit to

262
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:42,640
Adventure hold nothing back learn to find ease in Risk soon you will be home

263
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:49,440
in a new Rhythm for your soul since it's the world that awaits

264
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:57,840
you I like that this begins this poem begins in out of the way places of the

265
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:05,159
heart heart where your thoughts never think to wander it's pointing to like this the

266
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:10,320
poem is called a new beginning but there's some way in which Adventure is a

267
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:15,720
new beginning it's like a a beginning again

268
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:22,480
and thoughts are kind of the way in which we're trying to solve something we're trying to fix something we're

269
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,760
which is important we need to do that but there's a part of our life that

270
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:34,360
isn't n about solving isn't about fixing isn't about

271
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:41,600
planning it's about opening to it's about unfurling allowing

272
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:52,120
ourselves to unfurl in whatever way that means for you this opening this allowing this

273
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:57,840
unfolding and I would say that this idea of Adventure it feels like an adventure

274
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:03,480
to to allow something to unfold or unfurl to not control it to trust that

275
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:11,080
it knows how to do this unfolding and then there's this line in

276
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:17,919
here this expression learn to find ease in Risk because this is what Adventure

277
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:24,000
includes right is risk but this is what a beginning is is

278
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,679
going into some unchartered territory this going into places maybe we haven't

279
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:36,000
been having new thoughts having new ideas having new relationships to

280
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,399
experiences maybe the experiences are exactly the same we have the same job s

281
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:47,320
same life situation same whatever is happening but something new in the way

282
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:54,880
we're looking at it that new way in which we are experiencing it or a new frame of

283
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:02,720
reference in which we're looking at it and that is the adventure like oh what

284
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:11,519
what if I look at it from this perspective I always thought of myself as uh somebody who uh could just figure

285
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:18,639
everything out myself and I'm making this up well maybe it is true for myself

286
00:31:18,639 --> 00:31:25,559
too I kind of had this idea like okay I can figure this out I don't need no stinking nobody I can figure this out

287
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:32,840
you know in some kinds of ways this shows up up but then to realize oh actually

288
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:39,840
there's something in relationship to other people that we learn about ourselves that we learn about Humanity

289
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:46,519
that can only be done with others and so then to start to see some

290
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:52,080
of our experiences oh I wonder what this would be like if um I were to work with

291
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:57,559
this on this with somebody else or if I were to share this with somebody else or

292
00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:05,440
if I were to look at it from how somebody else might look at it just bring this as an

293
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,679
example like the exact same life situation but to maybe do something a

294
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:15,799
little bit different or consider it from a different vantage

295
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,360
point so this learning to find ease and risk like learning to do something that

296
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:30,760
isn't step one step two step three we need these step one twos and threes as well sometimes right to solve uh

297
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:36,559
problems but life isn't only about

298
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:44,919
this and I think the life that we are hoping to have it's full of Vitality and

299
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:53,480
that has a a richness and a depth to it which includes ease and Peace and

300
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:58,158
Freedom is an adventure

301
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:05,120
and maybe it's as simple as using that language thinking about okay let's turn this into an

302
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:10,960
adventure I'm not exactly sure how this is going to go and maybe that alone just

303
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:19,639
different language is something that can allow something new to arise that can be a support for you and your

304
00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:26,919
life so a journey or an adventure I don't know right now today

305
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:33,679
I'm feeling this idea like this idea of Adventure there might be another time I'm like no it's in a journey and we have to have some perseverance and you

306
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:41,880
know I've given those kinds of talks too but right now I I like this idea of an adventure idea of an

307
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:47,760
adventure so with that I'll close and open it up to see if there's some

308
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:54,840
questions or some comments for you what's the difference between a journey and an adventure or maybe there's an

309
00:33:54,840 --> 00:34:02,720
adventure you've been on recently that uh you'd like to share so yes so back

310
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:13,040
here so if Enlightenment is I mean the Buddhist says freedom from suffering

311
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:19,519
right would that be the end destination of the

312
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:27,560
adventure yes yeah no more suffering so then I mean so after that

313
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:33,398
like like I don't know I mean no more suffering ever it can't even bother you

314
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:39,358
it can't touch you I mean that's just you're just there right I mean I don't know is that what it

315
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:45,679
is it's not being pushed around by greed hatred or delusion it's like meeting

316
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:50,760
whatever is happening but maybe uncomfortable but it's not suffering

317
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:57,720
it's like oh ouch uh and responding appropriately like meeting each moment

318
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:02,960
fully completely without hiding and with

319
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,839
ease so it's it's not uh being I like this expression I heard somebody use

320
00:35:08,839 --> 00:35:15,520
recently it's not being a bliss blob just you know disconnected and uh different from the world it's

321
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:22,078
just meeting the world fully and doing what needs to be done

322
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:35,760
and can you say a little more about this falling asleep

323
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:42,200
mindfully I mean I would love to do this experiment but it's so counterintuitive because I do the

324
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:48,960
opposite I I let my attention go so how how does how do you do it well this was

325
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:56,200
never intentional and for all I know maybe it was a dream so maybe I should uh but I this was on a retreat where so

326
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:05,200
I had a lot of momentum I spent quite some time you know many many hours a day for many days and uh just I

327
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:11,319
noticing that uh like oh sleep

328
00:36:11,319 --> 00:36:16,800
is like some there was like some kind of like a like a type of Letting

329
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:22,359
Go and yet there was some awareness of that letting go

330
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:29,920
so maybe I'm making this up and it wasn't to mindfulness and to uh sleep but I I I know there's uh like some

331
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:36,280
Buddhist Traditions that talk about this lucid dreaming I wouldn't say I've have this lucid dreaming nor have I aspired

332
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:42,280
to or tried it but I don't know is that helpful so so you have some some

333
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:46,799
awareness and and you hang on to the awareness a little

334
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:54,240
longer so I just talked about language I'll use language a little bit different here it's not like I'm hanging onto

335
00:36:54,240 --> 00:37:00,240
awareness it's like there's like there's like a aess is

336
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:06,160
there have try what was that I have to try see what happens yes there you go

337
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:13,279
there you go you could go an adventure with it there you go let us

338
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:25,960
know hi hi I just wanted to quickly share just kind of

339
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:33,720
like um I think just in general like this is kind of how I've been approaching my life especially in the

340
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:40,000
last like couple to a few years um literally I've actually been like

341
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:47,359
calling it an adventure when people ask me like how I approach life um I can't

342
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:54,040
say that it makes it any easier but definitely um I I'm very strong into

343
00:37:54,040 --> 00:38:01,839
like like trusting the universe

344
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:08,920
and um almost like predetermination a little bit like things are already kind

345
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:15,880
of meant to happen meant to be like pre-written almost like a pre-birth plan

346
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:21,480
that we have some of these major life

347
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:27,920
um circumstances that we go through almost like they were pre-chosen um [Music]

348
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:33,760
so it's like I approach life in more of like a co-creation like I don't really have a

349
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:40,599
choice but I kind of help I do like I maybe think I have control over how my

350
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:46,440
life is going to go but actually it's going to go the way it's going to go which is not not in my control if that

351
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:52,760
makes sense yeah yeah and so I feel like when like no matter like I tell people a

352
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:58,160
lot all the time especially lately in the last year or two that I don't really

353
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:04,520
make decisions anymore like I just kind of not necessarily letting life

354
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:09,640
passively happen to me but in a way yeah just kind of

355
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:17,640
allowing what's happening to happen and trusting that the Universe has like a bigger picture at play that I'm not

356
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:24,319
aware of um and just not putting so much importance on my choices and decisions

357
00:39:24,319 --> 00:39:32,119
like if I feel confused about a relationship or um a job decision or something like this

358
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:38,040
um I feel like it's just an adventure like I'm just going

359
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:46,200
to and how does that make you feel to use this language of Adventure does it feel like yeah yeah I mean it definitely

360
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:52,480
helps me with the stress uh that I used to have in making decisions like I feel

361
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:58,319
I don't feel as overwhelmed anymore I actually don't really worry about it cuz I know people who like be like oh I

362
00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:05,960
don't know what job to choose job a or job B and then they'll just like worry about it incessantly for like weeks on

363
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:12,720
end or have sleepless nights over it and for me like I've learned that um the

364
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:18,720
universe will tell you if you just get quiet and listen the universe will give you signs like I'm very into

365
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:25,000
synchronicity and angel numbers and just like everything that crosses my path is

366
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,480
a sign for me um um and yeah I just like

367
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:37,280
wait until the last minute and see like what the universe is telling me and then go with my gut either

368
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:45,440
direction so um and it feels like an adventure it does exactly does that bring some uh I don't know some like I

369
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:52,119
don't excitement or juiciness to your life or not I'm not sure what uh word to

370
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:59,240
use there yeah I mean I I try to use it that way you know um for example right

371
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:06,599
now I'm going through a very um unsettling situation in my life where mold was found in my apartment and I've

372
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:13,318
been living in a motel slash out of my home for since

373
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:19,440
Halloween and so yeah it's very like un a lot of uncertainty where I'm

374
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:27,680
like oh my gosh what does my future hold I don't even know am I going to live here am I going to live somewhere else like and part of that is an ADV vure

375
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:33,599
like okay the place where I'm currently living I'm trying to look at it that way to make it

376
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:41,359
more manageable and fun to allow myself to cope better yeah cuz one thing I can

377
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:47,280
appreciate is what you're pointing to is allowing what's happening because it is

378
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:53,720
happening and this is It's astounding how often we're trying to pretend things aren't happening or trying to push that

379
00:41:53,720 --> 00:42:00,319
away so there's there's some wisdom and saying oh okay this actually is

380
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:08,040
happening mold in one's apartment and okay this this is here what what needs

381
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:13,880
to happen next or something like this yeah yeah exactly yeah and then just

382
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:19,160
kind of like think instead of like worrying more about the future sure I'm

383
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:24,280
worried of course but also I try to look at it from an adventure standpoint and

384
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:32,880
perspective of almost like I'm watching a movie like oh what's going to happen next so yeah that's just how I live my

385
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,280
life so tonight was um I I resonated with it because that's

386
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:43,880
kind of how I think great great thank you thank

387
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,039
you we have time for one more comment if somebody wants to

388
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:59,240
uh so I think it resonated a lot with what you said over there as well and uh what's interesting is that I think I

389
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:06,520
used to uh have this sort of emotion of surrender which is you're surrendering to the moment you're surrendering to what's happening in front of you and uh

390
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:12,119
you're living your life uh again not like you're not making decisions but you're at least letting the the universe

391
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:18,559
give you signs about what decisions you should be making but in some ways you're surrendering to it but I sort of I mean

392
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:23,920
to your point words can sometimes change your frame of mind so um Adventure makes

393
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:29,640
it a little more interesting than than than the surrender I mean surrender is great you're you're letting go of what

394
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:34,880
you what you are thinking what you uh have to make decisions on Etc but uh I

395
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:41,160
think the adventure makes it a little more interesting so that was uh that was fascinating today and uh talking about

396
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:48,079
science there's one of the my favorite books is The Alchemist uh which is Al about ens and the SS so if you ever get

397
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:52,920
a chance you should read that one yeah okay there you

398
00:43:53,720 --> 00:44:01,240
go okay so may your joury J home tonight not be an adventure just straight

399
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:10,880
forward find your way home in a nice way good night thank you thank you
