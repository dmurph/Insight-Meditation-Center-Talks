1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:07,480
uh good morning to uh many of you good afternoon Scotland and

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:13,639
uh London and um yeah happy to

3
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:18,920
uh to practice with you very sweet seeing the

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,600
uh chat

5
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:33,480
community okay um let's uh let's practice together

6
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,960
one way of talking about uh duka usually rendered as suffering is

7
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:32,560
that um life is

8
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,960
um a little bit too much at

9
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,640
least often too

10
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:55,439
much a little overwhelming just to to be

11
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,560
human and so in meditation it's just a

12
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,560
way of doing much much

13
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:28,760
less being open to how life flows through us

14
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:46,360
settling and tranquilizing so that we can uh

15
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,480
meet life as it flows through

16
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,480
so relaxing whatever can be

17
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:17,040
relaxed area around your

18
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:32,080
eyes be so much tension just in uh unconsciously

19
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:37,400
in muscles around the eyes

20
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,879
your

21
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,400
jaw softening releasing thing

22
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:43,880
so my friend uh Pam Dun says just let your whole face fall Ah

23
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,160
And your shoulders hang loosely

24
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:49,440
hey wherever your shoulders hang after a deep

25
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:55,160
breath just let them Rest there

26
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,120
your belly be

27
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,280
soft

28
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,759
any subtle tension or

29
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:55,240
holding bracing in your belly soften amen

30
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,840
if you're sitting just

31
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:57,960
letting your hips pelvis sink into the ground

32
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:53,240
your feet be open your hands be open

33
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:15,399
sense that uh energy can run through unimpeded

34
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,560
and now that which we already know how to

35
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,240
do

36
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,720
breathe becomes

37
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,560
uh objective

38
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,600
awareness you already know how to do this

39
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,959
now we just uh delight in

40
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:24,920
aliveness simplicity life becoming simpler

41
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:45,519
there's hunger for oxygen we breathe in that's uh quite

42
00:11:53,480 --> 00:12:03,120
pleasurable the little tension builds up and then we expel

43
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:11,560
uh what's been used up that too is quite pleasurable

44
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,680
so for a few minutes just uh just enjoy Hey

45
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:44,880
In subtle ways we're embedding this um present moment within

46
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:51,079
a kind of matrix of predictions and expectations

47
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:11,279
the sense of the energy just leaning

48
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:23,319
forward sense of uh knowing thinking that we know who we'll be in the next

49
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:30,440
moment what our life will be the end of

50
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:38,240
this practice period the end of this

51
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:50,320
day the ways in which we predict uh

52
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:58,960
continuity and expect ourselves in the next moment the next moment

53
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:22,000
we practice diving into the present

54
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:29,240
moment in a subtle way as that expectation ations are

55
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,799
modeled by our

56
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:45,160
mind we prune those back by having deeper

57
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:50,200
fidelity to this mind moment

58
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:13,640
you stop predicting yourself

59
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:42,160
and samadei it's a kind

60
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:49,320
of dissolution of the predictive architecture

61
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:36,520
craving is always about one word next

62
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:49,880
usually what we envision being next is me

63
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:20,799
in meditation we

64
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,120
uh soften

65
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:43,799
the expectation that I'm next me in the next moment me

66
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:48,679
reborn exactly as I was

67
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,520
please stop making that hypothesis

68
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,440
we fall into the present moment

69
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,950
[Music]

70
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:37,159
we often associate uh

71
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:45,360
disorientation with um unpleasantness who likes getting lost

72
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:51,440
you know maybe a few people but I have never had the taste for that exactly i

73
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:57,960
associate disorientation generally speaking with

74
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:04,480
unpleasantness but here um in in dharma we actually develop some

75
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:11,440
appreciation for it and those moments when you you know

76
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,559
right after you wake up or something before you've remembered who

77
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:21,960
you are some elements of

78
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:28,960
um practice are about a climatizing to

79
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:35,520
disorientation and was alluding to that a little bit in

80
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,919
the uh the instructions and

81
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:47,799
awe awe awe this is a um beautiful

82
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:54,039
feeling pleasant but maybe a little disorienting the sense of the

83
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:59,440
mind broadening and it's like we're not

84
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:08,000
accustomed to so much space but awe is the the feeling of a

85
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,720
kind of simultaneous expansion and

86
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:21,320
contraction in you know we're like infantessimally small and

87
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:26,640
vast and there's sense of like oh yeah this smallness is partaking in the

88
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,640
vastness

89
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:38,080
this is um psychologist Decker Kilner um awe is the feeling of wonder and

90
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,240
amazement at being in the presence of something vast that transcends one's current

91
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:49,000
understanding a is part of a family of states that includes elevation appreciation and

92
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,399
admiration the majority of all experiences occur in response to nature

93
00:31:54,399 --> 00:32:00,519
other people who other people who display virtuosity or

94
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:06,480
magnanimity art and music religious experiences and ideas similar to other

95
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:12,919
pro-social emotions like gratitude and compassion a reliably predicts increased

96
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:18,120
sharing assistance and generosity

97
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:30,799
maybe you're in nature in the mountains and that kind

98
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:39,960
of stunning austerity of the world just stops you and this sense of

99
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:45,399
like I don't know time can be felt in a different

100
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:52,799
way you know it's like you just see the the the rocks and the the you know the

101
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:58,559
trees and the landscape it's just like yeah time can be

102
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:03,919
sensed or virtuosity you know I was like

103
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:10,640
saw um a video of Simone Biles doing a floor a floor floor exercise the gymnast

104
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:17,919
like the most like kind of the best gymnast in the history of the world you know and it's like and

105
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:27,000
what she was doing it was like I was really like the response was like I cannot believe we're both homo

106
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:34,399
sapiens she and I were both like the same species i was like I just felt proud to

107
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:42,440
be like part of the same species somebody who could do that it's like science

108
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:48,159
fiction you know or goodness goodness you know like

109
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,440
it's usually called moral elevation the moral beauty that we can witness that

110
00:33:53,440 --> 00:34:03,799
can fill us with awe it's a lot of it happening it doesn't get reported so much but it's

111
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:10,878
like you know I don't know much more goodness than we could

112
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:17,919
ever estimate greed hate and delusion of course must fill the pages of the the

113
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:23,839
papers um but um the amount of just simple

114
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:28,800
ordinary goodness is

115
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:36,280
staggering and awe breaks us out of um

116
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:41,398
claustrophobia i associate suffering with

117
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:50,118
claustrophobia you know and often we don't realize how small our life has

118
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:59,800
become you know and it's natural suffering is inherently

119
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:05,640
selfabsorbing you know I'd like to live

120
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:11,680
uh to live with a sense of life as a problem just puts all the focus on

121
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:20,079
what's what's in front of us you know and because the feeling of self is

122
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:28,560
a feeling of specialness it's um it's hard to treat ourselves as

123
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:35,119
just another person and so a lot of how we work with

124
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:40,680
our mind is about broadening and awe is like a sudden

125
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:46,960
dramatic broadening we learn to live in more and

126
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:54,440
more awe we develop awe for

127
00:35:54,440 --> 00:36:02,000
um the path and the lineage you know and uh there are times when you

128
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,520
know there are times when it's like oh yeah I'm a meditator d whatever then

129
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:14,240
other times where it's like the gratitude is so overwhelming that it just becomes awe

130
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:19,560
like how on earth Did

131
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:26,200
Sidartha Gautama like of Lumbini you know 600

132
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:31,960
BC speak so directly to Matthew of

133
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:40,000
California 2025 AD you know to speak words that are

134
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:47,359
relevant across space and time amazing

135
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:54,880
i remember early tastes of the path you know kind of like have shared this moment with Galen

136
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:00,720
Ferguson you know Tibetan teacher and uh after a weekend retreat on the unity of

137
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:06,240
shamata and vapasha you know the unity of um

138
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:13,320
tranquility and insight and I didn't know what was happening but you know it was kind of

139
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:21,200
like you know beginning to fall in love with the dharma and I go up to him afterwards and kind of crying and sort

140
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:28,160
of messy and trying to say something but kind of just wanting to hug him and you

141
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:34,000
know and he's a kind of a little bit buttoned up you know uh didn't know

142
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:42,720
exactly what to do with me um but he was so gracious beautiful and um you know he

143
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:48,680
just said something like yeah sometimes peering out over the vastness of the dharma

144
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:54,920
ocean can be a lot can be a lot

145
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:00,599
awareness becomes a kind of object of awe like

146
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:05,720
how close the distance from suffering to

147
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:13,960
peace might be in the lockedin feeling of duca the

148
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:19,680
claustrophobia of duca feels like well no way out of this

149
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:25,920
until I get circumstances right till I get straightened some way

150
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:32,599
and um and then we start to appreciate like wait a

151
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:40,520
second maybe there's a lot of peace much closer than my mind

152
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:48,480
suspects maybe it's just one moment

153
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:57,680
away and it's not always like that but sometimes it is and when it's like that

154
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:04,560
we say to ourselves okay I don't want to forget

155
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:13,480
this we're encouraged uh to reflect on the kind of preciousness of uh human

156
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:19,400
life awe awe we could say at having been

157
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:24,720
born and we're we're thrown into the condition of living and it feels so

158
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:30,280
self-evident that I should exist you know but it's super

159
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:37,599
wild you know it's wild there's something rather than nothing nothing says we should exist

160
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:45,359
nothing says the dharma should have been offered as I say like all all the time before

161
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:52,079
you were born plus all the time after you die is almost precisely all the time

162
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:58,920
there is and yet here we

163
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,240
are on

164
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:12,800
YouTube and wonder wonder like a sense of awe in the face of

165
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:18,040
possibility how might I live in

166
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:24,960
um existential psychotherapy the failure to grapple with uh kind of core

167
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:31,359
existential themes is thought to be produced symptoms you know lead to pain

168
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:38,320
and one of them is around uh the openness of possibility the

169
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:43,720
weight of freedom you know

170
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:51,040
how might I live and we've perhaps been too taken

171
00:40:51,040 --> 00:41:00,040
taken in by convention by all the kind of models of happiness profered by

172
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:05,839
society and everything that we consider well

173
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:13,000
this is the natural way this is customary this is the right way this is common sense

174
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,880
empty labamasa like attachment to right usually rendered as attachment to rights

175
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:24,520
and rituals which is shed at stream entry

176
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:31,119
um attachment to rights and rituals um but it's also in a deeper

177
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:37,319
sense the ways in which fidelity to

178
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:42,760
convention to making what what is empty seem

179
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:48,319
uh concrete and it's sometimes it's like oh

180
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:55,440
yeah my entire life is sila paramasa entire life is

181
00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:01,079
convention and it's not to say we should live a totally different life but we should

182
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:08,640
realize we're just making this up

183
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:15,599
totally okay how might I live and even if I do

184
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:21,000
live and I do live in adherence to

185
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,000
convention at least it looks like that but not

186
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:34,160
inside and so we recognize the groundlessness of all uh convention and

187
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:39,200
there's a lot of wonder awe how might I

188
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:51,520
live i remember at a uh at a retreat uh New Year's Eve uh a retreat

189
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:56,640
that fell over New Year's Eve and it was a couple weeks of of retreat silence are

190
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:02,160
sitting and uh and we ring in the new year with chanting and then have a

191
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:09,520
silent dance party and it's midnight or you know it's after

192
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:15,240
midnight and uh I'm sitting in a chair out in the Santa Barbara

193
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:20,880
stars and some of the light from those stars you know looking up you can see a

194
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:27,440
lot it was it was a good night and uh knowing that I'm looking at

195
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:35,839
some stars that are now gone you know literally looking at the past and amidst the the vastness of

196
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:43,800
space and time i remember thinking like "Oh my good like here I am this like

197
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:50,640
unimaginable vastness and I'm worried about my butt hurting from

198
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:56,800
sitting you know hard hard to take uh much seriously

199
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:05,280
amidst the vastness but as the self grows smaller

200
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:13,160
the world gets much bigger the less clinging the more

201
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:19,560
life the less clinging the more life and then there's

202
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:25,359
uh a lot of love a lot of joy a lot of

203
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:31,200
cheerfulness you know to

204
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:38,240
uh sense into that openness maybe we call it the openness

205
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:46,119
of life sense how vast the love might be

206
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,359
so we we live in some sense of

207
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:59,160
awe we actually don't acclimatize to it

208
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,880
totally is not old

209
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:11,520
hat uh for this uh for your consideration yeah sweet to uh to be

210
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:21,480
