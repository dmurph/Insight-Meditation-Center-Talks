1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:07,840
good evening welcome nice to see you all in this

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:15,000
windy rainy day makes us happy I think that it rains

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,560
after having gone through that drought makes me

4
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,920
happy so I don't know if we need to turn on the recording or if

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:32,680
that's thank you Jim so I'm going to continue on this series

6
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:39,640
of talks talking about like efforting or making something happen or determination

7
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,000
resolve you know these types of things and uh I'm touching into some of the

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,160
lists and stories that aren't so commonly spoken about they're definitely in there in the suit as I'm pulling them

9
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:58,000
out of there but uh not as often spoken about and in some subsequent talks I'll

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,640
talk about some of the dangers of what I'm talking about but I'm not there yet so right now we're just going to talking

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:11,280
about uh you know just this movement towards an aspiration we have or we have

12
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:19,360
an inspiration and then how do we carry through and what are the things that get in the way and how can we find our way

13
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:26,240
through to what's important to us what's meaningful to us so I'll say very briefly that um I

14
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,479
started this series talking about the five factors of endeavoring

15
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:37,399
and those five factors are confidence Vitality Integrity energy and

16
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:42,759
wisdom and then I talked about uh the next week I did a talk on setting an

17
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:49,280
aspiration and then having this resolve to go pursue that

18
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,000
aspiration and I did that with the story of Prince bod who didn't want to make

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,240
any effort towards uh doing something that was important to him and said he was hoping that the Buddha would make

20
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,880
all the effort and uh that didn't work out so well for Prince

21
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,879
B and then uh last week I talked about well why don't we do these things that

22
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:19,920
we set out to do we really want to our heart toci set on them set on them it's meaningful for us and why don't do we

23
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,480
and I pointed out another quality that the Buddha talked about Ki which can be

24
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,560
translated both as tolerance and as patience because the reason why we don't

25
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:39,760
do things it's hard and it takes time it's not a secret come to find out

26
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,440
we're I think we're all kind of secretly opening right that there'll be hoping that there'll be some secret teaching

27
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,239
that'll make a difference but even just this idea of County tolerance and

28
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:59,239
patience just to cultivate it in really small mundane everyday settings this is

29
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:07,760
exactly how how it gets cultivated we don't wait until the really hard stuff arrives instead we start where it's easy

30
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:14,920
we always start where it's easy like why not that's the best way to go

31
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:20,959
forward so tonight I'm going to start with um a little story a brief story and

32
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,000
this is with h bad waja who the farmer Cassi Brad

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:34,599
waa and this was the first day of of the um of the planting season this was the

34
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:39,920
time of year when they were going to plant and Casi Brad waja is a Brahman

35
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:47,959
he's a priest in this brahmanical tradition and was doing a big like festival and ritual and all these things

36
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:54,519
to for to start the season of planting makes sense right if you're the

37
00:03:54,519 --> 00:04:01,040
kind of the whole Community depends on the crops surviving it's not like they

38
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:08,640
can import easily from other places where they didn't have this Logistics that we have today so a

39
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,120
lot of importance on having the crops work so there of course there were these

40
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,479
uh festivals at the first day and so here's a description of the

41
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:25,720
festival that comes like 800 years after the time of the Buddha and they're like

42
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:33,520
filling in the details but I I kind of like this uh so there's this Festival there was

43
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:40,280
3,000 oxen were present this is a lot we don't have to take the numbers

44
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:46,440
literally in uh in the sutas and uh certainly in Polly there's not as much

45
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:52,400
emphasis on Precision there's more emphasis on just big bigger biggest you

46
00:04:52,400 --> 00:05:00,360
know and so 3,000 is a big number so 3,000 oxen and all their horns were kept

47
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,960
with gold and their Hooves were kept with silver and they were adorned with

48
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:12,240
fragrant garlands so they put the decorations on the o and I like this it

49
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,680
brings a nice uh image to mind you know for this festival and then there were

50
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:24,560
500 people and all of them were wearing clean white clothes and they also were

51
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:32,080
wearing garlands and were garnished with had some flowers and Kasi bradan he was

52
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:38,560
the head uh priest and he was going to lead the festival so he took a bath it's

53
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:46,199
so funny that this is in the details right he took a bath trimmed his beard and anointed himself with fragrant

54
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:52,960
scents so I got all dressed up I'm I'm sure this is before right they

55
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,120
have all that stuff but um he had two rings on each finger so he had 20 rings

56
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:04,919
and he was wearing earrings he had had a turban on his head a Garland around his neck I'm not sure I think these garlands

57
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:12,360
are made out of flowers but they also might be made out of wooden beads I'm not sure and then um he does this ritual

58
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:18,520
with uh milk and rice and then he offers this milk and rice to the 500 people

59
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:26,840
that are about to take the 3,000 oxen and start the season so a lot of people

60
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:32,479
a lot of animals this is a big and you can imagine how much effort it went into

61
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:41,120
to prepare for something like this I don't know if they literally had gold and silver and but clearly just time to

62
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:49,160
decorate or you know the animals and oneself so as it happens that the Buddha

63
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,400
was nearby and he had this sense that uh

64
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,319
maybe this Cassy bradaa he could find some more freedom

65
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,680
so he approaches and as if he's on Ms so

66
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:12,919
here's this person who just did this big ritual and this festival and he's feeding all these people sees the Buddha

67
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:18,000
he's just wearing robes and has a bowl right and is looking for a

68
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:26,560
meal and um Cas bread W is a little bit uh irked about the Buddha and he

69
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:34,680
says I plow and sew you know sew seeds to plant I plow and sew aesthetic so

70
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:42,000
he's just calling the Buddha aesthetic like just this generic word you're somebody who is just like a

71
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:51,440
Wanderer I plow in so athetic and having plowed and sewn I eat you too must plow

72
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:57,840
and sew and having plowed and S you can eat saying like there is no free ticket

73
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:04,680
here that uh you have to do the work and it's we reap the benefits of the work

74
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:10,960
that we've done so just like Brad Wan he thinks the Buddha should do the same and

75
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,400
the Buddha replies I too Brahman plow and SE and

76
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:24,199
having plowed and sewn I eat and then uh the Brahman says but we

77
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:29,919
don't see your Yol your plow your oxen like where's if you're really a farmer

78
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:37,000
where's why aren't you participating in this festival and where's all your implements and animals and things like

79
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,320
this so then um Brad waja he uh decides okay I'm going to speak in verse and

80
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:52,399
this happens a lot in the suas when there's like an important conversation happening it often shows up in verse so

81
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:58,320
whether they actually spoken verse or whether this event actually ever happened of course I don't know but so

82
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:05,880
here's a W what he says to the Buddha you claim to be a farmer but we

83
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,000
do not see your plowing tell us about your plowing so that we can understand

84
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,320
your farming okay how do you farm without plowing and then the Buddha he gives a

85
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:25,160
number of different descriptions of how he does it I'm not going to talk about all of those maybe at a future time I

86
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:31,120
will I want to focus on this one stanza where the Buddha

87
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:41,399
says maybe I should say that um he the Buddha says that he plows with wisdom so

88
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:47,360
his blade is wisdom that like cuts through things and I'll unpack that a little bit more in a minute here but

89
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:55,560
Buddha says energy or effort is my Beast of Burden carrying one towards security

90
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:02,519
from bondage it goes ahead without turning back to where one does not

91
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:08,839
sorrow so he's saying energy is my Beast of

92
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:17,279
birden so of course a beast of burden that's like an oxen something that's like pulling something that's heavy or

93
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:24,240
carrying something that's heavy so the Buddha he's like saying just as the

94
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:31,440
Brahman paraja just as he is using an oxen and he has this blade that's like

95
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:38,720
breaking up the Earth like tilling the earth I guess and then this blade when it goes

96
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,560
through it uh like severs these the networks of the all the roots of the

97
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:52,440
weeds or whatever is growing there so the way that he's tilling it and so the Buddha is saying in the same way he has

98
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:58,320
this plow of wisdom so the blade is wisdom but rather than having oxen

99
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,880
carrying the blade blade it's effort energy or effort that's allowing

100
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,200
this blade to go through and rather than severing all the roots of the of the

101
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:17,600
weeds it's severing the defilements these are roots of unskillful behavior

102
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:25,839
unskillful things in the mind and then the so energy is my beast

103
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,000
of burden and I try not to think of the rolling stone song when I hear this

104
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,839
right do you guys think of [Laughter] this and then the second line is a

105
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:45,480
carrying one toward security from bondage and so we could say that nabana

106
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:53,760
Awakening is the security from bondage like what are those things that hold us back what are the things that we get

107
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:59,240
tied up with or that uh push us around

108
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:07,959
you know that kind of this idea of bondage is like something that's preventing you from doing what you want to do so you have security from Bond so

109
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:13,560
nothing standing in the way can do whatever you

110
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:22,120
want so this no longer being pushed around by our incessant desires or these

111
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:27,680
uh things that trying to get away from something or or the concerns that we

112
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:34,279
have we want to look good or we want to feel comfortable all the time no longer being pushed around by all

113
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:42,279
that and the third line is it goes ahead without turning back so the Buddha is

114
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:47,959
describing his plow goes ahead without turning back and this is in contrast to

115
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:53,440
of course like the Brahman right reaches the end of the field it has to turn around it has to turn around and goes

116
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,959
back and forth and then of course next season has to do it all over again however many growing Seasons there are

117
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:07,800
in a year but it has to be done repeatedly but this uh this plow of

118
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:13,199
wisdom something that I appreciate very much the Buddha saying it only goes

119
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:18,240
forward it's not like you regress with our practice we're going

120
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:25,000
forward it's true we have some insights we have some new understandings which we totally forget later and then we learn

121
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,279
them again but that's different than going

122
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:35,880
backwards there are times in which uh we don't have access to our greatest wisdom

123
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:42,399
or maybe we um are under a lot of stress or illness or something and we don't

124
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:48,519
have our full capacities but this path goes

125
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:54,759
forward it never goes backwards I don't know I this is like

126
00:13:54,759 --> 00:14:02,120
such an obvious thing but for me it feels um I know meaningful that each whatever

127
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:08,959
we're doing for practice whether it's just one moment of mindfulness or listening to a Dharma talk or um

128
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:14,759
behaving ethically or having some Compassion or kindness for others it's

129
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:21,040
always supporting this movement towards greater Freedom always always it's

130
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:30,600
always going forward and it's always talk and what's also being spoken about here is this

131
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:37,160
irreversibility of some experiences that we've had or even

132
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:42,959
some attainments that we've had specifically the Buddha here is talking about you know some degrees of Awakening

133
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:49,360
or insights like once that happens you can't go back and the way

134
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,560
that I think about this is kind of like once you've learned to read you can't unlearn how to read unless you know

135
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:01,040
there's some Dementia or something like this that's happening so the same

136
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,440
way and then the last line to where to where one does not

137
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:11,839
sorrow in some ways this is all what we what we all want right to not have

138
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:17,079
sorrow and again this is pointing to nabana

139
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:23,600
Awakening so this idea that wisdom is the blade and energy is what is helping

140
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:30,560
this blade go forward so rather than oxen it's energy or effort

141
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,720
one thing I'll say is that um oxen often

142
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:41,600
not always are like there's two or four or six there's a number of them and

143
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:48,519
something that I appreciate about this is that the same way energy sometimes we're with others and maybe our energy

144
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:55,199
is low and theirs is high and we can borrow some of their energy or maybe there's a way just like in the same way

145
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:01,480
that we practice here together being with others Maybe you sit a little longer than you would if you were at

146
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:07,360
home or pay more attention or do something differently when you're with

147
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:14,160
others so there's a way that doing things with others can be a tremendous support it's not always a support

148
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:20,480
sometimes we have to do things on our own also but there can be a way when we talk about energy or effort there can be

149
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:27,720
this real sense of like I have to do this I must do this but I don't think we

150
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:33,120
should ever underestimate the power of practicing with others what a big

151
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:42,360
support it is for whatever it is we're doing with our practice or wherever we are in our practice or however we feel a

152
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:48,560
practice so this idea of energy moving forward Viria is the word sometimes

153
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:54,839
translated as effort how do we keep this energy

154
00:16:54,839 --> 00:17:02,199
going how do I keep this effort going we might have some initial inspiration

155
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:07,760
something or aspiration that really motivates us but what can continue to

156
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:13,280
motivate us and especially after like it's gotten

157
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,600
difficult or it's gotten tedious or it's gotten boring or you know just so many

158
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:26,839
reasons or maybe something else turned out to be more interesting and just kind of our enthusiasm has petered

159
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:34,039
out so I'd like to talk about another list of course right there's no shortage

160
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:39,360
of a list that uh gets interpreted so many

161
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:46,000
different ways um partly because um it's one of those it's amazing the word this

162
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,480
word is really really long I tried to memorize it before I

163
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:58,880
came over here let's see if I got it it's Chanda Samar padana Sankara Sam G

164
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,600
that's one word has like 40 some odd letters in it

165
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:11,559
right it's it's a so what it is it's a number of words that are stuck together but so

166
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:17,919
because it's such a long word and which has all these different parts and it's not clear how these different parts are

167
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:23,000
related to one another that there's a lot of different interpretations on what

168
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:30,320
does this really mean and it's never explained anywhere in the suit do it's just this

169
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:36,760
so I uh recently heard a talk by a dma teacher James Barz maybe some of you

170
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:43,440
know him he teaches in Berkeley wonderful teacher and he uh interpreted

171
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:50,360
this in a way that I think is really fun and interesting and helpful and relevant

172
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:57,320
to what we're talking about here so this word that uh I I gave one

173
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:05,080
of them is uh it's a collection of these four qualities I'll call them

174
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:12,320
qualities and um The Collection itself is called the idiotas there's lots of different ways

175
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,960
this word idipa gets translated roads to

176
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:24,640
success bases of power foundations of potency you know

177
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:30,240
you can ity and pot these two words get together

178
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:36,039
and some people some teachers some Scholars related specifically to uh the

179
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:42,960
cultivation of somebody some collectedness but others don't and James

180
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,679
Barz he applies it to motivation what is

181
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:55,080
it that motivates us what is it that uh keeps us going when we really don't feel

182
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:02,000
like going and what he did which I think is really interesting he says that these four idas we could

183
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,200
maybe understand them as four temperaments there's four different

184
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:13,320
things that can motivate people and some people tend to be motivated this way and

185
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:18,559
some tend to be motivated that way with this recognition that if we understand

186
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:24,600
this about ourselves then we can really protect and

187
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:32,320
cultivate this little flame of motivation what what supports this motivation in

188
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:38,080
ourselves and I appreciate that Maria papova she's a

189
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:46,440
writer she wrote We are each born with a Wilderness of possibility within us who

190
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:53,960
we become depends on how we tend to our inner Garden so James BRZ is poting to Let's

191
00:20:53,960 --> 00:21:02,080
tend to our inner garden and part of the way we do that is to recognize for ourselves which one of these

192
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,960
iipas is the way that uh our motivation shows

193
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:16,080
up so the first one is Chanda so it's Chanda Samar padana

194
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:23,520
Sankar Chanda this can be translated as Zeal or

195
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:30,159
enthusiasm so somebody who has this is kind of a wave their orientation or their temperament has this Spirit of

196
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:35,400
Adventure like okay let's just go for it let's just do it let's jump in you know

197
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:41,919
they kind of have this uh feeling like all right let's just go they're like

198
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:48,320
inspired or on fire with like yeah okay whatever we're gonna just do it maybe

199
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:55,080
maybe that Nike uh logo let's do it and some people maybe they feel this way

200
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:02,159
about teams some of their sport teams like their you know this tremendous fans and they just have all this enthusiasm

201
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:08,279
and go yay and are really supporting the team or learn everything about the team

202
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:15,559
or whatever it might be so this is Chanda or maybe for some people this

203
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:22,360
they have this enthusiasm for being outside going for walks hanging out in

204
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:29,600
nature or maybe they have Chanda for a particular cause maybe they have some activism they do or there's a cause at

205
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:36,600
something that's really important for them and I know for me I had I certainly

206
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:42,440
had this Chanda this Zeal or enthusiasm at the beginning when I first discovered

207
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:49,880
this practice I felt like wow it really spoke to me some kind of way and I had

208
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:55,840
this like voracious appetite to learn about it and to practice and explore and

209
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:01,720
maybe some of you had the same too when you first encountered these teachings or this

210
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:07,360
practice so Chanda Zeal or enthusiasm and we could

211
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,480
all of us we could just have this query where do we have that in our life do we

212
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:20,960
have this enthusiasm or Zeal is there a way that we can nurture it whether it's

213
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:28,080
for our spiritual life or our um Dharma practice for anything in our life if

214
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:35,240
it's worthwhile to really acknowledge and honor that this kind of this uplift

215
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:40,679
Vitality these different words we could use for Zeal

216
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:46,600
enthusiasm the second idip is Viria

217
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:52,960
energy this word Viria shows up in so many lists and in so many ways it's a

218
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,400
little bit different so in this way

219
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:05,360
there's this uh way that we might sometimes ver gets translated as perseverance and that's kind of the

220
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:11,520
slant I'm going to take here so maybe there's a way in which there's like some

221
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:17,000
determination or this uh resolve like it's not through enthusiasm but it's

222
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,600
like okay I started and I'm going to finish even though this I don't maybe

223
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:28,039
I've lost uh enthusiasm for it but you know I started it so I'm going to finish

224
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:34,279
so there's this coming from this maybe this inner strength of or this sense of

225
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:42,960
it's important to finish things that we start this way of being undet

226
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,120
undeterred and there's this way I could say for me the way that this uh shows up

227
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:53,919
is when I'm on Long Retreats I've done Retreats that have been months long I've quite a few Retreats that are months

228
00:24:53,919 --> 00:25:00,279
long it's just natural after been there for you know quite some time you're like

229
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:06,360
really am I still here there's just like oh my gosh I

230
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:12,200
can't believe it there's still two more months or you know something like this this just arises of course it

231
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:17,720
does but there's this sense okay no I started this I'm going to finish I'll

232
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:24,039
find my way through this and even though right now I'm feeling completely unmotivated doesn't mean I will always

233
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:30,080
be unmotivated and I'm just going to go to the next it or you know whatever is

234
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:36,000
needed maybe sometimes what's needed is to go for a walk in nature and feel

235
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,640
booed and nourished that way so is there a way that there can be

236
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:50,720
like a commitment maybe commitment to practice or just this sense of okay I

237
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:57,679
started I'm going to finish this uh resolve or determination so that's the second for

238
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:05,000
for some people that's the way that they're built I know somebody who's very much like this and it's really

239
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,320
impressive they just have this kind of like this doggedness like nope I'm going

240
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:16,120
I'm no matter what and I can be that about certain things there's a way of kind of like just putting my head down

241
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:21,840
and going you know just getting it done and it's not always the wisest thing to

242
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:27,679
do but is there a way that we can think about ourselves when do we have that s

243
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:33,919
sense of determination can we honor that respect that and maybe even cultivate it allow

244
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:44,200
that little flame of determination to Glow brightly flame Bri flame

245
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:51,120
brightly the third idipa is chitta and many of you know that this

246
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:59,399
word can be pronoun uh translated either mind or heart they didn't make a distinction between mind and heart in uh

247
00:26:59,399 --> 00:27:07,039
the time of the Buddha and I like that James Barz for this he's done this when you've been

248
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:13,200
touched by the Dharma like you've fallen in love with the Dharma like it's touched something inside of you there's

249
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:21,480
like something resonating with it where this um maybe and it

250
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:29,279
um can like fuel this intense desire for like freedom for more or like this it

251
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:35,840
often happens after you've had a flicker or a glimmer or a glimpse of

252
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:43,919
something some more ease some more peace some more quiet some more freedom that

253
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:50,760
you didn't know existed until you started practicing and that certainly has been

254
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:57,320
the case for me this is reason why I went on these long Retreats is because there was something that I just felt

255
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:04,039
like like U I don't know I had like touched into I had like a little glimpse of something

256
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:12,159
and I couldn't even necessarily articulated clearly but this uh this wish to okay I

257
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:18,760
I want to go this direction not even quite sure exactly

258
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:24,080
what it was and I would say in my role as a Drama teacher and a retreat teacher

259
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:29,360
now I see this a lot in students that go on retreat because they have touched

260
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:35,440
into something and they want to find their way towards that and of course

261
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:42,600
this can get in our way too if we're trying to recreate an experience we had earlier so instead of this wish to

262
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:49,880
recreate exactly what we had before maybe to focus in instead on the desire

263
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:55,480
the the the

264
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:01,720
wish for to touch that again so instead of focusing on that

265
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:08,200
thing out there again it's about focusing on oh this this uh energy here

266
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:14,799
this desire for it and then you might say but wait aren't aren't the Buddhists

267
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:23,399
supposed to be down on desire are they not supposed to like desire and um somebody did ask Anand

268
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:30,880
this exact question wait is there to be desire but uh you talk about uh the

269
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:39,320
Freedom From Desire as nabana and then Anand said in response venerable sir is it true that

270
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:45,480
you had this desire to go to the park but then when you got to the park

271
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:51,360
that desire no longer was there and the person said yes and he said it's the

272
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:58,519
same with this with all these ity poas did you have enthusiasm to go go to the park and

273
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:05,360
when you arrived there the enthusiasm is no longer there and same With chitta This Heart

274
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:12,480
felt uh wish to go this desire to go so these are things

275
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:18,159
that help us along our path but as we're finding more and more freedom they just they're not there they're not needed

276
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:25,159
anymore and they just naturally fall away they're not an impediment well they can be an impediment but they don't have

277
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:31,600
to be de facto and then the fourth one this

278
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:37,320
four via which is we could uh translate as

279
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:44,159
investigation or curiosity like this way of like wow I

280
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:50,720
had no idea that this was all going on in my mind before until I started meditating right I think this is the

281
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:57,679
first Insight that everybody has as soon as you start a meditation practice you start to see like oh my gosh I tried to

282
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:04,960
stay on the breath but my mind was going everywhere it turned out not to be so easy and there can be this way of like

283
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,399
well what else is happening in there what's going on and can be this

284
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:17,840
curiosity or this wish to explore or investigate one's inner life the mental

285
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:24,919
inner life and the emotional inter life in this sense of wow this is

286
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:30,279
fascinating maybe like in a way that uh you go to a museum natural history

287
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:37,080
museum for example like wow I had no idea look at this so it's not so much that we have to

288
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:43,480
figure it out and we're trying to solve a big problem it's just like going to

289
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:49,279
the museum it's like it's uh interesting and

290
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:56,840
fun to be sure the things that we discover in our inner life some of them are not all fun some of them are rather

291
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:05,559
dis disappointing really I don't want to be like that right we discover our

292
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:11,760
impatience we discover our ill will we discover our how our mind is going to

293
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,919
all these different places that's okay we practice with that

294
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:26,080
we practice wherever you are whatever is going on practice meets us exactly where we

295
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:33,360
are and maybe I'll say for me this uh studying the sutas and learning poly has

296
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,960
been for me it's been a big part of that I just enjoy it it's just fun and it's

297
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:45,000
uh you about practice and it makes me think about my own practice differently and it makes me think like okay how can

298
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I support others differently and gives me some new ideas and I don't know for me it's fun I'm I'm one of those one of

299
00:32:52,000 --> 00:33:01,760
those types of people so these ity poas these four OTAs Chanda Zeal or

300
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:07,200
enthusiasm the second one is Viria energy effort

301
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:13,320
perseverance third one is chitta which uh I'm emphasizing here a like being uh

302
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:19,000
the heart being touched and having this heartfelt wish or desire and the fourth

303
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,120
one is vmsa investigation or

304
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:31,480
curiosity and it might be easy to think like okay pot is I don't haven't heard about this very much it must not be very

305
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:38,760
important but it's one of the group of it's there's seven sets so there's this

306
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:46,519
uh 37 Wings to Awakening eight factors Eightfold Path

307
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:52,720
seven factors Awakening five faculties five powers for foundations of

308
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:58,399
mindfulness for great efforts I'll talk about these in a later talk and four

309
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:03,480
iipas all of these are required for awakening according to the Buddhist

310
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:09,240
teaching so it's there in this list of things that are to help us support this

311
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:13,919
movement towards nibana towards greater and greater

312
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:20,919
freedom idas and with that I'll end and open it

313
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:28,878
up to see if there's some questions or comments

314
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:47,240
hi uh could you discuss the third ity po somehow that is kind of eluding me

315
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:54,240
what yeah I'm trying to do a little slide of hand with it and hoping that you're not noticing but you did notice

316
00:34:54,240 --> 00:35:00,480
so CH this so mind or heart gets translated

317
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:08,359
I'm putting towards heart and so just a something that uh like the heart's

318
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:16,240
desire you know something that um let's see like this way you just fall

319
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,400
in love with the Dharma or falling in love with

320
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:27,160
practice or something like that and this is something that can provide energy

321
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:31,240
like can help us like continue or go

322
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,200
forward is not

323
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:52,079
helpful it's better than nothing so yeah so it it did gives a gives me a

324
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:57,520
little thing to hang on to there okay so I'll offer you another what as I said

325
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:03,359
before this these words right are so long and so many different people have interpreted them in so many different

326
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:09,880
ways I'll give you another interpretation let you can try this one on chitt this which uh can be mind or

327
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:16,760
heart and if it's mind then some people focus on awareness like just knowing

328
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:25,560
what's happening there's a way in which we just to be aware of what's Happening be present for our lives is provides

329
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:33,720
energy and a way to go forward it's a way to feel like oh I'm living my life fully I'm have awareness I'm here I'm

330
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:39,560
not uh off in uh the past or the future

331
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:46,240
but I have this awareness that's here so that's another interpretation of this third

332
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:55,680
idipa would it be fair maybe that to think of that as sort of a you've started a virtuous circle or yeah yeah

333
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,880
yeah absolutely I would say all of these are like virtuous

334
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:06,440
circles and maybe there's a little bit of enthusiasm a little bit of effort a

335
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:11,920
little bit of love and a little bit of curiosity maybe mix them all together

336
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:17,800
make a super in a cauldron and then that's what helps us uh go forward maybe

337
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:24,560
sometimes we need a little bit of this maybe sometimes a little bit of that I think we all have these inside of

338
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:30,599
us but what James Barz was poting to is that there's also ones that are more

339
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:36,240
accessible to us and that show up in other areas of our lives and he was

340
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:41,920
talking about like you know cherish these like really take care of these

341
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:49,760
temperaments is what supports us making effort and to notice them for

342
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:56,079
ourselves so maybe chitt for you isn't one maybe there's another one that is uh

343
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,920
feels more more

344
00:38:04,319 --> 00:38:10,040
accessible thank you uh so this is my first time here welcome welcome thank

345
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:15,680
you um yeah I really appreciated your talk and I've never heard of the what

346
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:23,119
what are they again the itas yes what what suta is that referenced in so

347
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:28,359
there's a whole chapter in the semaya that's called the it pot chapter so it's

348
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:33,560
I don't know do you know the the I'm I'm actually in the process of um doing the

349
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:41,200
majima study that you and Gil um uh I guess have published in the Sati yeah

350
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:48,119
Center so I'm just starting into like a more in-depth study of the sutas but um

351
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:54,200
anyway but I guess I have both a comment and a question one is that

352
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:59,560
Veria shows up in all all of the lists it seems right and so you know you were

353
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:05,359
talking about all of these different um factors or all these different kinds of

354
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:11,119
qualities but it's just interesting to me that ver as I recall is in virtually

355
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:18,160
all of them and so just it's curious to me why there's this um duplication um of

356
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:26,599
that and then also I guess for me when I think about chonda and what provides

357
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:34,040
that motivation or that prompt to just continue down the path um it occurs to me

358
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:41,359
that in my experience there's this intensely just like it's such a pleasant

359
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:47,200
experience it's like that that pleasure that's not of the senses right and once

360
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:54,599
you get a taste of that that it's that to me is what really is so

361
00:39:54,599 --> 00:40:00,079
compelling um and so you know that wasn't really mentioned in your talk but

362
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:07,079
I think it's sort of noteworthy at least in my experience to know that there's so much pleasure that one can attain

363
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:15,560
through this practice as well and that that's a big part of I guess what keeps me motivated so anyway so I just just

364
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:22,720
wanted to make that comment and also just see if you can speak to why vir is so often uh duplicated in so many of

365
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,920
these lists yeah so I'll say maybe we could have imagine that you're maybe the

366
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:34,560
pleasure is the maybe we could even say it's the chitt kind of like this desire for more you've had a taste of something

367
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,079
and uh fallen in love with it and going after it so I guess I'm the one with the

368
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:46,240
CH your something and then the reason why viia

369
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:52,960
shows up everywhere so remember this is like of course thousands of years ago and there was a lot of philosophy and

370
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:59,880
religion happening then right the conversations and some some of it was like well do the are there gods that do

371
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:05,400
everything and we're just ponds so we don't have to do anything it's all

372
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:12,200
predetermined and so the budha was emphasizing no you have to put effort you have to the gods aren't just moving

373
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:20,680
us around like ponds we have to do effort so that's why it shows up in all these lists just to recognize there not

374
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:27,200
there's no passivity just complete passivity right well and there's also this element of

375
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:32,280
like uh it's work you know yeah um but

376
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:37,520
there does seem to be sort of like a pay off at every Point as you're progressing

377
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:43,839
yeah yeah and and you it is work right because also kind of with the Buddha's not kind of what the Buddhas he is

378
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:49,200
pointing to undoing some of our patterns right and to undo a pattern

379
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:55,200
takes work right okay thank you you're welcome you're

380
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:03,200
welcome hopefully uh brief but I was trying to

381
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:11,520
understand so question and then maybe follow up but uh what was the 37 was it wings or a list of yeah so often I get

382
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:16,560
translated 37 wings of Awakening or Wings towards aw B

383
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:22,119
Pia something so it's a uh aids to Enlightenment is how it it literally

384
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:28,880
gets translated okay of which the OTAs are part of MH okay what I'm trying

385
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:34,119
to I guess understand the motivation for understanding the idas like in

386
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:39,280
particular is um yeah I'm trying to understand maybe

387
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,920
the role that they play in particular out of 37 Wings let's say but the thing

388
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:50,200
I can come up with is it sounds like they're very particular ways to

389
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:57,400
realize impermanence you know but yeah yeah I guess I'm trying to what

390
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:02,720
in particular to the OTAs or may they you know guide us to this is a great

391
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:08,839
question and it depends on who you ask because how it gets uh interpreted there

392
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:15,280
is a a legitimate way in which you can um interpret these to be about samadi

393
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:20,800
and so it could be like effort and Sami because like the Chanda

394
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:25,880
Sam well what I'm not going to go through that um it's so it could be like

395
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:31,599
just to allow the mind to get really collected or something like that and

396
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:40,480
maybe it's a concentrated effort maybe is how some people might think of the ity poas but it's fascinating how

397
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:46,760
they're never explained anywhere yet they're part of these 37 and lots of different Dharma teachers have different

398
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:53,599
ideas and most Dharma teachers don't talk about them because it's yeah it's a little not

399
00:43:53,599 --> 00:44:00,559
quite sure what to do with them starts here starts here

400
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:08,040
yes hi I'm not sure if this is I understand what you were saying more or less but I'm having a problem with

401
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:13,440
procrastination big problem with procrastination so any tips you

402
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,280
have I'd gladly

403
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:24,440
accept yeah I had something there was something just recently that I learned

404
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:28,000
about procrastination

405
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:35,520
lack of motivation yeah you know it's not it's not arising in my mind right now but I'm

406
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:42,640
going to I'll I'll look into this and I'll talk about this because right I think we all do this at some extent you

407
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:48,680
know in some settings all of us do some procrastination I think so yeah this is

408
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:54,240
a good question it's a good question but back on Monday next

409
00:44:54,240 --> 00:45:01,000
Monday and I'm trying to think like um but even like something like this uh

410
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:08,960
could help too like well what is it that gives us energy and can we tap into that to just notice what types of

411
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:14,000
things motivate us is there anything that motivates us you know anything in

412
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,720
our life and is there a way what can we learn from that and can we borrow some

413
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:25,640
of the energy from whatever else um motivates us but this is a legitimate

414
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:30,920
question procrastination the Buddha didn't talk about this in particular well he did talk about

415
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:37,440
practicing with urgency with a sense of urgency but I'm sorry I don't have

416
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:45,640
anything right off the top of my head that's specific about it thank you okay so we're at the end of our time

417
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:52,599
together so you're welcome to come up and talk to me if you have some more questions otherwise I wish you safe

418
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:58,119
travels home and enjoy the rain than

419
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,920
