86
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:42,120
moment the inspiration aspiration can I sit just a little more

87
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,240

88
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:52,880

90
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:09,240
on we're all cheering each other with heart with kindness

91
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,279
i allow my heart to be brightened just a little bit even if

92
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:25,880
things are hard to know that I'm not alone in this moment

93
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:40,240
supported in ways I cannot imagine or see and supporting others in ways I

94
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:47,079
can't imagine just through this being sitting breathing very simple not

95
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:51,320
complicated not heady

96
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:53,839
Now if you like you can stay with the breath with the body the feeling of

97
00:16:55,079 --> 00:17:00,580
interconnection or you're welcome to drop in the invitations

98
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:05,798
[Music] ions that I will

99
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:11,839
share and these invitations reflections again like yesterday let's drop them

100
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:19,079
into the body into our hearts as if we're dropping pebbles into a body of

101
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:24,319
water and let them resonate reverberate we're not dropping them into

102
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:31,720
our heads thinking about them no we drop in the reflection and just sit with

103
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:39,679
it breathe with it and here is the

104
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:49,559
reflection considering considering qualities of a good friend

105
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:58,280
can we bring to our hearts perhaps a

106
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:07,320
friend or a benefactor or a relative or parent

107
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:14,280
or anyone any being any being who has

108
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,960
been a wise counsel for

109
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:25,399
us or has been compassionate

110
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:35,400
kind or has been loyal maybe there is a friend [Music]

111
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:44,000
who's continues to send emails and calls us checks in on us this good

112
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:53,039
friend any of these qualities in this meditation is enough not to make it

113
00:18:53,039 --> 00:19:01,480
challenging but any of these qualities in a being in the recent or distant

114
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:07,640
past that comes to your mind comes to your heart space

115
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,799
welcome yourself to sit with this quality

116
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:41,799
maybe it's been a wise friend who's given us wise

117
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:49,799
counsel perhaps gently [Music] kindly sharing with

118
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:57,519
us something that we didn't want to hear but they had our benefit in

119
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,760
mind or a friend who was compassionate

120
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,440
kind when we were having a difficult

121
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,480
time

122
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:33,840
inviting this friend to your heart space just spending time with them breathing in breathing

123
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:44,919
out allowing your heart to be lit up

124
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,840
by this quality by this particular quality of

125
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:11,200
goodness bringing some nuance to the recognition of the quality of

126
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:20,159

138
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,880
recognizing your own goodness let yourself be

139
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:22,840

heart most of life is just showing up

147
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:11,559
the more we recognize the more we turn towards the goodness of ourselves and

148
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:17,080
others the more we water the seed of

149

so um yeah continuing on this theme of of

179
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:22,880
saga of this interactive aspect of our practice just as important as the other

180
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:29,679
two jewels as I mentioned earlier Buddha Dharma Sana the Buddha the possibility of

181
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:36,880
awakening awakening intern uh the uh the Buddha inside the Buddha outside

182
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:42,399
uh the historical Buddha the uh teachings of the Buddha Dharma

183
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:49,320
with capital D small D with the lawful way that things unfold and SA the

184
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:54,960
community noble friends supporting one another towards awakening towards

185
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,960
becoming the best versions of ourselves for the sake of all beings for the sake

186
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:10,240
of ourselves and others so so the theme yesterday was about the

187
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:17,720
power the power of spiritual friendship kalana mita beautiful friendship

188
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:24,559
kalana meaning beautiful wholes wholesome and u mita friendship and the

189
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:33,440
few things that I mentioned yesterday is that spiritual friendship is not just a luxury uh it's the entirety of holy life

190
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:40,640
um and also we talked about how uh spiritual friendships these these wise

191
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:47,200
friendships maybe spiritual sounds like a heavy word but wise friendship let's say wise friendship otherwise it sounds

192
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:54,320
perhaps a little hoyy doy and it doesn't need to be that uh wise friendship good

193
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:59,760
heart friendship beautiful friendships yeah let's just use the poly word the Buddha has given us already the poly

194
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:07,200
word so so beautiful virtuous beautiful friendships there's also deep emotional

195
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:13,839
attunement uh that we talked about there's contagion that we talked about both emotional contagion and also

196
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:20,320
ethical contagion uh people whom we spend time with they inspire us uh we

197
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,520
become like them so there's a there's there's it's really the soil there's the

198
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:31,118
soil principle that the um the the soil of friendships the soil of the community

199
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:36,839
that we plant ourselves in can nourish us

200
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:42,960
and today I wanted to talk a little bit about the qualities of a true friend as

201
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:54,720
the Buddha has talked about it in the different sutas and um so in uh for example the

202
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:01,920
Buddha talks about a true true friend um is one who safeguards counselss and

203
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:10,160
stands firm through seasons of change so uh in digaya 31

204
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:17,880
uh the Buddha is teaching a lay person sigala about the duties of right conduct

205
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:23,640
including and how to honor and recogni recognize and honor true

206
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:29,760
friends and this is what the Buddha says the helper the enduring companion in

207
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:36,560
happiness and sorrow and good counselor and compassionate these are the friends

208
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:41,760
to be cherished it's just uplifts my heart when I hear these qualities it

209
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:49,920
also I feel inspired aspiring to to um to embody these as the Buddha says so

210
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:56,160
here we go the helper the enduring companion in happiness and sorrow the

211
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:02,200
good counselor and the compassionate these are the friends to be

212
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:12,119
cherished and in traditional commentaries these four types of true friends are known as the suha

213
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:18,720
suha sua the friends of the heart and these

214
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:24,440
kinds of friendships don't arise just through accident but

215
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:31,040
through purposeful cultivation of goodwill and shared virtue and trust so

216
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:38,560
they just don't happen to us these friendships right they take cultivation nourishment and again the four types of

217
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:45,040
true friends as the Buddha talks about are these four qualities one is the helper enduring

218
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:50,880
companion so this loyalty aspect good counselor wise counsel and the

219
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:56,000
compassionate these are the four qualities that he's mentioning in this there are other qualities in other

220
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,560
places and I'll bring them in the future days but

221
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:09,920
um um so so um yes so the Buddha also is

222
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:16,800
emphasizing here the rep reper the reciprocity of friendship just as a

223
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:22,880
friend protects you you should offer protection loyalty and your presence in

224
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:28,000
return and friendship ship isn't just about receiving care of course it's

225
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:35,520
about becoming a person who embodies it who becomes a refuge becomes a good friend for others so as I'm talking

226
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:41,680
about these good friendships today and yesterday as well if your mind goes oh I

227
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:49,040
want good friends oh I don't have good friends oh it's so hard to find good friends pause my dear pause what if you

228
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:56,000
shift it how can I be a good friend how can I be a good friend to others how can

229
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:03,280
I be a kalyanita to others woo wow that uplifts my heart there is no scarcity or

230
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:09,519
lack well it's it's my heart can I be uh a noble

231
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,400
friend so

232
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:22,320
um okay I'm going to move on uh more points I want to make and the Buddha

233
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:31,480
also talks about the counterfeit friend versus the true friend also in digaya 31

234
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:38,720
uh he talks about beware of the taker the sweet talker the flatterer and the

235
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:44,960
reckless companion for they abandon you when hardship comes

236
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:50,119
and these descriptions especially when framed for householders illuminate the

237
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:59,040
psychological characteristics of ego-based relationships where they're friendships that are based on gain uh

238
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:09,200
deceiving for approval and vanishing when hardship comes um and and the false

239
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:17,040
friendship is often propped up by mutual craving right uh rather than mutual care

240
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:22,320
mutual craving rather than mutual care and the

241
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,960
Buddhist teachings call us to notice the subtle difference between

242
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:33,280
attachmentbased connection and liberation supporting friendship i'll

243
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:39,960
say this again attachment you know this this clinginess this cling or craving

244
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:47,640
based connection versus liberation supporting

245
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:52,800
friendship and in living a wise life or

246
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,960
intending to live a wise life a friend who flatters but does not

247
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,560
challenge you is considered dangerous in in this context

248
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:10,640
but a friend who lovingly corrects corrects you lovingly corrects

249
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:17,200
you when they see that perhaps something unethical or challenging or difficult you're doing or or perhaps you have a

250
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:23,280
blind spot spot in your mind and they lovingly correct and support you that

251
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:30,520
friend that kind of a friend is considered invaluable in these teachings

252
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:40,240
and uh friendship is sustained by virtue and mutual connection mutual support

253
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:47,440
mutual protection in this old language so true friendship rests not

254
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:52,520
only on emotional closeness but also on shared ethical

255
00:40:52,520 --> 00:41:01,200
foundation and it's so interesting because in psychological research in the west uh it is said that the foundation

256
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:08,560
of a relationship is trust trust and trust is the most basic level really is

257
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:15,599
the the ethical foundation right when you trust someone's word their their uh

258
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:21,280
their actions they that that level of trust is based on this ethical

259
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:29,200
foundation so so again there's so much I mean this is uh not so much you know

260
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:35,599
Buddhism doesn't have hegemony over wisdom over world wisdom many times uh

261
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:41,119
various traditions of course and and psychology that does research on these

262
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:47,520
various very very human truths discover that oh yes they're they're the same of

263
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:53,200
course our friendships are based on shared ethical foundation ation of of of

264
00:41:53,200 --> 00:42:02,240
trust and ethical behavior so in uh Angutra and Nikaya 735

265
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:09,760
the Buddha says the good person is one who uh faithful virtuous learned

266
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:16,640
generous and wise becomes a reliable companion and guide and again I'd like

267
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:22,119
to invite you to turn everything that I say instead of looking outside look

268
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:27,920
inside can I be this good person that the Buddha describes the good person is

269
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:33,119
one who uh faithful actually may faithful better

270
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:40,880
translation in this case is having trust having confidence in the dharma in these teachings virtuous ethical having

271
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:48,720
ethical integrity learned generous having dana and chaga wise

272
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:56,480
uh becomes a reliable companion and guide how beautiful is that how beautiful is that for us to in as aspire

273
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:04,319
to be this for for ourselves and others so a friend who keeps the the

274
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:11,599
precepts of non-harming the five precepts of nonharming practices generosity and reflects on impermanence

275
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:17,280
is the one who uplifts not just your comfort but your liberation not just

276
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:24,079
your comfort but your liberation and in traditional terraada

277
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:30,920
commentaries such friends are said to be a I'll say it

278
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:36,839
again sorry I I put the ax in the wrong place

279
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:49,839
assistant companions those who point out your faults with kindness celebrate your

280
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:55,200
progress and remind you of the dharma in the times of despair isn't that

281
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,400
beautiful i love that description

282
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:07,520
a those who point out your faults with kindness celebrate your progress and

283
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:15,119
remind you of the dharma in the times of despair in difficult times and last thing I want to say is

284
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:22,040
how noble friendship transcends personality again um it's it's a

285
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:30,079
friendship that uh is supporting you is not just uh uh supporting you know the

286
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:37,040
ego and making you feel comfortable but is is actually offering you um pointing

287
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:43,000
out your faults really this this out of compassion out of love out of

288
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:49,359
care so a true friends that sees beyond your moods and self-image but speaks

289
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:55,920
from the perspective of your highest potential not your passing preferences

290
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:02,720
but really seeing your highest potential your your true goodness and

291
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:09,359
beauty and [Music] um and maybe yeah given that we're out

292
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:14,480
of time I'll transition to sharing the reflection questions so here here are

293
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:19,960
the reflection questions for today in my life who offers

294
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:27,760
counsel that pri prioritizes my true welfare even over my comfort are there

295
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:34,720
friends who uh offer counsel that prioritizes my true welfare over even

296
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:40,119
over my comfort and how do I receive that how can I be with

297
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:46,160
that here's a second reflection how might I strengthen my own practice of

298
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:52,560
being a reliable wise and compassionate friend how can I strengthen my own

299
00:45:52,560 --> 00:46:01,520
practice of being a reliable wise and compassionate friend and the third and last reflection

300
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:09,839
for today where do I need to become more discerning between superficial and noble

301
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:16,560
companions is there a place that I need to become more discerning between superficial and

302
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:22,880
noble companions and friends so with that my dear friends

303
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:29,839
this is uh this is our dharmat and invitations for reflections on on the

304
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:35,760
