1
00:00:03,639 --> 00:00:11,400
okay welcome uh welcome folks nice to be in the chat just in case you don't know I am

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:20,359
Insight Meditation Center there uh in case you think I have a very

3
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:28,080
intuitive assistant but um anyway it's sweet to

4
00:00:28,759 --> 00:00:33,760
uh yeah sweet to see your uh names and checking

5
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,520
in um okay let us

6
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,039
uh let us practice

7
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,840
sometimes we get into our Dharma posture very

8
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,159
gently the same way somebody might get into a yoga

9
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:35,720
ASA where they getting in is as important as the getting

10
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,799
to but other times it's counseled by one of my

11
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:57,960
teachers shinzen Yang who would say start on a dime

12
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:12,360
sometimes we have to do that in our life and so here we

13
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,319
practice kind of ruthlessness with respect to the trail

14
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,920
of distractions and dramas

15
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,760
we start on a

16
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:54,599
dime maybe it feels like wait a second I need to tend to all those loose

17
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,879
ends I need to uh patch things up figure

18
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,159
things

19
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:16,760
out it feels like neglecting a loved one to put down our

20
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:23,239
thoughts but put them down and if there's pain that comes with

21
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:31,760
that if there's a sense of vulnerability or incompletion just feel that

22
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,720
e

23
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720

24

e e

25
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:42,880
the renunciation involves the willingness to

26
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:52,639
feel renouncing a thought that feels

27
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,800
important to tend

28
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,199
to the egoic

29
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:10,080
wound that feels important to

30
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:17,019
nurse the [Music]

31
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,360
uncertainty the ambiguity that feels necessary to game

32
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,360
out

33
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:36,159
for our life that life to become less sticky

34
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,080
involves the willingness to

35
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,479
feel to not use

36
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:10,639

57
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:05,360
we practice bringing equinity to the emotional

58
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:22,280
activations one of the effects of this is that

59
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:30,840
everything becomes less urgent

e

86
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:39,200
okay good to uh good to sit with

87
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:50,320
you so I had a a memory teaching um few

88
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:57,159
days ago um of um a few few times as a

89
00:29:57,159 --> 00:30:04,360
as a kid um I remember I don't know 10 8 10 something

90
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:10,000
like that and uh I remember kind of playing

91
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:18,398
this weird thought experiment game in my mind and

92
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,559
uh and it would go something like I I would just and I don't know where this

93
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:32,600
is from and maybe this is uh uh uh I needed some help or something but I

94
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:39,480
I felt okay emotionally but I remember I would imagine things falling

95
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:45,679
away and first that I was never born that was quite

96
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:54,480
conceivable and then uh my brother and my parents

97
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:00,440
family never existed okay what what about our

98
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:07,240
species what about no no history no time no

99
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:15,399
Universe nothing nothing and I would kind of hit this

100
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:21,000
point of like real abiding

101
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:29,000
nothingness and then sort of freak out and I would freak out out I you know

102
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:37,240
in retrospect probably for a few reasons so first I was was

103
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:42,799
actively imagining my death and the changing of all

104
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:49,799
things and um that's a lot you know for a

105
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:57,480
kid but more radically I I think I was I was imagining something even

106
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:06,200
Beyond on nihilism not merely that nothing mattered but that nothing could ever

107
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:13,399
matter uh that there was no no meaning no love no no nothing I

108
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:19,519
was like trying to get my mind around that and I kind of just something

109
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:25,120
blotted out and of

110
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:32,720
course it could have been that way and that there is

111
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,559
something is extraordinarily

112
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:45,919
wild but in that you know thought exercise uh I

113
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:51,519
was also trying I I think to to

114
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:56,000
essentially think my way into

115
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:05,120
emptiness not that there is nothing but that the something is much more like

116
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:11,880
nothing than we realize and emptiness Emptiness is

117
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:18,480
characterized a lot of different ways but one aspect of it we could say

118
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:26,080
and I'll unpack this language one aspect one characterization maybe would

119
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:31,919
be um emptiness as the progressive

120
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,960
deification of the self

121
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:46,120
model so deification that um that that word

122
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:54,000
um was typically used to describe in meditative circles

123
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:01,039
to describe the process whereby thoughts become mere thoughts rather than

124
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:07,440
reality and generally the voice inside my head

125
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:14,440
is confused for the voice of God right to think is to be identified

126
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:21,960
with thinking and there are wise thoughts right but all thoughts involve some

127
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:28,679
measure of identification a collapse of of

128
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:36,280
metacognitive awareness and mindfulness is about

129
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:42,760
appreciating phenomena as phenomena rather than phenomena as the world so to

130
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:51,919
see to recognize visual impressions are arising rather than that's the

131
00:34:51,919 --> 00:35:01,520
world to reify things is to make them more sub substantial more real right the

132
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:08,839
thought of some food you love makes you salivate the thought of

133
00:35:08,839 --> 00:35:18,880
some something scary makes you afraid it's reified right that thought

134
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:25,720
is the world it's very real and deification moves in the

135
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:32,640
opposite direction deification recognizes thought as a passing

136
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:37,800
phenomena an auditory thought I am a bad

137
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:45,599
person I am a whatever is heard in the same way that we

138
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:53,079
hear a sound no more meaning in I'm a

139
00:35:53,079 --> 00:36:01,800
bad as this and So what had been

140
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:07,720
transparent becomes opaque what we had been looking

141
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:12,319
through becomes an object of

142
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:21,240
attention so the thought you know I need lunch is just as

143
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:28,359
real as anything in the world and then becomes an empty arising

144
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:34,000
it's the process of disidentification [Music]

145
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,960
deification to use um the philosopher Buddhist practitioner meditator uh

146
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:47,240
Thomas me metzinger's language the representation of

147
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:58,640
lunch is not automatically integrated into a transparent self model

148
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:08,599
we recognize oh that's a thought about lunch it's deified it's rather than I want lunch

149
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:14,480
it's remains transparent and then gets integrated as

150
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:21,319
a the agent Matthew model of myself wants lunch

151
00:37:21,319 --> 00:37:26,520
needs lunch and then we go about fulfilling that craving or

152
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:33,000
whatever but there's a lot more to dis disidentify

153
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:40,200
from than the thought of lunch and new new

154
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:46,800
meditators take so much for for granted

155
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:53,560
um about the self model really the only thing new

156
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:59,760
meditators uh disidentify with is just distractors you know

157
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:05,240
like whatever a simple thought about lunch or whatever it may be okay

158
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:12,800
thinking coming back to breathing or something but what distracts

159
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:19,720
us is not nearly as problematic as what is always

160
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:24,319
assumed what is assumed is

161
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,440
transparent and so

162
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:38,240
it leaves many layers of the model of self self view transparent they must

163
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:45,480
become opaque so we start to hear the different

164
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:53,280
ways in which we incessantly hum the song of

165
00:38:54,200 --> 00:39:02,800
self and we're almost constantly reiterating our

166
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:09,240
position sandwiched between our past and our future each

167
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:14,880
moment a kind of addendum to our

168
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,240
autobiography this is who I am this is where I've come

169
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:28,520
from these are my papers they say who I am you know

170
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:33,640
and the position of our body you know we

171
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:39,119
keep tabs for understandable reasons but

172
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:47,119
we keep tabs the places where I end the world begins this is reiterated and integrated

173
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:52,318
into the self model again and

174
00:39:54,119 --> 00:40:01,599
again so part of what we're learning to do do is this process of

175
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:10,640
disidentification to disidentify from our preferences right because

176
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:17,040
unnoticed preferences unnoticed little knots of

177
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:22,880
clinging um create a motivational

178
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:29,318
urgency that gets integrated into the self model

179
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:36,000
and part of the the function of equinity

180
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,160
is to help us disidentify when when we don't have

181
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:49,359
equinity with you know craving or aversion it's um it's very hard to

182
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:55,599
disidentify with it it feels like we must enact

183
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:02,800
it and the craving and aversion that that is not equinom

184
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:08,359
mised our preferences and points of

185
00:41:08,359 --> 00:41:15,079
clinging holographically project a sense of

186
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:24,040
self the the sense of

187
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:34,359
um the sense of ownership sense of ownership is assumed often

188
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:38,519
transparent this is me this is

189
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:47,880
mine the majima majima um only when there is what

190
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:54,839
belongs to a self is there a self only when there's what belongs to a

191
00:41:54,839 --> 00:42:00,760
self is there a self this this ownership these mechanisms of

192
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:06,040
ownership are transparent we're making them

193
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:13,319
opaque and to disidentify from all of this is not to dispute the content not

194
00:42:13,319 --> 00:42:21,800
to say I'm someone else but it's to recognize that the

195
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:28,119
identification the reification has important effects on The View

196
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:34,079
so we get quiet we get quiet quieter you get ramda says the

197
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:39,839
more you can hear and so we have to get quiet

198
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:48,000
enough to hear the noise of our self

199
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:58,319
model thear said um what is known

200
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:07,400
cannot be self and so we become more more

201
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:13,720
comfortable in uh without some of the reference

202
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:19,800
points having made opaque what was transparent more

203
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:28,480
comfortable and not knowing more comfortable in uh

204
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:36,160
emptiness so uh offer this for your consideration this talk came out a

205
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:45,559
little bit more technically bulky than I had

206
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:52,280
envisioned it's a little late especially some of you on the East

207
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:58,800
Coast but it's a certain Wednesday you just kind of

208
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:05,440
this is what we did so but I'm happy happy to be with you

209
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:13,440
and uh happy to practice and um pick up what's useful leave the rest behind and we will uh

210
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:22,240
continue on next week okay you uh take good care
