1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:07,500
okay well my name is May Elliott doing a week-long study on the

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:15,000
foundations of a pasana meditation today's instructions are about emotions this

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,060
includes moods and mind States this is a really wide field

4
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,340
and learning to practice skillfully with it can I can have a huge impact on our

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:32,099
life on our lives and on a really simple level we're learning how to let emotions

6
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:39,239
come and go without tampering with them without fighting them or without judging

7
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:46,920
them so there's no practice I'd like to introduce you you to it's called raft

8
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,079
and it's an acronym that stands for recognize

9
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,199
allow feel and tease or tease apart so we'll

10
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:03,239
be going for these four parts of raft in the meditation today and then unpacking

11
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:09,299
them further in the talk at the end now raft is particularly useful for

12
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:16,200
difficult emotions and wounds sadness grief resentment anger Etc

13
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,500
um but for the sake of this meditation if there aren't any difficult emotions present you don't need to go looking for

14
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:29,159
that you can still apply this instruction to whatever mood or emotion is happening for you

15
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:36,060
and it might be a really subtle mood that's in the background and so we're not needing to dredge up anything

16
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,579
um intense with this let's go ahead and start our morning

17
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:48,420
meditation together can begin with a stable posture

18
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,420
both alert and relaxed

19
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:06,899
you might connect with your primary anchor that might be the breath for you

20
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:16,099
believe The Sounds in the room or a global sense of the bodily posture

21
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:31,080
foreign instructions with the breath to start but go ahead and apply them to whatever

22
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,220
your anchor is

23
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:49,760
so to help settle and collect the mind

24
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,379
we might take a few deep breaths

25
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,780
foreign

26
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,599
to resume a normal rhythm

27
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:36,800
allowing the mind to become interested in the breath

28
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,480
collecting here into the present moment

29
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,879
foreign

30
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:28,740
spots arise during the meditation you can gently release them

31
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:33,680
and glide right back to the breath

32
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,780
foreign

33
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,479
foreign

34
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,699
foreign

35
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:50,520
as we sit letting go of our preoccupations

36
00:06:51,300 --> 00:07:00,479
letting go into the body into the felt sense of breathing

37
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:07,740
as we do this you might notice if a particular mood or

38
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,418
emotion is present

39
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:21,919
it's okay if it's overt it's okay if it's subtle

40
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:24,740
foreign

41
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,819
T background mood

42
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:43,699
maybe a little calm or contentment

43
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:53,120
maybe a little agitation or striving

44
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,720
foreign

45
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:31,759
it's going to begin with our emotions by simply recognizing what's happening

46
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:40,039
that's the first practice of raft we're recognizing

47
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:46,740
just knowing oh happiness

48
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:54,240
or oh this is sadness or self-judgment

49
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:01,100
whatever is being noticed can be noticed cleanly and simply

50
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,880
and it's okay if you don't have a name for the emotion if you can't figure out

51
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,920
what emotion it is that's totally fine

52
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,060
you might just note emotion

53
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,200
foreign

54
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,600
changes as we sit

55
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:04,220
the second part of this practice is allowing

56
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:12,259
whatever arises is welcome foreign

57
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:20,300
there is no need to resist anything that comes up in meditation

58
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,500
can you fold everything in nothing excluded

59
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,540
foreign

60
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:24,200
is no longer predominant we can return to your breath or your primary anchor

61
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:56,339
foreign

62
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:36,720
foreign whatever arises to be known in the light

63
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:43,760
of awareness nothing to fix

64
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:04,639
we'll move now to the third grade instruction feel

65
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,060
connecting with whatever mood or emotion may be present

66
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:19,160
can you experience it in the body Can you feel it in the body

67
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,760
emotions almost always have a physical manifestation

68
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:39,740
that might be tingling in the chest thank you a sense of lightness or heaviness

69
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:47,700
contraction in the belly or the forehead heat pressure

70
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,820
Etc

71
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,279
see if you can connect with whatever emotion or mood may be present

72
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:12,440
through the felt sense of the body

73
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,720
thank you

74
00:14:55,019 --> 00:15:00,420
if it's helpful and you can apply a soft mental note to whatever you're

75
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,199
experiencing

76
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:08,420
tingling

77
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:17,180
tightness

78
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:29,959
warmth keeping the note light in the background

79
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:36,139
and the actual sensation in the foreground

80
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,139
foreign

81
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:26,459
foreign

82
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,380
foreign

83
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:12,259
whatever Sensations we find there to be

84
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,319
foreign

85
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,840
and a scientist

86
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:07,220
nothing personal

87
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,580
nothing's a problem

88
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,980
thank you

89
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:57,539
foreign

90
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,500
foreign

91
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:54,419
this last piece of working with emotions is

92
00:19:54,419 --> 00:20:01,020
teas T's apart so for this piece of the practice it's

93
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:09,120
supposed to be simple we're teasing apart the difference between the storyline or any narrative

94
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:16,740
associated with the emotion we're teasing apart the

95
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:22,860
felt sense of the emotion and how it's experienced in the body

96
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:30,299
seeing the difference between mental and physical manifestations

97
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,659
we're getting clear about what's Extra

98
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:52,980
maybe there's an extra layer of self-judgment or resistance

99
00:20:52,980 --> 00:21:02,299
or a wish to fix whatever emotion is present so teasing apart to be able to see that

100
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,160
thank you

101
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,120
foreign

102
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:11,720
the emotion from the identification with the emotion

103
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:15,539
foreign

104
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,600
foreign

105
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,600
every emotion will pass away

106
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:16,200
at that time we can return to our anchor we can return to the breath

107
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:22,340
foreign to stay present in the body

108
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:21,299
okay if we can learn to befriend our

109
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:27,480
emotional life when we're not at war with ourselves

110
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:32,940
with our inner world we can show up more fully and more

111
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,500
compassionately for others

112
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:47,700
May the beneficial energy of our practice here together benefit all

113
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:53,900
beings everywhere so they may be happy

114
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:59,000
safe and free from suffering

115
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:13,640
I okay

116
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:31,080
welcome back everyone I hope you enjoyed your sitting

117
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:37,980
for those just arriving my name is May Elliott and we are in the midst of a

118
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:45,240
five day series on the foundations of La pasana meditation so we're on day three

119
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:51,899
focusing on emotions day one was on breath day two was on the body

120
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:59,760
so I'd like to start with a story for you in my early 20s I got a one-way ticket

121
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:06,659
to India and at one point when I was in rishikesh on the banks of the Ganges and there

122
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:14,220
were tons of monkeys around us really fantastic and I had left my backpack on the beach

123
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:21,659
while climbing up on some rocks and I looked down to see that one of the monkeys had his little hand in my

124
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:27,600
backpack my lunch was in there and so I think it was somewhat enticing so I

125
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,820
scrambled down down from the rocks and I shooed the monkeys away only to gain the

126
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:40,200
attention of a whole pack of monkeys um and they didn't seem so threatened by

127
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,960
my attempts to fend them off so before I knew it several monkeys had

128
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:51,600
started closing in on me they were surrounding me and had very aggressive expressions

129
00:30:51,600 --> 00:31:00,080
and I started feeling a pretty uneasy and I was backing up and found myself uh

130
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:08,100
backed up against the rapid-filled river and uh sort of hopped onto a tiny sliver

131
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:14,100
of Sandbar a foot or two offshore and I had a big stick and I was trying

132
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:20,460
to fend them off at the stick which I think they perceived as pathetically unthreatening

133
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:26,159
and it seemed ever more probable that I would be their lunch when to my

134
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:32,039
tremendous surprise a group of Whitewater Rafters appeared from

135
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:38,100
Upstream and in a blink I don't know even how it happened but I found myself scooped into

136
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:46,278
their boat and they kindly delivered me to the safety on the other Shore

137
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:53,940
so some of you may be familiar with the Buddhist teachings on the

138
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:59,600
parliaments the Perfections these refer to

139
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:05,460
the term parami refers to the wholesome Buddhist qualities like generosity and

140
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:11,279
patience and wisdom and I I actually love this word parami

141
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:17,700
because it's an ancient Pali pun it can be translated as Perfection pointing to

142
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:24,659
how these beautiful qualities of mind and heart perfect or I guess I should say how

143
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:31,679
these use practices perfect the mind and heart but it can also be translated as

144
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:37,500
crossing over paramet can be translatables crossing over and in this way through practicing we

145
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:45,480
learn to cross over to the other Shore we learn to cross over from the shore of delusion to the shore of Awakening from

146
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:51,720
confusion to Clarity from hatred to love when there's a way that all of these

147
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:58,320
practices we're doing together support us to cross over to the other Shore

148
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:06,600
you may remember uh w s Merwin quote that I shared on day one of this series

149
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:12,059
little breath Breathe Me Gently roaming

150
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:17,240
for I am a river I am learning to cross

151
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:26,880
when I was on the riverbank in rishikesh I was pretty scared and in that moment

152
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:33,720
of being rescued I was freed from that state of fear and that state of despair

153
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:41,100
uh the the emotional upheaval was transformed one could say so in the same

154
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:47,880
way whenever we're overcome with a difficult emotion can often feel like we're stranded you

155
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:55,039
can feel like we're overwhelmed or we're stuck and we could all use the benefit of a Lifeboat in those moments

156
00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:00,659
so the practice I'd like to discuss further that we covered in the

157
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:08,060
meditation is this practice called raft it's an acronym so it stands for

158
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:14,460
recognize allow feel and to tease or tease apart

159
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:21,658
and um this practice is designed to keep you above water when struck by a strong

160
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:28,260
currents of emotion and it was originally uh the acronym was coined by the Insight teacher Tanya

161
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:37,138
Weiser so let's talk a little bit more or let's take a little more time to unpack this

162
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:42,300
okay so first when would we use raft

163
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:48,599
generally in meditation we would stay with the breath with um

164
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:55,679
with emotions in the background really giving the breath our soul attention

165
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:03,240
however if an emotion becomes compelling enough to pull you away from the breath

166
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:08,400
that's when you shift to give the emotion your full attention

167
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:15,000
so in short if it asks for your attention you can give it your attention

168
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:22,680
when an emotion becomes predominant in this way that's when we can apply these four aspects of raft

169
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:27,839
you don't need to apply all four aspects of raft at the same time

170
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:34,500
sometimes we might focus on just recognizing at other times just teasing apart maybe

171
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:41,000
just allowing or maybe just feeling so you might use them all at once can

172
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,880
consecutively or you might use different parts at different times so there's an element of creativity with us with

173
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:55,260
this to see what works for you so let's go through each now um with a little more detail on them

174
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:00,660
so recognizing this is a really basic principle of

175
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:05,760
mindfulness practice it's just knowing what's happening in the present moment

176
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,859
and this might be as simple as acknowledging

177
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:17,760
this is boredom or oh irritation what oh this is happiness so often we don't know

178
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:25,260
what's happening in our emotional life and before we know it we've snapped at our spouse or our co-worker when we

179
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:31,800
didn't even really notice that what was happening again aside was anger so the more clearly that we can get to know

180
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:37,680
these different emotions the more quickly we will identify them in the future

181
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:43,560
and the less likely it is that we'll be hijacked by them so just the simple Act of recognition

182
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:49,260
recognition can sometimes unhook the power of the emotion it's

183
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:55,740
really simple as ajan sumado would say it's like this

184
00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:01,200
so we might be experiencing frustration we might go wrong frustration is like

185
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:06,920
this I don't know contentment is like this

186
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:14,820
so that's recognition the next is allowing so often when difficult emotions arise

187
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:19,920
we find ourselves pushing back against them we're aversive to them we don't

188
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:25,619
want them there and we're trying to find ways to get rid of them and often in meditation without even

189
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:32,640
realizing it we'll have something difficult a rise of pain in the body and a difficult emotion and then we'll try

190
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:38,099
to meditate our way out of it so we're kind of using meditation as a tool to get rid of something

191
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:44,640
um and if we notice that happening we can just notice it and see if there's room to soften and release

192
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:50,160
and really meditation is not the only way we try to get rid of our emotions that's maybe one of the more skillful

193
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:58,079
ways um that humans do all sorts of things you know excess food and drink entertainment argument suppression Etc

194
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:04,320
so uh so when we reject our emotional experience what ends up happening is

195
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:10,380
that we add an extra layer of Sufferin the Buddha talks about this process as

196
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:16,560
being like being shot by two Arabs the initial painful emotion is like being

197
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:22,020
struck by the first Arrow jealousy longing Etc

198
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:28,500
but when we reject our experience and try to get rid of it this experience of aversion or rejection is another layer

199
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:34,440
of suffering so that's like getting shot with a second Arrow so if we're sad and then we

200
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:40,440
say to ourselves oh this is ridiculous that I'm sad I shouldn't be sad about something so petty

201
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:46,560
and then we're filled with self-judgment for feeling sad then we've shot ourselves with a second Arrow said it's

202
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:54,180
the first Arrow the self-judgment's the second round we know from the second Noble Truth that

203
00:38:54,180 --> 00:39:00,839
the source of suffering is craving aversion is just the other side of the

204
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:06,000
same coin when we reject our experience we suffer

205
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:13,859
so instead this is where allowing comes in and said can we allow our experience

206
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:19,500
this doesn't mean that we are justifying or condoning our emotions nor does it

207
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:24,599
mean that we're necessarily expressing it instead we're just making space for

208
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:34,500
it to be as it is allowing the emotion to be to express in the body without judgment

209
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:41,160
and there's so much Freedom that's available with difficult emotions if we can learn to relate to them as just

210
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:47,579
tides that move through us if allowing is difficult they can be

211
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:53,180
helpful to remember that um all of these emotions are impermanent

212
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:58,320
that will all pass on their own even if we tried to keep an emotion the same we

213
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:05,480
couldn't do it right um so everything is subject to change

214
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:11,700
there was once a spiritual Master walking on one shore of a river and his

215
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:16,800
disciple was walking on the other the other Shore and the disciple yelled across the

216
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,500
master master how do I get to the other Shore in essence so how do I cross the

217
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:28,500
river of samsara and get to the shore of Awakening and the master replied you are on the

218
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:34,380
other Shore so when we practice acceptance when we

219
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:41,700
practice allowing we realize that we don't have to strive to get to the other short or to get somewhere else or get

220
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:47,160
somewhere better you don't have to resist our experience to try to get a

221
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:54,200
better one when we practice allowing it's as though we've already arrived

222
00:40:54,200 --> 00:41:02,339
Freedom can be found in the Here and Now Okay so we've done recognize and allow

223
00:41:02,339 --> 00:41:07,380
and now we'll do filling the F of raft so this aspect

224
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:13,920
of raft involves really getting to know the sensations of the emotion in the body

225
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:19,500
so often emotions are carried by a really strong narrative or storyline and

226
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:25,680
in this practice we're letting go of of that Narrative of the thoughts associated with it and really feeling

227
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:32,400
the physical Sensations associated with their emotion and it's often used physical Sensations

228
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:38,780
that keep our stories spinning our storytelling mind is in a way Often by

229
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:43,920
thinking it's trying to to think its way out of the problem

230
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,680
it's trying to um to come up with some solution to

231
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:55,020
whatever is challenging us and is causing us to feel how we feel in the body

232
00:41:55,020 --> 00:42:01,320
so for example if we're compulsively rehearsing a conversation it might because we're trying to figure

233
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:08,400
out the right thing to say and we really want to get the right comeback for this person that we're angry at and if we can

234
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:15,300
just really nail that response then we won't have to feel angry anymore so in a way we're trying to think our

235
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:21,240
way out of how we're feeling um so the thinking mind is problem

236
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:26,280
solving in a way such that the body can stop feeling the emotion

237
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:33,420
now instead this practice of feeling uh what it does is it subverts this

238
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:38,940
tendon it subverts the tendency to try to think our way out of our feelings

239
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:44,640
and instead it meets the emotion at its root that meets the emotion in the body

240
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:51,359
and we may get back the only place we can ever really address it which is in the now

241
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:58,740
so if you could use support in learning how to feel the body I suggest you go back to the meditation

242
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:04,079
and the the talk that we did yesterday on mindfulness of body it's really learn

243
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:09,359
the language of how the body feels dealing in the language of sensation

244
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,660
foreign

245
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:28,380
so in this uh in this piece we're teasing apart the different components of an emotional experience so that we

246
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:34,260
can start to see the different parts more clearly so emotions have many facets to them

247
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:39,720
both physical and mental and we can tease apart the physical experience from

248
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:45,960
the thoughts so we might notice that heaviness we might notice heaviness a slouched

249
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:52,380
posture maybe a lump in the throat um we recognize that part of sadness as

250
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:58,560
distinct from the thoughts about sadness which is distinct from the emotional

251
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:04,319
tone of sadness so that helps us get to know what's

252
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:10,740
really happening here and when we can really see clearly and tease apart carefully we can find where the

253
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:17,520
suffering is we can find where the source of suffering is and we can also find where the freedom

254
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:24,300
is so when we look more closely at the mind we can tease apart the emotion from the

255
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:29,700
reaction to the motion right this is what we talked about with the first arrow in the second Arrow so we can

256
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:36,540
start to see the difference between the first and the second arrow and we can see the difference between our grief and

257
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:42,540
the embarrassment about the Greeks and those are two different things and we get to see what

258
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:47,880
our judgments expectations and attitudes we have that are functioning in

259
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:54,599
relationship to the Primary Emotion maybe we might ask ourselves you know are we afraid of how are we afraid of

260
00:44:54,599 --> 00:45:00,960
how we feel uh do we grasp hold of our feelings do we hate them

261
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:07,500
are we embarrassed by them are we identified with them these are all questions that

262
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:14,599
um that we can discover through this practice of teasing our part so here you have it that is raft r-a-f-t

263
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:21,980
recognized allow feel and tease tease apart so just as a reminder with these

264
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:28,260
you don't have to practice all four aspects each time you focus on a emotion

265
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:34,740
um please feel free to experiment to see what works for you and see what helps you relate to your emotions with less

266
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:41,220
reactivity and what you may find is that through doing this practice

267
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:47,300
rather than needing to solve our problems sometimes this practice can

268
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:52,560
dissolve our problems and

269
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:58,800
what we find is the more we practice the more clear it is that there are two

270
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:04,740
classes of emotional experience one class is of wholesome emotions

271
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:10,079
or excuse me of unwholesome emotions that involve craving aversion or

272
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:15,480
delusion and these are often emotions based in wanting or not wanting might be

273
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:20,880
desire anxiety competitiveness energy and particular feelings feelings that

274
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:26,819
raft is particularly helpful for now there's a second class of emotions

275
00:46:26,819 --> 00:46:35,700
that are wholesome ones that manifest from a peaceful heart emotions like uh Joy or compassion

276
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:42,540
the para means like generosity patients loving kindness and these wholesome emotions are

277
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:48,720
cultivated in part just by knowing when they're present so we have so many moments throughout the day where it

278
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:55,680
might even just be a flicker but just a little flicker of contentment but a little flicker of Joy so don't miss

279
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:02,880
Feast when they're present really pause and soak them up when they come to visit because this condition is the mind

280
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:09,180
for allowing these wholesome states to arrive more frequently in the future

281
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:16,140
so I hope that today whatever emotions you encounter you can meet them with the

282
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:21,240
eye of practice and I hope that you remember that you

283
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:28,140
always have a raft on hand you always have what you need to cross the River

284
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:35,640
from delusion to Awakening so may you all arrive safely on the other Shore

285
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:41,900
thank you so much I hope you have a lovely day
