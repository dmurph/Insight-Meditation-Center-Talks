1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:07,600
so good morning everyone and welcome

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,320
and um so we're here uh

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,359
to meditate and perhaps to use the word meditation

4
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,720
is too broad perhaps

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:32,960
another way of saying it is we're here to deeply appreciate

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,719
our capacity to be aware to deeply

7
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,399
use that awareness to discover what the lived life is

8
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,520
at this moment not the lived life we'll have tomorrow

9
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,280
or we had yesterday but the live life of the moment

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,399
that is the place where there's it's almost like three dimensions if the past

11
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,920
the future is two-dimensional

12
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,840
the present moment is three-dimensional has depth to it in a different kind of way

13
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:22,159
so to assume a posture

14
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:29,920
that can help you really be here to appreciate this moment

15
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,479
but not appreciate it only from the mind from the controlled torah watching or thinking about it

16
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,920
but one that a posture of embodiment

17
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:48,159
a posture that you arrange your body in such a way that there's an intentional

18
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,439
intentionality to being embodied

19
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,880
for some people that means to sit up a little straighter

20
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:08,720
perhaps without puffing up the chest there's a gentle art of opening the chest as we sit

21
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:16,840
maybe by gently pulling in the spine between the shoulder blades

22
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,840
and sometimes you can no sound

23
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:36,959
um the um

24
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,640
and sometimes you can get a little bit more sense of engaged presence

25
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:50,400
by pulling back your head slightly

26
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,000
and tipping your head gently forward

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,640
opening up the space between the last vertebrae and the skull

28
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,360
and then gently closing the eyes if it's comfortable for you

29
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:20,239
and this closing the eyes is a way of concentrating our attention

30
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,040
in the body

31
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,720
kind of dropping into your lived experience of your body

32
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,720
feeling sensing your body

33
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:47,840
so much of the lived experience of the moment is mediated through the body

34
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:57,879
including the things that we don't think of as the body our emotions our thoughts our attitudes

35
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,799
and taking a few long slow deep breaths

36
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,199
so you can feel the fullness of this embodied life

37
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,359
expansion of the chest lifting of the shoulders

38
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,840
swelling of the belly perhaps as you breathe in deeply

39
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:49,520
and then letting your breathing return to normal and with a normal breath

40
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:57,560
on the exhale relax your body

41
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:07,840
and relax into an awareness of embodiment of being in a

42
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,840
body having a body

43
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,960
and relaxing the muscles of the face

44
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,440
on the exhale relaxing the belly

45
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,400
and on the exhale relaxing the shoulders

46
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,638
and then within the body as part of your embodied experience

47
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:19,639
become aware of how the body experiences breathing

48
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:31,360
as if awareness lives in your body not in your control tower not in up in

49
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:38,319
the thoughts see if you can rest into

50
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,759
the body's experience of itself

51
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,120
the body's experience of breathing

52
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:14,080
and ever so gently as a whisper in the mind

53
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:22,880
say the word in as you breathe in and out as you breathe out

54
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:31,199
and let that word not be so important

55
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:37,919
for its own sake but rather as a gentle pointing

56
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:47,039
of staying with the embodied experience of inhale and the embodied experience of exhaling

57
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:53,759
so the mind doesn't wander off when it does wander off just gently

58
00:07:53,759 --> 00:08:01,319
begin again returning to the embodied experience of breathing

59
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:06,080
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

60
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:15,200
to realize that the more centered we are in ourselves

61
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,360
the more we have to offer others

62
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,600
the more centered we are here that can be the genesis of our

63
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:31,039
kindness our friendliness our care

64
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:36,960
our love take a moment to center yourself the

65
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:43,039
best you can here in this body

66
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:55,520
and turning your attention outwards out into the world either generally towards everyone or

67
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,840
towards the people that you'll encounter today

68
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:07,440
and imagine yourself maybe in the presence of some people where you're

69
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:13,840
centered and balanced and relaxed unthreatened

70
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,039
everything's okay and there's lots of room for your

71
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:24,399
love your care your good will your well wishing

72
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:30,159
and in that situation with that situation in mind

73
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:37,559
extend your good will in the following way maybe repeating after me

74
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,559
may all beings be happy

75
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,919
may all beings be safe

76
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,679
may all beings be peaceful

77
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:04,518
may all beings be free

78
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:13,279
and may i have the kindness and good will from which such quick such good will can

79
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:21,960
flow may i contribute to the welfare and happiness of this world

80
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:37,248
[Music]

81
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:47,440
so we come to the last talk on discomfort i hope you've been

82
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,559
usefully uncomfortable this week not anymore than usual

83
00:31:52,559 --> 00:32:00,159
but that you've learned something about the value of mindfulness of discomfort

84
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:07,519
i think that well as i like to say that if buddhism focuses ultimately on a

85
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:14,559
certain kind of spiritual freedom inner freedom and if we become free only when we're

86
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:21,600
comfortable we're not really free the one of the tests for how free we are

87
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,720
is to discover if we're free while we're uncomfortable

88
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:33,840
and um uneasy and there will be i was always going to be discomfort in this world

89
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:40,080
so to fight it or feel like it's a mistake is going to be exhausting

90
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:46,320
and so we can develop a power the power of being comfortable with

91
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:52,880
discomfort discovering how to be free with discomfort

92
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:58,559
not free when discomfort has gone away and

93
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:05,360
and this kind of combination of learning how to be free with discomfort

94
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:11,679
is very extremely useful sometimes if people think that they have

95
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:18,399
to be comfortable to be free then we're never going to learn how

96
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:25,120
to be wisely with discomfort if we feel like if when we're uncomfortable we

97
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:31,120
have to react to it and and change it or fight it or hide from it or give into it

98
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:38,159
collapse around it or something then we'll never discover how to be free

99
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:44,640
but uh the combination of learning how to be comfortable with discomfort

100
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,679
so uh and to be learn how to center ourselves

101
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:55,519
or to be present for discomfort without reactivity

102
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:02,480
and and in the pla and be free enough that while we're uncomfortable

103
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:08,638
to be able to stand metaphorically stand tall or upright

104
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:16,320
metaphorically be able to look reality directly at look directly at reality

105
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:22,398
discomfort is maybe always a message and the question is

106
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:28,560
what is the message is it a message to heed or is it a message to

107
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:35,440
not not give into the ability to be present for discomfort

108
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:42,000
and being able to look reality in the eye really see what's happening here

109
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,280
sometimes we need to look at ourselves what's happening and sometimes it's it's a call to look

110
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:53,118
at what's happening around us and to take discomfort as a message

111
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:58,320
for greater attention something here needs attention

112
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:04,800
and and then to look at it directly what's really going on here this is beginning to exercise our

113
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,960
freedom to look at what's happening as opposed to giving in to the reactions about

114
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:17,680
what's happening and so this ability to then be able to stand

115
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:24,320
comfortably in discomfort also gives us the ability when it's appropriate

116
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:32,400
to be allow ourselves to be uncomfortable and do what has to be done the discomfort doesn't interfere

117
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:38,000
doesn't distract us from what has to happen it can be very uncomfortable

118
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,599
to to have to take a neighbor

119
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:49,280
to a er to the hospital when the hospital is full and long lines outside

120
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:56,320
and and covet is there very uncomfortable and the ability to but this has to

121
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:02,480
happen i have to help the neighbor i know how to be uncomfortable this is the time to be uncomfortable and not be

122
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:09,040
caught by it but keep that keep focused on the task of helping the neighbor

123
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:13,760
the the um

124
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:20,160
and so to have the strength to have this capacity

125
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:26,079
to have this maybe dedication to have the ability

126
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:31,359
to stay present to investigate to see what's going on and take care of what

127
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:36,800
needs to be taken care of without being sidetracked by the discomfort

128
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:42,160
now sometimes what's needed is the task at hand is to investigate

129
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:47,280
the discomfort itself and that investigation it works a lot better

130
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:53,200
if we are not living in the reactivity with discomfort if we learned how to be comfortable

131
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,480
with discomfort because then we don't have filters over our eyes to see what's happening we're

132
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:04,400
more able to be honest and see more clearly and deeply what's happening if we're looking at ourselves

133
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,839
same thing if we're looking outwardly this is uncomfortable social situation

134
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:16,079
i think it's important to take a good look and see what's going on here and to be able to

135
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:22,640
again not give into this comfort not be be distracted by it

136
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:28,560
but to really take but not ignoring it either but being able to use our capacity to

137
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:35,440
look and investigate what's really going on here so i see this uh i see this

138
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:41,280
as a capacity to do two things at once the capacity to know or three things to

139
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:47,920
know we're uncomfortable to be okay with that

140
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:53,119
enough so that we either look and see more deeply what's happening

141
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:59,200
or we dedicate ourselves to the tasks at hand we do what needs to be done

142
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:06,880
even if we're uncomfortable so for example giving a public speech for some people is very uncomfortable

143
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:13,040
but to learn to be comfortable with discomfort might mean yes i'm uncomfortable and i'm not going to hold

144
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:18,960
back i'm not going to go up there to the stage i'm going to go up there and just stand there and i'm going to do it and

145
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:25,920
not going to be held back by the discomfort i'm not going to be inhibited by the discomfort but i'll

146
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,280
know it's uncomfortable so this ability to look and hold all

147
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:38,560
this i think is one of the great skills that we can learn from this practice of

148
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:44,480
mindfulness and it requires a little bit or lot it takes

149
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:50,160
not don't be discouraged or upset

150
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:56,079
or avoidant of discomfort that occurs while you're meditating

151
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:02,400
don't hold up a standard that meditation is only supposed to be relaxing and calm and blissful or whatever it might you

152
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,920
might think it is sometimes the greatest growth in

153
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:14,160
inner growth can happen when we're willing to practice with our discomfort

154
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:20,000
when meditation is uncomfortable don't go make yourself uncomfortable for this lesson

155
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,760
but when discomfort comes don't shy away from it don't feel like oh this is not the day

156
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:32,079
to meditate this might be the ideal day to meditate you might learn more about freedom more

157
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:39,680
about yourself more about your reactivity and more about how to not give in to to discomfort

158
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:44,960
if you sit with it upright clear present and really

159
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:51,119
practice mindfulness of it it might feel how it is in the body feel how it is in your attitudes your

160
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:56,560
reactions so this week has been a call

161
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:02,560
for all of us me myself as well to

162
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:09,720
understand the value of practicing with discomfort

163
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:15,599
as i said yesterday sometimes when we give in to discomfort

164
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:22,079
we actually shortchange uh some of the most beautiful parts of what's possible in our life

165
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:28,800
we might be uncomfortable with love we might be uncomfortable with receiving gen generosity from others

166
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:34,000
we might be uncomfortable uh with honesty we might be uncomfortable all kinds of

167
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,000
things that interferes with rich social interactions

168
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:47,680
and to learn to be comfortable with the discomfort so that our love our generosity our care

169
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:53,520
our receptivity from others generosity other people's love can flow freely

170
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:59,599
is one of the advantages of being comfortable with discomfort

171
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:08,560
so thank you for this and um

172
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:15,359

173
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:21,839
comfort in this life including a comfort with discomfort
