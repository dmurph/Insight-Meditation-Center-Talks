29
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,519
as an expression of care for ourselves as well as leaning

30
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,959
into it even a little more now so leaning into it in the way of

31
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:35,599
oh this body this body this dear body that i

32
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:42,799
take for granted a lot of the time this amazing body

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:51,200
that functions it heals itself it breathes it

34
00:03:51,680 --> 00:04:00,239
processes food in ways that i have no idea how it even gets done these amazing chemical processes

35
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:06,239
and also if there's any challenges in the body any parts of the body that are

36
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,560
challenged hurting struggling

37
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,680

38
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:24,320
to those parts of the body so both grounding in the physicality and

39
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,400

170
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,960

171
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:56,160
typed everyone then i also read your name

172
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:02,000
so as i wait for your reflections or your

173
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:09,200
questions for your hands to be raised i'll just say that again what we did was

174
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:17,119
at the beginning just settling with the breath and the body taking refuge tilling the soil calming the mind

175
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:23,839
and then turning to the body both as the support the stability this connection

176
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:30,240
the body as the mother body as the child or for many people maybe kuan yin or the

177
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:39,599
buddha works better than the image of the mother so so wayne please

178
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:45,359
i i find that uh holding putting my hand on my belly

179
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:50,880
real really helps me stay in touch with my breathing

180
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:57,440
and and helps me come back quicker from when i notice my mind is

the delta variant our shared humanity no matter where we are in the world

201
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:38,640
we're sharing this so two reflections coming to me one person says i really

202
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,920
liked the guided experience as if being embodied by kuan yin then the buddha

203
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:51,119
felt so strong grounded and stable even if just for the moment beautiful

204
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:57,920
yay i'm delighted to hear that that uh report from the field that's great

205
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:04,319
that can just bring a sense of stability and another report coming in

206
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:12,319
thinking of my body as mother slash buddha and sending loving support metta to myself that way immediately

207
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:19,920
led me to be more protective of my physical body make it strong for long-term care of my

208
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:26,480
health smiley beautiful i haven't thought of my body in this way enough the rank of it beautiful

209
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:32,720
reflection beautiful insights both of these in chat and also those who

210
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:39,760
raised their hands thank you beautiful reflections and very

211
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:47,520
insightful lovely so how about we turn oh one more one more

212
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:53,200
coming when you nikki mentioned something like instead of the back and forth

213
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:59,200
holding both together came very much in handy there was a ping-pong going on

214
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:06,400
between pushing aches and pains away and befriending them making space for all was then possible

215
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:11,520
thank you oh lovely it's great making space for all

216
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:18,480
lovely yeah beautiful thank you for your practice everyone

217
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,920
such lovely reflections and i'm sure there are plenty more reflections and here

218
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:31,200
and now turning into small groups will have the chance to listen to each other and also share as

219
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:38,240
much or as little as you like sometimes actually listening to each other brings more up like oh

220
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:44,319
yeah that came up for me and i totally forgot that i noticed that during guided meditation

221
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:50,960
so these uh the group practice sangha practice is is very important part of our

222
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:58,160
practice here in happy hour so so the group size is usually roughly

223
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:04,240
three people three or four depending and we always start with just 15 seconds

224
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:10,160
of silent meta for ourselves and for each other for our bodies for each other's bodies

225
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:15,839
and then you can say and then you can go around

226
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:21,760
and say as little or as much as you like uh there's about we have six seven minutes in the group

227
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:28,079
so so i will open the groups now the rooms now take care of yourselves take care of

228
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,400

229
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:40,880
welcome back everyone welcome back the rooms are closed

230
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:49,200
we have a few minutes for any reflections that might have come up from listening

231
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:55,119
to others or listening to yourself sometimes when you hear yourself share your practice

232
00:46:55,119 --> 00:47:02,720
new insights come up or no questions or shared understanding or no understanding

233
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:08,720
so [Music] especially if you haven't shared this evening or recently you're welcome to

234
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:25,839
raise your hand we'd love to hear from you or you can type in chat

235
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:32,640
yes wayne i am talking a lot um well it's your first time at happy

236
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:39,599
hour so you have a lot of catching up did you tell us i was when we were we're one gentleman

237
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:47,760
mentioned about drinking caffeine in the morning and i i remember i didn't start drinking

238
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:52,800
caffeine until i was about 22 years old and i was at us

239
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:58,160
in a sashin at the zen center and i wondered where all the people went

240
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:04,000
in between or in between the zazen periods and so i thought well i'll follow them out and everybody was

241
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,680
heading to the coffee urn and i was wondering about

242
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:16,000
um my i guess my answer is that well i should just try now i drink i've been drinking coffee

243
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:23,200
ever since but uh use you know people i guess that's one of the things

244
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:28,400
coffee's always been used for is for stimulation and i was just wondering about

245
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:34,160
mindfulness and maybe practice sometimes without

246
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:40,400
drinking caffeine yeah i strongly i strongly recommend it i strongly recommend it actually yeah without

247
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:46,720
without caffeine or where yeah without caffeine without without get to to notice the state of your mind and heart without

248
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:52,720
caffeine and often when people come on retreat silent retreats and they've been used to drinking coffee

249
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:58,160
and they intentionally go they stop drinking to really be able to

250
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:04,160
observe their mind what happens without caffeine and then if they drink the effect of it so

251
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:09,839
yeah i highly recommend it way yeah thank you yeah definitely good practice

252
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:16,000
reflections jerry says it is amazing how one feels much less isolated

253
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:22,559
hearing the vulnerability of others yes absolutely yeah

254
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:29,440
marie christine says yes this is true jerry and yes and an agreement from patricia

255
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:35,280
it's so isn't it amazing how much less isolated one feels hearing

256
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:43,119
the vulnerability of others such a beautiful way to practice in community and melanie says totally

257
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:50,640
relate jerry my professor wrote this to me in an email once and i think of it often among my own

258
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:56,160
peers i find that the passage of time eventually corrodes the simplistic and

259
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:02,160
conformist notion of success that we are fed at a certain age we all

260
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:08,480
realize that nobody's life has been perfect and that it's empowering to share our

261
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:13,680
regrets or sadness or failures oh beautiful melanie thank you

262
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:18,880
for sharing that absolutely absolutely

263
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:26,240
yes this conformist notion of success it's simplistic and it corrodes and

264
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:32,720
when we actually share our vulnerabilities our sadness our regrets our pain

265
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:40,319
our failures and growth we come closer it's part of our common humanity we're all

266
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:47,760
human yeah so much more there it's it's the first noble truth in buddhism

267
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:54,240
stress pain dukkha failure challenge is a part of human life it's

268
