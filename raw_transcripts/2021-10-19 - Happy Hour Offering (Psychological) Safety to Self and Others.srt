1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:10,000
okay great so formally hello and welcome everyone dear

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,720
sangha to happy hour so so i missed you on friday i was

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,560
teaching a a day long part of a

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:29,039
leadership program i've been teaching in five month leadership training the reason why i mentioned that is that

5
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,399
one of the themes that um i was

6
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:41,040
sitting with and it's been a lie for me and i want to bring in that theme tonight is borrowed from

7
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,120
that context of what makes teams what makes you know

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,840
when you have when you are working or volunteering or

9
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,000
or even your family units you know you have a team of maybe you're throwing a party and you have you know people

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,560
you're working with so any team what makes teams

11
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,400
successful what makes teams really really work at their best and it turns out

12
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,880
that there's a lot of research about this and and google for example being

13
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:25,360
you know that there's so many scientists there and so they've done so many studies and it turns out that the number

14
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:33,040
one there are many value variables there are five they come up with but number one is psychological safety

15
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,320
wow isn't that interesting the number one factor that makes teams

16
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,159
really cohere and work and succeed psychological safety

17
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,840
which to me is ties in with meta i'll i'll tell i'll

18
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,840
say more in a minute but the idea of psychological safety from this context is

19
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,759
offering yourself and offering team members um

20
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:08,800
this the sense of you know they can disagree they can say what they want there's not

21
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,000
a sense of retribution you know people won't be shut down immediately

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
for voicing their opinion or if something is going wrong or for for making a mistake

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,440
making a mistake there's a sense of psychological safety it's okay

24
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,920
it's okay and those teams the teams that have psychological safety succeed the most

25
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,680
uh which makes sense right if something is not going right if people are scared

26
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,720
to speak up then it will continue to go off the rails but

27
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,879
that's one way people have the ability to brainstorm make mistakes take risks

28
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:54,400
so now let's take that idea for ourselves for

29
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,720
our team this team that is me with all my voices inside you know all

30
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:08,720
the the uh the ways i speak to myself the way that i show up the way that i put myself down

31
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:15,680
the way that i disagree with myself the ways i the way i tell myself stop you can't think that you made a mistake bad

32
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:23,120
bad bad so as a person as a being with all these

33
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,560
voices that come up for us internally

34
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,080
how can we offer ourselves psychological safety so that's what i like to bring in

35
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,840
tonight as as a practice of meta and also

36
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:47,599
to tie it into meta in the following way remember the first phrase of metta

37
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:55,360
is may i be safe from inner and outer harm may you be safe from inner and outer

38
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,480
harm ah safety hello

39
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,920
here it is you see the connection this idea of offering safety especially

40
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:13,599
to ourselves may i be safe from inner harm and inner harm is the harm that we call

41
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,639
ourselves through not offering ourselves this

42
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,759
sense of safety the sense of psychological safety not opening our own heart

43
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:30,320
to ourselves so so [Music]

44
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:37,280
that's the connection i like to bring in for the practice of method tonight offering ourselves

45
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:44,400
safety offering other safety so that people feel safe in our presence

46
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,240
they can disagree they can say what what's on their mind and it's okay

47
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,680
we won't shut them down right away we won't be angry we have the sense of

48
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,120
stability and resilience and open heart to be curious they can

49
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,639
make mistakes they can fail yay they can fail

50
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:13,440
and not be quote-unquote perfect and it's okay they can feel safe we can offer

51
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:19,420
people safety psychological safety the safety so

52
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:25,199
[Music] in meta practice safety is number one is

53
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:32,160
the first phrase of the four phrases and in research in multi-variable

54
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,479
research and industry and you know various places psychological research oh

55
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,840
it turns out psychological safety too is number one far more than the composition

56
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,039
of teams etc etc so i think that is

57
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,479
not surprising not surprising at all so

58
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,919
ah with that as the setup let's

59
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:08,400
practice let's begin so so i'd like to invite you invite us

130
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:58,720
couch potato it turns out that through offering our

131
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:06,360
self-safety with care and compassion we take more responsibility

132
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,000
so see how that feels internally for you

133

notice if there can be more ease and peace in your heart and your body and your mind

145
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:33,360

146
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:40,240
jerk the mind back into the present moment with force but just gently

147
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:46,320
it's okay dear it's all right ah

148
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,600
sense of ease it's all right it's part of this training this is how we trained

149
00:26:51,600 --> 00:27:00,279
our mind our puppy gently gently returning every time

150
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:20,880
now you can stay with yourself offering safety kindness

151
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:27,279
as an expression of mental loving kindness to yourself as a part of this training

152
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:31,279
the most important part of this training

153
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:39,200
so either stay with yourself or if you like

154
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:46,000
and consider someone in your life or someone's in your life you like to

155
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:55,039
offer more safety too from you for more psychological safety too

00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:20,799
the ones you are considering in your mind's eye right now

165
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,639
may i be safe for myself and others

166
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:48,080
may i allow space for ease for mistakes

167
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,640
for imperfection in myself and others

168
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:09,840
i feel the goodness in myself and others

169
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,120
offering safety from judgment

170
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:01,240
and ill will internally and externally

171
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:56,640
recognizing you're doing the best you can so are others

172
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:04,518
given all the causes and conditions that have come to be

173
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:41,919
every time you find your mind has wondered relax into safety some more

174
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:51,000
into ease no need to judge yourself

00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,159
relax

176
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,839
and for the last moments of this practice period together

177
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,960
offering offering yourself safety from judgment

178
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,960
from however this practice period was so you were sleepy the mind was

179
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:14,480
distracted it's okay you showed up you did your best

180
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,200

181
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:27,760
it's okay offering appreciation yay i showed up as

182
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,880
best as i could

183
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,599
it's the best any of us can do

184
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:44,320
trusting there is goodness there's goodness and just showing up even with

185
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:50,320

192

[Music]

193
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,359
thanks everyone thank you for your practice

194
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:05,839
ah safety

195
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:14,880
so the more i have practiced with metta

196
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:20,800
the more i have discovered that it's not accidental

197
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:27,839
that the first of the four phrases of meta have to do with safety

198
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:35,440
i'll say all four phrases traditionally they are may i may you be safe from inner and outer

199
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:41,359
harm may i you be happy may i you be healthy

200
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:49,280
may i you have ease in our lives so safety happiness health

201
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:55,680
and ease are the four wishes of course we can change them many teachers change

202
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:02,240
it and it's all fine and you can change them to be whatever worked for you

203
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:09,839
so in some teachers shift didn't change it make happy to be

204
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:17,599
number one may you be happy start with that and safety comes at the end that's how originally i had started to practice

205
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:23,280
with may i may you be happy being the first one and then later when i was starting to step into the

206
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:29,520
role of you know being a teacher and sharing the dharma i looked at the order and he looked like

207
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:36,720
oh safety is first i wonder why so i practiced that way intensely i

208
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:43,920
remember one retreat it was a month-long retreat meant to retreat where i did

209
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:50,800
happy as first and realized wow there needs to be i'm sorry i need i

210
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:58,000
need i did safety is first ah let me rewind i did safety as the first

211
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,520
one as canonically off suggested that you do may i be safe may you be safe as the

212
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:09,680
first wish of the four i discovered that this wish for safety is so

213
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:16,800
fundamental this feeling safe feeling safe our bodies and mind and heart is so

214
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:24,319
fundamental it's really it's it's what holds everything else it holds happiness and health and and

215
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:29,520
ease until you have a sense of safety in your heart in your mind

216
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:36,480
and also um it ties in with the attachment theory of bolby's attachment theory in terms of

217
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:43,280
safety in our hearts anyway there's so much ears and and now also this connection to the world of research

218
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:52,000
about teams and work offering ourselves and each other safety so safety what an important

219
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:59,040
[Music] gift to cultivate it's a gift to cultivate gift to cultivate for

220
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:04,960
ourselves for others so i'd like to invite you to share reflections

ah our hearts feel more ease did any of you try especially you know

230
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:11,839
when your minds went um off to say it's okay dear it's okay sweetie

231
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:17,838
and kind of easing into safety a little more did you try that

232
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,280
yerba says this meditation made me feel cozy and empowered ah thank you here but

233
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:30,480
i'm so happy to hear that yay cozy and empowered beautiful

234
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:37,040
dimensions of just feeling contented and a sense of empowerment coming out of that thank you

235
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:44,000
yerba aurora says this was very timely in the middle of a covet scare and really

236
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,920
needed to offer myself safety ah thank you aurora yeah

237
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:56,520
safety yeah safety to our minds

238
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:07,040
another share it was a difficult sit initially because i have been having trouble feeling safe

239
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:13,119
in my body due to some health challenges so when i remembered safety i decided to

240
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:19,359
lay on the floor with a blanket and it helped soften some of the edges fantastic

241
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:24,640
great i am delighted to hear the inner wisdom

242
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:29,760
to to say hey body's feeling challenged

243
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:35,760
and lying down with a blanket with just blankets make us feel safe right

244
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:43,440
safety blanket and and softening the edges beautiful thank you for sharing that beautiful yeah delighted to

245
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:50,079
to hear how that came up and how you worked with that thanks for that share

246
00:43:53,520 --> 00:44:00,960
the other reflections i was asking if anyone tried the being kind especially kind to your mind

247
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:06,880
when it goes off mary says in practicing first to give myself safety i was able to see how a

248
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:12,720
friend who's often critical of me perhaps is not feeling safe themselves

249
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:18,800
i was able to offer safety for them oh beautiful what a beautiful insight

250
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:25,280
what a beautiful insight yeah that's often the case when people feel threatened

251
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:32,000
themselves then it's it's hard for them to offer safety to others both with friendships and also

252
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,040
in work relationships jamie says it was nice to be preoccupied

253
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:43,200
and then distracted and then sleepy and no it was all okay yes great yeah sense

254
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:48,640
of safety and and jamie did you when when you noticed all that and it's

255
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:53,680
like oh was it a sense of ease and safety um that

256
00:44:53,680 --> 00:45:00,400
just said like it's okay i don't have to feel bad about it it's like so the one yeah you see your nod and smile yes

257
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:06,720
and so then that moment that actually one comes to like oh yes there's a depth there's a settling that can happen in

258
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:13,440
that moment when there is safety if you notice that it's like yeah the mind was sleepy in here like

259
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:19,440
ah now i can settle let's notice that moment it can be

260
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:28,000
very nourishing very nourishing lovely yay internal safety

261
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:34,000
so dear ones let's turn into small groups and see if

262
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,920
we can continue to offer ourselves safety and offer each other safety

263
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:46,560
and let the rubber meet the road of of relating to each other

264
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:53,839
in this sphere and the space of safety so important to practice and and if

265
00:45:53,839 --> 00:46:01,119
you're on the edge if you're like oh no no i don't feel safe getting into small groups maybe stretch stretch yourself

266
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:07,440
just a tiny bit given that this is the theme see what it feels what it feels like

267
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:12,640
so one reflection i notice that when we are

268
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:17,760
in breakout rooms i feel safer when talk taking the time to do a few seconds of

269
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:24,400
sitting quietly before we share to know that i'm with like-minded folks beautiful yay

270
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:32,560
so we'll do that again tonight we'll start with a 15 30 seconds of meta silently for

271
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:38,880
yourselves for each other offering safety to each other to yourselves in silence

272
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:45,920
and then share as much as little as you wish about your your practice take care of

273
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:54,000
yourselves take care of each other and the rooms are created and now they

274
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,760
are open here we go okay

275
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:07,280
welcome back everyone the rooms are closed so we have um a few minutes for any reflections that

276
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:12,960
came up for you that you liked each that you like to share please

277
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:20,400
especially if you haven't spoken for a while neil please

278
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:28,960
so this practice reminded me of a time i went horseback riding when i was six years old

279
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:35,359
maybe seven i don't really recall it was just me and my dad my dad's standing right i don't think he ever

280
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:40,400
touched a horse if he could avoid it um you know he was a brooklyn boy

281
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:46,800
um and we were in a little corral i was just going around in circles and some horses

282
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:53,839
galloped on by and my horse took off it was like crazy you know

283
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:59,280
and my dad he didn't yell stop neil right instead he jumped in front of the

284
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:06,319
horse right i don't know what he was thinking i'm sure he didn't know either but you know sort of you know i keep

285
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:11,920
thinking about that because it kind of like was obvious to him telling me to stop was pointless

286
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:16,960
you know i was not the one in control of that right i was being taken for the ride

287
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:22,720
you know you know and there would be no point you know him yelling at me for having not stopped the horse would have

288
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:27,760
been ludicrous right i mean gosh i didn't want it to do that either

289
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:34,480
um you know so that thought came to mind here tonight you know you know you know sometimes

290
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:40,319
your mind just takes you for a ride and you just have to figure out how to manage it

291
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:45,520
hopefully not getting run over and trampled in the process

292
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:52,240
yeah thank you neil i appreciate what you're talking about is really a lesson

293
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:59,359
in you know thanks for sharing the story first of all and and how frightening that must have been as a little boy for the

294
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:05,359
for this horse to just take off and your dad trying to support and also his wisdom not to say you know shouted you

295
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:11,760
but realize yeah but just you know you're not in control and having the same sense of oh yeah my mind i'm not

296
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,880
always in control of my mind and that's really an insight into anata not self

297
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:24,000
it's like it's impersonal you can't say my damn it it's you know bad it's like oh sweetie it's okay you're running off

298
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,640
again okay come come so it can only tame it or train it with with this gentleness

299
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:36,240
with this kindness yeah thank you thank you

300
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:40,040
jesse please

301
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:54,480
hey thanks uh yeah just uh along the lines of what you said about the mind wandering what struck me today is that

302
00:49:54,480 --> 00:50:01,920
it really is just a fantastic opportunity to practice kindness right at that moment and i was wondering

303
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:09,440
if you are recommending like saying a specific different other phrase like so like i'm normally saying

304
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:15,839
may i be safe maybe happy but then when my mind wanders i'm drifting off i'm just wondering if that's

305
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:22,160
um should i say like good job or welcome back or you know i'm just wondering what what types of

306
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:28,319
how i could be supportive to myself in that specific moment of noticing that the mind has wandered

307
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:33,440
yeah yeah yeah very good very good point so so it's um

308
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:39,119
what um what feeds what supports what nourishes

309
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:46,000
you know there is the carrot and there's the stick right method so the moment that you realize that you know you

310
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,040
become awake you know your mind has been gone forever many minutes right just

311
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:57,760
minds do that and and the moment you become awake instead of going oh bad mind you've been

312
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:03,280
gone right and so and you're and so you're not you know

313
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:09,680
but i'm giving the complete picture and i'm going to get to your the details every question for a moment and now you're asking so in that moment do i

314
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:17,200
just bring it back and continue and say may i be safe you know continue the practice or do i actually acknowledge in

315
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:24,240
that moment do i do something more in that moment so great so in that moment it is helpful it

316
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:30,400
does feed it will like it's a carrot to actually celebrate

317
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:37,040
that moment to actually say yay i'm awake now oh sweetie it's okay come back you know it's something positive you

318
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:42,640
know bringing something positive in that moment instead of definitely not something negative like how bad you were

319
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:48,960
sleepy and and and neutral is fine but it's kind of nice to bring in yay just a

320
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:57,040
little bit of a smile oh yeah a moment of awakeness yeah i'm awake now i'm yay and

321
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:04,960
oh or or what i was suggesting tonight like it's okay it's okay there's a sense of comfort there oh it's okay and so try

322
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:12,480
that yeah it's okay when you find yourself you've been gone and see if that it's okay with kindness

323
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:19,119
if it lands you deeper than just going back so that's what my

324
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:24,319
recommendation is you experiment with it for a while and some

325
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:30,160
you know or for a long time so yes does that does that make sense

326
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:35,520
thank you great thank you jesse christine over time so this needs to be really

327
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:40,000
quiet really quick or i'll stay over time

328
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:46,640
not sure what you're saying my dear oh okay yeah

329
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:52,400
it just occurs to me um that i i think when when david sat in

330
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:59,200
for you was he was that he's sitting in for you here at happy hour where did i hear him yeah and he

331
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:04,559
suggested when when you come back well that when my mind goes away it is always

332
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:09,839
going it is always going somewhere to try to make me safe

333
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:14,960
it's going somewhere to try to figure something out to make me safe right

334
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:20,319
and so he suggested when you come back to say oh thank you for

335
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:27,760
working so hard to try to make me safe like um great great that's that's it

336
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:34,880
whatever positive thing you put in there whether say it's okay sweetie welcome back or thank you as long as it's it's a

337
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:41,200
positive reinforcement you whatever works for you christine as long as it's a positive reinforcement
