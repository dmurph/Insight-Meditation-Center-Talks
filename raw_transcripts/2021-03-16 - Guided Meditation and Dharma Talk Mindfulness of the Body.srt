1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:07,200
so welcome again we'll begin on the evening sit

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,519
and so today what i thought ah share is a practice

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:19,439
that a buddha often praises in his teaching that is mindfulness of

4
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,800
body and so in our sitting today

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,880
we'll be working with this aspect of becoming aware of our body in

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,160
different ways and there are a total was of seven different

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:43,840
practices that's been introduced um that are included in mindfulness of

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:51,680
and so we'll do some of this today as you arrive

9
00:00:51,680 --> 00:01:00,160
i invite you to you know however you are coming to this meditation

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:07,280
maybe just begin to pay attention to your general posture if you're just

11
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,360
settling down sitting maybe just becoming aware that you're

12
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:20,880
sitting as a way to arrive arrive into the space

13
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,759
and if you're still standing or walking in some way

14
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:41,680
just noticing the posture you're in maybe you're lying down

15
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,799
simple awareness and global awareness

16
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,719
and then momentarily as you take a seat sitting down

17
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:09,840
allow the whole body to arrive

18
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:26,720
maybe the sense of arrival can become obvious

19
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:36,560
when we really know that we are here

20
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,800
maybe feet are touching the ground

21
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:51,840
maybe the back links against the chair

22
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:05,840
are the legs against the cushion

23
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,680
buddy and feel and sense that all parts of the body

24
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,760
have arrived

25
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,440
arrived here in the space

26
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,840
torso arms hands

27
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,639
and face your head

28
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:29,840
and neck aligned on top of the spine

29
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,120
may be supported by earth

30
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,759
what does it feel like when the whole body has arrived here

31
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:11,840
maybe the sense of a bubbly energy is the sinking settling down

32
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:25,840
maybe the thoughts drifted in the background

33
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,520
as you begin to settle

34
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:09,600
allow your awareness to rest on the breath in breath

35
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:21,440
and out breath as you breathe

36
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:35,120
becoming mindful of the in and out breathing

37
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,240
so awareness is very simple

38
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:51,599
simply noticing if the breath is soft and gentle

39
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,440
with a soft and gentle breath

40
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,280
now the breath is a little rough

41
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,639
it's a rough breath

42
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:18,720
if the brush breath is shallow just know it's a shallow breath

43
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:28,240
however the breath is simply knowing it

44
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,840
as is

45
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:45,280
not trying to change it manipulate it control it

46
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:59,840
it's simple annoying

47
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:23,839
easing into the breath

48
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:45,279
as the breath travels moves through the body

49
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,800
allow the body to be massaged

50
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:19,839
maybe the whole body can be more at ease

51
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,040
and sensing and feeling the breath

52
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:47,839
moving through the torso

53
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,399
maybe the sensations of the breath rolling

54
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:04,399
on the back or in front

55
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:14,880
around the chest and belly

56
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:29,839
maybe the breath is massaging inside of the ball of the body as well

57
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:57,839
temporarily we can put away the thoughts and plans for now

58
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,639
it's becoming intimate and curious

59
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,360
with this embodied experience

60
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:39,839
embodied experience of the breathing

61
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:20,639
as the mind settles

62
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:28,240
one of the contemplations that's taught as part of a mindfulness

63
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,000
body is to contemplate the different parts of

64
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,600
the body this body that we call as the body

65
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,839
is made up of different component

66
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:53,680
parts from outside of the body our hair

67
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,680
nails skin

68
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,519
moving inward there's flesh

69
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,240
underneath of the skin

70
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:30,880
and the bones feeling the hardness of the bones

71
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:45,760
there are organs inside

72
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,959
different fluids

73
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:59,839
blood fat

74
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:13,839
saliva this body is made

75
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:27,839
of all these different parts

76
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:32,240
there's a different parts of the body there's no inherent beauty

77
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,839
or ugliness it's just what it is

78
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:51,839
different parts coming together

79
00:16:53,199 --> 00:17:01,920
we can also contemplate and reflect the elemental nature of our bodies

80
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:10,880
this body is made of earth water fire

81
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:19,839
and air

82
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:34,640
earthy quality of the body maybe you feel the heaviness of the body

83
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,320
hardness of our bones

84
00:17:43,750 --> 00:18:01,840
[Music] firm relatively still and scented

85
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,840
what's the felt sense of air element

86
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,799
in breath and out breath

87
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,840
maybe vibrations

88
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,840
tinkling

89
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,960
temperature

90
00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:01,440
maybe you notice the warmth of the palms

91
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,960
and the coolness

92
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,200
on some part of the skin that may be

93
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,840
exposed

94
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,559
what's the felt sense of the water element

95
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,720
maybe there is a sense of the harmony of the whole body

96
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:10,399
the whole body feels coherent harmonious

97
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:35,840
brought together by the water elements

98
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,159
in this body there is element of the space

99
00:20:54,799 --> 00:21:00,559
space inside of this body and all around

100
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:17,840
this body is held within the space

101
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,200
letting go of the bigger concepts of the body

102
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,880
we drop into the raw felt sense of the body

103
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,840
elemental sensations

104
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,840
movements

105
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:41,039
pressure around the neck

106
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:55,840
some tingling on the fingertips

107
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:23,840
maybe vitality humming in this body

108
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:05,840
all that we experience are ever changing

109
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:33,840
breath rises and passes away

110
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:47,840
different sensations

111
00:24:47,919 --> 00:25:01,840
appear and disappear

112
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,039
the whole experience

113
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:56,320
maybe you like the flux of wavelets

114
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,720
sounds travel through

115
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:12,879
thoughts bubbles up and burst away

116
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,559
sensations in the body

117
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:39,840
get soaked bubbles

118
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:40,720
let go of any attempt to try to hang on

119
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,840
to a particular experience

120
00:28:54,399 --> 00:29:13,840
let loose all the experiences

121
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,258
[Music]

122
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:03,508
[Music]

123
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:34,840
so mindfulness of body something i have in mind to share

124
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:41,760
tonight and so in poly canon text and the buddha often

125
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:52,399
praises and um talks about the mindfulness of body

126
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:59,279
he says the mindfulness of the body when cultivated and developed is of a

127
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:04,640
great fruit and a benefit

128
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:11,679
so i thought i'd share a little bit of the teachings of a mindfulness body based on the poly canon text

129
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:17,120
specifically and this uh suta and the title of the

130
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:22,640
suitor is mindfulness of the body and the susuta can be found

131
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:28,880
and in machu nikaya 119 for those who you know might be

132
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:35,278
interesting looking it up so much money kaya 1 19.

133
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:44,559
so mindfulness of the body is also often emphasized

134
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:50,640
in secular mind mindfulness meditation teachings

135
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:57,440
and in secular mindfulness teachings and often the teachers would start with

136
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:05,600
mindfulness of body for example mindfulness of breath are becoming aware of

137
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:12,000
and the sensations in the body and through this kind of awareness of what

138
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:19,360
is happening in this lived experience in the body we began to cultivate our capacity

139
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:25,200
to live in the present moment with more clarity

140
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:33,440
the mindfulness body however in the poly canon teaching

141
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:40,840
is much more on extended expansive and has a profound

142
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:47,120
implications and so buddha on one buddha taught

143
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:54,960
mindfulness of a body and the whole sequence of the practices that's introduced

144
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:03,120
in mindfulness of body are meant to lead all the way to full awakening liberation

145
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:11,840
in addition to many other benefits and that may be available to oneself

146
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,640
and so i want to share a little bit about this sequence of practices that the susuta

147
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:25,840
talked about and some of them are not very

148
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:34,240
not often taught in secular mindfulness teachings however they can be quite profound

149
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:42,159
and so this mindfulness of body teaching consists of seven different practices

150
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:49,120
and that are ordered in a particular sequence i can be thought as a progressive

151
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,159
sequence to cultivate mindfulness in somebody

152
00:33:54,159 --> 00:34:02,720
and through which through the sequence of a practice one can have um a great clarity

153
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:09,599
into the very nature of this body which is according to the three key

154
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:17,760
insights and that is an impermanence

155
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:26,079
non-satisfactoriness of this body and that cannot be identified as self

156
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:32,000
anata so through these forms of insights it

157
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,878
becomes possible to have a complete destruction of defilements and that leads to full

158
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:44,398
awakening so what are the seven different

159
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:49,599
practices so i'm gonna give you this list of the

160
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:57,359
seven first and so you maybe orient your mind a little bit to this list of seven and then i'll walk

161
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:04,079
through each of this and in some form of a sequence and to say a few words about each of them

162
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:09,520
so this list of the seven uh in poly canon text it starts over the

163
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:17,839
mindfulness of breathing and however in the chinese parallel

164
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:23,520
of the poly canon text mindfulness breathing actually is number

165
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:30,240
three in this sequence and which i'll say a few words and um

166
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:36,240
the sequencing a little bit later but i just started with the list number one

167
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:41,680
mindfulness breathing the second one is awareness of the four

168
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:49,279
postures that is walking standing sitting down and lying down

169
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:58,160
the third is awareness of the bodily activity and that is if you're bending down

170
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:04,079
you know you're bending down if you're eating you know you're eating if you're cooking you know you're

171
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:10,480
cooking and so whatever you're doing in terms of bodily activities

172
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:16,880
and you know that this is happening so that's number three awareness of the

173
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:22,839
bodily activities number four is the contemplation of the

174
00:36:22,839 --> 00:36:28,720
anatomical parts as a different parts of the body

175
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:37,119
contemplation of that this body is made up of different parts component parts

176
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:45,359
number five is contemplation of the four elements earth water fire

177
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:53,440
and air in other suitors it also talks about the fifth element which is space but not

178
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,240
in this particular suta and number six is the corpse

179
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:04,480
contemplation contemplation of the different stages of decay

180
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:11,839
of the dead body corpse number seven is the four jhanas which is

181
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:16,560
the four stages of samadhi

182
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:24,320
and so it's very interesting to look at the sequence to see what is happening with

183
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:31,200
this sequence and then for me it made a little more

184
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:38,320
sense that the mindfulness of breathing is number three and the whole sequence starts with

185
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:45,599
something that is relatively easy to know very simple intuitive and

186
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:52,160
quite global and so for most of the folks who began to practice engage in a

187
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:58,079
mindfulness body practice that's the first few are relatively easy

188
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:05,680
easily accessible so for example being aware of our postures

189
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:12,079
and we all know that we have some sort of posture and we're aware of it and so the practice is

190
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:17,359
to simply know that oh you know i'm standing right here i'm

191
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:25,040
standing or on if you're lying down just aware that you're lying down very

192
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:33,680
light weight noticing just know and then on the awareness of a body the

193
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:40,960
activities is also something very um relatable and maybe

194
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:47,760
comparing to the first practice it has a little more detail and so you are you're now paying

195
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:55,760
attention to different activities as you uh go about your daily life and so

196
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:03,599
um it's maybe has a little more detail than adjusted the four postures

197
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:12,240
and then after that um mindfulness free thing so now we're settling down to a more

198
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:18,880
settled state of being where we began to pay attention to some

199
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:26,240
details of the activity and as a whole sequence of seven unfolds and

200
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:34,160
you get a sense that there is a um a growing sense of settledness

201
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:40,960
and the subtlety and um collectedness and so the

202
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:47,520
strength of uh samadhi and mindfulness began to build up as we

203
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:54,880
practice in this way starting from the first practice mindfulness of

204
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:00,800
awareness of the posture awareness of the bodily activities

205
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,560
and yet you know the practice doesn't have to go in sequence exactly like this you know

206
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:14,960
for most of us and we may practice in one particular one uh in different situations

207
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:21,760
and then just practice with that for quite some time so for example becoming aware of

208
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:28,560
on the bodily postures and bodily activities and it was a

209
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:36,480
you know a practice that i engaged in for quite some time and especially at the beginning of my um

210
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,880
meditation practice i didn't have a regular formal

211
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:50,400
meditation sitting um but um i was still interested in cultivating

212
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,599
mindfulness and so i incorporated just noticing

213
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:03,200
my activities as i go about and living my life in daily life

214
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:10,400
and it has an effect because becoming aware of our coarser level

215
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:17,680
postures and body activities in action it began to cultivate and tone our

216
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:25,280
mindfulness muscle and as we actually sit down

217
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:32,240
when we begin to sit down if we had cultivated this mindfulness

218
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:41,440
in our daily life by noticing various activities as we we do them and

219
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:48,960
the sitting meditation can be more easily settling so one can settle down but much

220
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:54,240
more quickly but if you know during the day um

221
00:41:54,240 --> 00:42:01,040
you know whatever you're doing you're very preoccupied with thinking this thinking that and and you

222
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:07,760
know for example if you're cooking uh instead of noticing that you're cooking and you

223
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:15,440
know taking this spatula of flipping and the pancakes you're simply thinking about

224
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:21,040
all kinds of things and then we have lost opportunities to really begin to

225
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:28,560
atone our mindfulness muscle and as we sit down and to do our formal meditation

226
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:36,800
our mind can still have this momentum to jump here and there i'm busy uh engaging in all kinds of

227
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:44,160
um mental activities so this uh first few a couple of

228
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:50,800
mindful body practices can be a great way to really set the

229
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:59,838
conditions up for us to go into more formal meditation practice

230
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:07,599
but they they can also be complementary to formal meditation practice and some people do formal

231
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:13,280
walking meditation on retreats or daily life and that itself

232
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:20,480
can be a a very meditative meditative process as well

233
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:28,400
and as this process goes on the next um practice that's being

234
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:34,000
introduced is mindfulness of in and out breathing

235
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:41,280
in this particular suture mindfulness of a breathing and that's being described here uh

236
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,400
includes um the four steps of mindfulness breathing that is

237
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:54,079
noticing in and out breathing as it is and as you breathe in and out

238
00:43:54,079 --> 00:44:02,000
begin to calm and settle the body and so in our meditation uh before this

239
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:10,000
talk um we did a little bit of that and kind of as we began to breathe in and out

240
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:17,520
this process itself can begin to settle the body and allow the body to become

241
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:25,599
quieter and calmer and some of you may know that um

242
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:32,160
mindfulness breathing itself and can be a whole system a

243
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,200
comprehensive process of its own that leads to full awakening

244
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:45,040
and that process consists of the 16 steps that go through mindfulness breathing

245
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:52,079
that allows the body to come calm down and then allow the mind to settle and

246
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:58,480
then um go through the process to cultivate the joy and this trunk

247
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:06,480
tranquility and um also leading to seeing on the inside and the nature of our

248
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:12,079
experiences and so that that itself is a 16 step

249
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:18,880
of process in this suta it's the first four steps and that are

250
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:26,400
related to calming and easing the body that's being brought here

251
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:36,319
and then but it has an effect because as we go through on this mindfulness breathing

252
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:44,079
process when our bodies become to come down the next few

253
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:50,319
practices that are introduced become more relevant become more available to

254
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:55,680
us and so for example the next practice that's been introduced

255
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:03,519
in the susuta is the contemplation of the analytical parts

256
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:08,880
so this is a a contemplation that is

257
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:15,920
not taught often in secular mindfulness some teachers also teach contemplation

258
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:23,920
of analytical parts but it's not very popular and and yet in and the mindfulness of

259
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:29,520
body teaching and it's quite a significant um

260
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:36,800
practice of its own so what you can um one way to understand this particular

261
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:43,920
teaching is that as we become a calmer in relationship to our body we can begin

262
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:51,760
to see this body in a bit more uh raw form rather than a bigger conceptual

263
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:59,680
framework of what this body is you know whether it's beautiful or ugly kind of all this other conceptual things

264
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:04,720
begin to kind of fade out but we can begin to see

265
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:10,000
this body as it is in terms of its componentary

266
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:17,040
and parts and so the classic teaching is to see this

267
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:24,319
body in terms of the 32 parts or 31 parts starting from and the

268
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:29,839
uh exterior part of our body you know body hairs and

269
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:36,800
skin the nails and then go through this process and and begin to contemplating internal of the

270
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:44,880
body also and all the way to um you know our flesh

271
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:52,559
bones fat um and the body liquids even including our urine

272
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:59,520
and um so you you know you ask why why do we do this contemplation

273
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:07,040
and that's probably not very popular because if we began to look at this body

274
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:15,040
in this way often our immediate reaction could be you know some form of aversion of

275
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:20,480
repulsiveness and so maybe that that's kind of why

276
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:30,000
it's not very popular teaching uh in contemplation of our mindfulness of the body teachings

277
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:35,680
but the buddha prescribed this specific teaching

278
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:43,920
as a way to really point at some strong forces of craving illness in particular

279
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:49,200
craving for essential pressures it's not very hard to see that

280
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:56,160
uh that you know many people and most of us probably have a strong

281
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:01,200
clinging to our bodies one way or another

282
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:08,480
i'm aware and that even for kids when they are very young they will

283
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:15,440
begin to have some sense of how they wanted to be seen from

284
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:23,200
the image perspective you know what to wear and how long a hair is

285
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:30,319
and as and the kids grow older you know in teenager years young adults

286
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:38,160
body images and you know can be become so defining for who we are

287
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:46,480
i can certainly relate to this myself and as we get older we we can get

288
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:54,720
very obsessed with our health our the aging process

289
00:49:55,839 --> 00:50:03,440
and so it's not hard to see that you know that there can be a lot of cleaning and grasping

290
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:11,839
in relationship to this body and the buddha has um really seen this

291
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:18,400
that in you know kind of a human psyche and so he prescribed

292
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:23,520
this kind of contemplation to begin to see this

293
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:31,920
as is not something to be um cling to as you know beautiful

294
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:39,599
or repulsive against as ugly but just as this is what

295
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:44,720
what is what the body is made up of

296
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:51,680
and yet you know as we began to engage in a practice like this the

297
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:58,079
contemplation of the analytical part there can also be some danger because

298
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:04,319
for those who do have a very negative and repulsive relationship

299
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:11,359
with one's own body and this form of practice can can lead to

300
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:17,520
um i don't know depression or it may be even self-harm

301
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:24,480
and so it's a wise to really tune in to what kind of attitude we may have

302
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:30,559
and maybe even work with the teachers and to engage with this kind of practices so

303
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:36,000
that one can move with this practice move into this practice

304
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:42,640
with a more balanced mind in the suta and the simile that is being

305
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:48,800
used to describe this particular form of practice is that as if

306
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:55,200
one is looking into a bag of mixed lentils and mixed rice

307
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:01,359
and and knows that you know the red lentil is red lentil black lentil is

308
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:06,880
a black lentil and this is the way to look at you know here the body has all those different

309
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:14,960
parts just like you know the bag of lentils and rice mixed up here and so there's no

310
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:21,920
attitude of um indulging or attitude of

311
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:29,040
pushing away and so it's a very neutral way of looking at things as is

312
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:35,359
and so that's contemplation of the analytical parts

313
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:41,440
now moving from there the next practice that's being introduced in this

314
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:47,839
sequence is the contemplation of the four elements

315
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:56,079
and so what is happening is um in this stage now one

316
00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:03,760
once contemplation of reflection or observing of this body

317
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:11,119
is now moving into more of a felt sense of what this body is

318
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:18,000
now this may not be very obvious if one just began to practice

319
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:24,640
mindfulness body because it's not very common for one to relate to this

320
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:30,000
body at this level which can be not very intuitive

321
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:36,720
or hard to be accessible at the beginning but if we practiced

322
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:43,280
as and this sequence unfolds we began to see that once mindfulness

323
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:50,160
maybe began to grow one is able to let go of some of the higher level

324
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:55,440
concepts and ideas but now one is able to drop into

325
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:00,800
the raw and felt sense of what this body feels like

326
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:07,359
so the elemental natures of this body the firmness of the earthy part of the

327
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:12,720
body and the air are movements of them

328
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:19,040
of the body and then the space all around us inside us

329
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:24,800
and so contemplation of the four elements allow us to begin to cultivate even

330
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:32,558
further what this body is in the elemental level the raw level

331
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:41,520
and so this particular practice based on the contemplation of the four

332
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:47,920
elements and can also cultivate a strong sense of

333
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:54,480
ease and settledness and so this allows the next

334
00:54:54,480 --> 00:55:01,119
practice to begin to become accessible so the next practice is

335
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:09,119
a corpse contemplation again this may be something kind of a provocative in

336
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:16,000
our modern um secular mindfulness teachings

337
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,838
and rarely you would hear people talk about corpse contemplation

338
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:27,680
yet the corpse contemplation serve on

339
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:36,720
a very um how do i say it very um critical step in this

340
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:41,760
cultivation and that is it's moving into a different

341
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:49,839
form of a perceiving the nature of this body

342
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:59,359
usually when we come to the notion of a death most

343
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:05,119
of us most people will have some sense of a denial even though we

344
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:12,240
all know that the death would happen but one would refuse to see it

345
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:19,680
but through this a process of cultivating how we see our bodies in this sequence

346
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:25,040
of our practices when it gets to corpse contemplation

347
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:30,559
a mind may be more settled and began to be willing to see

348
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:37,920
oh this body is of nature to age of the nature to be

349
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:45,520
sick and of the nature to die and even when this dead body

350
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:52,319
um even when the death happens this dead body go through its own

351
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:59,839
decomposition process will eventually go back to earth go back to nature

352
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:10,839
and since through seeing that this it can lead oneself to an insight into impermanence

353
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:19,040
unsatisfactoring of this body and the not self nature of this body

354
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:27,760
this body is not something that we can hang on it's not something permanent

355
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:33,839
and so this corpse contemplation began to bring in kind of front and

356
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:38,960
center this inside way of seeing inside way of seeing

357
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:45,839
the nature of this body anitra dukkah and anata

358
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:53,440
and when we began to be able to see this body in this way

359
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:59,760
there can be a profound sense of letting go as well

360
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:07,040
and so in this sequence and the seventh practice is that of the four genres

361
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:13,359
it's a cultivation of the four stages of samadhi

362
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:21,040
and this is impossible because when we began to see the nature of this

363
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:27,760
body there can be a strong sense of letting go letting go of grasping and cleaning

364
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:32,880
and when the clinging and grasping are let go of

365
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:41,359
a deeper sense of well-being can bubble up joy tranquility equanimity can become

366
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:51,040
available and that can become a platform for us to lead into

367
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:59,760
full liberation awakening and so this process that's described

368
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:08,400
prescribed by this particular suta that includes you know from a very

369
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:15,720
simple lightweight practice of being aware of our body postures body

370
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:23,319
activities to our breath and to noticing and reflecting

371
00:59:23,319 --> 00:59:31,520
contemplating that this body has made component parts and all the way to begin to notice

372
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:36,559
that there is a felt sense of this body

373
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:41,760
which is very elemental nature of this body

374
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:50,240
through this then the the uh samadhi becomes available to us

375
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:56,960
and this can lead to lead to um destruction of defilements

376
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:04,799
so this is really kind of a holistic system and that covers the uh

377
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:10,640
the entire spectrum spectrum of our practice

378
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:16,319
and this practice has a lot of benefits and the susuta itself i have highlighted

379
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:23,520
10 different benefits you know ranging from no longer being a victim of a desire

380
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:31,119
and a discontent no longer being a victim of fear and dread and have a stronger

381
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:38,240
capacity to endure the vicititudes of climate and hunger and disagreed and

382
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:43,920
disagreeable conditions all the way to

383
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:50,880
destruction of the developments as i mentioned before and it's a very

384
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:58,400
profound teaching and so i do hope that tonight's practice

385
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:05,599
and and this dharma talk is uh um a bit of an inspiration

386
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:13,839
for us to engage in this practice uh with a lot of curiosity and

387
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:19,920
maybe some dedication and so may this mindfulness of body

388
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:27,359
practice bring much benefit to all of us and to all beings thank you for being

389
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:32,799

390
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:46,880
