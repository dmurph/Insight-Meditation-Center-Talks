1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,319
so

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,000
good day hello

3
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,320
and perhaps this morning we are all both

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,680
welcomed by each other and we are the welcomers

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,360
and what a wonderful thing to be the welcomer and the welcomey

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,800
uh together and uh thank you for all being here and sharing this time

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,840
with the dharma with the meditation

8
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:52,559
and one of the words that i will use for myself

9
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:59,280
sometimes meditating especially when my mind is busy

10
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:07,360
it's hard a little bit to get centered in the present moment i'll tell myself in a gentle open

11
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,920
undemanding way i'll tell myself here h-e-r-e

12
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,159
and i see it as a reminder that i'm here and uh not where my thoughts are going

13
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:29,119
and not somewhere else and uh and it's um

14
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,640
and when i say hear then in the wake of that simple word

15
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:42,479
simple reminder i open all my in a sense i open all my senses up to experience what it's like

16
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:49,360
for this moment to be here and sometimes it's hearing sometimes it's sensing in my body sometimes it's

17
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,680
just knowing how active my thinking mind is

18
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,759
here isn't here in the present is a mind that's filled with thoughts

19
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,840
but i'm not involved in those thoughts it's kind of like i step back and i recognize oh this is what's happening

20
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:14,000
here and now and then in the wake of that that lasts for a

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,400
second or two or something before the thoughts take over or something and then i'll gently say it again here

22
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,680
here and it's not a command like you give to a dog it's more like an invitation or a

23
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,200
welcoming here into here and

24
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,680
it's quite special quite wonderful to be here but we want to be careful not to

25
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,160
uh evaluate here by the circumstances we're in

26
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:51,280
maybe you're in a wonderful circumstance maybe you're in a not so interesting place where you're meditating

27
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,800
but the wonderfulness of here is not the externals not just the

28
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,560
internal but rather the the way that awareness begins to grow

29
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,560
and flower in the middle of here and that enter the interaction the

30
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,680
mutuality of the place we're in the experiences we're having here in our

31
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,840
body and mind and the awareness that meets it that's the fully embodied here

32
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,879
and that is what can grow and develop and that and it's like we're developing

33
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:31,760
a capacity to be aware here and this capacity is what starts to

34
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:38,080
becoming very special and rich and wonderful and a marvel

35
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:44,000
and the capacity to be here in many capacities we're developing in buddhism

36
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,959
but one of them is to feel safe here and maybe where you're sitting and

37
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,319
meditating is a safe place just for these moments that you're here

38
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:02,080
and maybe there's a lot of danger in your life but here maybe for these minutes it's

39
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,159
safe and as the capacitive awareness grows we're also developing that capacity to

40
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:14,319
feel the present moment safety but it isn't just a safety that's around

41
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:20,720
us but also the safety that we bring with us as awareness grows

42
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,840
the awareness itself develops a capacity for

43
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:33,280
non-fear the capacity for awareness grows and develops here

44
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:40,080
and it's this interaction between our inner capacity for feeling safe or feeling having no

45
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:47,360
fear that meets the environment that makes it rich and valuable

46
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:55,040
and and at some point we realize that we have the ability to bring that non-fear to bring that

47
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,479
safety that's always here with us as we go into the world and go

48
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:07,520
into the places where it's even dangerous and so there's a different chemistry between the dangers in the

49
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:14,080
world and ourselves because we develop this capacity this ability to hold to have space for

50
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,120
the ability this inner strength to meet what's going on

51
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:26,320
so that's all to say that to say the word here simple relaxed as an invitation for you

52
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:32,000
to open to what is here

53
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,960
is a wonderful little practice it's so rich even though it's so simple the simpler

54
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:46,880
you do it the better so as we sit today we'll get started and do some of this basic usual

55
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,960
um you know getting settled and then at some point

56
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:59,520
you might want to uh on your own just in a nice rhythmic relaxed way

57
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,039
tell yourself the word hear a soft little whisper in the mind

58
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:12,479
in the wake of that say of saying that to be present for what's here

59
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:20,240
take in more fully and take in the breathing the body the

60
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,160
feelings the emotions whatever it is that shows itself that appears

61
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:34,160
in the wake of here so assuming a comfortable meditation

62
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,560
posture and

63
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,639
making sure that it's not only comfortable but also that the posture will express alertness

64
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,960
in some way a certain vitality

65
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:03,440
physical vitality that supports being here

66
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:10,880
present and if it's comfortable you can close your eyes

67
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:19,280
and gently take some deeper breaths maybe three quarters full

68
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:28,840
but deep enough so you have to do it consciously and that consciously deep breathing

69
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,400
deeper is a way of being more fully here

70
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:42,199
so that your mind is not so much drifting off in thought

71
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,360
and then a longer exhale than usual

72
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,039
not so you get winded or to strain but maybe a little bit at the end of the

73
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:05,400
exhale exhale more

74
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,919
at the end of the exhale pause ever so slightly

75
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:25,039
maybe saying the word hear and feel your experience in that

76
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:30,080
fraction of a moment of pausing

77
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:43,680
and then you take a deep breath in pause ever so slightly on the top of the

78
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,959
inhale here

79
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,360
in that pause

80
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:08,440
and then to let your breathing return to normal

81
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:19,440
and taking just a few moments to scan through your body to relax any holding tension in your

82
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,720
body the face the shoulders the belly

83
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:58,279
and then again attune yourself to the experience of the body breathing

84
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:17,279
and at the end of the exhale maybe have an ever so slight pause in

85
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:25,160
which you say gently softly the word here

86
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,399
and in this cycle of breathing in breathing out perhaps a

87
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:21,680
infinitesimal pause being here for your breathing

88
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:28,800
is there any point in the cycle where you feel safe

89
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,480
feel an assurance

90
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:40,200
or a lack of anxiety or fear

91
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:55,639
or the place in the cycle where there's at least fear

92
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,519
or the most sense of safety

93
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,320
and if there is such a place in the cycle or is such a

94
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:25,839
feeling in your body anywhere gently softly say here with it

95
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,320
hear and then feel it more fully

96
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:43,519
increasing your capacity to be here

97
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,160
without fear

98
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,920
you

99
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,920
you

100
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,480
um

101
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,919
you

102
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,919
you

103
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,600
remembering here

104
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,159
here being like a drop of water

105
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:22,960
landing in the middle of the pond the ripple of awareness

106
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,440
spreads through the about the pond

107
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:35,840
of our life silently openly

108
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,919
you

109
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,919
you

110
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,919
you

111
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:35,000
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

112
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:43,440
perhaps to appreciate that as we develop our capacity

113
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,200
to be here that this recognize that this is an

114
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:55,200
inner capacity of awareness of of our

115
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:02,399
whole system psychophysical system being able to be present

116
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,640
for present moment experience

117
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:17,520
and that capacity is closely related to our capacity to

118
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:23,600
be without fear to feel safe

119
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:30,480
safe enough to feel or fear where that which is without fear

120
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:39,360
knows if we are afraid and the capacity to be fearless

121
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:48,559
to be without fear to feel safe is a profound form of trust

122
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:56,279
trusting that can be a gift that we provide others

123
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,640
that the more we know how to be feel safe

124
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,520
a safe safety we carry with us everywhere

125
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:18,559
the more we can offer that safety to others

126
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:26,399
we can be reassuring to others they have nothing to fear from us but

127
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:32,559
more than that they recognize

128
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:41,840
maybe they'll recognize that they are able to relax their fear

129
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:48,480
they can be more at ease and may it be that

130
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:56,080
this practice of mindfulness that we do that it develops our capacity

131
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:02,320
to share our absence of fear with others

132
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:10,640
that it shares our ability to be present

133
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:15,760
in a way where no one needs to be afraid of us

134
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,840
and may it be this practice spreads out into the world

135
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:32,559
a greater assurance reassurance for others that they too can begin to relax

136
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:40,960
be at ease may the extension or the

137
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:47,120
the influence of our practice spread out into the world in known and

138
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,840
unknown ways

139
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:57,679
to bring greater happiness and well-being

140
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:04,640
greater safety and peace and greater freedom

141
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:10,399
of heart to all beings everywhere

142
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:15,600
may all beings feel safe

143
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,840
may all beings be happy

144
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,799
so good morning and good day

145
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:54,799
continue today with a second talk on faith in buddhism buddhist practice

146
00:31:54,799 --> 00:32:01,799
and so often that's the common translation of sadas s s-a-d-d-h-a

147
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:09,039
and um one word one translation i like for that poly word is trust

148
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:14,640
and uh it's a word where trust is the concept of trust is one that i feel

149
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:20,960
very feels very something very deep inside of me or very

150
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,240
rich and valuable and in some ways i feel more

151
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:33,600
connected to trust than i do through the word faith both words i love and

152
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:39,679
and um and i feel like the trust speaks a little bit more

153
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:45,039
to me to a capacity uh an inner kind of

154
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:52,000
quality of heart that uh we're evoking in practice that uh the word faith is a little bit

155
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,840
still residual association i have in english that it has a little to do with a belief

156
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:03,360
system that we have and maybe a little bit more intellectual than uh something that's more embodied

157
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:11,279
and more um you know connected maybe to uh our emotional life

158
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:18,320
and so trust and to be able to uh live and trust uh if we trust someone else or trust

159
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:23,440
something that i associate that with living without fear

160
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,960
this thing that i trust i don't have to be afraid of and and so

161
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,240
a faith a trust that is that is felt

162
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:40,320
as an as a deep sense of safety or an absence of fear at least

163
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:47,279
and kind of an assurance a deep assurance and some of this

164
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:52,640
is a capacity we can develop the capacity to be without fear

165
00:33:52,640 --> 00:34:00,960
the capacity to feel safe and that's an important thing to appreciate because if we only know how to be safe

166
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:07,679
by rearranging the deck chairs on the titanic then you know it's not going to make us

167
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:13,599
so safe and some people feel like they have to just arrange everyone else and

168
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:19,040
arrange every thing and system and everything so everything's lined up so then they can

169
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:24,560
feel safe but the problem with that is it might work for a moment but things are always

170
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:30,480
shifting and changing and then we have to do it more again or the very the other thing that

171
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:38,320
sometimes happens the very effort to control other people or get other people to behave a certain way so

172
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:46,079
i can feel safe creates a kind of alienation a separation that can't do that that actually doesn't

173
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:52,878
really work when we can't really become safe when we're kind of forcing or requiring other people to be a certain

174
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:59,920
way for our sake and and maybe that's not the best way to

175
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:06,720
you know find safety in relationship and one of the one of the things we human beings are capable of

176
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:14,000
is developing and growing the inner feeling of trust the inner capacity for being without anxiety and fear

177
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,520
the inner capacity to not to be free

178
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:25,920
in a way that we're not as affected by the things of the world

179
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:32,079
maybe we're more porous and uh things don't hit

180
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:37,599
our identity or the what we're holding on to it as my egos me myself and mine

181
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:43,520
or maybe there's not the contraction of fear that world events

182
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:50,320
hits inside of us and and so we're not impacted as much by those in

183
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:59,200
some heart way so we developed a capacity of trust the capacity of safety inside

184
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:04,640
and and so some of that has to do with the buddhist idea of cultivation

185
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:12,720
a very important part of buddhism is to develop cultivate all kinds of inner strengths

186
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,760
one of those strengths is faith another is a strength of engagement of

187
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:23,760
practice of of efforting to be able to do and engage

188
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,520
the other is mindfulness itself can become a strength our ability for concentration for

189
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:36,000
stability for steadiness can become stronger and stronger and our capacity for wisdom for

190
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,400
discernment for seeing clearly what's going on can be developed and as these inner

191
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:50,720
strengths grow that that reinforces faith reinforces trust reinforces our capacity to feel

192
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:56,960
like we're capable of holding and being with what's there i love the word capacity

193
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,320
developing our capacity because it has two meanings in english for me

194
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:09,200
one is that it's in the inability to do something and some people they say that they have great capacity means they have

195
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:14,960
a great ability to do do certain things but another meaning of capacity

196
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:21,280
is that um it's like the capacity of a of a container

197
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,880
to hold liquid water a little teaspoon can hold a little bit of

198
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:33,119
water contain a little bit of water a cup holds can contain more water

199
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:40,800
a gallon jug contains more a lake will contain much more water and

200
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,720
an ocean contains even more so the capacity

201
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:53,920
to hold something can grow and develop and so our capacity for our awareness

202
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:59,520
our mind to our heart to be aware of things without

203
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:05,920
contracting without reacting without getting a fear afraid but to be able to hold it with some freedom or some

204
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:11,680
equanimity that can grow as these inner qualities develop and get stronger

205
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:18,800
and the advantage of that is that they would bring our safety with us because certainly there's dangers in the world

206
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:25,200
but we have this we've developed something powerful inside we we're less affected by it we're less

207
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:31,280
fragile what goes around goes on around us and some of that is faith developing

208
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,800
faith has a power that trust is a power that

209
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:43,760
that we have this deep reassurance that our life is

210
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:51,520
supported in a way that is is significant helpful valuable

211
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:57,520
so that when that it reassurance that trust means that we're not so caught up and

212
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,880
concerned with the details of what happens that

213
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:08,400
the recently

214
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:13,920
i lost something and now something that was kind of important it was i had hearing aids so i

215
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:20,079
thought i lost my hearing aids and i think years ago when i would lost something like this i would have gotten

216
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:26,079
quite anxious and afraid and now uh i lost them i looked for them

217
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:32,800
and um and uh i had this reassurance simple reassurance and trust that i can figure

218
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,839
out what to do from there i can find my way and um you know i have to have to i'll

219
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:44,400
get new ones i did find them eventually but um but so you know it's a simple maybe silly

220
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:50,320
example of developing a capacity uh to be able to deal with some

221
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:56,880
difficulty that in the past i wouldn't have been so easy but now i have this equanimity and peace around it

222
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,480
and so and so this faith the quality of this trust

223
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:09,920
is one of the really valuable things in buddhism is to trust the the practice

224
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:15,760
that the practice of mindfulness the practice of meditation the practice of

225
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:21,760
kindness compassion these practices are powerful and valuable

226
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:28,480
and there and to have enough experience of practicing with them to feel confident

227
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:34,319
these work but confident they work they support us in a in

228
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:39,440
many ways but one of the ways is that we know we had enough experiences with

229
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:47,280
them that we're confident even if i don't know what needs to happen here even if i don't know how to find my way

230
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:54,400
i have these practices that can keep me safe keep me without fear keep me

231
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:00,560
at ease it can support the situation to unfold in a healthy and good way

232
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:05,760
that somehow the situation will find itself the way forward and the way out of the

233
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:11,680
challenge that exists and so they have this this deep trust in the practice

234
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:18,640
and maybe eventually the trust and practice is greater than a trust in anything else

235
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:24,480
certainly greater than the trust that it says on the in the us dollar bills where in

236
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,760
god we trust you know how many of you to trust you know

237
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:36,160
money more than you know anything else but to trust yourself more than anything to trust the

238
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:41,440
practice i mean not yourself so much but to practice in fact

239
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:48,960
at some point there's a shift where the practice helps us not to be so caught in me myself and mine and we no

240
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:55,119
longer kind of we're no longer at the center of the play of our life the drama of our life

241
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:01,760
because now the practice is at the center and that's such a liberating thing to have happen

242
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:07,599
related to the practice is trusting the dharma not the dharma as teaching so much

243
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:14,480
but the that there's some something that's transpersonal operating here something that's not about me myself and

244
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:20,319
mine maybe it's within us but there's a inner wisdom an inner process and

245
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:26,960
unfolding a movement towards freedom that operates that is natural

246
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:32,520
and operates independent of the ego independent of my

247
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:38,240
self-preoccupation and self-concern in a certain way so some people might call it

248
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:43,359
transpersonal even though it's maybe within this psychophysical body

249
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:50,960
and so to begin having faith or trust in something which is within us

250
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:58,319
but it's not what you identify with as yourself this is a great freedom and to know that

251
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:03,839
and develop it gives a lot of assurance so faith as trust

252
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:13,839
and trust is a power that we carry with us and um and it's the power of being without fear

253
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:19,760
and certainly we wanted to be together with wisdom the power of wisdom

254
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,800
so we don't do foolish things without the absence of fear

255
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:30,880
but to feel safe to have this deep abiding feeling of safety that we carry with us

256
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:37,599
that's not easily threatened by what happens around us

257
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:45,119
allows us to then offer the gift of safety the gift of fearlessness to others

258
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:52,960
that they have nothing to fear from us and perhaps we can be reassuring presence in this world

259
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:59,599
and finally i'll say that the word for being for assurance for reassurance

260
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:06,000
in the ancient pali language uh is uh the literal meaning of it

261
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:13,200
is to breathe easily and so may we all find the ability

262
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:18,319
to trust in such a way to have faith in such a way that we can breathe easily

263
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:23,560
going through our lives thank you
