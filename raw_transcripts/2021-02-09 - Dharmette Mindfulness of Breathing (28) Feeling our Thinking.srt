1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,480
i'm going to today i'm going to discuss

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,120
the

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,759
seventh step of anapanasati

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,519
seven steps of breathing in and

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,240
breathing out the buddha's teachings on

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,200
breath meditation

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,199
and the way it's worded it says one

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,960
trains oneself

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,560
breathing in one experiences

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,240
uh the activity of mind

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,240
the mental formations the construct

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,480
construction constructing activity of

13
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,399
the mind

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,160
and in the simple ways is called the

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,360
activity of the mind

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,520
breathing out one experiences the

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,079
activity of the mind

18
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,559
and this is a really rich topic what the

19
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,440
mind is the

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,199
holy word is chitta ci tta

21
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,320
and it's um you know

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,520
a rich and wonderful topic and i'll

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,160
touch on some of it as we go along here

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,879
but in

25
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,879
simple terms in english we might call it

26
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,440
the mind

27
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,360
and but one of the

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,000
main activities of the mind for many of

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,720
us

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,560
is thinking and

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,080
and to uh so to become aware

32
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,400
of thinking and there's two different

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,840
ways to become aware that i'm

34
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,680
emphasizing here

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,799
one is to become to observe it

36
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,439
just to know what's happening and the

37
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,240
other is to

38
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,520
really experience it uh to feel the

39
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,280
experience to feel what it's like to be

40
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,320
thinking

41
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,000
and both are important and to learn to

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,960
recognize and know and observe thinking

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,720
is many times a stepping stone to

44
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,399
feeling it and experiencing it more

45
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,640
fully

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,960
so as always with this mindfulness of

47
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,880
breathing there's always this

48
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,600
the rhythm the background beat or the

49
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,880
foreground beat

50
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,040
of breathing that's we're getting

51
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,880
centered on and focused on

52
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,758
and and

53
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,720
settling in on and uh and the breathing

54
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,480
protects us a little bit

55
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,480
from getting caught up in the world of

56
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,599
thinking

57
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,800
to be resting or focusing or

58
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,400
stable on the breathing then as was more

59
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,440
more stable

60
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,840
the more awareness can begin to open up

61
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,640
and be more expensive more inclusive

62
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,720
to be able to take in more and more

63
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,560
what's going on

64
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,680
and and was a stable

65
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,640
attack stable present presence attention

66
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,160
to breathing

67
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,239
it's possible to be aware of thinking

68
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,239
without being bothered by thinking

69
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,319
without making it into a problem or i

70
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,000
think it said you know it's wrong to

71
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
think in meditation or to be upset

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,239
about it or to call it even a

73
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,760
distraction

74
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,400
and the reason why we can why it's

75
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,159
easier not to be bothered

76
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,319
is because there's not a very strong

77
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,080
pull into that world

78
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,200
we don't get lost in it very much but

79
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,959
it's also true that even if we do get

80
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,239
lost in it

81
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,400
we're better off not being bothered by

82
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,280
it

83
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,920
being upset being agitated because we

84
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,280
think

85
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,400
is a recipe for perpetuating the

86
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,599
thinking

87
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,239
the more agitated we are the more the

88
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,080
mind tends to want to produce thoughts

89
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,920
and ideas

90
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,080
stories and so the art of not being

91
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,360
bothered not being upset

92
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,480
not being attached to thinking but also

93
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,200
not being aversive to thinking

94
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,680
not making your thinking your very best

95
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,720
friend

96
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,720
and not making thinking your enemy

97
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,920
either

98
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,560
it's just thinking is happening and to

99
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,799
be aware of thinking going by

100
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,439
and the classic image in buddhism is

101
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,439
having thoughts drift by

102
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,959
like clouds and an endless sky

103
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,599
it's just clouds and i love the metaphor

104
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,680
of clouds for thinking

105
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,799
because you know you if you put your

106
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,799
hand into a cloud

107
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,239
you don't get anything maybe get a

108
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,959
little bit moist but you know there's no

109
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,639
solidity there just like you can put

110
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,479
your hand right through

111
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,280
and it turns out that thinking is not is

112
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,960
actually less solid

113
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,400
than a cloud and uh there's no

114
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,800
you know it's it's a it's kind of a

115
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,960
virtual reality thing

116
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,400
their thoughts but it's the

117
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,800
what we invest in our thinking the

118
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,639
attachment the engagement the all the

119
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,560
energy we put into it

120
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,360
that makes thinking sometimes actually

121
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:43,759
more

122
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,080
solid and more real and more important

123
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,240
than almost anything else in our lives

124
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,320
we can get so wrapped up in our stories

125
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,880
and our ideas and our thoughts

126
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,320
and and the paradox here is that the

127
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,720
more

128
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,560
energy we put into thinking the more

129
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,240
we're trying hard to

130
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,720
you know anxiously think or be attached

131
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,840
to it

132
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,320
we actually think less effectively

133
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,039
um the most creative the most innovative

134
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,680
the most

135
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,880
wise the most loving the most beneficial

136
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,720
way of thinking

137
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,280
tends to be without a lot of extra

138
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,600
energy

139
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
there can be a choice to focus on some

140
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,000
things to think about in daily life

141
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,039
but to do it with an easy relaxed mind

142
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,960
and that ability to stay focused and

143
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,479
very relaxed

144
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,360
allows the thinking mind to be most

145
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,639
productive most creative

146
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,080
maybe there are exceptions but

147
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,280
for many people it's the exception to

148
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,759
every ever approach this idea of a

149
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,880
you know a creative mind that's relaxed

150
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,840
think thinking relax thinking

151
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,560
and so to learn not to be bothered by

152
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,440
our thinking

153
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,120
is very important one of the useful

154
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,520
skills to learn in meditation

155
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,840
to have this wisdom not to be caught up

156
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,840
in it or foreign against it to have a

157
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,440
certain equanimity

158
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,000
and to be patient with the mind wonders

159
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,680
often thought to keep coming back

160
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,120
keep coming back starting over again

161
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,960
starting over again

162
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,120
but at some point now it was at the

163
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,199
seventh step of anapanasati

164
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,639
with the idea that seven step now

165
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,479
there's some stability there some

166
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,400
centering on the breath ability to stay

167
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,039
with the breathing more continuously

168
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,960
and of course that comes and goes that

169
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,160
ability

170
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,400
and many of us will start at step one of

171
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,840
anapanasati

172
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,960
um regularly and like i'm just beginning

173
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,919
and that's completely fine but at some

174
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,280
point as we settle in

175
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,520
maybe the end of a long sit meditation

176
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,720
or maybe

177
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,520
you know conditions come together where

178
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,800
there's enough stability here

179
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,400
that we can becoming aware of thinking

180
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,520
and um in a way that it's like clouds in

181
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,120
the endless sky we just

182
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,800
there's a kind of almost we don't get

183
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,639
too caught in it we don't get focused on

184
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,880
it but we are aware

185
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,479
and there's a few things that are

186
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,479
interesting to notice when we can do

187
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,680
this

188
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,680
one is to notice whether we think more

189
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,800
in words

190
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,840
or more in images

191
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,759
and some people it's one or the other

192
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,759
and some people come some combination of

193
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,000
both

194
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,080
and but you know maybe one predominates

195
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,840
over the other

196
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,880
and because once you recognize uh

197
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,400
what your primary quality of thinking is

198
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,199
you can investigate something more and

199
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,120
that is

200
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,680
where does that operate so where is the

201
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,360
if it's avoid inner voice which is

202
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,479
speaking

203
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,400
where's the loudspeaker or where's the

204
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,000
inner mouth that's doing the speaking

205
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,720
the vocal cord or something

206
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,800
sometimes and people generally feel it's

207
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,919
behind

208
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,759
their forehead it's kind of somewhere in

209
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,520
the area of what we call the brain for

210
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,160
many

211
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,120
modern people in the ancient world it

212
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,759
seems

213
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,160
still to the modern world in in places

214
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,840
in buddhist asia

215
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,319
and if uh people associate the heart

216
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,280
center with where

217
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,560
where they're where they are thinking

218
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,800
and maybe some of you do as well but i

219
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,080
think a tendency in the

220
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,319
in the modern west at least is the point

221
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,440
to the head

222
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,199
and partly because you know the brain

223
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,440
has such a big role in thinking that

224
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,639
you know we gravitate towards there and

225
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,440
associated with air but you know the the

226
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,440
work the words might be spoken somewhere

227
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,039
inside

228
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,200
and or if you see if you're thinking in

229
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,080
images

230
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,640
it might be like a scene just in front

231
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,240
of you with the eyes closed

232
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,039
it might be like a projection screen or

233
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,959
or a scenery that's in front of you

234
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:45,440
there's

235
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,680
kind of some directionality it's there

236
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,320
that we're sensitive watching it

237
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,399
and that sense of a location for the

238
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,519
inner voice

239
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,880
if you can find it or the directionality

240
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,160
of seeing an image is a

241
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,600
is a is a means by which to know or

242
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,600
start noticing the extra energy that

243
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,760
goes into thinking

244
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,360
if it's an inner voice there's often a

245
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,200
kind of contraction and tightness

246
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,200
and pressure if there's a lot of extra

247
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,600
energy that goes into thinking

248
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,680
if it's a lot of imagery there might

249
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,680
also be a contraction or tightness

250
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,680
but it might be in a different location

251
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,959
for some people it might

252
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,839
actually be around their physical eyes

253
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,519
even with the eyes closed

254
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,839
because they're seeing of an image

255
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,360
there's a kind of

256
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,160
habit maybe of engaging the eyes to kind

257
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,000
of focus on the image

258
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,320
and so there might be tension in the eye

259
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,720
area

260
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,680
but by noticing the location where

261
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,680
thinking seems to be occurring

262
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,080
it's also possible to notice how much

263
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,880
energy is being expended for this

264
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,640
and the and the emotions that might be

265
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,959
connected to the energy

266
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,120
and so um to um

267
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,680
you know start seeing there's more to

268
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,760
thinking

269
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,160
than just the thoughts more to thinking

270
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,839
just the images

271
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,920
there's the energy that's involved the

272
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,760
tensions that are involved

273
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,399
the pressure there is the interest

274
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,320
that's involved with thinking

275
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,079
the curiosity the the being glued or

276
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,880
lobbed

277
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,800
you know locked onto it sometimes it can

278
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,160
be the feeling

279
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,440
there can be some emotionality connected

280
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,600
to thinking

281
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,279
that's may sometimes the emotions are

282
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,519
the fuel for it or the source for what

283
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,040
we're thinking about

284
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,760
and so it's possible to to step back

285
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,839
in a sense settle back and just observe

286
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:46,399
thinking

287
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,440
and without necessarily observing the

288
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,720
content of the thought

289
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,959
the content is often not so important

290
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,200
for the purpose of meditation

291
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,720
but the associated aspects of thinking

292
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,160
the energy the tension the

293
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,720
directionality the location

294
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,440
the emotionality to it the interest we

295
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,200
have to it

296
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,360
all those not to study them and get too

297
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,600
active but all those

298
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,880
you can step back and kind of observe

299
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,160
and and that gives you access

300
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,720
to the instructions to experience

301
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,399
the mental activity so in this case

302
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,120
to exp to experience what it's like to

303
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,480
be thinking

304
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,279
or to say it differently to really feel

305
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,079
it

306
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,519
feel it somatically physically almost

307
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,760
even though it's mental there might be

308
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,200
some the sensations

309
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,600
of thinking and

310
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,519
and this and this allows us to not be so

311
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,200
and the more we kind of disinvest

312
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,920
ourselves from the story and the ideas

313
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,560
and but

314
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,040
without dismissing the thinking and

315
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,279
experiencing different parts of thinking

316
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,839
thinking that by itself tends to become

317
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,639
quieter and stiller

318
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,200
and and as thinking becomes quieter and

319
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,480
stiller

320
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,600
then that's then we may be able to

321
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,079
better

322
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,720
more fully stay with the in-breath and

323
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,079
the out breath

324
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,000
focusing on the body breathing and

325
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,279
and do so maybe with more sense of ease

326
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,399
more sense of well-being that comes

327
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,839
along just the simplicity the

328
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,120
contentment

329
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,360
being content just to be present and

330
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,040
breathe

331
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,200
more often than not the discontent about

332
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,600
life and the impatience

333
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,800
belongs to the realm of thinking and

334
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,160
or fueled by thinking

335
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,399
so

336
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,880
this is not an instruction to get really

337
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,440
busy

338
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,240
to notice and focus on thinking but

339
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,720
rather to stay with your breathing

340
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,760
and and don't be bothered by it don't be

341
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,279
troubled by it

342
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,120
but as it becomes relevant

343
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,160
to touch into an extreme being

344
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,279
experiencing

345
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,200
feeling what's happening as you breathe

346
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,680
and and maybe with the idea that you're

347
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,240
breathing

348
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,240
through the thinking breathing with your

349
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,399
thinking so the breathing supports

350
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,600
you're not getting caught

351
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
in whatever you're thinking about but

352
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,759
you can just observe it and feel it

353
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,880
so um

354
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,480
may you develop a new relationship with

355
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,000
your thinking

356
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,560
don't assume that the way that you think

357
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,480
