1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:08,000
Hello and welcome. And as we

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,200
as an introduction to this meditation, I would like to say a few words about

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,720
letting go. Letting go is often associated with

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:28,960
Buddhism, sometimes in more dramatic terms like renunciation perhaps.

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:36,559
And um and certainly it's a very important part letting go or release

6
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:45,840
liberation from clinging. But what is often not appreciated enough

7
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,440
is that um the Buddha rarely talked about letting

8
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,960
go of anything. what he talked about releasing, letting

9
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,280
go re is we let go of holding on.

10
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:11,439
We let go of clinging to things, not necessarily let go of the things.

11
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:19,360
And to paraphrase a common teaching of the Buddha in apply to letting go,

12
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:26,799
he he would have said if letting go

13
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:34,159
increases what's harmful for you, I don't teach you to let go.

14
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:42,320
If letting go decreases what's harmful and increases what's beneficial for you,

15
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:51,040
I teach letting go. And so there's always this understanding that letting go has two for two

16
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,720
purposes. One is to let go in of what is harmful

17
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:04,159
for oneself and and the other or stressful and the other is to let go so that it's

18
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,599
beneficial. We grow, we develop

19
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,120
but it's not the issue to let go of things. Maybe the English word letting go

20
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:23,440
implies releasing, letting things go away. But it's uh opening the fist of the

21
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,360
hand. We don't lose the fist. We don't lose the hand. We just just the

22
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:36,400
the fist disappears. So the idea is not to hold on. And then

23
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,560
there's two ways of that we can let go as I've said before showed before. One

24
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:51,599
is that we let go and something drops away. The other is we let go of the clinging

25
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,640
and the the grasping but we still can hold

26
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:04,319
the thing. we can still hold it lightly, openly. And um

27
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:11,720
so to uh so as we sit this morning,

28
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:19,519
see if you can let go of the clinging, the grasping, the

29
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:26,680
holding on to things and then see what happens.

30
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:34,159
And a lot of what we cling to, hold on to are ideas, our thoughts, our

31
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:40,640
memories, our beliefs, and we don't even know we're holding on

32
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,920
because we in the grasping we take it as

33
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,159
natural. We think this is how it's supposed to be.

34
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:58,159
But no, as we sit and meditate, we don't have to hold on to anything, grasp

35
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:04,159
anything, cling to anything. And we also don't have to reject

36
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:11,680
anything. The only except for the clinging

37
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:20,720
except for the holding tight. So in we letting go this way, it's very

38
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,560
respectful. It allows everything to exist in its own

39
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,840
way without our perpetuating it, reacting to it, holding

40
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:41,040
on to it, pushing it away. And this is a phenomenal gift to ourselves, to the

41
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:49,520
world, to all the different parts of ourselves to let it be free

42
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,199
of our entanglement with it. And so part of the purpose of Buddhist

43
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:02,759
meditation is to become acutely sensitive

44
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,960
to how we cling, how we tighten up, how we resist,

45
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,720
how we um become guarded,

46
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:21,280
how we become defensive, how we become insistent,

47
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,720
assertive. all it all as kind of manifestations of

48
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,479
clinging, grasping, attachment.

49
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:41,160
So to assume a meditation posture

50
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,000
and right at the beginning of beginning of meditation

51
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,560
assuming a posture that lets the body relax.

52
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,639
Relaxation is a letting go of grasping and clinging

53
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,199
in the muscles.

54
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,960
Gently closing the eyes

55
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:25,280
and to allow to orient towards a deep

56
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:32,919
relaxing, a deep softening of the body.

57
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:47,680
Perhaps taking some fuller breaths to feel the torso, the shoulders, the

58
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:57,360
belly more fully. And then a longer exhale

59
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,400
to relax, let go, soften.

60
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:25,520
A byproduct of relaxing the body is that it can relax

61
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:33,360
the mental tension that might be the cause of the physical

62
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,319
tension.

63
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,919
allowing your breathing to return to normal.

64
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,759
softening the belly

65
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:09,160
both as you inhale and as you exhale.

66
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:20,919
If the belly expands as you breathe in, let that be like a gentle massage,

67
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,639
relaxing in the expansion.

68
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:36,680
When you exhale, see if you can relax the belly still.

69
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:58,600
On the inhale to feel the shoulders

70
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:10,440
and relaxing the shoulders on the exhale. Feeling

71
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,000
the face

72
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,560
and relaxing the face.

73
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:14,839
And then feeling any tension, pressure in the thinking mind.

74
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:32,240
and with care, compassion, kindness

75
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:39,800
for the thinking mind. As you exhale,

76
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,160
soften the tension, the pressure.

77
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:02,240
Maybe you can feel the drive, the insistence

78
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,640
to think.

79
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:18,800
Maybe there's fear and desire that drives the holding on to ideas and

80
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,839
beliefs and thoughts.

81
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:31,880
Relax. soften.

82
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:51,279
Or maybe where clinging, holding on, resides

83
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:59,920
is in the heart area or maybe deep in the belly.

84
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:09,000
may be fueled by feelings of fear.

85
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:21,160
Maybe even a form of assertiveness, insistence.

86
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:36,600
As you exhale, gently, softly, slowly

87
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,240
release your holding.

88
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:52,120
Release the force of attachment to anything.

89
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,800
With each breath,

90
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,079
let there be freedom.

91
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:47,440
and ease. By slowly letting go

92
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,839
of holding

93
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,919
With the help of your imagination,

94
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:24,200
imagine not holding on to anything.

95
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:31,200
Nothing sticks. Nothing gets attached. Everything is

96
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:37,559
free flowing. Comes and goes

97
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:46,320
like standing sitting in a river and the everything flows. The river

98
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,200
flows right by.

99
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:04,200
If we try to grasp at the water, we kind of come up empty-handed.

100
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:11,200
Imagine letting go of everything, sitting here quietly, letting everything

101
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:20,400
be free to flow, including the freedom of awareness.

102
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:26,360
That present moment awareness flows freely.

103
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:37,080
Nothing is let go of.

104
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:43,320
Only clinging is released.

105
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:31,000
As we come to the end of this sitting,

106
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,720
I'd like to begin by evoking the idea

107
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:42,880
that the opposite of

108
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,400
freedom is clinging,

109
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,120
clamping down,

110
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,880
tightening up, freezing,

111
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,120
the heart, resisting,

112
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:13,240
being stuck in loops of thought.

113
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:27,360
Bracing oneself against life, against feelings, against

114
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,158
thoughts and emotions.

115
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:42,840
And that non-clinging is the release of all these things.

116
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:48,960
letting go, releasing, clamping down, being stuck,

117
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:56,960
bracing oneself so that we have breathing room.

118
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,640
So we can breathe easily in the midst of all things.

119
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,720
We can have a soft, relaxed belly.

120
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:13,440
Our hands and jaws, shoulders

121
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,519
can be at ease wherever we go.

122
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,679
So that our thinking is not stuck.

123
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,399
Doesn't overpower us with beliefs and opinions,

124
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:36,600
projections and fantasies.

125
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,880
to let go of clinging.

126
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:56,320
So that we have just to let go of the fist. Open the fist of the hand, the fist in

127
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,360
the mind, the fist in the heart.

128
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:07,600
So our good heart can meet the world. Our

129
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,679
friendly thoughts can meet the world.

130
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:19,279
Our openhandedness can meet the world.

131
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:26,519
And may it be by being open-minded, openhearted, open-ended,

132
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,919
we can live in this world for the benefit of all beings,

133
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:39,520
including ourselves. May our openness

134
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:46,000
that comes from letting go of clinging be for the welfare and happiness of all

135
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,720
beings. May we freely

136
00:29:52,720 --> 00:30:00,480
offer our goodwill. May all beings be happy.

137
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:08,679
May all beings be safe. May all beings

138
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:16,310
be peaceful and may all beings be free.

139
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:29,890
[Music]

140
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,440
Thank you.

141
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:48,960
So hello and welcome to this series on insight.

142
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:55,919
And right now we're discussing the insight into duka, insight into

143
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:01,960
suffering or stress, unsatisfactoriness.

144
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:07,440
And um my hope in giving these talks now about

145
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:14,640
suffering that most of you have been along for much of this progression of uh

146
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:20,559
practice of teachings from the beginning of the year with samadei cultivating a

147
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:29,200
deep capacity to be calm and centered and quiet, still peaceful, relaxed

148
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:38,880
and also these talks about um uh insight, the deep capacity to be

149
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:45,679
present for the changing nature of this world and in doing so to be aware of how

150
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:52,640
we resist that change, how we stop it, how we um hold on to it, how we uh

151
00:32:52,640 --> 00:33:00,480
struggle with it. Uh, and one of the ways we struggle that Buddhism emphasizes is one way or the other,

152
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:06,000
we're clinging to something. We cling to how things were. We cling to how we want

153
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:13,039
them to be. We cling to how things are. We cling to how they should be.

154
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:18,799
We cling to our beliefs, our thoughts. We cling to identity.

155
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:24,320
We cling to our possessions. We cling to people.

156
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:32,640
Um there's no shortage of things that we cling to, we get attached to, we hold on tight. And all of those can be felt if

157
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:40,159
you're really deeply flowing and inside practice as a resisting or interfering

158
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:45,919
with a changing, moving, inconstant flow of experience.

159
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:52,480
It's a way of standing in the river and putting up our hand and telling the river to stop. maybe even putting the

160
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,760
hand in the water to kind of stop it and you can put a lot of effort into

161
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:04,080
stopping the water and but it the water will flow right around your hand. So

162
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,200
there's something we can feel that we can feel at some point uh in deeper the

163
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:15,440
practice goes how clinging and attachment um doesn't serve us. It's

164
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,358
actually feels like it's a distraction. It's a interference. It's a it's a

165
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:26,800
limiting ourselves in a very important way. And so the desire to let go of

166
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:32,158
clinging is not an instruction, not a thing,

167
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:39,760
something you're supposed to do, you should do. But with insight practice, samadei and insight, at some point we

168
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:46,398
know for ourselves, we can feel for ourselves this is not good. Not only that, we can

169
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:53,200
feel more deeply that the very nature of clinging in the heart of it, it wants to

170
00:34:53,200 --> 00:35:00,720
let go. It wants to release. It's work. It's suffocating. It's tight. It's

171
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,920
painful to cling. And uh and and in the middle of it,

172
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:11,119
there's a desire to release, to free. And in deeper insight practice is not a

173
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:18,240
matter of following a admonition you should let go but rather is listening

174
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:25,359
deeply to the letting go that wants to happen. So in this uh the he talks about

175
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:32,000
suffering the second characteristic the se second really important insight of insight practice

176
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,040
uh the deep recognition of something about suffering. It's maybe helpful to

177
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:44,240
appreciate that when the Buddha talked about the suffering that he really wants to address through this practice that he

178
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:51,599
defined it in a particular way. He defined it as clinging sometimes as

179
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:56,960
craving. Uh and clinging is a kind of very

180
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:05,359
um kind of holding on tight um uh much more than is needed.

181
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:11,119
And uh and there's something about the nature of holding on tight that hurts,

182
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:18,560
that is stressful, that is painful. And um and so the one of the strong

183
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,680
definitions the Buddha gave of suffering, he he called suffering, the

184
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:29,440
human suffering that we have, the bundle of clinging.

185
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,720
It's a bundle. It isn't just we cling to one thing, but a few of us cling to a

186
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:40,720
lot of things. We have a big bundle. And some people keep accumulating bigger and

187
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:45,760
bigger bundles. Every time we look at an advertisement or see something that we

188
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:52,480
want, we hold on to that. Um, every all kind all through the day, we're

189
00:36:52,480 --> 00:37:00,480
accumulating more things to cling to, more things to hold on to, more things that we're we're grasping.

190
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,760
And um and the Buddha said that there was five for back in his understanding

191
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:11,200
five primary areas of this clinging. We can cling to appearances, our own

192
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:18,880
appearance and others which is a multi-billion dollar industry taking care of appearances in this country. We

193
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:26,160
can uh cling to sensations to whether things are pleasant or unpleasant, comfortable or uncomfortable. Many

194
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:31,280
people are holding on to comfort. Comfort means so much more than just

195
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,800
pleasantness. It means security or success or something. Clinging to

196
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:44,079
comfort and discomfort. Clinging to ideas of things. We cling to

197
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:49,359
stories. We cling to imaginations.

198
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:56,079
We cling to the stories of identities. Me, myself, and mine. and we cling to um

199
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:01,839
consciousness or cognitions that we have. So each of these things just kind of to

200
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:08,240
it doesn't have to be these five but for the Buddha he puts in these five buckets of bund these five bundles that we're

201
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:14,320
gathering up all the time and uh and it isn't the bundles is it

202
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:21,920
isn't the things we cling to that are the issue and this is a very important part of this dharma practice the issue

203
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:28,880
is not what we cling to the primary issue is the grasping itself

204
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:34,800
And um and so to separate those two out is so important because otherwise we

205
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:42,240
think we have to let go of everything. Our possessions, our wealth, our friends, everything. Uh but there's we

206
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:48,640
don't have to let go we have to let go of anything but we have to let go of the clinging to

207
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:55,599
those things. And um and in letting go of the clinging we might have greater wisdom. And some

208
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:02,560
things we see they don't serve us. They harm us. And so we put them aside. But if they benefit from some things, we

209
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:10,160
don't have to put them aside. Then we can live with them freely with an open hand without clinging.

210
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:17,680
But this deep movement of letting go of the grasping, the clinging, the holding on, the tightening is really the

211
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:27,040
emphasis of Buddhism. So in um yesterday I talked about the three kinds of suffering the uh the

212
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:36,480
we're here now the word duka can be understand pain we understanded as literally as pain there is duka duka the

213
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:45,119
pain of pain like physical pain they're just pure and simple physical there is the the the suffering the pain

214
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:51,599
of things changing they're not being what they are people die, get sick,

215
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:57,680
things will fade, things break, societies change.

216
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:04,640
And uh and then there's the the um the suffering of the mental formations,

217
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:10,880
the mental constructs that we have. And the third one is really the primary

218
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:18,000
concern. We can have mental constructs, mental clinging, grasping towards physical pain. We can have mental

219
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:25,040
grasping and clinging to a relationship to how things are changing or not changing. And we can have mental

220
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:31,200
grasping and clinging to our clinging to the constructs we've created.

221
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:36,400
And so it's this it's a third one which is a primary concern

222
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,599
and they make the first two easier. If we're not grasping, clinging, resisting,

223
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:48,000
physical pain can be a lot easier. I'm not saying it becomes easy but uh it

224
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,320
removes the second arrow. If uh we take uh if we don't cling to

225
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:59,520
change then change becomes easier. It's not always nice. It's not always welcome

226
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:05,520
but it becomes easier to find our way. And one of the remarkable things

227
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:12,560
is how our hearts, our deep inner psychological life generally knows how

228
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:18,160
to work through how to find its way with grief, with loss, with change, with

229
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:24,400
what's coming new, with adapting to the new way of living. Uh if we give it a

230
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:32,400
chance, give it time. But if we cling and resist, we don't give this deeper heart

231
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,520
a chance to find its way. We interfere with it.

232
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:43,839
And then uh mental constructs are so much nicer and easier if there's no clinging.

233
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:49,520
And we learn to let go of those constructs which have that harm us not

234
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,800
for no other reason because they involve this tightness and resistance.

235
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:03,359
So the core suffering that the Buddhist practice is meant to address is the suffering that comes from

236
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:08,640
our mental clinging attachments that we have. And as I said at the beginning of

237
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,680
this talk, um, uh, the function of deep

238
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:20,000
mindfulness practice, deep somati practice is to help us become our own

239
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,680
teacher, that we can feel and recognize

240
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:31,359
that the uh uh uh how we shortch change

241
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:37,280
ourselves, how we harm ourselves through our clinging, our attachment. But even

242
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,319
more important, we can feel that deep inside,

243
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:48,560
deep in the heart of our clinging, our attachments, sometimes our fears, sometimes our

244
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:54,720
strong desires, sometimes our our very clinging to identity, to me, myself and

245
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:00,240
mine. There is a wish, there is a feeling, there is a movement

246
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:08,160
towards freedom, to letting go of that clinging. And so we become our own teacher when we

247
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,680
recognize that the wisdom of non-clinging

248
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:19,440
and the deep request that even clinging asks of us that our

249
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,640
inner life asks of us. Let go release.

250
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:32,880
Put down this burden. Free yourself from all this work

251
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:41,119
of clinging, the yoke of clinging, the bondage of clinging. Put it down.

252
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:49,078
Let it go. Become free of this suffering.

253
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:55,119
So um the insight into suffering

254
00:43:55,119 --> 00:44:01,520
is invaluable. So we can see that in the heart of suffering

255
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:07,599
is a desire for freedom which is an invitation.

256
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:13,119
Let go of clinging of holding on.

257
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:16,359
Thank you.
