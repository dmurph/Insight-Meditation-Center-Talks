2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,599
kindness um so for today's practice

3
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:17,199
um yeah you know instead of invite introducing a theme I think I like I

4
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,920
will introduce the a theme while we're practicing and we'll start as always by

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,920
settling our bodies with the breath and getting

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,120
settled um and uh um yeah let's let's just do that I want to talk don't want

7
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:42,160
to talk too much ahead of time so let's begin let's begin and see if your body needs a stretch as a way of as a way of

8
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:48,480
meta for your body see what it needs how does it want to sit in this

9
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:55,879
moment and a moment of care for the body meta for the body and inviting allowing

10
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:02,840
your your body to be comfortable sitting in a posture that has Integrity

11
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:10,720
sitting upright but not stiff upright doesn't mean stiff in

12
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,880
fact consider

13
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:24,400
consider your base the base is very important in how we sit consider your base your sit bones as

14
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,439
they land as they connect

15
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:37,479
the cushion to the chair and let your spine Rise Up from

16
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:43,479
this base in a very relaxed way as if there's an invisible magnet on top of

17
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:50,320
your head rising up not being pushed

18
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:58,118
up and then let the rest of your muscles relax soften

19
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,800
feeling the connection of your feet to the

20
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:27,239
Earth and feeling the breath moving through your abdomen perhaps through your chest

21
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,879
through your whole body e

22
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:28,840
and allowing inviting the breath to be natural however it is in breath out breath

23
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:43,840
not controlled but peaceful whether deep or shallow fast or slow

24
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:13,760
allowing awareness allowing loving awareness to know this

25
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,199
breath no the

26
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,720
appreciation e

27
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,919
imagining that the breath is moving in and out of the heart center

28
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:29,720
the center of our chest and maybe putting a hand on the

29
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:36,000
center of the chest connecting with

30
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,400
yourself with this being who is you with a sense of

31
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:55,639
appreciation as the breath is moving in and out the center of the chest the Heart

32
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:58,639
Center

33
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:08,960
bringing more appreciation and good will for this

34
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:20,479
being who is you being who is me perhaps recollecting one one act of

35
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,639
kindness that you did today doesn't have to be huge maybe you were generous with

36
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:37,319
your time or generous with a smile or called up a

37
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:43,160
friend or you were kind to yourself you were not harsh on yourself

38
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,280
today or yesterday past few days bring this act of

39
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:55,080
kindness generosity to your heart and appreciate yourself as if you're appreciating

40
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,360
someone else who had done it

41
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:06,960
that was nice that was nice A that was

42
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,440
sweet I was caring or

43
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,400
generous let yourself Savor and appreciate this expression of goodness

44
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:31,240
Good Will from yourself from you

45
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,039
to someone else or to

46
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:48,960
yourself and maybe another act of kindness comes to your mind comes to your

47
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:52,759
heart that was

48
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:01,280
nice that was kind of me I went out of my

49
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:07,520
way could be any time the past few days it doesn't have to be

50
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:15,159
huge maybe it wasn't an act of kindness so much but it was an act of restraint

51
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:22,360
you could have said something or done something that wouldn't have been very kind or wise and you didn't so

52
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,719
appreciate yourself for that

53
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:46,640
is a tender could be very small Act of recognition of your own goodness don't

54
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:53,240
belittle your own goodness could be an act of

55
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:59,710
Courage stepping a little out of your comfort zone to do something skill

56
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,799
[Music]

57
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:19,959
again if you don't have a hand in your heart center in your chest try doing that and see how it might

58
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:27,079
actually enliven this practice this somatic gesture

59
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,440
and born from this appreciation wishing yourself

60
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:00,040
well wishing this being who is kind generous

61
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,399
as

62
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,920
goodness sharing your blessings your your good will your

63
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,079
good wishes freely may I be well may this being who is

64
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:22,640
me be safe as safe as possible knowing that

65
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,160
the world is not completely safe so it's not attaching to the idea of safety it's

66
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:36,320
just wishing safety offering freely may I be happy as happy as

67
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:44,160
possible again not attaching to the idea it's not a demand just a good wish may I be

68
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:50,480
happy I be healthy as much as possible not as an intention or

69
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,570
affirmation just as a gift with no strings attached may I be

70
00:10:55,570 --> 00:11:00,800
[Music] healthy and may my life have

71
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:07,959
ease made it unfold with ease and make sure it's not demanding

72
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:16,160
or or it's a prayer strong like I want this to happen it's just you offering

73
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:23,200
every gift of good willll to yourself wishing this being well may I be

74
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,639
safe may I be happy

75
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:39,399
may I be healthy may I have

76
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:46,600
ease if the phrases are too complicated you can just say may I be well if you're

77
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,040
new to this practice that's

78
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:59,000
fine and if the good willll runs dry then then remember again another act of

79
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,000
kindness kindness or Goodwill and connect with that otherwise stay stay with the sense

80
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,279
of Goodwill good wishes and phrases for

81
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
yourself

82
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,160
e e

83
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:45,160
sometimes it might be easier to wish yourself well if you see yourself from a third person's perspective step out of

84
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:54,839
yourself and wish yourself well or perhaps see yourself that's it's

85
00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:01,040
a younger version of yourself wishing wishing yourself as a baby

86
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:12,440
may I be [Music] safe may I be

87
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:21,279
happy may I be healthy may I have

88
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
EAS

89
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,040
e e

90
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:35,920
or maybe it's appropriate for the phrase to be may I may I love and accept myself

91
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:42,519
just as I am or if that's not

92
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,000
available I Aspire may

93
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:56,440
I I may I grow into loving and accepting

94
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,519
myself just as I am

95
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:12,240
or if it is accessible I love and accept myself just as I am I love myself I accept

96
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:25,959
myself allowing a sense of enoughness which is not equal which is

97
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:31,519
not the same as resignation but the sense of enoughness to be

98
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,759
here not a sense of

99
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,199
lack maybe the phrase becomes time

100
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
enough

101
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

102
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

103
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

104
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

105
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,679
e e

106
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:03,039
see which raise works best for you maybe the phrase might even

107
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,519
become I love

108
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:22,279
myself or perhaps even if it feels right I am love I am

109
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:30,000
love may I live may I live with with love in this

110
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,919
world may I radiate love for myself and

111
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:54,600
others may I radiate kindness good willll friendliness from myself and

112
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:01,880
others may I be safe for myself and

113
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,640
others see it feels

114
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,520
right e

115
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:30,840
as we turn to bring this sitting period to close

116
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:36,600
together notice notice what your body is feeling

117
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:45,840
is there a little more calm peace space perhaps kindness tiny tiny tiny bit more

118
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,400
compared to

119
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:02,760
before trusting that we're planting seeds of goodwi kindness for ourselves

120
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:08,760
for others the world and may our practice these

121
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:15,600
planting of seeds be of service to ourselves and everyone to

if the sense of appreciation for our for myself or this person who's me could be

136
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:03,559
um uh leading into meta to be a it may be

enoughness so there are a lot of ways that tonight today this practice um

139
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:21,760
inviting you to experiment meta is is a creative practice we see where we are

140
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,840
what what really works it's more practice to be done as a

141
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:35,880
feather with gentleness nod as a hammer and chisel so now happy hour on Zoom at this

time we turn to in invitation to to practice together uh we were doing

143
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:49,120
silent meta now we do interactive meta for six minutes 7 Minutes in small

144
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:54,840
groups and and the invitation for the interactive meta to is to enter into

145
00:26:54,840 --> 00:27:01,080
these small uh groups of three or four with a sense of Goodwill for yourself

146
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:06,840
for other people there's nothing you have to say really right or wrong um but

147
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,919
maybe you just silently hold space for others if you feel like sharing a word

148

or two about how this practice was for you feel free to do that but please stay

184
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:20,159
you um okay so the next piece is a little bit more difficult because I was in a group and you gave very very very

185
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:25,399
very very very clear instructions very clear yeah

186
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:31,039
yet it wasn't to me it was to another person that person did not have a safe

187
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:38,760
space and I could not unmute fast enough to say um excuse me let's remember but

188
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:44,200
it just I really don't understand year after year after year this keeps

189
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:50,360
happening and I've been also on the receiving end of people commenting about my stuff and I don't really appreciate

190
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:56,120
it but I was on the receiving end of being a bystander today and I don't

191
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:02,320
appreciate it and I felt bad about the other person so whatever meta we created

192
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:08,480
it could be you know we were talking about perception we create things in our own mind sure this is something that I'm

193
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:14,519
creating in my mind however this is a group that as a whole we have agreed to

194
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:20,399
certain boundaries and I don't understand how literally 10 seconds

195
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:26,760
later this does not happen yeah yeah I I appreciate you raising this and know we

196
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:32,320
try of course and there's more I'm going to say about this I really appreciate you raising in and also raising into the

197
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:37,720
group because it um yeah it can be an ouch for the person

198
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:43,159
who receives for an ouch for the person who's witnessing ouch all around so I

199
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:50,279
really appreciate you raising this and and cloudy I would really U if you would please stay afterwards i' like to to

200
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:55,720
connect with you a little more about this um uh oneon-one especially about

201
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:00,919
what happened in the group and if there's more care care that's needed both for you and and for the other

202
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:07,399
person so I'd like to if you would be so kind as to stay for just a couple of minutes after afterwards I would

203
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:14,720
appreciate it thank you um and it's um I like to think that

204
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:21,080
we're doing the best we can and it sometimes in the social situations if

205
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:26,919
somebody says something perhaps I don't know what the situation was but if someone says something that's difficult

206
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:32,480
or Tender the other person maybe is trying to make it okay

207
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:39,960
somehow like comments on their situation trying to support them and make it okay um so that they don't feel bad they

208
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:48,960
don't feel uncomfortable and that's something that can happen also uh on it's not helpful in meta spaces um we

209
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:56,279
need to also be able to practice equinity to just allow what has been said to be there and hold space with

210
00:33:56,279 --> 00:34:02,519
kindness without fixing it so maybe that's a comment that from now on I'm going to bring in when I

211
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:09,118
set up the the groups you know don't try to fix each other just let each other be

212
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:15,480
accept with meta love each other just as you are don't try to to um fix each

213
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:20,599
other I think that that might be again I like to attribute that to Goodwill but a

214
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:28,320
little misguided not enough wisdom there is Goodwill but not enough wisdom and if you would if you would um

215
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:35,280
if you would uh stay that would be great we can we can check in afterwards I really appreciate it

216
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:41,358
cloudy Nick

217
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:49,599
please yes I'm Gonna Keep mine very quick but sure it was why did I turn

218
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:54,960
cash it was what oh it turned close captioning on was seeing what I was

219
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:04,400
saying on the no it was it was a really beautiful set and as I shared to the group um it turned into something very

220
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,960
joyous and almost Whimsical for me because I've got a window open on a

221
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:17,240
beautiful Sunday Chicago or beautiful Chicago evening in the summer and I could hear the ice cream

222
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:23,160
truck in my neighborhood for about 20 minutes to the 30 minute set and it just

223
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:29,320
kept this brought up all this just joy and especially when you brought up the

224
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:36,960
phrases in I am enough and I have enough that really resonated at that point for me so thank you oh that's beautiful

225
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,560
thank thanks for speaking about how um you know you're Incorporated the sounds

226
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:49,000
of of life of Living the ice cream truck and the joy of that and um instead of oh

227
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:55,280
the ice cream truck is is is distracting me from my meditation right that that could be where the Mind goes instead

228
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:03,580
letting it really including everything as a part of our practice thank you so much Nick appreciate it yeah lovely

229
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:08,599
[Music] Jerry um first of all I

230
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:15,599
Echo U Claudia's comments so uh it's great to see you back and uh uh your

231
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:21,359
voice is amazing and your work uh the question I have uh have comment and that

232
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:29,040
a question so uh I was a friend once uh recently said to me my may you is so

233
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:34,680
compassionate toward others but may you seem to be very critical of yourself and

234
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:40,000
uh of course my work as a physician I try to be compassionate and keep clear

235
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:48,520
boundaries but uh when I then come to judge myself well I I push harder and

236
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:53,640
then why haven't I done this why haven't I done this and and then of course uh

237
00:36:53,640 --> 00:37:00,400
that comes back and so um and and uh she said you need to be more compassionate

238
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:09,520
with yourself so of course this was fitting for what we talked about tonight and I guess I uh uh wondered if and so

239
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:17,480
the question is uh in this tradition of terana is loving kindness uh which I

240
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:23,640
love meta is it more prominent than in other traditions and in in Buddhism or

241
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:31,040
is it prominent in Buddhism generally I don't know so yeah yeah so um the first

242
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:38,880
question that an implied question about kindness to yourself right meta and compassion to

243
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:44,960
yourself and meta and compassion as you already know by now they're related but not the same thing compassion is meta

244
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,720
when meta meets challenge pain suffering self-criticism it becomes

245
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,000
compassion so that is what's needed so please please keep practicing kindness

246
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:04,119
meta compassion for yourself and it works we know that it works and we know that it works so um and then with the

247
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:09,440
question of whether this is um uh more

248
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:16,839
prominent in this uh tradition or another tradition um in in all

249
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:22,480
traditions of Buddhism meta is there in the in the Tada uh Buddhism meta is the

250
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:28,119
primary one and in the other tradition in the um uh Tibetan tradition

251
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:33,200
compassion is the primary so compassion which is meta meaning suffering and in

252
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:39,440
Zen it's there it's it's not leaned into as much emptiness is lean into more so

253
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:46,119
it's it's it's part of all Buddhist teachings but uh anyway that's the theoretical part in terms of practical

254
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:53,839
part keep practicing Jerry keep practicing yeah thank you thank you thank you than thank

255
00:38:53,839 --> 00:39:01,200
you so there was a question earlier from P pava I hope I'm saying your name right

256
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:07,440
panova reflection in the happy in the group happy era I convert habitual

257
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:14,760
judge uh thought to habitual ah let me try that again in the group happy a I

258
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:21,480
convert habitual judge thought to meta through thought to group members because

259
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:26,680
I realize judging doesn't help me and others thank you everyone thank you

260
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:33,640
question do meditation when mention lacking I feel like my Sati Samar and

261
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:40,359
vasana is not fulfilled yet um this is the most important part but I feel but I

262
00:39:40,359 --> 00:39:46,960
feel lacking of this area may I ask what I should do ah right I appreciate it I

263
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:53,599
appreciate both uh both you wrote both of what you wrote um

264
00:39:53,599 --> 00:40:01,720
so the um I'm going to close chat right now there we go actually it will just

265
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:07,599
come to me so um so with the question that you have

266
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:14,280
this sense of lacking um if you for for your somebody for your practice not to

267
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:21,160
have completed not to have come to full fruition there could be a a

268
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:27,160
um uh um you know if if if it uh supports

269
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:32,520
you you and it inspires you let it be inspiring instead of a feeling of lack

270
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:38,640
let it feel inspiring that oh yes there is more so that it can be onward leading

271
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:46,040
so that the practice can continue to be onward leading yes there is more instead of like oh I'm not enough I haven't done

272
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:53,200
yet that can be contracting and can limit your progress um I hope that makes

273
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:58,520
sense right there's you can still have this feeling of I want to to practice I

274
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:03,839
want to fulfill my potential but from a place of aspiration so that it lifts up

275
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:09,079
your heart instead of a feeling of lack I'm not enough and those two feel very

276
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:15,640
differently and you can chat me directly I hope that makes sense um as an answer

277
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:21,760
to your question so um so I'm going

278
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:29,520
to yeah um direct question comes to me Megan so

279
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,680
uh where does self forgiveness play into the practice of meta yeah self-

280
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:40,960
forgiveness is related to the practice of meta even more the practice of uh

281
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:49,560
self-compassion actually because there is pain and suffering so um and and and self-

282
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:55,599
Compass self forgiveness is is quite a practice quite a development and given that there's only a couple of minutes

283
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:01,480
left and it's quite a practice I'm not going going to uh bring it all in it's it's maybe another session and if you

284
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:09,240
search for forgiveness on um on audiio Dharma you'll find uh self forgiveness I

285
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:16,160
also see other questions about various things that uh yes P of us so

286
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:23,839
inspiration that means there's still progress yes so in inspired to make progress instead of like oh out of lack

287
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:31,240
out of like I'm not good enough so shift that um I see there are more

288
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:37,040
questions um about group process etc etc

289
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:46,400
and what's appropriate um and what I would like to do is um let's see there's there's a lot

290
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,480
and so what I would like to do is to end the session formally I see there's

291
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:58,559
there's comments from uh uh Claudia Serena um and if you would if you would

292
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:05,040
stay it would be great to just have a conversation and I can answer those questions and it would it would be

293
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:13,520
really helpful for the sa if you if you could spare a couple minutes and stay um yeah and and parents ask Micki

294
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:22,599
is it okay to name teachers who have been a source of inspiration or skillful means that's that's okay but not so much

295
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:30,000
as a um I think it becomes a little difficult when you're saying well well you you you go do that right if it's

296
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:37,119
more of a uh it depends the spirit in which it's offered right it's all depends on this so you sound like this

297
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:43,079
you know this teaching or this this teacher or this other person has been inspiring to me you know speak from your

298
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:48,280
own experience instead of telling oh you need that it's like it's that's the

299
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:55,319
spirit in which things can be um shareed really speak from your own experience um

300
00:43:55,319 --> 00:44:02,800
instead of telling others what to do I I think that's another uh important thing to keep in mind um and when in doubt say

301
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:08,800
