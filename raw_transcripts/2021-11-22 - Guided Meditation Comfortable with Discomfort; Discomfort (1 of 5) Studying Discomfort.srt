1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,160
okay now we go

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,758
i was teaching at um excuse me

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,920
i was teaching at our uh retreat center this last week uh insight retreat center teaching our

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,760
first in-person retreat in uh since the pandemic started

5
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,360
and that was wonderful and the mute button for the

6
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,520
speaker system there is the opposite uh direction for the button then the one here so i'd

7
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,239
used um

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,680
so i got confused with the up and down on the button for the mute

9
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,878
so wonderful to be here and

10
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,320
so the topic uh this week will be something that i believe is

11
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,159
important and i hope that you'll either understand it is important or come to understand its importance

12
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:24,840
it's multifaceted touches all kinds of parts of our life and that is developing the

13
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:32,840
ability to be comfortable with discomfort to develop the ability to be

14
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:40,799
non-reactive to be available to be present wisely present attentive to situations

15
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,320
where we're uncomfortable and so we'll see over the course of the week that

16
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,399
you know the different different areas where this plays out not just when it's uncomfortable and it's you

17
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:59,360
know something unfortunate tapping happening but sometimes we're uncomfortable with fortunate things happening

18
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:08,519
uncomfortable with love and comfortable with people helping us uncomfortable with um

19
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:15,840
peace even or calm all kinds of things so we'll explore this topic

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,480
so for now to meditate uh assume a meditation posture

21
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,800
and

22
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:43,599
and what i'll emphasize for this meditation posture is whatever discomfort you might have

23
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:50,360
recognize it but don't give it a lot of attention

24
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:57,599
stay connected to your breathing like you would be if you were on a rocky

25
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:04,720
rowboat in the waves and you were able to stand you had to stand and you stood in the

26
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,760
middle of the boat where it's most stable with your feet

27
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:17,200
planted wide and it wasn't dangerously rocking but you had to pay attention

28
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:24,560
and you had to give a lot of attention to navigating the rocking of the boat and

29
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,879
adjusting your weight and just really stay there and you might be aware of other things

30
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:37,760
you might even be having a conversation with a friend who's sitting in the boat and but part of your attention important

31
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,920
part of your attention is on the standing there and keeping your balance

32
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,440
so in that kind of way stay balanced stay connected to your

33
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,519
breathing for the sitting and i'll talk you through it a bit so

34
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,560
gently close your eyes

35
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,239
and as you inhale become aware of some part of your body

36
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:16,959
where there's some tension or holding and on the exhale

37
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:24,240
let go of it so let your attention roam on the inhale

38
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,840
to discover where the tension might be the holding

39
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:36,000
so first you might do this with a few long deep breaths

40
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,800
three quarters full inhale but as you inhale

41
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,919
feel where your body your body there's some holding and tension

42
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,919
and on the exhale can you soften it and relax it

43
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,000
you might come back to the same place repeatedly

44
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,199
you might allow your attention to wander around to find new places

45
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,960
and then letting your breathing return to normal and continue this process for a few more

46
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:46,160
minutes of on the inhale feeling tension or holding tightness in your body

47
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:53,240
on the exhale release it relax

48
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:59,479
and if it doesn't relax soften around it

49
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:34,240
and as you exhale and relax let there be an ever so slight pause at

50
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,919
the end of the exhale to see if in that pause you can relax

51
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:46,280
some more release some more

52
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,800
okay

53
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:15,520
releasing relaxing on the exhale with an extra

54
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:22,199
attention to relaxing when the exhale finishes

55
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,160
and now bring your attention just to the breathing

56
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,000
not to places of holding or tension in the body

57
00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:01,360
but maybe now on the exhale at the end of the exhale

58
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,520
there can be a little relaxing or more releasing of the exhale

59
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,680
relaxing around the place where you feel breathing

60
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,959
and look almost like a little pause at the end of the exhale

61
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:40,919
so so that the beginning of the inhale is highlighted

62
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:26,800
and gently maybe imagine that the

63
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:34,080
inhales and exhales are like the gentle rocking of a boat

64
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:42,160
to keep your balance you stay there connected

65
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:49,200
embodied awareness the rocking and rolling and swaying

66
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,639
moving the body breathing

67
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:11,040
and for now trust that trust attention to breathing

68
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,000
more than you trust your thinking for these minutes

69
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,000
stay in with an embodied connection

70
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,440
to the rhythm of breathing

71
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,920
if things are uncomfortable as you do this

72
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:53,600
try not to give any attention to the discomfort let it recede in the background

73
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:00,199
and in the foreground of attention let there be the breathing

74
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:22,160
not ignoring discomfort but also not giving it primary attention

75
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:31,519
primary attention goes to breathing to protect you from being reactive

76
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,360
protect you from thinking about it

77
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:45,839
and maybe you breathe with it the discomfort breathe through it

78
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,889
[Music]

79
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:55,039
and then as i as we come to the end of the sitting

80
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:05,760
to imagine that on your exhale

81
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:11,799
you can send wishes of goodwill to the world

82
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:30,520
to send your wish for the well-being of those who are close to you

83
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:39,360
those are your neighbors and members of your community and out into the world

84
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,600
may all beings

85
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:53,760
be peaceful may all beings

86
00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:02,799
be safe may all beings be happy

87
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:09,720
and may all beings everywhere be free

88
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:27,000
[Music] uh

89
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,080
fifty

90
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,840
um

91
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:47,200
so good morning good day and so the topic for today is

92
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:53,840
this this week is discomfort and with the hope that you can be

93
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:59,840
uncomfortable in better ways it isn't necessarily

94
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,519
always good to alleviate discomfort discomfort is a

95
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:12,000
part of human life and sometimes discomfort is what keeps us

96
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,279
from being living our life fully keeps us from being connected to others or

97
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:22,159
keeps us from being honest or keeps us from being free

98
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,519
so if we react every time we're uncomfortable by pulling away from that

99
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:32,760
we might be shortchanging our life dramatically

100
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:38,720
also the things that make us uncomfortable that are there at times not always of

101
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:45,440
course but there are times where that's a window into some deeper understanding of

102
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:52,640
ourselves to understand what is it that's been triggered that we feel uncomfortable

103
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,840
is it necessary to be uncomfortable is it discomfort that

104
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:04,559
that we're reacting to is it the discomfort of the situation or is the discomfort of our reaction to

105
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:10,640
the situation but regardless of what

106
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,640
the discomfort is the um today i just want to emphasize

107
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,159
the willingness to be uncomfortable

108
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:29,440
not so that you suffer more but rather so that you are not being pushed around by the discomfort

109
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,720
so that you are not reacting running away

110
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:40,720
grabbing something to distract you reaching for some

111
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:47,200
alcohol or something because you're so uncomfortable but

112
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,399
but start learning how to be skillfully

113
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:58,080
uncomfortable so one of the things that really helps

114
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:05,440
is um is this thing to understand that it's valuable to be uncomfortable

115
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,480
that but when you're uncomfortable don't go make yourself uncomfortable

116
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:17,200
isn't that valuable but if you're uncomfortable learning to

117
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:24,320
realize it's valuable to train yourself to hang out with the discomfort hang out

118
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:31,760
and be kind of non-reactive to be present in a way that you're

119
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:37,760
you're balanced and so the analogy i gave before

120
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:42,799
is you can be uncomfortable in a row boat

121
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,399
and the rowboat that's in the waves and swaying back and forth

122
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:54,159
and but if you can and if you have to stand in the robot for whatever reason

123
00:33:54,159 --> 00:34:01,440
you find a place in the mid-point lowest center of gravity in the boat and now you put your legs kind of wide

124
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,799
and firm and you stay in touch with the slightest

125
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:12,800
movements of the boat so you can adjust your weight and um

126
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:19,839
and uh shift and change as you don't just stand stuck still but you get fluid like that like fluid

127
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:25,760
kind of almost like you're swaying with the waves um when the boat lives up on the

128
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,919
on the right side maybe you lean in that direction and bend the right knee and then when it goes the other direction

129
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:37,599
you do the opposite then and so you're attuned and maybe it's uncomfortable

130
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:42,638
but uh if you react to the discomfort or get afraid in the discomfort or

131
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:49,280
you know then um you're not going to have the fluidity you're not going to have the balance with ill

132
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:56,158
so you have to be willing to feel where you're at and be with what you're at to find your bearings in it

133
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:04,480
and so how can we do that in daily life there's a few things one of the things that um

134
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,960
is breathing there's something a very

135
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:16,640
can for some people very effective about staying in touch with the rhythm of their breathing

136
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:23,119
to the degree to which your attention is grounded in the breathing that attention is not going to the

137
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:30,079
reactivity to the discomfort and and so and the breathing also tends to

138
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:36,320
be relaxing tends to be grounding or stabilizing and so to find yourself in an

139
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:42,960
uncomfortable situation and breathe and you know that's a common psychological

140
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:49,920
uh technique is if you're anxious in some situation to breathe deeply

141
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,280
if you're angry breathe deeply breathe all kinds of things you know you breathe

142
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:00,480
in order to kind of come back into balance breathe so you're not pulled into the

143
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:07,440
world of the reactivity the fears the anxieties the the angers the

144
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:14,240
uh you might feel in relationship to what's uncomfortable it doesn't mean that

145
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:20,079
we have to for now it's not doesn't mean that you have to live forever with the discomfort

146
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:26,880
but you want to have um you want to learn the skill

147
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,800
of not being pulled into the reactivity

148
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:39,520
and breathing is one of the places to learn that skill eventually as we learn to be balanced

149
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,880
and present for discomfort without the reaction then it's a time that we can learn

150
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:50,160
what's wise to do with it if the discomfort is is uh unnecessary

151
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:57,680
or unfortunate maybe there's things you can do to change it if the discomfort is a

152
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:03,839
is limiting you from doing something which is wonderful then perhaps the balance with the

153
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:09,520
discomfort that you find non-reactivity that allows you to go forward into this wonderful thing that

154
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:15,839
you're going to do so to use the breathing

155
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,320
to be with discomfort to use your mindfulness of your body the

156
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:27,760
body is such a fantastic place to rest to be established in

157
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,880
and to use mindfulness of the body to stay present in the body

158
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,240
in the uncomfortable situation if it's a social situation for example

159
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:44,720
have some of a fair amount of your attention rooted in your body find a comfort in your body

160
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,760
breathe with your body find a kind of safety

161
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:57,119
if you can with your body so that you're not automatically being pulled and reacting to what's being said

162
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:04,200
and what's being done the um

163
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:12,960
and then sometimes in terms of feeling in your body is to feel more precisely

164
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:19,800
where the discomfort is felt physically because sometimes

165
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:26,480
recognizing the actual place of discomfort gives it a kind of um

166
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:34,720
simplicity that's not there if we don't really recognize and feel

167
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:41,119
where the discomfort is it's kind of i'm thinking a little bit like the wizard of oz

168
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:47,760
that when they finally make it to the emerald city and they find that the wizard is this great big voice and the

169
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:53,280
wall or something and and then they pull the curtain and behind the curtain there's this little

170
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,880
guy who's the wizard and suddenly he's not this big domineering

171
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:04,960
imaginary presence so uh sometimes discomfort if we're

172
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:11,520
vaguely feeling uncomfortable or more in our reactivity of the discomfort it can loom and seem much bigger than it

173
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:18,640
needs to be but to drop into the body and find where particularly am i uncomfortable

174
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:25,119
am i comfortable my belly and my shoulders and my chest is it swirling in my mind

175
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:32,160
and sometimes by locating that and then breathing with that on the inhale feeling it on the exhale

176
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,839
maybe softening and relaxing um makes it kind of like

177
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:44,640
it protects us from the imagination it protects us from the general idea that oh this is bigger than

178
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,160
it actually is oh it's just tightness in my belly i can be with this

179
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:57,440
my shoulders are collect you know my chest is collapsing oh that's what it is

180
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:03,520
and so learn to breathe with discomfort learn

181
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:09,599
to recognize it in your body and then an interesting thing to do with discomfort in some

182
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:15,839
situations is to notice your posture

183
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:21,040
and notice if your posture is collapsed or your posture is pulling away or

184
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:27,280
reacting or how's your posture in relationship to the discomfort

185
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:33,760
and can you take a posture of strength a posture of confidence

186
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:39,440
a posture that feels both confident and calm

187
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:45,040
if you only take a posture it's calm you might settle back and become a couch potato and there's a kind of collapse

188
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:50,240
that might happen but to have a confident posture

189
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,680
and cost you a posture that itself expresses confidence and maybe may be

190
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:03,520
calm maybe if your finger you're tapping your fingers a lot or playing with your fingers maybe stop doing that

191
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:09,839
now you don't have to feel confident you don't have to feel calm but

192
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:15,200
assume a posture that expresses that

193
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:20,960
and then breathe with the discomfort then feel it in your body

194
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:26,960
then then kind of just be with the experience in a fuller way

195
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:35,119
so one of the purposes of advantages or possibilities in meditation is to let that this be a

196
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:42,079
as a laboratory for discomfort and that the situation is so simple when

197
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:47,599
you meditate uh hopefully that you don't have to solve any social

198
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:53,680
problems you don't have to um you know do a lot of things

199
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:59,280
it's just a simple you know you're feeling uncomfortable and then in the meditation

200
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:05,280
learn to breathe with it learn to connect to your breathing and find balance

201
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,720
in the meditation find a way to feel grounded in your body

202
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,760
and then locate where the discomfort is in the body in the meditation you can rely on a

203
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:23,680
posture which is confident and calm and then don't physically give in to the reactivity to discomfort

204
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:30,400
and so in meditation then you're beginning to discover yourself

205
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:36,319
about how you are with world of discomfort what are the tricks of the mind what are the reactions of the mind

206
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:41,599
what are the beliefs that come into play um and you're not giving into it but you're

207
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:46,880
studying it you get to know it and in this way you become a student of

208
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:53,040
discomfort not to be discomfort more uncomfortable

209
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:58,400
but rather to learn all the unnecessary reactions

210
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:05,359
responses fears beliefs that come into play that sometimes hijack your attention hijack

211
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:12,079
your wisdom and hijack your ability to be with the situation in a wise way

212
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:16,960
so sometimes in the out in the world it's hard to

213
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:23,599
you know to really assess all this and really know what needs to happen and some situations are uncomfortable and we

214
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:29,280
don't have not the time in place to check in with our discomfort it's really the time to get out of there

215
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:35,440
but and so we don't have a chance there to study it but find situations in your life where it's

216
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:41,680
appropriate it's okay to hang out and hang out with your discomfort

217
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:48,160
not to suffer more but to become wiser to understand more what's going on be

218
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:55,040
curious breathe with it feel it in the body feel location

219
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:00,318
assume a posture that allows you to

220
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:08,440
have a greater capacity to just stand there and feel the discomfort

221
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:14,000
so it's maybe an unfortunate instruction for this

222
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:21,440
day but i do instruct encourage you to look for opportunities in the next 24

223
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,880
hours when you are uncomfortable and become a student of your discomfort

224
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:32,480
in this way that i'm talking about and this will set a foundation for what we'll talk about this week as we go

225
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:38,880
along so this is not just so you can do it for today but so that you can

226
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:45,359
build on build on that as we go forward so becomes for today become a student of

227
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:51,560
discomfort thank you
