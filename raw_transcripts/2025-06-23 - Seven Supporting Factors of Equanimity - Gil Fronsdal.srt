1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,960
so the topic for today is equinimity and over the years people have come to

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:15,280
me when times are challenging either locally in certain area or in nationally

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:22,160
or internationally said Gil please give a talk on equinimity

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:31,439
it's like the go-to thing that people are requesting and um and uh when I discovered

5
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,840
equinimity for myself uh it was in on retreat

6
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:46,320
and I was quite surprised to discover it and to understand how both sweet it is

7
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,160
the that it's really sweet that it's really involves a tremendous clarity

8
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,760
and it's powerful it's an amazing thing and I had no idea until then that

9
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:04,000
equinimity was like a thing it's a particular state that we can experience

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,439
particular way the mind operates that can be known that operates if anything

11
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,799
if I when I thought about equinimity before I thought it was like a

12
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:21,200
admonition like some like stay calm you know don't be reactive now or

13
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,600
something some a little little bit you know like you had to do something okay I got to be a quantumist

14
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,520
but to discover on retreat as the mind got very settled and peaceful that there

15
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,640
arose this particular state of mind or particular activity of the mind in a

16
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:47,280
sense that is known as equinimity and how beautiful was it that was a great um

17
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:56,159
you know a great source of joy for me so um so the word for equinimity in Pali

18
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,880
in the ancient language is upeka and uh it uh is a word that means

19
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:10,319
something like to watch over to have an overview of something and so to get to

20
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,440
have the big picture of something and it's not a few times that if we have the

21
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:23,120
bigger picture of what's happening that uh we're going to be much more forgiving in the situation much less reactive

22
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,680
uh you know if someone you know is being unnecessar unnecessarily

23
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,840
snappy irrit irritated and irritable and just like what is going on here you

24
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,200
know this is my friend or this is my colleague I've known for a long time and and it's easy maybe to get

25
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,959
self-righteous or upset or critical this person's doing me wrong but then uh

26
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:54,000
someone tells you you know so and so um just lost a very close relative and they

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,040
have all this personal challenges right now to kind of and oh now you have the

28
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:06,959
bigger picture they understand more why the person is emotionally challenged so okay let's let's give this person lots

29
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:14,000
of permission let's just hold this person with care and kindness and not take it so personal that the person is

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,319
attacking me by being snappy so there's lots of situations like this where where we do this maybe or we don't

31
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:28,720
do it because we don't have the overview maybe you're in this in the market you

32
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,640
know checkout and you you're going to the checkout and there's lots of lines and you see one place where the line is

33
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,560
kind of short and it's clear that you're the you have the right you're they're right there ready to move into the be

34
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:47,120
the next person in line and someone slips right in front of you like how could they do that they they could have

35
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,319
seen me and how could they possibly this is offensive and then they see me and so

36
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:58,879
many times people don't see me and and I should give this person a piece of my mind and this is not how good people

37
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:05,519
operate but then somehow maybe you start a conversation with a

38
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,799
person something happens and you discover that the person's been kind of

39
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:17,120
seriously critically ill for a year and this is the first time out and it's

40
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,440
challenging it's the person's exhausted and tired and just barely able to kind of manage to get their their food and

41
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,720
get out of there and they don't really see what's going on around them they just saw the line and they were like in

42
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,800
a trying to cope and so they just saw this kind of gap and stepped into it

43
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:41,759
without they didn't have the bigger picture but when you hear the story about this person's challenges oh please

44
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:48,240
of course you could have be in front of me no problem and so there there as soon as you know something you have the you

45
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,360
know the bigger picture of what it is and one of the remarkable things that

46
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:01,520
happened to me many years ago was that I did a retreat with Steven Levine who was

47
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:08,479
one of the premier kind of pioneers for the modern hospice movement and he wrote

48
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:14,720
a very impactful book at the time called who dies about death and dying and so I

49
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,240
did a weekend workshop with him and brilliant man very insightful and

50
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:28,160
attuned to people and and it was a death and dying workshop and and um it was up in Marin at maybe

51
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:34,800
the community college there or some place like that and before the event was going to start all these people were

52
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:42,639
milling around outside in the courtyard and um and um

53
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:50,080
I don't know exactly exact you know I don't know exactly how to describe how I was viewing everyone but I think I was a

54
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:56,320
little bit at the minimum um I had this view that these were just

55
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:02,479
everyday ordinary people it might have been a little worse than that

56
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:08,160
but I if I could tell if I could remember it properly I would tell you but but you know some people like these

57
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:15,600
are ordinary everyday kind of people and then we went into the workshop for the weekend and the primary way in which

58
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,919
Steven line worked was he invited people to come up and speak about their challenges around death and dying and

59
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:29,360
then he would engage them in a transformative way very quickly it was remarkable what the two days were like

60
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:36,960
and the people who spoke who were these ordinary everyday people

61
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,759
had these dramatic difficult challenging experiences i mean

62
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,840
some of them were literally um you know dying while they were there some people

63
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:58,160
had just lost their child young child or baby or something some people they're all in accidents and this and that that

64
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:06,400
uh war zones it was ordinary people everyday people with this huge

65
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,919
painful difficult time and I thought Gil you just kind of

66
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:18,560
viewed all of them as ordinary everyday people who don't have any suffering kind of or something

67
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:26,240
and I said wow I take people for granted who knows when I'm walking down the street what suffering what background

68
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,599
what challenges these people have maybe everyone has some kind of serious

69
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:38,639
challenge background and let's not take people for granted anymore let's not kind of assume that everyone is I don't

70
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:44,639
know what everyday ordinary folks everyone has an emotional depth and

71
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,240
background and conditions that I don't know and so that provides an overview

72
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,960
kind of a different attitude to how to be with people that lends itself to not

73
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:04,560
being immediately reactive judgmental uh operating on pref preferences

74
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,720
u bias and uh so this idea of an overview an equinimity from an overview from seeing

75
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,840
a bigger picture seeing in a different way the other word that's used for

76
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,960
equinimity is a very ordinary three words that are

77
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,199
strung together into a compound that sounds like a sophisticated word if you don't know poly

78
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,240
it's it's the words um um

79
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:38,479
kind of like this middle standing

80
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,599
in the middle of all this so uh it's kind of more of a sense rather than an

81
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,640
overview it's more like having a balance being in a balanced standing position be

82
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,000
able to take a stand and not be pushed around and this comes a little bit from

83
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,080
from being somehow emotionally or spiritually or psychologically strong

84
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,920
there's some kind of inner stability inner balance that if someone comes and

85
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,200
says something unkind to you or if someone praises you

86
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,839
that uh that's not going to kind of hit anything inside it's not going to tip you over one way or the other you kind

87
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:24,640
of you're you're you're kind of rooted in a certain way that that rootedness means that you're not prone to being

88
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,399
pushed around by what's called the winds of the world the praise and blame success and failures and things like

89
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:36,160
that so these are the two kind of primary forms of what what background

90
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,320
for equinimity and what they both do is they protect us

91
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,760
from a reactive mind they protect us from somehow and reactive in my

92
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,360
vocabulary is uh a action a response in

93
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,959
the mind which is on automatic pilot that happens before we've decided it

94
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:05,440
decided anything or come to conclusion we just automatically kind of react to a

95
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,440
situation rather than respond response can be more thoughtful more

96
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,959
considerate more kind of balanced more coming from a deeper place reactivity is

97
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:22,480
kind of like a surface reaction that uh that you know after it happens

98
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:29,600
we realize that we've done it and so uh equinimity balance protects us

99
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,519
from this reactivity which keeps the mind calm calmer one of the natures of

100
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:41,200
reactivity is that it agitates the mind and an agitated mind is more likely to

101
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,360
be reactive which keeps it going and some people unfortunately seem to live

102
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,399
in reactivity and sometimes what people are reacting to and I've certainly seen

103
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:59,160
this in myself um I'm reacting to myself

104
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,720
i have a thought I have an idea I have something and like that that just like you know gets me agitated you know

105
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,000
automatically and then that agitation then another one another one and it goes

106
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,920
on and on and so equinimity is to come to a place where we're not prone to be reactive we

107
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:27,040
might have all kinds of feelings and responses that arise but all those feelings and responses are held in kind

108
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,320
of a wider field uh rather than generating an automatic

109
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:39,279
uh uh response so how is equinimity

110
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:46,560
brought about how do we find ourselves to be a quantumous someone tells you be a quantumous what do you do uh there was

111
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:53,200
a time when some I kind of indicated at the beginning where someone if someone told me Gail be a quantamus

112
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,399
I would have reacted to that

113
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:05,600
and and one reaction is no the other reaction would be okay I got

114
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:12,079
to get to work you know somehow you know this is something to do

115
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:18,959
but I think that reactiv um equinimity is not something we do but something

116
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:24,480
that we we build something that we create the conditions for so that it's

117
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,560
there to support us it's not a not a doing if it's a doing it probably is not

118
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:37,760
going to work if if we try too much to be a quantum it's probably not equinimity but equinimity is almost like

119
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:43,440
a byproduct of a way of living a way of practicing a way of being that we want

120
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,880
to put in place that we can do um and so

121
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,560
uh in doing them then equinimity can become stronger and stronger

122
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:01,200
so there are seven things that I think of that are the conditions for

123
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,200
the

124
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:15,519
seven conditions for the arising the appearance the establishing of equinimity

125
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:22,160
the first is uh and this some of this kind of follows a very common uh a kind

126
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:28,160
of progression of practice described in the in the Buddha's teachings the first

127
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:35,600
is um to live an ethical life and an ethical life in the Buddhist

128
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,279
vocab Buddhist teachings is a life that does not involve any intentional harming

129
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,480
of anybody else that's the that's the criteria for it and if there's no

130
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,760
intentional wanting to harm someone through our body speech and mind then

131
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,839
that gives birth according to the Buddha to uh the joy or the bliss of

132
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:05,680
blamelessness that no one has anything to blame you people can't blame you uh uh based on

133
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,480
what you've actually done of course people will blame you anyway

134
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:17,839
but you know that your inner life was clean you know that you dedicated to

135
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:24,560
nonharming and you were not intending to harm someone even though uh inadvertently maybe you did cause harm

136
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,000
to someone or offend someone and then you maybe try to take care of that but

137
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,519
at least you have the equinimity the balance that you have nothing to apologize for

138
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:44,800
uh you don't have to be or worry that someone's going to uh find out what you did because you had unkind thoughts or

139
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:51,680
you did something unethical and so a tremendous value of living

140
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:58,880
harmlessly dedicated to harmless harmlessness uh that's based on no hostility living a

141
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:05,600
life without hostility and um and to take refuge in that to

142
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:11,839
value that to realize how important that is so that if someone does blame you so

143
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:18,560
that if something you do something that the byproduct somehow accidentally is that it causes some harm or pain for

144
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:24,399
someone uh you at least don't have to worry about your intention you don't

145
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:30,399
have to worry about you know the motivations you have in your inner life you you can you kind of kind of kind of

146
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:36,399
feel good about yourself on the inside you might not feel good about the consequences of what you did and you

147
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:42,240
might want to try to do something to alleviate the problem that was caused but there's some balance or some

148
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,279
non-reactivity there's nothing in there you have that causes you to feel like

149
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:52,959
you did something wrong that you were just somehow were off in your way that

150
00:15:52,959 --> 00:16:00,079
you went through the world so this uh sometimes it's called the bliss of blamelessness the well-being of

151
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:06,240
knowing that you you have nothing you've done nothing that deserves blame from someone else

152
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:14,160
the second support for equinimity is um uh it's often in English called

153
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:20,320
faith sada in Pali uh I like the word confidence

154
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:26,079
confidence in the practice confidence in the dharma confidence in these teachings confidence in the purpose of this

155
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:32,399
practice that when there's a confidence about how to live confidence about a

156
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,600
practice we have to engage with this life that we have if that is strong then

157
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:44,560
we have we know we have inner resources and an inner direction inner orientation

158
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,920
that will support us in any circumstance we find ourselves and so even though we

159
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:57,600
don't understand what to do in a in a situation we know that the practice is always there i can't tell you how many

160
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,959
times I've been in a situation where I did not know what to do

161
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:09,600
but uh I've come to trust that in those circumstances I can always be mindful

162
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,640
and if I'm mindful somehow things seems to work out that I couldn't have

163
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,959
predicted if I had not been mindful I would have been caught up in my reactivity my fears

164
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,880
my trying to figure things out my kind of agitated mind but with a faith and

165
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,400
confidence and mindfulness I can stay somehow balanced and calm non-reactive

166
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,400
and realize okay we have time here let's just be present uh let's talk about

167
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:45,520
what's actually happening here what we can recognize and know let me stay close to how I'm feeling and somehow uh

168
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,960
through that things work out so I've learned I have a tremendous faith in

169
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:58,240
mindfulness i have a tremendous confidence in uh uh cultivating calm

170
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,760
cultivating um non-attachment cultivating a certain kind of uh inner

171
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:10,559
freedom i'm not always those ways but have confidence in it and that carrying

172
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:16,000
that with me means that I'm much more likely to be non-reactive it supports

173
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,160
equinimity the third is uh a sense of is a

174
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:31,520
well-developed mind or develop developed heart the our inner life

175
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:41,760
uh you don't have to put I was going to say put up with but maybe that's not nice um you don't have to uh just uh be

176
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:47,200
stuck with the inner life that you have your inner life is malleable your inner

177
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,880
life can change and grow for the better or your inner life can can grow and

178
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,000
develop in ways that are kind of harmful to you and the world it can go oh uh it

179
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:05,039
can go to be kind of beautiful inner life or it could be a fairly ugly inner life when there's full of hostility and

180
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:11,840
hatred and and uh greed in a way that um you know is not kind to the people

181
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:18,640
around us and so uh to develop a good inner life a

182
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:26,000
strong wellbalanced inner life um to cultivate mindfulness so the mindfulness

183
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,640
becomes strong to cultivate uh concentration and calm and stability

184
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,000
so those become strong so that not that they have to be strongly mindful

185
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,240
strongly concentrated or calm all the time but so that

186
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,840
those are available to turn on when they're needed

187
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:55,520
turn them on kind of or or or turn up the volume or or bring up the greater

188
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:01,200
clarity so there's sometimes I'm in a situation where um this situation feels

189
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,880
like okay now I got to really be mindful really be present for this and I can

190
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:13,039
kind of turn on the mindfulness muscle and uh it's kind of like pulling the

191
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:18,320
curtains from the mind and so I'm not so caught up in my thoughts and my

192
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:25,760
fantasies ideas myself but now I'm really seeing knowing

193
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,280
recognizing noting uh tuning in to the details of the present the details of

194
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:37,039
what's happening inside of me and this is invaluable to have this heightened

195
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:42,640
kind of capacity to be mindful there's a lot of circumstances where because of my

196
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:49,280
role my my role as a teacher where I'm meeting one-on-one with people and it's really important that I kind of turn

197
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,799
this on so that um I'm really attuned to what's happening in me and the other

198
00:20:54,799 --> 00:21:00,080
person really present and um I don't really I'm not thinking about the past

199
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:05,520
and the future too much uh I'm not even trying to remember what people say i'm

200
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,559
just really trying to turn on and be present be mindful be clear what's and

201
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:16,880
track what's going on here um there's you know and it's not not

202
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:25,840
always appropriate thing to do in all circumstances uh I shouldn't do this too much at home

203
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,280
you know in with my family my kids you know um you know it's a little bit you

204
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:37,679
know too much for them but um but they uh but they have the ability when something is difficult to turn on the

205
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:45,600
mindfulness and really know it's there it's a strength we have or to turn on the calm or stability to be able to kind

206
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:52,400
of know how to kind of become embodied how to relax be settled be here in an

207
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:58,159
embodied kind of way that's soft relax calm to breathe calmly this is a great

208
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:03,600
skill to have both of these to turn on a higher degree of strength of mindfulness

209
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:10,000
a higher strength of stability calm help then this non-reactivity to be there

210
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,760
we're less likely to react because we have this balance this support

211
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:22,799
the fourth factor is a well-developed uh happiness well-being

212
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:29,440
to have to become happy and this is one of the goals that is inherent or or

213
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,799
explicit in the Buddhist path to liberation that the the on the way of

214
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:41,600
this path is to become happier to have more joy to have an inner life that uh

215
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:49,360
is is you're glad to have you're delighted to have there's delight in it there's joy there's happiness and this

216
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:56,320
is of course a little bit challenging to hear for some people there's a lot of people who their life is not like that

217
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:03,840
where they're quite challenged quite sad grieving depressed angry hurt

218
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:09,039
uh you know it's there's a lot a lot of people that way the dharma though is

219
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:14,480
here to support them with this practice to hold it and be with it in a wise and

220
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:20,080
compassionate way but in the process it is supposed to kind of slowly help

221
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:26,880
people to develop an inner capacity for happiness well-being so their inner life

222
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,880
has the ability to feel when it's appropriate uh a friendly and welcoming

223
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:40,159
a place to be in a sense we're be we're in the dharma we're supposed to become our own friend

224
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:46,799
so that our mind rather than being an enemy is our you know our best friend we're happy to be company our mind or

225
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:54,000
have our mind along because it's a happy place to be so uh one of the ways that's developed

226
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:01,440
is to begin recognizing more often than we normally would when

227
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,360
we have moments of well-being when we have moments of pleasure and delight

228
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,720
i'm quite capable of leaving my house in a hurry i'm late to come and teach the

229
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:20,640
dharma and so I I don't even know that it's a beautiful blue sky and recognize the

230
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:27,520
clarity of the light in the early morning uh because I have important places to go

231
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:33,120
or we can take the few extra seconds few extra minutes to start enjoying and

232
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,640
appreciating the simple joys of life the simple pleasures of life not to be

233
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:44,320
hedonistic but in order to begin uh conditioning ourselves acculturating

234
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:51,200
ourselves that it is possible to create the conditions for inner well-being

235
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:57,039
one of the functions of of samadei practice is in fact to cultivate greater

236
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:03,360
sense of well-being one of the functions of some of mindfulness practice is in fact to

237
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,640
discover how to put in the conditions of mindfulness so that a natural capacity

238
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:15,840
for well-being wells up one of the great surprises one of the great pleasures

239
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:22,240
treasures of dharma practice is discover that there's well-being their sense of

240
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:30,159
joy and happiness that can arise for no good reason

241
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:36,480
most of us you know we need reasons win the lottery we get a good date we get someone praises us all kinds of things

242
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:42,080
that uh that uh you know conditions in the world have to be a certain way and

243
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,360
some people are chasing the world chasing conditions in the world trying to reorganize things and make things

244
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:54,159
happen so that they get the condition so they get things happen that make them happy

245
00:25:54,159 --> 00:26:01,679
in the dharma we discover that we don't have to f our happiness doesn't have to depend on the world the world being a

246
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:09,120
particular way getting what we want uh there can be the the harmonious

247
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,559
working of the inner life itself produces happiness and well-being

248
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:20,880
and it's really a delight to just feel this carry with you an inner happiness

249
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:27,360
not dependent on the world and that's one of the lessons of this practice

250
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:33,440
the next one is so that's four so uh ethical integrity

251
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,480
faith well-developed mind a sense of well-being

252
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:46,159
and then the the fifth is um wisdom to have some uh some good understanding

253
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:51,760
street smarts of what's goes on in this world so I I attained acquired some

254
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:57,520
wisdom from the Steven Levine workshop and um it wasn't so much about my own

255
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:04,720
relationship to death and dying from that weekend but rather was a much deeper understanding appreciation wisdom

256
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:12,559
about the challenges that human beings have that when I was young was quite kind of eyeopening to see and so that

257
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:19,120
that gave me the wisdom to not take people for granted to be ready to understand that people are suffering And

258
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:27,039
that wisdom gives me more ability to hold people with equinimity with care

259
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:33,200
a very uh somewhat typical I think advice that hospice workers will give to

260
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:39,520
family of someone who's dying if they're dying slowly and uh is to kind of warn

261
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,799
the family that sometimes I don't know what exactly how it is 3 or 4 days

262
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:50,480
before they die the last week sometimes um sometimes more uh people will go

263
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:57,760
through a kind of maybe it's a physiological changes maybe it's hormonal changes in their you know in

264
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:04,000
their body who knows what it is why but uh they they the dying person will be

265
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,360
become very hostile and angry to the people that they have loved the most in

266
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,640
their life their family or spouses and it could be deeply distressing for the

267
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:21,520
family to suddenly have this anger being directed at them from the one person they love but hospice workers will often

268
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:28,080
forewarn people and say this is a known phase of people that are dying you don't

269
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:34,799
have to take it personally and so then when then when it happens oh okay we know why why it's here this is

270
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:41,039
not this is not the culmination of our relationship for 40 years this is just

271
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:46,080
chemicals maybe operating in their in their system and so now we have the have

272
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:52,880
a wisdom of how this works we might have wisdom about how our

273
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:58,720
reactivity works maybe we've learned the lesson from many

274
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:04,880
years experience slowly gained that when we react we re

275
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:11,919
react we get a headache when we react we feel uh stress and tension when we react

276
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:19,120
we tend to make a lot of mistakes and um and so uh to begin slowly to

277
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:24,880
learn our our delusions our reactivity our beliefs that are operating that that

278
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:33,200
keep us from being aquatous that's wisdom the um um I mean a few things that I I

279
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:38,320
had I learned myself through these years of practice that was slowly gained

280
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:46,559
because maybe sometimes I'm a very slow learner and u but it slowly dawned on me that my

281
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:52,600
success rate at predicting the future was abysmal

282
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:59,919
and I had you know I would I would have all these fear about the future plan I would try set everything up to be just

283
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:05,840
perfect so it' all be good and I was just planning ahead and anxious and wondering or expecting it to be a

284
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:12,880
certain way and over and over and over again it the event that happened was

285
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,480
different than how I could have expected it to be and so slowly slowly I learned

286
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,399
that Gil the chances are pretty high that your predictions of the future your idea of

287
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:29,600
what's coming is not going to be right and that created more that wisdom

288
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,880
created more equinimity for me the um

289
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:41,840
I have delusions and so that was also slow slow to to recognize so I've maybe mentioned this

290
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:47,679
recently but one delusion that I'm still operating under is uh I do a lot of

291
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,960
writing little essays and different things and uh as soon as I finish

292
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:59,440
writing at the first draft it's done it's ready to be sent out or something

293
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:05,039
and uh and I'm then or I'm eager to send it to someone to help edit it or something but it's done you know I've

294
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:10,240
done my piece and occasionally I've uh you know had that idea in the evening

295
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:16,159
and then in the morning I wake up and I have new ideas you know no or I read it

296
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:22,240
two days later it's a wait this is not ready so I don't know what it is and why I'm

297
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,840
built in this kind of way that I come to these conclusions maybe I think to I don't know what I don't I'm not going to

298
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:33,360
guess but I have a delusion and that delusion was against there slowly

299
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:40,159
learned to see it and now I see it when it's there and and so I don't bite I

300
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:46,480
don't give into it there's equinimity and things are much easier for me with my writing because I just now give it

301
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,919
the time that it needs or much of what it needs

302
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:59,200
so wisdom the the the sixth is um

303
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,440
is um the wisdom of non-clinging

304
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:12,080
to not cling or to have the wisdom to recognize when you do cling and to know

305
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:17,919
how to let go to recognize we lean in oh I'm angry with someone and to them I'm

306
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:26,320
leaning in to hold on to that anger it's a you You know it's it's a very different to be angry and hold on to it

307
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:33,039
tight versus being angry and not picking it up just letting it move through us we

308
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:38,159
don't have to justify anger necessarily we don't have to condemn anger necessarily

309
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,279
if uh if we're not clinging to it then we may be more balanced with it

310
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:51,440
equinimously angry meaning we're quantimous about being angry look at that there's anger

311
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:58,480
well let's see how this goes rather than you know immediately getting on the angry bandwagon

312
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:05,519
to have a desire desires are dime a dozen but uh but

313
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:11,840
again when we cling to desires that's where we might make problems for ourselves or that's where we lose our

314
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:18,320
equinimity and so to learn to not hold on to desires to hold them lightly

315
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:25,519
and um you know rather than holding it in a fist we hold them with an open hand so we can see them clearly and we might

316
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:31,120
then better be able to assess is this a good desire or not a good desire useful

317
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:36,640
or not useful so to learn something about clinging

318
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:43,279
uh it gives a lot of uh contributes a lot of capacity for equinimity because

319
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:50,640
most loss of equinimity most reactivity involves some some clinging to something

320
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:56,279
and then finally the seventh support for equinimity

321
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:02,399
is um the absence of clinging

322
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:10,240
the absence of holding on to some fixed ideas about life ourselves fixed ideas

323
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:16,480
about our who we are who we're supposed to be who we shouldn't be fixed ideas of

324
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:22,158
what is right and wrong so that when something happens in the

325
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:28,960
world it doesn't hit some attachment we have it doesn't hit

326
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:35,200
something we're holding on for dear life so you know the the example that's given

327
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:41,599
uh in this in the teachings of the Buddha is that uh conceit is apparently

328
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:47,358
like a um the the the

329
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:52,560
flag the banner that an army you know

330
00:34:52,560 --> 00:35:00,000
troop carries with it into into b into battle announcing it's there and then

331
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,200
everyone can attack but without the flag of conceit uh

332
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:13,040
nothing can be attacked so it's kind of like if some if you hold up you know something uh you know if you and you

333
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:18,240
throw something at it it can hit it and hurt it and then there's a reaction but

334
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:25,119
if there's nothing there then some things go right through it's like an a a

335
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:30,400
closed window the neighbor's baseball will break it open window it goes

336
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:38,520
through and lands on the living room floor floor hopefully and causes no causes no damage

337
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,680
and uh so so there's this there's a a a

338
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:51,440
deep letting go that is possible that the dharma teaches and that deep letting go then means that

339
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:58,960
we're not holding up panes of glass that the world can strike

340
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:04,720
and and and and uh and then we react accordingly we just things just go right

341
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:11,280
through in a sense things can arise and oh

342
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:18,160
so you know if uh if one of you said to me that you know dharma teachers who

343
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:23,760
wear gray shirts you know they're a sorry state

344
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,440
you know you know there I don't know I think that would just like

345
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,960
that would have no that wouldn't touch me at Oh I might

346
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,599
wonder about you

347
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:48,960
maybe you need equinimity so equinimity

348
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,240
so uh one of the principles here that I'm trying to convey is that it's not

349
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,280
something we do because then it's probably not equinimity but it's rather

350
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:07,599
a condition that we have supported and grown and come to appreciate come to value

351
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:14,800
come to see that equinimity is really for our own best

352
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:20,000
equinimity makes room in the heart and the mind for the best qualities inside

353
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,920
of us to come to the forefront equinimity is a kind of a condition that

354
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:31,359
allows for the goodness we have inside us to grow and part of what we're doing

355
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:37,040
in dharma practice is growing our inside our inner life so that it becomes a

356
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:45,680
beautiful inner life it becomes a valuable inner life it becomes an inner life that um

357
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:52,039
is here to support the well-being and happiness of all

358
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:58,160
so those are my thoughts on equinimity so um

359
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:06,760
what are your thoughts we have about five minutes before the end do you have any questions about that or thoughts or

360
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:14,520
did it did it did you lose your equinimity in some way hearing it

361
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:31,839
can you hear me so I've been thinking about equinimity

362
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:36,960
uh in the context of what's going on right now in the world

363
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:42,160
and particularly the news that we got last night that we seem to be

364
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:48,720
starting yet another war you know our country that I'm a citizen

365
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:56,240
of and I came into this very troubled by that and I listen to your talk and

366
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:02,880
everything you said is is correct it makes sense and yet

367
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:10,560
I'm struggling a little bit with how I can reconcile a deep sense of compassion

368
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:15,480
and a feeling of wanting to

369
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,440
alleviate the suffering that we seem to be on the brink of

370
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:30,560
with this all the stuff you just talked about maybe could you could you give some guidance on on how to hold this so

371
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,400
I don't know your inner life to know whether I can speak of speak for it but

372
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:43,119
first I want to say I appreciate very much your compassion and desire to alleviate suffering in the world that's

373
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:49,520
a beautiful quality and um I think that uh

374
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:55,839
to have that I hope people will act on that I hope you will act on that in some way

375
00:39:55,839 --> 00:40:04,960
i hope you have the wisdom to know what's appropriate for you to do uh sometimes we can't we can't uh address

376
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:11,040
directly address the big things in the world that are happening we read in the things we read in the newspaper but we

377
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:18,240
can be changed by it so that uh we can uh put more energy or effort into

378
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:26,320
what where we can make a difference it might be that um if you offer your care

379
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:31,359
support for a neighboring child

380
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:38,560
you might be preventing World War II World War I who knows how

381
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:45,040
this kid's going to grow up but it's possible that the one person was really kind and supportive changed the whole

382
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:52,400
direction of that person's life you think that's ridiculous but there's a lot of small ways

383
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:58,079
acupuncture points of change in this world that are operating that are not

384
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:04,960
you know but and but then but to go and stand on a street corner with a sign saying you know no war that might be

385
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:14,160
nice but it might not that might not be the acupuncture point that makes a difference and um and you're so so but

386
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:20,319
to but to do figure out what to do absolutely but the more interesting uh reflection

387
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:27,839
of what you're saying is that what's the complex ecology in you

388
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:36,000
uh when you have this uh the it's one thing to be aimous

389
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,480
it's another thing to have no equinimity to be caught in fear distress anger

390
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,960
confusion but to be caught in the grip of that

391
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:56,240
the desire to be do good in the world to be compassionate and alleviate suffering takes a very different shape depending

392
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:02,000
which of those two ways your mind is and so the chances are the way you the

393
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,800
tone of voice the way you said this and the way your face and everything looked uh there's a lot of extra going on here

394
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:15,520
for you that's not needed not needed and so to not to not let that be unconscious

395
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:22,800
so that it creates a power a strength of distress and pushing like something needs to happen here that's being pushed

396
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:29,200
by fear distress anger uh that uh that's what the dharma practice that's what

397
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:36,560
deep equinimity helps us to find and then we find that

398
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:43,200
and maybe settle those things heal those things and then maybe that when we do

399
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,720
engage in compassionate care for the world we do it in a way that's more

400
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:54,720
effective and one of the ways it can be more effective is we become the example

401
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:01,440
of what we want the world world to have how does that sound to you does that

402
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:08,380
address your concern or is it easier said than done

403
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:13,440
[Music] but that's I'll try that's why we have a

404
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:20,400
practice and in some way one response to these kinds of the big challenges of the world

405
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:28,319
the sufferings of the world one very powerful response of what we can do is

406
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:33,520
we can practice and some people actually will will throw

407
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:39,040
themselves dedicate themselves to a life of practice because they this is this is

408
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:44,240
the deepest response that we can do some people feel that's not for them

409
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:52,480
that response or that seems like it's avoiding the problem but uh in a sense uh in a real sense I

410
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:58,000
saw the huge challenges of the world and when I was young

411
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,440
the distress of the world and that's what I decided I decided to take the

412
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:11,040
route of the dharma and the practice and um and so now when I teach I've

413
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:16,400
tried to teach in such a way that that um support people in their suffering and

414
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:22,480
freedom from suffering But I I'm also teaching because I want all of us I want

415
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:28,720
everyone to to become agents of change to make this world a better place not

416
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:34,960
just to sit and meditate but to whether it's the local children or whether it's

417
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:40,240
you know in capitals of the world or that we try to make this world a better

418
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:47,359
place but uh so that's a response to you that that uh dedicating yourself to practice

419
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:53,359
is not a escape it's a way of really getting to the bottom of who of

420
00:44:53,359 --> 00:45:00,319
ourselves bottom of our reactivity our attachments and clinging so that uh we

421
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:06,640
can be much more effective and happier in how we deal

422
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:13,839
with the suffering of the world so maybe if you if you think it can be a

423
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:18,960
short answer can we can you pass it there because we the time is up now i'll

424
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:27,040
try to be quick with my answer now let's see if I can be quick with my

425
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:34,319
and and economous my question i just remain confused and I may be

426
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:41,119
saying the same thing that the gentleman just did but it it seems like

427
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:47,920
with practice that compassion is essential or where I want to where I

428
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:54,720
want to go and so is equinimity and that I need to just keep finding a balance

429
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:02,319
between those when I find I've gone so much with compassion that I'm overwhelmed then I need to go back work

430
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:09,440
more on being equinimity but yeah I think I I went through a I'm

431
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,880
not being short am I i went through uh about 15 years of being part of the

432
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:22,560
Friends meeting the Quakers and it seemed like both of those were something that was being worked toward not always

433
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,839
with ease and the other day I Let me let me let me respond since people I want to

434
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:38,240
may I okay the the so equinimity and compassion maybe both of them are uh uh

435
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:44,160
expressions of something deeper that we develop and so we what we're doing in the dharma practice we're trying to get

436
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:50,640
back to the roots that are deeper deeper down and so we don't want to be too

437
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:56,240
quick to call upon equinimity as the response to the world too quick call on

438
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:02,800
compassion we might not be quite ready so we want to develop a strong practice

439
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,920
which uh creates the inner stability the inner quiet the inner mindfulness so

440
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:15,119
that we can actually start seeing the roots of deep what's deeper inside it's those roots that have to be somehow

441
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:21,200
trans transformed without knowing ourselves down to the depths uh we're

442
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:26,040
just rearranging the deck chairs and the Titanic

443
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:34,000
i don't know i I just I drove by a church the other day and there was a big banner that said um immigrants and

444
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,119
refugees welcomed here and it seemed like it wasn't a wild action uh that it

445
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:44,720
was a loving action and if we're very committed to ethics and compassion yeah

446
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:53,200
sometimes I just really feel like in a very calm loving way it would just seem

447
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:59,680
like a group that I really love that's devoted to those would Yeah very nice i

448
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:06,240
love the Quakers and and I love the Quakers and different churches that are involved in social action that's their

449
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:12,440
mission is to be involved in social action and I think it's fantastic

450
