1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:07,919
so good day everyone and welcome to our meditation session

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:16,320
and um and so here to sit

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:24,480
and include your body as part of the meditation it's helpful to have the body be

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,840
at the center of your meditation partly because

5
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,680
centered in the body ground in the body gives us much more capacity

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:43,440
for patience for openness for an ability to be present for what is

7
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,920
here and uh cultivating cultivating developing our

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,160
capacity to be present for all the different things that can come in our lives

9
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,559
is one of the tasks of meditation because they're sooner or later they'll be very challenging things that we all

10
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:10,240
have to experience and have to have prepared ourselves with developing our capacity for

11
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,439
to be present to be open to be patient

12
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:22,560
is so important so gently

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,640
taking a comfortable but alert meditation posture

14
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:43,360
giving some care to adjusting your posture whatever way that's appropriate for how you are meditating

15
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:50,320
so your body is a little more active not completely passive so not to be a

16
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:57,200
just completely so even if you're lying down

17
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:04,159
to have your forearms pointing to the ceiling maybe your elbows resting on

18
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,440
the ground or the surface and the arms pointing to the ceiling

19
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,640
gives a little bit more activation

20
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,319
and if it's comfortable closing the eyes

21
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:45,760
and taking a few long slow deep breaths

22
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:54,239
taking your time with the inhale as long as it's comfortable to breathe

23
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,280
in taking your time to breathe in

24
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:05,239
feeling maybe the comfort or the pleasure of that

25
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,080
taking your time to exhale

26
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,159
as long as it's comfortable to exhale

27
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,120
perhaps enjoying the extended exhale

28
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:36,159
and with the extended exhale to relax in the shoulders

29
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,640
soften

30
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,319
soften the belly

31
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,799
and relax the whole body down into your

32
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,280
wherever your body is in contact with some surface

33
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,439
chair the floor

34
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:21,680
and release yourself to receive the support of that surface

35
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:31,320
so that there's a feeling of maybe being grounded or centered rooted here

36
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,600
letting your breathing return to normal

37
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,520
and on the exhale perhaps you can soften your face

38
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,478
around the eyes

39
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,960
the cheeks and the jaws

40
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,600
and also to relax the area of your brain

41
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:39,840
or wherever there might be some contraction or energy

42
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:48,120
associated with thinking wanting resisting

43
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,479
relaxing

44
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,880
and then as you sit here now spending these few minutes settling in

45
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:15,039
can you recognize inside of you in your body your mind your heart

46
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:23,039
the capacity to be patient with what is

47
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:35,080
a patience that maybe is an openness

48
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,800
or a supportive

49
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,960
tolerance for what is uncomfortable

50
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:04,000
a recognition of the challenges it might be here while you're meditating

51
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,039
that in the very recognition there's a patience

52
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,960
a kind of acceptance openness

53
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:24,479
in that clear recognition of what is uncomfortable or

54
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,560
difficult

55
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:49,520
and what is often underappreciated is that what's valuable is not what is

56
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:56,879
happening but rather the how we're aware of it

57
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,960
patiently openly

58
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,440
non-reactively

59
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,800
being aware with clarity clear recognition now this is what's

60
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:27,720
happening and developing the capacity

61
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,560
to be present for what is especially when things

62
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,800
are uncomfortable

63
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:46,880
and coming to appreciate not that you can be with the uncomfortable

64
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:55,320
but appreciating how you can be with what's uncomfortable

65
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:13,279
and one support for this grounding in the body for ability to be patient and open

66
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:19,440
is the constancy of our attention to the breathing

67
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,959
the rhythm of breathing in and out becomes the beat

68
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,399
that keeps us steady and going and

69
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,160
maybe uninterruptable

70
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,440
and our attention here in the present

71
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,919
you

72
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:43,120
if you are more settled than you were at the beginning of the meditation

73
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:49,279
recognize that maybe recognizing it as

74
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:55,520
a capacity to be more patient more open

75
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:04,000
to what's happening and if you're not more settled

76
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:11,840
recognize that and that is the place to be patient

77
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:18,760
open with how things are

78
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,840
and as we come to the end of this sitting

79
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:09,440
to perhaps appreciate that when we can be comfortable

80
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:15,840
or when we can be patient with discomfort

81
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:23,039
then that patient cannot patience can be used offered as a gift

82
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:31,039
to others that we can stay calm or non-reactive

83
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:38,159
when the situations are difficult maybe when people have difficulties that

84
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,840
are uncomfortable for us our patience allows us to stay present

85
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:49,320
attentive non-reactive

86
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:55,440
so that our generosity our kindness our care

87
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,440
has space and room to operate

88
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:10,080
may it be that our development our cultivation

89
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:15,840
of greater capacities in patience attention kindness

90
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:24,159
can grow through our meditation practice in such a way that we can

91
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:30,480
it can be a gift to the world we can dedicate it to the world

92
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:35,840
so that we can live and act and speak in ways

93
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:41,440
that benefits others that supports others to

94
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:49,760
feel more at ease or more present in this difficult life

95
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:56,159
may it be that our meditation practice helps us to improve the world for all

96
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:02,559
beings may may we be a force of good

97
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:09,599
so that all beings may be happy all beings

98
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:15,838
may be safe so that all beings

99
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:23,519
may experience peace so that all beings may be free

100
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:28,638
may all beings be free from oppression

101
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,358
and attachments

102
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:39,000
may all beings be happy

103
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:44,849
[Music]

104
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:51,530
[Music]

105
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:03,160
[Music] thank you

106
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:58,320
so warm greetings on this sunday

107
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:05,119
and i would like to talk a little bit about patients or use that

108
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:12,720
as a as a topic to talk about something which might even be more important

109
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:18,800
and that is that how buddhist practice one of its functions

110
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:24,240
is to develop our capacities to develop to cultivate and develop our

111
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,920
abilities to that native natural abilities we have

112
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,839
so that we have greater capacity for being present for discomfort and

113
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:41,200
challenges and greater capacity

114
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:47,200
to be at peace when things around us are difficult not at peace

115
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:55,680
so patience is part of this task we have a capacity for patients and we can develop it the word for the

116
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,920
pali word for patients is kanti k-h-a-n-t-i

117
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,520
and it's a rich word has many connotations that maybe are greater than the english word patience

118
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:13,680
it sometimes has the association with i i mean i don't know for me an

119
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:19,839
association with an openness a willingness to be present for experience

120
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:26,079
a openness to be present for whatever is happening including what's difficult

121
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:32,320
it also has the connotations of some kind of healthy deep acceptance

122
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:38,640
of what is true even if what is true is difficult or challenging to some of our cherished

123
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:44,320
attachments that we have that that there's a a patience a

124
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:51,440
willingness and acceptance that is willing to work with us and stay present and find our way

125
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:57,839
and that capacity those these capacities of openness willingness

126
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:05,040
patience are as i said capacities that can be developed and

127
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:11,599
i have the impression they're going to have very kind of generalized and speaking very generally

128
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:16,640
that many people don't have enough appreciation for

129
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:21,760
delayed gratification that or that they want results

130
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:27,440
from their meditation from the buddhist practice that

131
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:33,839
they want good results rather than more than developing inner strengths

132
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:40,480
so sometimes people are searching for some having an experience of peace experience of bliss or happiness or

133
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:47,040
something and but there's all kinds of ways we can fall into experiences of peace and

134
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:53,520
happiness that don't necessarily involve developing ourselves cultivating

135
00:38:53,520 --> 00:39:00,079
strengthening capacities that we have and so if we always need to find refuge

136
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:06,079
in places that are peaceful and quiet and still we might be able to relax and feel nice

137
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:11,359
and good in those place safe places but it hasn't helped us

138
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:17,040
to feel at ease or feel a certain kind of inner peace as we go into situations that are

139
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:23,920
challenging and maybe even sometimes threatening and and so to only kind of retreat into some

140
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,280
kind of inner peace is not so helpful in the big picture

141
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:35,839
in the bigger picture especially of the buddhist path what we really want to do is develop our capacity to be present for what's

142
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:41,520
difficult for us present for our suffering and challenges so we can go through them and find our

143
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:48,560
way with them not so we skirt around them or avoid them or or hide from them

144
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:53,599
and it goes along with this principle that

145
00:39:53,599 --> 00:40:00,480
we have greater capacity greater ability

146
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:08,560
to have mastery of our own mind to adjust our minds to change our minds to

147
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,960
to work with our mind then we might have with changing the

148
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:21,599
world or the circumstance around us and if we think that we always have to change the circumstance around us to

149
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:27,359
feel good to feel safe then we're always going to be outwardly directed and constantly needing to

150
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:33,119
change and fix things and it also sets up a can set up a kind

151
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:39,599
of unfortunate tension between us and the world if we have to

152
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,800
change the world so that we're safe then the world has to accommodate us and

153
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,240
we have to assert ourselves or there has to be a push in the pull and of course that's appropriate at

154
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:56,960
times but but if that's all we know how to do then we actually make ourselves less

155
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:03,119
safe because we always need to have the world change for us

156
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:09,760
but buddhist practice is about developing an inner safety inner strength and inner capacity

157
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,800
to be present and so this capacity

158
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:22,160
buddhism is a capacity building practice and now that needs some delayed

159
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:28,160
gratification it takes time to develop ourselves it takes time to develop strengths of all kinds of different

160
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:34,960
forms it takes time to expand the capabilities we have

161
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:41,119
so they become strengths so uh what you know and as we do so our

162
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:46,400
relationship to the world around us shifts and changes so um

163
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,839
so um the um so there's this uh

164
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:58,880
little story or something from my book the monastery within and um

165
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:07,599
the abbess once instructed the younger monks and nuns with the following

166
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:14,560
if a fly lands on the back of an ant it's a big burden for the ant

167
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:19,599
if a fly lands on the back of an elephant it is a very small thing for the

168
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:24,800
elephant you will have many challenges in life

169
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:32,000
it's up to you whether you face them like an ant or an elephant

170
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:38,560
so this ability to develop ourselves so that there is a kind of something as there's a large

171
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:46,560
capacity and that largeness of our capacity to be patient to be present to be mindful

172
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:52,160
to be to let go to be non-reactive to be generous

173
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:57,200
oh we have a lot of capacities to be equanimous as those become

174
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:03,119
stronger then we're not pushed around by the the events in the world and what people say

175
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:08,560
and what people do so much we carry our peace with us and um

176
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:15,760
and we take our choice we you know that we discover we have as we develop our capacities we discover

177
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:22,319
we have more choice to choose mastery of our own mind our own hearts

178
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:28,079
as opposed to giving away the power we have of our own minds to

179
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:35,520
others based on what they say or what they do and and we're just kind of you know put out to wash out to see with

180
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:41,280
the slightest little insult or difficulty that happens around us

181
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:47,520
and so slowly slowly develop capacity and it does involve some letting go

182
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:54,000
um i'll tell two stories the one about letting go that develops capacity in one

183
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:00,240
um no it won't i'll give one then i'll then i'm going to read a little poem kind of

184
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:06,240
the there's a famous kind of zen story that has to do with a scholar

185
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:11,760
someone who's a erudite scholar buddhism spent decades studying buddhist texts knows

186
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:18,240
the ins and outs of buddhist philosophy and um and goes to visit a zen master

187
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:24,079
and um and uh wants to ask questions uh of the

188
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:31,040
zen master or be in a debate or discussion about these erudite kind of ideas and opinions about what buddhism

189
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:37,599
is and so the zen master says oh welcome let's have tea first and so the sun

190
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:44,640
master gets the tea ready and makes the tea and and offers the scholar a cup

191
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:51,440
and then starts pouring tea into the cup and when the water gets to the top of the rim of the cup

192
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:56,880
the denmaster keeps pouring the the water in so it starts spilling over the top

193
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:03,839
and the scholar says stop stop it's already full you could you can it

194
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:10,319
won't take any more tea and the scholar then the zen master then stops pouring tea and says well in the

195
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:17,200
same way you're so full full of yourself full of your ideas that there's no space to take

196
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:23,280
more of teaching more understanding of what i have to teach

197
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:31,359
so sometimes we have to let go of our ideas our thoughts our projections or

198
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:37,760
our stories that get in the way of our ability to be patient that

199
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:43,200
there's very reason maybe we can't be patient because we're caught up in the swirl of these prediction predictive

200
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:48,400
stories of what will happen or what volume

201
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:54,240
and then as we develop these capacities like we become an elephant rather than an ant

202
00:45:54,240 --> 00:46:00,000
is uh i wanted to read this wonderful uh i don't know i don't know if it's a poem

203
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:07,440
it's either by this wonderful zen master that i studied with in japan named shoto harada roshi or it's by his

204
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:12,480
student hogan baze so i apologize i don't know which one it is

205
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:18,960
the form i have here associates it with the teacher roshi

206
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:29,200
in this passing moment karma ripens and all things come to be

207
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:36,480
i vow to choose what is if there is a cost

208
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:45,680
i choose to pay if there is a need i choose to give

209
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:51,839
if there is pain i choose to feel

210
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:57,839
if there is sorrow i choose to grieve

211
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:04,560
when burning i choose heat when calm

212
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:12,640
i choose peace when starving i choose hunger

213
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:17,760
when happy i choose joy

214
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:25,200
whom i encounter i choose to meet

215
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:30,800
when i shoulder i choose to bear

216
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:36,640
when it is my death i choose to

217
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:43,280
die where this takes me i choose to go

218
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:50,400
being with what is i respond to what is

219
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:56,960
so this certainly seems like a this willingness to

220
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:03,280
respond to what is and be present and kind of meet what is in such a full way

221
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:08,480
that's a testament of capacity

222
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:15,760
testament of cult having cultivated one's strengths and abilities and cultivated enough letting go

223
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:21,040
so that our strengths are not inhibited or held in check by

224
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:26,960
our fears our anxieties our angers our desires

225
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:34,160
so to cultivate and develop these capacities so we can face our

226
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:42,160
challenges and so you know it's all teaching that

227
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:47,359
you should spend time with people who don't try to protect you

228
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:55,359
from the challenges of life but spend time with people who appropriately encourage you to face the challenges

229
00:48:55,359 --> 00:49:01,040
to be present for what's difficult in your life because sooner or later

230
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:07,440
things will be difficult sooner or later buddhist practice will bring you into

231
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:13,200
places of letting go and faces places of where where the usual orientation

232
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:19,920
stability place ways in which we hold on to safety are no longer available

233
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:25,839
and some people will retract and pull away and won't take the path all the way

234
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:31,359
but to cultivate our ability to slowly steadily to to

235
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:37,200
develop strengths that hold us present allow us to be their

236
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:42,800
presence so there's strengths and one of the strengths

237
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:48,400
that the meditators develop is the strength of being still

238
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:55,040
not moving in the middle of whatever is happening in meditation

239
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:00,079
sometimes there can be a lot of restlessness there can be fear there can be anger

240
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:05,920
there can be strong desire there can be a lot of agitation and there's something very significant

241
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:11,280
about not giving into it physically and not getting up and pacing and

242
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:17,359
running around or not giving up on the meditation or also not collapsing

243
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:23,359
the idea in meditation is to neither collapse nor retract nor get up and run away but

244
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:29,680
to sit still in the middle of it ideally sitting in some kind of

245
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:36,800
posture that does express a little bit of strength and confidence and over time we're developing

246
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:44,800
a confidence a physical strength a physical malleability to be able to stay present

247
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:52,079
for all kinds of difficult energies that course through us and that's uh but anything that's

248
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:57,359
cultivated is cultivated gradually

249
00:50:57,359 --> 00:51:03,760
by repetition and so people who don't have capacity for delayed gratification who are

250
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:09,440
expecting instant results to have instant enlightenment or instant peace or or to really have a wonderful

251
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:16,240
experience in meditation sometimes shortchange themselves in this gradual slow cultivation development of

252
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:24,000
these strengths of confidence of strength of being able to sit still and not move of letting go of the forces

253
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,119
inside of us to react and to run away or to

254
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:36,800
move or to collapse especially today of collapsing the wonderful thing about meditation

255
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:42,160
and is that it can be a place where we can feel

256
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:48,400
the sorrow the challenges the grief the angers we have the difficulties we have

257
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:54,000
but to do it uprightly with this kind of dignified confident posture

258
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:00,880
and we might feel like it might be feeling like it's overwhelming like just too much and we should collapse

259
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:06,240
but while we're meditating the dedication is never collapse unless

260
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:13,359
it's impossible not to but to really stay there and that develops a capacity to be

261
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:20,640
present it's not rejecting the difficulty or the strong feelings it's actually building the ability more room

262
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:25,920
and space inside to hold them and so over time we're developing this

263
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:32,720
ability to hold more and more difficult things and uh and if you meditate every day

264
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:38,800
the wonderful thing about that is then sooner or later your whole life goes through that

265
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:45,359
days which are good days which are difficult days which are joyous days days which are sorrowful

266
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:53,040
they all get processed they all have their chance to be experienced in this and now in meditation practice

267
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:59,200
and so we're developing in doing so we're developing this greater and greater capacity to be with a range of

268
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:05,920
experiences a range of what's happening for us and in doing so we're developing we're cultivating

269
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:11,280
ourselves we're expanding our capacity and eventually

270
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:18,079
maybe our capacity becomes so big and so huge that most things that come along

271
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:25,040
don't agitate us not because we're aloof from them or distant from them

272
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:31,359
maybe we can feel them even better than we do than we did before because when there's a lot of reactivity

273
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:37,119
and swirls of stories and ideas and judgments

274
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:42,480
that's kind of a veil between us and ourselves the us and our story but as we

275
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:48,000
get quieter and stiller and less reactive and less swept away in the stories and judgments

276
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:54,800
and and commentary of what's happening then we actually more present to be there

277
00:53:54,800 --> 00:54:01,280
and maybe there's greater and greater capacity to hold it and at some point what we come to

278
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:08,559
appreciate is or it kind of identify with is the strengths we have the capacities

279
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:13,680
we have more than what our experience is the experiences that come and go as we

280
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:19,119
go through our life and that gives a a

281
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:26,800
ballast to our life that gives stability to our life because then we're not so easily swayed and pushed around and

282
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:32,800
and uh impacted by the vagaries of life that ups and downs in life and

283
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:39,680
that are huge like i don't want to dismiss or or diminish how huge the challenges we

284
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:44,960
have that we can have but to um

285
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:52,400
but you know we learn to choose we learn to choose an attitude we learn how to give away

286
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,880
our freedom if someone

287
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:03,680
criticizes us or treats us as somehow being

288
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:10,799
inferior we participate if we start feeling

289
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:17,119
inferior because of that then we are participating we are actually choosing it ourselves

290
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:23,599
and to let other people have that kind of influence on us so that we are choosing to go along with it is really

291
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:29,599
sad and this ability to master our mind see our minds what it's

292
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:35,680
doing is one of the great skills of mindfulness meditation or buddhist practice

293
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:42,240
there is a kind of self-mastery we develop so that we can choose how we are we can

294
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:48,640
we can develop an ability to be present more widely and then we have hopefully

295
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:54,960
with our wisdom an ability to respond appropriately

296
00:55:54,960 --> 00:56:00,240
we're not here just to be patient with things and accept things and that's that's the end of the story

297
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:06,799
i hope we're here also to make the world a better place and to stand up and speak up when necessary and

298
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:14,559
and um and to change this world for the better and and to speak up against injustice when

299
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:21,839
we encounter it we don't want to just simply be patient with injustice in the world but we want to have developed patients

300
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:28,720
so that we are not coming from a reactive place a place that where our capacity for

301
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:35,920
difficulty has been diminished but rather we want to come from capacity a place where capacity is expanded

302
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:41,920
so that uh we're have a level of ease or peace or

303
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:48,079
or non or non clinging

304
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:55,280
in how we then respond and act in the world i came across recently a quote by viktor

305
00:56:55,280 --> 00:57:01,599
frankl who was he wrote the book the man's search for meaning and he spent

306
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:06,640
time in the german concentration camps in world war ii and he uh

307
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:11,760
a lot of his philosophy and and that he that he developed and his

308
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:19,359
teachings that he developed i developed because he was inspired by the people in the camp and camps who

309
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:25,119
he said chose not to chose to respond to each thing

310
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:31,280
with a mastery with not giving up not not abandoning their their

311
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:36,880
their um autonomy or their ability to choose how they

312
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:44,960
what they do with their minds their hearts with their speech that somehow they would always choose not to collapse

313
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:50,000
but rather many of them chose to help and support the other prisoners

314
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:55,480
so this ability to develop capacities

315
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:02,319
and i probably have said this enough now but i just want to

316
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:07,599
really as i finish this talk underscore that

317
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:14,880
very important part of buddhist practice is cultivation it's called in pali it's called babana

318
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:20,960
b-h-a-b-a-n-a and it's sometimes the word for practice

319
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:26,079
in english we might say i have a spiritual practice it's um the word bhavana it's also

320
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:31,280
sometimes used for the word for meditation but literally what it means is

321
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:38,880
cultivation or development and so the idea we're cultivating something and developing something

322
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:46,799
and for some people this is an exhausting idea for some people it's a difficult one because

323
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:52,880
if it kind of gets entangled with ideas i'm not good enough and i have to prove myself or

324
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:58,319
i have to now strain and try to get something beyond the present moment

325
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:04,079
then it can be you know it can be quite a burden

326
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:10,799
but but cultivating the ability to be patient cultivating the ability to be open

327
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:16,000
cultivating the ability to be willing to experience what is here

328
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:21,359
this is a one way one thing to cultivate and develop that goes along with

329
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:28,799
not trying to change the world not trying to change ourselves

330
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:36,079
so hopefully don't get so entangled with the cultivation part because what we're cultivating is cultivating capacity to

331
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:44,400
be present for what is and that is i think subways the ultimate

332
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:51,200
capacity we're developing in buddhism and and hopefully it'll support us

333
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:56,720
in times of difficulty in times of joy sometimes the

334
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:03,760
capacity to hold joy is more difficult than the capacity to hold suffering

335
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:11,200
and and eat both forms of holding both forms of being

336
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:17,680
present for without being caught in it leads to wisdom and to freedom

337
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:24,240
so may you cultivate and develop um

338
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:30,960
your native capacities so your capacities grow and support you

339
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:36,400
and may you become like an elephant or

340
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:43,838
maybe you have another animal big strong animal that you prefer to be your

341
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:51,480
your model so thank you very much
