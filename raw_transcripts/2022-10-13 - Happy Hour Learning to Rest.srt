1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:07,560
all right hello and welcome welcome to happy hour

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,620
this this rendition of it so

3
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:20,180
so what I want to um

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,760
invite us to turn our attention to uh for practice today is

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:34,340
um is the need for rest the need for rest

6
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:42,120
as as an expression of meta and yet I want to bring a Twist to this

7
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:48,420
rest it's not just sleeping or vegging out in front of Television to

8
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:56,219
rest which of course sleeping is very important please get a lot of sleep and sometimes

9
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:02,399
vegging is actually the appropriate things to do sometimes it is the appropriate thing to do not always but

10
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,159
sometimes it is the appropriate thing to do so you know I'll talk more about that later

11
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,580
but but the twist I want to bring in um

12
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:21,180
is um the way our minds our hearts can really

13
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,060
rest their sense of deep rest

14
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,119
often happens and can't happen in

15
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:40,320
in easeful nourishing meditation so not to approach meditation as this

16
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:47,180
thing I have to do and I have to accomplish and I have to be but actually

17
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:54,479
seeing the act of meditating as complete rest letting the mind come to rest

18
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:01,979
oh sweetheart dear mine you can rest you can let go you can let go

19
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:07,020
there are many different ways to see and

20
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:12,300
under many different practices with it also even the Buddhist Canon different

21
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,900
ways to practice meditation as as you all know by now there's

22
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,920
paying attention with mindfulness there is meta practice there's compassion

23
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:31,440
there's uh you know there are all the prama we have so there are different ways we can pay attention and this this

24
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:39,480
way of the the um inclining the mind to rest to rest

25
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,519
with with things as they are to let go that

26
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:49,860
just to rest just to rest can be seen

27
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:55,080
as another expression of meta and care

28
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:01,140
it's also a practice of of it's a Liberation practice the

29
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:07,140
liberative practice it's of Letting Go not clinging it's the opposite of clinging when we cling I want this I

30
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:13,260
want it to be a particular way I want these great states of mind I want this pain to go away I want this distraction

31
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:19,560
to go away I want I want I want I want I want or I don't want I don't want I don't know which is actually the same

32
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,260
thing is wanting the want to just the it's the pushing away versus the one that's still

33
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,959
the wanting still the the grasping whereas this this idea of rest

34
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:37,379
depressed um I really really want this pain to go

35
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:43,080
Eric actually what if I just rest with with it oh I really want to have pleasant

36
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:49,799
experiences what if I let go of this wanting and just rest with yeah it's a pretty ordinary experience right now

37
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:56,819
well actually it's pretty awesome this ordinary experience when you stop wanting something else you wake up to

38
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:02,540
how awesome amazing this ordinary experience is

39
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,620
and say with the distracted or sleepy mind

40
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:13,500
again instead of wanting to push away the distractions like oh

41
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,600
letting go this this sense of letting go okay I see you thoughts I see your

42
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:25,380
distractions I see you planning and wanting and it's like what if I just open my hand yeah I know you're gonna

43
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:30,720
come back but it's okay I'm gonna let go not not throw you away but invite my

44
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,020
heart to just rest rest it's a different way of engaging I

45
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:43,560
was talking about engagement on Monday engaging with meta engaging our minds so

46
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:50,100
this is engaging with rest which sounds a little counter-intuitive how do I engage with

47
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:57,360
rest but it teaches our heart it teaches our mind a different way of being this

48
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,880
engaging with letting go and engaging with a sense of rest so

49
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,919
might be a con for some of you right now like what does she mean well let's

50
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:14,340
discover let's explore it together and see what we find out see what we find

51
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:22,440
out so okay shall we shall we let's do it all right okay so

52
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,560
I invite you to get into your meditation posture

53
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:36,199
ah Landing in this body in this moment

54
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:54,360
and In This Moment what if we let go of all the Notions

55
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:01,199
of what we all have collectively about what doing meditation is what if you

56
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:07,740
just let go of it all and for a moment just sit not knowing what to quote

57
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:14,280
unquote what to do next like oh you know what I'm sitting

58
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:19,500
okay now what stay in that moment stay with that

59
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:26,660
now what now what do I do nothing stay with that

60
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,319
and if you find yourself doing let go again

61
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:06,918
and rest take a radical stance to the practice

62
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:17,880
and you can also notice the the way your mind gravitates

63
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:24,720
I noticed that my mind wants to rest with the breath because all of these years of training

64
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,740
ah I just wants to collect itself and just rest in the breath

65
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:38,660
ah it doesn't feel like doing it feels like resting okay I'm gonna let it

66
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:47,099
see if there's any movement in that way in your heart in your mind that feels

67
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:54,060
like resting not doing if something feels like doing then just let it go and come back to that space of

68
00:07:54,060 --> 00:08:01,860
not knowing like okay now what nothing nothing but if it feels the mind is resting with

69
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:09,060
the breath or the body ah because it knows a place of safety

70
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:16,038
ease Refuge then it's okay let it

71
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:35,300
the kitty of the mind is collecting itself in the Sun

72
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:42,599
the body of the breath and resting napping it's okay not

73
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:50,779
literally napping but a sense of rest is of non-doing

74
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:59,420
engaging with letting go of wanting

75
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:24,959
this deep rest another door into the Temple of Metta

76
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,640
care for yourself

77
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:35,720
if you find the mind is wandering notice notice can you let go

78
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:44,579
invite the mind to rest the heart to rest sweetheart rest it's okay you don't have

80
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:02,540

to rest a hundred times it's okay do it gladly

82
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,839

tightness in the body

91
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:25,079
turning away towards the Simplicity of not wanting

92
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:32,160
anything in this moment just

93
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:39,800

and as we bring this period of sitting practiced her clothes

132
00:35:58,339 --> 00:36:05,280
noticing that even if you thought or you felt you were

133
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:11,760
distracted and you didn't quote unquote rest that

134
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:17,520

when you started or nourished more cared for

138
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:49,680
learning reteaching ourselves our minds our hearts how to rest not forcing but

s to rest

145

146
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:03,560
loving this heart loving this mind

147
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:15,720
so we have time for Reflections and I do acknowledge that

148
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:20,940
I'm pretty calm myself so might be

149
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:26,880
um actually maybe some of you want to say something and just ready to jump in

150
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:33,960
but uh I also feel the quiet and the Peace of Letting Go and the

151
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:41,180
and the rest in my heart and mind that feels quite nourishing so

152
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:48,900
so any questions any aha moments any challenges

153
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:54,960
anything you want to check in about an offer

154
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:00,500
with this practice of turning away

155
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:06,780
turning letting go of Engagement engaging with thoughts and

156
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:15,660
memories and doing Neil says super chill in chat yeah super

I love it super chill yeah those two words

159
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:37,920
it's good it's this is there's nourishment of rest

160
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:46,020
in non-doing in meditation as non-doing that that's so nourishing especially if

161
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:52,320
our minds our hearts are so used to doing and doing and doing and doing some

162
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,740
more it's like okay all right let's train ourselves in this way

163
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:04,140
let's see Bill says interesting how many of my thoughts could be classified as

164
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:11,000
either grasping or aversion watching those two arise again and again

165
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:19,380
great oh how wonderful to be able to see the classification this is great it's

166
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:26,400
it's um you know there is the falling into the thoughts falling into the grasping and

167
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:32,940
pushing away and yet when we've graduated to actually

168
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:38,640
um seeing the classification oh yeah that's an aversive thought okay I see oh that's

169
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:44,760
a graspy thought okay grasp one you know team one zero twos

170
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:51,960
though three okay about the same I'm just joking but but when we get to actually see the process instead of fall

171
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:58,859
into the content that is fantastic so it's not a problem that they arise of

172
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:05,640
course they arise thoughts are dime a dozen we don't have to believe them so so Bill I celebrate

173
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:13,320
um that you get to see them and classify them rather than falling into

174
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:22,680
yay thumbs up ah Gene says rest equals less stress yes

175
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:28,260
I appreciate that reflection from um

176
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:35,400
from gene on on YouTube yeah there is there is this freedom of this rest this

177
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:40,980
letting go but uh letting go is not engaging with

178
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:47,660
with friction also Jamie I see your hand please

179
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:55,320
yeah uh Nicki for for a little while it just got so quiet

180
00:41:55,320 --> 00:42:00,359
that I wondered um what the difference between rest and

181
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:05,940
death is I'm just curious if you have anything to say about that

182
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:12,240
huh so so wait so let let me follow the thread you're presenting before jumping

183
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:20,160
to the question um so it got so quiet for you it sounds like in this meditation right yeah

184
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:25,920
so could you say just a little more about that because then the question is interesting but I want to see where the

185
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:31,140
link is between the the peacefulness of rest and where where your mind jumped to

186
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:36,380
the question so unpackage for me a bit Jamie with you

187
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:41,900
um no it's just this this

188
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:47,279
profound deep Stillness and

189
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:53,280
I I wondered [Music] um

190
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:58,820
oh is this what that would be like um

191
00:42:59,339 --> 00:43:06,839
so so before I go there again I want to ask you the Deep profound Stillness how did

192
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:12,119
that feel how was the quality of that for you in this experience

193
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:19,700
it was um exceptional it was so um

194
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:28,260
it was beautiful yeah yeah beautiful

195
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:35,700
lovely thanks for unpacking that great so this exceptional beautiful quality of

196
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:44,339
of deep rest deep Stillness wow how awesome is this it's nourishing it's not

197
00:43:44,339 --> 00:43:49,440
scary at all and so so I invite you to consider

198
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:57,420
that letting go because what what this um sense of ease and Stillness arising

199
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:04,200
from letting go right and letting go Letting Go resting resting Stillness

200
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:09,960
so death is a kind of well it is a letting go it's an ultimate letting go

201
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:17,220
it's letting go of the last breath it's letting go of life it's letting go it's a releasing it's a releasing

202
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:22,859
and and what you just spoke of can be the

203
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:30,960
quality of mind can be the quality of Mind accepting approaching being with death

204
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:37,920
now as to what death itself is like I don't know and nobody has really come

205
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:46,800
back to tell us so let's have a don't know mind about that and yet this Stillness could very well

206
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:54,180
be an experience right before the ultimate letting go maybe maybe

207
00:44:54,180 --> 00:45:01,560
does that make sense what I'm trying to the needle I'm trying to thread absolutely absolutely thank you thank

208
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:10,400
you so much for sharing this beautiful uh lovely inspiring practice report yay

209
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:16,500
I'm very sick today and I just to have this profound experience in the middle

210
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:25,319
of it is just so such a gift thank you um hmm thank you oh deep bows thank you so much

211
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:30,780
uh for practicing uh while sick which is actually quite

212
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:37,560
it's I love practicing while sick it's uh you know things can quite yeah

213
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:43,740
beautiful ah thanks for sharing that with the Sangha Jamie great

214
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:52,440
so dear ones I'm going to I would like to invite us all to rest with each other in small groups

215
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:58,020
today you can and when the your turn comes you can just say pass and you can

216
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:03,300
just be silent with each other if you want to say something you can but

217
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:08,700
you're invited to just hold Silence with each other if you want it's quite a

218
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:16,800
habit to develop and see if you can keep in your eyes open while you stay silent

219
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:22,980
and again maybe after a minute or two or three of Silence maybe somebody gets moved feels moved to share something

220
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:30,540
about this rest being in the space of rest with the others not rushing to fill

221
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:35,700
the silence and feel that tendency maybe this discomfort

222
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:41,040
of wanting to rush to fill it and maybe at some point it feels

223
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:47,040
appropriate to say something or maybe not maybe you'll just spend a few minutes in silence and metal with each

224
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:53,400
other it's an experiment right so I might make it tonight a little shorter so you'll come you can come back and

225
00:46:53,400 --> 00:47:01,440
actually tell me how it was so let's see I'm going to

226
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:08,460
create the rooms uh for this experiment in being

227
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:13,560
being with being with one another um

228
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:19,680
okay creating your rooms here take care of yourselves take care of each other

229
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:28,319
here you go okay the rooms are closed we are all

230
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:33,599
backed together so we have a better minute for any

231
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:39,119
Reflections it might have felt different well how was it to be together in this

232
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:44,240
super chilled way in the space anybody wants to say anything

233
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:49,760
awkward interesting I learned something new about myself

234
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:58,440
Aurora please I'll say something

235
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:07,079
um it gave me pause to land in my body

236
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:13,380
and it made me realize that sometimes when I talk like I follow the words out

237
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:20,339
and I'm not here that makes sense absolutely

238
00:48:20,339 --> 00:48:25,940
I was like oh oh I'm still here

239
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:31,519
and and that was nice

240
00:48:32,819 --> 00:48:40,319
so what a powerful realization thanks for sharing that or I love it I love it wow that's a great insight to come from

241
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:48,000
this different setting thanks thanks for that any any other realizations any quick ones from

242
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,599
this different setup

243
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:56,220
foreign

244
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:06,780
last minute ahas okay

245
00:49:07,579 --> 00:49:14,760
okay so I we leave on that note of realizing acknowledging oh yeah Landing

246
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:22,200
in the body when we speak I think many of us if not all of us can can

247
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:27,720
appreciate that they're following the words out so so thank you all for

248
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:36,359
practicing together for bringing yourself showing up to cultivate for the sake of

249
00:49:36,359 --> 00:49:41,400
yourself and all beings everywhere may all beings be well may all beings be

250
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:50,780
free thanks everyone take care
