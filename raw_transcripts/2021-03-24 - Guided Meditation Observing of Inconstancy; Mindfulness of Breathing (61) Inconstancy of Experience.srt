1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,200
warm hellos from redwood city

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:17,440
and uh i appreciate all the good mornings and the warmth that it comes

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,880
kind of radiating out of the chat here so thank you for those who are making

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,800
the greetings and and thanks to all those of you who have those kinds of

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,120
greetings in your heart so we're continuing with mindfulness of

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,920
breathing and one of the functions one of the wonderful functions or

7
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,879
potentials of mindfulness of breathing is a combination of doing both mindfulness and

8
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:55,760
concentration practice that we are both developing a steadiness of mind to stay on the breath

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,359
to really rest in the breathing or stay kind of immersed in the world of

10
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:07,680
breathing without being pulled into extraneous thoughts and ideas and

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,720
feelings and it can be a real delight to simplify the mind even our life in a

12
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,840
certain way and be absorbed in one thing in this case the breathing

13
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,400
and it's not necessarily the breathing is so wonderful and as it is the absorption the really

14
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:33,200
kind of intimacy with it that intimacy and connection continuity opens up a whole different inner world of

15
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,560
possibility and one of those possibilities is to observe

16
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:46,000
carefully the experience of breathing which is really where the passana practice practice of insight

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,159
begins opening up and to distinguish to highlight what observing means

18
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,240
we can distinguish between

19
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:08,479
looking seeing and observing looking is an active function

20
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:16,319
we if we look at if we say look look look at look for look for the needle and the haystack

21
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,520
then there's a kind of steering that might go on you might kind of really

22
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:28,480
actively engage the eyes to see and try to find the thing that we've been asked to look for and so it's an

23
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,640
it might be very active engaged and and even the head might go forward

24
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,640
and the eyes may be you know more fixated as it kind of really searches the terrain

25
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:47,760
uh to see uh in the more passive sense of the word or

26
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,160
there's less active senses of the word it's just the i see there doesn't have to be an intention to

27
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:00,400
see determination to see any effort to find anything or look anything particular

28
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:07,680
there's a seeing happens and we might not even choose what we see it's just new things come in and and you

29
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,040
just see that for now and uh and it's more receptive quality

30
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,319
than the active quality of looking and observing has a little bit

31
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:26,879
of both qualities observing uh has uh the the receptive quality of just

32
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:33,120
seeing not interfering not trying so hard not staring at anything fixating on

33
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:41,599
something but it is also a little bit intentional gentle loving determination

34
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:48,720
intentionality to be intimate with the experience to really get closer and really

35
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:55,840
feel and sense and experience it in a more precise way and a little bit like you're still

36
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:03,680
seeing within that kind of receptive mode but you've placed a magnifying glass or you're

37
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:10,799
still seeing but you've gotten really close so i've had a history of being

38
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:18,720
nearsighted and that's a little bit changing now with cataract surgery in one eye but uh still

39
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:26,160
my right eye is nearsighted and if i keep my eye my hand you know three feet away from my

40
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,639
myself i see that i have a hand but i don't see many details at all it's a little bit fuzzy but as i bring

41
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,880
it closer i can see really all the lines and the fingerprints and i can see the details

42
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:45,280
of my hand very nicely and and so i can still just seeing

43
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:51,440
but there's a things get highlighted and clear and clear so it's a little bit like that

44
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,639
the observing that we're building or finding discovering

45
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:03,919
that comes with being settled and immersed in the world of breathing is to now begin seeing this the

46
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:10,400
subtlety or the details the fingerprints almost of each little in-breath and out

47
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,000
breath each little experience of breathing and so the observing has a little bit more of

48
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,960
a little bit more maybe kind of intimacy than just seeing might have but not the

49
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,759
active kind of looking forward and reaching for out that that looking would have so to

50
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:39,680
observe so that's kind of the so to take a comfortable meditation posture

51
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,440
and gently close your eyes

52
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:56,479
and relax let go soften your body

53
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:07,840
tune into your body see your body feel your body

54
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:16,880
and then within this body take a few long slow deep breaths

55
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:24,479
the purpose of which is to remind yourself now you're going to be

56
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:31,520
with your breathing that you're offering to accompany your

57
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,680
breathing and your breathing and ascent is going to accompany you

58
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,720
hand in hand you will go

59
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:49,840
and here you are you're saying hello to your breathing with these big breaths

60
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,440
and then letting your breathing return to normal

61
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,720
and as a way of settling into your breathing more

62
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,080
you might relax your shoulders and as you relax your shoulders

63
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,840
almost as if you're relaxing into the body breathing

64
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:26,319
easing up some of the muscles and that are surrounding

65
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:33,520
the bodies engagement and breathing

66
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:43,039
and the same thing with a belly to relax the belly as you breathe

67
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:49,120
so that there's a greater connection to breathing and freedom to breathing

68
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,840
and maybe there's also a softening in the chest the solar plexus area

69
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:10,840
and as you relax the chest it's almost like you're able to settle in more to the experience of the body

70
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,840
breathing

71
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:21,680
if you experience the breathing mostly in the nostrils maybe there's a way of softening

72
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,840
relaxing your face so that you settle more into

73
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,758
the place where you feel the breathing

74
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:46,640
there as you exhale

75
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,839
to relax your thinking

76
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,959
calm your thinking a little bit

77
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:09,839
reassuring the mind that things are okay at this moment just for now here

78
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:22,320
as you exhale letting go of your thoughts

79
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:37,839
as you let go of your thoughts let go into your breathing

80
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:10,160
and in the beginning of this sitting keep returning to your breathing as

81
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,800
often as necessary but do so gently lovingly

82
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,480
do so in which in a way that the returning the beginning again

83
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:29,600
is pleasant the returning the beginning again itself

84
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,720
is done in a way that's calming relaxing

85
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,279
maybe a mental tai chi

86
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:47,839
where you flow awareness back into your breathing

87
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:06,399
and then stay intimate with the inhales with the exhales

88
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:14,720
as if there's a wonderful tai chi dance between breathing and your

89
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:21,040
awareness why the breathe awareness mirrors the

90
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,200
breathing follows the breathing

91
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:43,839
rides the breathing

92
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:57,040
and relaxing the mind's ability to be aware

93
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:06,000
so that the awareness of breathing is more receptive

94
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,440
then active but receptivity that

95
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:24,399
is committed to the intimacy between awareness and

96
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,839
breathing

97
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,839
hmm

98
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,240
and then with a little bit more intimacy

99
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:35,519
awareness getting really close to the inhales and the exhales

100
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:43,360
begin to experience the details of sensations that come into play

101
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:51,040
as you breathe in that come into play as you breathe out

102
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:58,160
breathing in breathing out intimately

103
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,760
letting things letting the sensations that are connected to breathing

104
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:09,920
begin to stand out and highlight

105
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:17,199
in the clarity of awareness that's

106
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,000
not swept away in thinking and thoughts

107
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:31,839
but becomes more like a soft relaxed magnifying glass that just

108
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:39,120
feels and senses intimately

109
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,800
the beginning the middle the end of the inhale

110
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:51,040
the beginning the middle and the end of the exhale

111
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,839
observing

112
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,559
observing the particular detail of your breathing

113
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:11,520
particular detail of all the sensations that come into play as you breathe

114
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,480
and that is those sensations are changing

115
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,799
no need to look at the details in any a different way

116
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:32,320
but begin observing in a relaxed receptive way

117
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:38,320
how every sensation that comes into play as you breathe

118
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:46,960
changes by fading away or turning into something

119
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,840
else

120
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:12,720
maybe the way that waves washing up on a shore are constantly changing

121
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:25,840
as they wash up and roll back on the sand

122
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:53,840
immerse yourself in that changing landscape of breathing

123
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:16,799
observing in a relaxed but careful way

124
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:22,159
not only noticing how the sensations change

125
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:31,840
notice that some appear and disappear

126
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:39,919
an ongoing sequence of sensations that appear and disappear

127
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:45,440
throughout the inhale throughout the exhale

128
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,880
no need to think about it or be involved with them

129
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:59,840
but allow those sensations to be known as coming and going

130
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:31,679
as we observe the breathing allowing the sensations to come and go

131
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:37,840
on their own there is a giving of freedom

132
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:44,320
to those sensations there's allowing each of them to be its

133
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:51,600
own self as they arises as it passes

134
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:03,840
in this way in which observing grants freedom

135
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:15,360
from our involvement our entanglement our fixing and wanting it's a wonderful lesson

136
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,039
for how to be with others

137
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:25,679
to allow others to be as they are

138
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:34,080
to have the ability to be present and maybe even a certain intimacy or

139
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,720
closeness or attentiveness

140
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:46,799
we allow others to be who they are where others become free

141
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:54,240
of our desires our needs our expectations our fixing our wanting

142
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:00,320
our bias and interpretations

143
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:17,440
and to allow to let the deep capacity to observe this way

144
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:24,000
be registered deeply in the mind and the heart

145
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:32,799
and to stay close to it so we begin to find wise ways

146
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:41,840
of offering this freedom to others the freedom from what our minds does

147
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:52,320
and may it be that this meditation practice that we do

148
00:29:52,840 --> 00:30:01,200
offers a lot of freedom for others to be as they are

149
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:09,840
they might not recognize that you're granting them freedom because it's really a freedom that

150
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:15,919
within which how they are seen and received in ourselves

151
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:27,440
and it's a freedom that then also makes more room for the heart's tenderness

152
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:36,240
kindness love for others to shine forth

153
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,360
in a way this freedom that the mind grants to others

154
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:48,320
allows for space for more love care

155
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:54,480
and may it be that what we learn here

156
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:07,278
can be expressed in the words may others be happy

157
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,480
may others be safe

158
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:22,320
may others be peaceful

159
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:33,279
may others be free

160
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:39,039
and may others be included in my circle of care

161
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:52,399
a care that is characterized by freedom

162
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:59,679
the giving of freedom to others so they can be

163
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:07,679
be themselves in some deep way may all beings everywhere

164
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:15,840
be free and safe

165
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,840
uh

166
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:25,760
so as i've said already that with the 13

167
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:31,679
step of mindfulness of breathing we enter into the territory of insight

168
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,880
of bipasuna and

169
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:43,600
before this meditation practice can be characterized by practicing

170
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:50,720
mindfulness after all this is called mindfulness of breathing in and breathing out

171
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:57,600
and mindfulness and vipassana are two different things classically in the early tradition in

172
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:05,760
the modern english kind of scene people will use the word vipassana and mindfulness sometimes synonymously

173
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:13,839
and sometimes the word vipassana refers to the vipassana tradition or vipassana meditation and it's used

174
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:18,960
kind of as a you know to a general term

175
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:26,320
but in the teachings of the buddha the word vipassana doesn't refer to any kind of practice

176
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:33,358
but rather the results of practice so it's the result of doing mindfulness the result of doing

177
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:39,358
concentration the result of doing mindfulness and concentration practice together which is one of the benefits of

178
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:44,720
mindfulness of breathing that they they stay with the breath all the time

179
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:50,398
there is a concentration factor that builds as but we're also practicing mindfulness of

180
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:57,200
staying aware of what's going on where the the mindfulness is present when those become both become

181
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:04,400
sufficiently strong the mindfulness and concentration then we start having insights we start

182
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:10,640
seeing observing in ways that we don't usually observe in everyday life you start

183
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:17,040
observing in deeper and deeper way or with greater clarity into the moment-to-moment experience and

184
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:24,640
that's when insights begin and the insights of the insight meditation practice

185
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:31,119
are not i i like to think of them insights with capital i there's lots of insights with a small

186
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:36,960
eye all can be very significant but the difference in my vocabulary and why i'm

187
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:43,760
using them now is the small eye insights are the ones that are a big aha

188
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:49,680
moments where we see something about ourselves that unique to ourselves

189
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:55,359
so for example we understand something about the conditions that led us to become who we are today or we

190
00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:02,480
see clearly our particular beliefs that were operating under maybe they were deluded or not really true so ah and

191
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:08,079
then we put that down or we see something about ourselves that we never saw before and

192
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:15,440
and say wow that explains why i behave this way because oh there's that anxiety or fear or

193
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:22,640
something memory that i have that keeps kind of filtering my experience so there's all kinds of very important

194
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:27,760
personal insights that help us become freer and freer

195
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:33,760
but the insight with a capital i the insight of that inside meditation is really

196
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:41,920
focusing focusing on are seeing things which are universal uni uh that are common

197
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:48,960
denominators of all experiences and so it's it's true whether it's a

198
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:55,440
personal experience it's only unique to oneself and it's true for uh you know

199
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:03,359
for everybody and so sometimes they're called universal characteristics of all experience and um

200
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:10,640
and and uh and in the buddha called these perceptions so they're they're qualities

201
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:17,119
or aspects of how we perceive all things that we we take in or character characterize

202
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:23,280
the perceptions that of all things so there's something universal so they're transpersonal maybe

203
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:31,040
or or um you know they're more encompassing than anything we see personally whereas the personal insights

204
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:37,359
are important going deeper down into the common denominator of all experiences

205
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:43,280
the common characteristics of all experiences it puts us down at the deeper foundation

206
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:48,560
from which we build the cathedrals of

207
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:55,359
the citadels of our conceptual world the the world of self and self in the world

208
00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:00,720
of others and we we kind of build this world and philosophy and beliefs and feelings and

209
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:06,320
all that based on uh things that are have this foundation

210
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:13,760
of these common characteristics common per ways of perceiving and

211
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:20,240
and the primary one that is the buddha emphasizes is a

212
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:25,440
quality of all experiences

213
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:31,599
is something called anicha in pali it's a-n-i-c-c-a

214
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:39,200
it's commonly translated into english as impermanence and and

215
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:45,200
probably not the best translation and i'll get to that in a few moments but i want to emphasize that what we're

216
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:50,400
focusing on here is what can be called experience

217
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:56,160
in philosophical terms buddhism is epistemological or vipassana this

218
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:02,480
practice we're doing is epistemological i think what that means is that it's a nature of how we ex

219
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:10,160
how we know something or the nature of the experience we have itself and so as opposed to ontological which

220
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:17,599
is uh having some understanding or belief or interpretation about the nature of reality so

221
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:23,920
many people want to assume or believe that insight practice brings us a deep

222
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,520
insight into the nature of reality it can be very reassuring to feel like

223
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:35,280
we have that kind of deep powerful understanding the buddha seemed very

224
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:43,040
reluctant to make any ontological statements about the nature of reality he was not an early physicist who

225
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:49,599
understood the physics you know in my nuclear physics of what was really going on he was a scientist he was a scientist he

226
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:54,720
was a scientist of perception of how the nature of perception nature

227
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,920
of how we experience things which is uh an interface of what

228
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:07,440
it's a meeting place of what's happening in the world out there and and our perceptions how

229
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:13,440
the mind takes it in and so it's a nature of experience now this can be a little bit

230
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:19,200
feel complicated a little bit discouraging because we want to have certainty about the world out there

231
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:25,119
but everything we know about the world happens through the filter through the the

232
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:30,880
avenue of our experience how we experience something

233
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:36,720
it's kind of like if there's an hourglass the one wide end end of the wire when you're

234
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:42,640
broad cup of the hourglass is the expanded world outside of us

235
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:49,040
and the other end of it uh expanded kind of cone of the hourglass is the

236
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:55,920
huge inner world that we have but the the the neck of the hourglass

237
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:01,680
is what we see through our eyes what we hear through our ears smell

238
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:09,680
through our nose taste through our tongue feel through our body and then what is known uh

239
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:15,760
about what's happening in the mind the knowing the experience of knowing or recognizing what's happening in the

240
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:21,520
mind one way or the other everything that we know has gone through

241
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:28,560
those six kind of hourglasses of perception and then with that the inner world can

242
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:36,000
make it complicated and we can invent new ideas and stories and connections and all kinds of things so

243
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:44,560
but we don't we don't remember or don't recognize that it all had its genesis in that realm of

244
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:50,319
hearing seeing so for example language and concepts and words for things had to we had to have

245
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:55,920
some you know that had to come through hearing someone speak those words or

246
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:02,240
reading those words and so the buddha made tremendous emphasis on

247
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:07,200
this kind of in a sense this narrow

248
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:13,520
neck of the hourglass where everything is coming in and rather than seeing it as an

249
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:18,880
hourglass we see it as the foundation upon which everything is built inside

250
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:24,720
and sometimes outside as well and and so what is it that

251
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:33,760
is the common characteristic of experience and it's anitcha that all experiences

252
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:40,560
are coming and going they're changing they're they appear and they disappear

253
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:47,280
the details the fingerprints of experience appear and disappear moment by moment

254
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:54,160
and sometimes it's because what's out there is passing by really quickly and

255
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:59,200
or not so quickly but clearly passes by we have here i think some of you can hear that

256
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:05,839
sometimes the train whistles going by they come and they go they come and they go and uh

257
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:12,640
and so it's pretty easy to notice that those come and go but um but also the way as i said

258
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:18,160
yesterday the way that we pay bring attention to something

259
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:24,560
we very rarely fixate the attention in some solid hard way because if we do that it tends to be

260
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:30,079
strainful it's stress stressful but that's very gently the the

261
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:36,400
mind the awareness is kind of moving around and taking in different details and it's fascinating to do this with

262
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:42,079
physical pain where pain can you know can feel from a distance like it's just solid and

263
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,599
we're really kind of connected

264
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:54,560
we're connected to it and uh and then we will um

265
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,200
the um

266
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:05,440
but if we really pay careful attention this observing way we see the experience of pain is a

267
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:11,599
kaleidoscope of all kinds of sensations going on arising and passing and this arising and

268
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:17,280
passing is repetitive so some things come and they go and they return they come and

269
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:24,480
they go and and so that can give lend a sense of continuity and even a

270
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:29,839
sense of permanence like they're not stopping they're continuously there

271
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:36,240
but as we drop deeper and deeper into this deep subtleness of meditation and able to observe

272
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:43,119
intimately and closely everything without without the mind making the leap making

273
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:50,160
the constructing the idea of continuity then we just see the arising and passing

274
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:56,400
a phenomena and the repetitive nature of it the inconstant nature of it

275
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:02,720
and um and so the word anicha a n i c

276
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:09,520
c a comes from the the root nicha which means it can mean something

277
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:16,880
like constant continuous and also sometimes may be permanent and the a

278
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:23,520
is a negative prefix so not constant not continuous not permanent

279
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:31,119
when we translate this as impermanent as done often in english it suggests that very many people hear

280
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:37,040
that is meaning it's not going to last it's going to come to an end and it's kind of you know to be

281
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:42,400
constantly reminded everything's going to come to an end it maybe can be even depressing or and

282
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:47,440
also it kind of misses the boat because we have to then we just expect

283
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,480
and wait some things take a while to end and while it can be wise to be

284
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:57,760
understanding and recognize that things will end there's a lot of wisdom to that

285
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:04,880
it's not the full story or it's not really what the buddha is pointing to as an insight the core insight of

286
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:10,319
insight meditation is to see the inconstancy of experience

287
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:16,319
moment by moment how it arises and disappears or rises and disappears

288
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:22,560
so anisha as as one of the core insights is probably better translated

289
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:29,040
as inconstancy to the inconstant arising of passing a phenomenon

290
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:35,920
that there might be continuous a continuous constant inconsistency constant continuous things

291
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:41,680
being inconstant like a river is constant is continually flowing but it's

292
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:51,040
also never the same there's being inconstant about it as well and so that's enough for now

293
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:56,480
so um so we're entering into this deep world of insight

294
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:02,960
now and and hopefully you'll begin appreciating the observation of

295
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:10,319
inconstancy thank you
