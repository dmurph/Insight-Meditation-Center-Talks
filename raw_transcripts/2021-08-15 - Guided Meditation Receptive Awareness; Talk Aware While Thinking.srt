1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:07,520
welcome everyone we'll go ahead and start with the sitting and today

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:14,719
i'd like to offer a little bit of a guided meditation in

3
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,439
what i sometimes call receptive awareness

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,640
this is a style of practice where

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,760
rather than choosing what we attend to such as

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:38,879
picking an object like the breath or the body or hearing and allowing the attention to rest there

7
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,399
instead we kind of settle back and receive

8
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:51,120
what is already happening so mindfulness as a

9
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,960
factor of function in our minds

10
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:04,960
works both in conjunction with

11
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,400
a directed attention so we can choose to direct our attention

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:19,759
and attend to something in particular like the breath or we can essentially settle back and allow

13
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:27,479
the processes of body and mind to choose what

14
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:34,960
to attend to it's kind of in a way like

15
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,960
i sometimes give the analogy with receptive awareness that it's kind of

16
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,960
like the breath in a way that we can consciously choose to breathe we can

17
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:53,360
breathe in say okay i'm going to breathe in and we can breathe in so we can we can control the breathing in that way we

18
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,399
can aim the attention and choose when to breathe in and when to breathe out

19
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:04,719
but we can also let go of that we don't have to consciously remember to breathe it will

20
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,759
happen and the the um mindfulness

21
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:15,360
can function like that we do not have to in mindfulness does not require us to

22
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,160
be choosing something in order to be mindful this is something that i i had to learn

23
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,319
i thought that if i wasn't choosing what to be mindful of i was not being mindful

24
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,519
and so there's a little bit of a learning process in terms of

25
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:42,080
recognizing when we are mindful when we're not choosing the object of experience

26
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,920
and so the guided meditation i'll offer will will actually start with a little bit of

27
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,680
directed attention and explore what it means to receive that experience instead of

28
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,360
kind of trying to look at anything about it and then we'll broaden out

29
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:08,239
to the place where we are simply kind of settled back letting go of choosing any particular object of experience

30
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,840
and receiving just receiving

31
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,080
form of meditation practice and i think all forms of meditation practice are supported by

32
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,640
relaxation so we'll start there actually with a little bit of

33
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,239
guiding the attention through the body and exploring a relaxation of body and

34
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,280
then we'll move into exploring the receptive awareness

35
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,840
practice and so we'll begin with some relaxation

36
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,480
checking into your body and seeing if there are places

37
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,640
in the body that are holding tension and seeing if there can be a relaxation

38
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:11,599
of the body it can be helpful to do this in a kind

39
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,720
of a systematic way

40
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:25,360
perhaps starting with the head and face seeing if

41
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,360
the head and face can relax

42
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,840
relaxing across the brow around the eyes

43
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,000
the crown of the head the back of the head the jaw

44
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,199
the neck and shoulders

45
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:18,440
seeing if perhaps the arms and hands can soften relax

46
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:37,160
relaxing the chest and upper back all those muscles around the rib cage

47
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:46,720
sometimes as i notice this area and relax those muscles very naturally a deeper breath happens

48
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:55,199
and that deeper breath can sometimes support even more relaxation of those muscles

49
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,360
relaxing the stomach across the muscles across the

50
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,840
stomach in the abdomen the middle and lower back

51
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,840
relaxing the hips the legs

52
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,840
feet

53
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:56,319
and then sometimes it's also possible it's not always available but

54
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:03,280
sometimes it's possible to explore a relaxation more deeply in the

55
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,560
core of the body so as i name some areas more deeply

56
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,240
inside the body just see just touching into those areas and

57
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,479
seeing if there's an invitation if the body is willing to accept the

58
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,759
invitation to soften so maybe

59
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,759
maybe the inside of the throat can relax

60
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,520
maybe the heart can relax

61
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,319
maybe the stomach and the intestines can relax

62
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:15,520
one of the benefits of the body relaxing is that it supports it

63
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,919
creates conditions that support the mind to be able to relax

64
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:28,479
so maybe two the mind can relax a little bit

65
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:37,200
letting go of mental tension that might pull you into thoughts of past or future

66
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,399
sometimes gill uses a lovely analogy about relaxing the mind

67
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:52,920
he says as if the brain were a muscle maybe the brain can relax

68
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:10,720
from this place of whatever relaxation is available in this moment

69
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,639
allowing exploring the possibility

70
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,720
of receiving the breath letting the breath come to you

71
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:31,279
no need to see anything in detail or notice anything in particular about the breath

72
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,160
this breathing is happening

73
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,080
awareness can receive that

74
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,160
a very light simple way kind of settling back with the sense of not looking at or

75
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:03,279
trying to find anything but just willing to receive the breath however it is offered

76
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,839
in this moment

77
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,880
one of the basic instructions for mindfulness of breathing breathing in

78
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:59,120
know that you're breathing in aware of breathing in

79
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,240
breathing out know that you're breathing out simple

80
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:11,480
simple instruction aware while breathing

81
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:49,040
as we explore receiving the breath

82
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:57,160
there also may be other experiences that are

83
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:04,079
revealed by awareness at the same time

84
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,639
while breathing perhaps there's also awareness of a broader sense of the body

85
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:26,720
a relaxed body and mind support this kind of attention

86
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:41,839
perhaps too while aware

87
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:47,680
of receiving the breath and maybe also some sense of the broader

88
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:55,360
experience of the body aware that hearing is happening

89
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:01,279
you've been possibly taking in the sound of my voice this

90
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:07,839
whole time without effort receiving

91
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,880
our system knows how to do this

92
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:26,480
we can perhaps settle back and allow

93
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,200
awareness to receive naturally

94
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,320
the breath the body and hearing

95
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,199
if you're still connecting with the breath that's fine

96
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:05,760
this kind of receptive awareness might allow

97
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:12,000
that connection with the breath but then also aware that other things are happening at the

98
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,839
same time hearing and the breath

99
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,680
body sensations and the breath

100
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:38,160
perhaps even recognizing emotions or moods

101
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,560
and the breath

102
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:59,560
even thoughts can waft through

103
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,959
and the breath

104
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,839
allowing awareness to receive

105
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,199
the human experience

106
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,279
the experiences of body and mind that are already happening

107
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:48,360
right where you are

108
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:21,040
you could explore if you haven't already

109
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:28,480
letting go of any kind of attention or holding to kind of that

110
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:34,320
thread that connects to the breath and just explore

111
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:40,959
receiving whatever is most obvious in this moment

112
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:50,880
that might be body sensation a particular sensation in the foot or hip or

113
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:57,279
face it might be a broader sense of body a vibratory energy through

114
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:03,959
the body it might be hearing

115
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:10,160
the breath or an emotion

116
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,439
a mood a feeling

117
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,720
with receptive awareness we

118
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:34,400
may find that the attention shifts from one experience to another

119
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:41,520
sometimes slowly sometimes as a flow for a little while hanging out with the

120
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:47,080
breath and body and then attending to hearing

121
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,440
and back to the body sometimes you can feel like a flow of

122
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,720
sensations and thoughts and feelings

123
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:09,919
and other times it can happen more quickly this shifting can feel almost jumpy

124
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:20,799
like the attention is rapidly shifting between experience and that's okay

125
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:29,639
if that happens sometimes it's settling back and just recognizing

126
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:37,679
lots of changing things are happening we don't have to track

127
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:43,840
we don't have to track all the different things

128
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:55,679
just exploring being aware and receiving

129
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,679
experience

130
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:31,360
and of course the mind will wander it will get lost it'll pick up on one of those

131
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,640
things that the attention is drawn to it'll start thinking about it

132
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,080
an image or a thought will arise in the mind and it will catch the attention

133
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:49,919
and we'll get lost and at some point

134
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,840
there will be a remembering you'll remember

135
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:01,200
possibly supported by sitting in silence with your eyes closed hearing these

136
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,720
words you'll remember

137
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:12,480
about being present again

138
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:20,159
in that moment in the receptive awareness practice there's nothing in particular to come

139
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:26,480
back to with receptive awareness when awareness arises

140
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,520
when mindfulness returns we open to what

141
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,960
that experience is first of all what is it like for

142
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:43,600
mindfulness to come back noticing that moment

143
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,840
it's a great moment

144
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:59,520
awareness arises effortlessly in that moment you didn't have to do it

145
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:06,640
that's a lovely reminder of what it's like to be aware without

146
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,840
trying to be aware just awareness appearing

147
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:17,280
and what is happening in that moment

148
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:23,120
what is awareness receiving in that moment

149
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:29,840
often in that moment from a return from wandering of the return from the mind

150
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:36,240
being lost in thought often what's happening in that moment

151
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,840
has been shaped by the thoughts that were happening

152
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:48,320
and so that's useful to be attentive to in that moment what what has been the

153
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:54,640
impact what has been the effect of thinking

154
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:02,080
on your human system sometimes if the mind has been wandering

155
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:08,159
into charged thoughts thoughts about things you have to do or

156
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:15,120
things that happened that had some challenge to them

157
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:21,760
what will be shaped what will have been shaped is a little bit of a response to those thoughts

158
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:27,200
perhaps some of those emotions or feelings related to

159
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,720
those things you need to do or the things that happen that were charged

160
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,000
so that is useful to recognize

161
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,559
just being with receiving the body

162
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:53,320
receiving the moods the emotions in that moment

163
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:00,320
and perhaps if it's supportive remembering that relaxation supports our

164
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,880
capacity to be mindful to be aware

165
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:17,280
sometimes after the mind has wandered off into thought sometimes the mind kind of more drifts

166
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,320
out of the present moment

167
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:28,320
it just kind of picks up on some thought and it's drifting or floating

168
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:34,880
and then when we remember we may not even really have a clear sense of what the thoughts were there

169
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,919
were more dreamlike or random kind of thoughts

170
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,960
but what's the effect what is the impact sometimes i've found when the mind has

171
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,080
drifted out of the present moment if i'm not judging the mind for having

172
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,679
gotten lost that moment when mindfulness returns

173
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:03,840
from that drifting sometimes there's more ease more relaxation more spaciousness

174
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,640
in the mind

175
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,278
more ease more peace

176
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:22,400
that's useful to notice if that's what has happened

177
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:29,120
after the mind has wandered that ease that peace

178
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:34,960
can also be known its effect on the body the mind

179
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:44,000
and often there can be a sense of some pleasantness there that supports

180
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,840
our willingness to be present

181
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:04,880
and if it has been supporting you after the mind wanders and you have

182
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:11,679
explored this effect of the wandering on your experience

183
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:18,158
if it's has been supporting you in terms of the receiving to

184
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:24,480
receive the breath again receive the body

185
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,000
in a soft gentle way that doesn't exclude other experience but has that

186
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,240
perspective of and

187
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,880
hearing and the breath body and the breath

188
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,200
moods emotions and the breath

189
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,760
exploring receiving

190
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,000
the human experience

191
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:14,240
with a perspective or an attitude of allowing

192
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:24,278
allowing how you are to be just as you are

193
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:33,200
and sometimes if there's a perspective or if there's a resistance to what's happening or

194
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:40,000
wanting to hold on to something that's happening that too is just another thing

195
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,400
happening and maybe that can be allowed

196
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,880
there's this experience and there's resistance oh that's what's happening can that be

197
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,440
received allowing

198
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,960
the non-allowing

199
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,039
being with

200
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,399
your experience

201
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,600
moment after moment

202
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,320
so

203
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:29,059

wherever you are

218
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:14,760
so today i thought to reflect on

219
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:23,839
being aware while thinking

220
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,880
we often in meditation practice have a

221
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,440
kind of a conflict or a sense of

222
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:43,520
struggle around thinking that if we're practicing a concentration practice for instance where we're

223
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:50,079
attuning to a particular object of experience and trying to stay

224
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:57,200
with that experience then thoughts

225
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:02,960
what we how we relate to thoughts in that case is we notice that we're thinking we set aside

226
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:11,200
the thought we come back to the object or we might if the thinking is strong

227
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:17,599
explore what's the impact of the thinking we might look at a little bit of the the effect of

228
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:23,040
thinking on the body or the uh um the

229
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:30,320
effect of thinking on our emotions we rarely in meditation we we rarely get many

230
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:36,480
instructions about what it means to be aware while thinking

231
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:43,359
we often in meditation are instructed let go of the content of the thought you know let go of the of what's happening

232
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:48,480
in the thought and turn to let turn to the experience that's that's

233
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:54,320
happening and so i just wanted to explore a little bit around this terrain

234
00:36:54,320 --> 00:37:02,640
of being aware while thinking because it is a big part of our lives

235
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:09,200
we use thoughts to navigate

236
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:15,280
our world and if we haven't

237
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:21,200
explored or practiced or even had the sense of the possibility

238
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:27,920
that we can be mindful aware while thinking there's like huge parts of our day that

239
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:33,920
are off limits for mindfulness practice if we think that while i'm thinking or

240
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:40,720
engaged in something even something quite um active like you know writing an email or

241
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:48,960
something like that then there's a lot going on in our day

242
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:56,480
that we won't be able to explore connect with with mindfulness

243
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:09,119
so in the guided meditation i offered an exploration of receptive awareness

244
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:15,280
and this this kind of awareness is is i find very

245
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,720
um supportive particularly in daily life practice it is my main practice whether

246
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:27,280
i'm in sitting meditation or in daily life but it's the same practice whether i'm in sitting meditation or in daily

247
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:32,320
life the instructions are the same just receiving what's happening moment after

248
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:39,040
moment receiving and being aware of experience noticing where the attention is drawn

249
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,839
including with thoughts

250
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:54,800
one one one big difference or one big uh place

251
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:01,040
to to kind of be curious about is what does it mean to be aware with

252
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:07,119
the content of our thoughts and this is this is this is again in our

253
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:13,359
in some of our more focused meditation practices we don't generally engage with content we're usually trying to drop

254
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:18,880
below content and explore more the bear experience

255
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:25,359
but again in in navigating our lives how how content affects us

256
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:30,880
is really um a big part of where we get caught and

257
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:36,160
lost and a big part of how we struggle in our relationship to

258
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:41,520
the ideas that come at us the political ideas a big place where we

259
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:48,960
get caught in struggle the relational uh experiences we get caught in i wanted

260
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:56,079
my friend to do this and they did this and we we respond we we um

261
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:01,359
we have a lot of struggle around the content of our

262
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:08,880
experience and so learning how to navigate this terrain not saying okay content drop the content

263
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:15,920
and just come into body and but what is it like to be aware with content

264
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,960
so a great place to begin this exploration is right in the meditation

265
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:30,240
um as i explore as we explored in the guided meditation when the mind wanders and returns from

266
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:36,240
wandering this is a place where we can begin exploring the effect of content

267
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:41,680
on our experience so in the guided meditation

268
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:48,400
um i encouraged after the mind had wandered you know after the mind had wandered um

269
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:54,240
noticing what was present in the in the because when the mind wanders as i said

270
00:40:54,240 --> 00:41:01,680
when the mind wanders it's wandering often into thought it may be wandering into some charged

271
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:08,480
thoughts kind of active content of mind it can be it can wander into into charged thoughts

272
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:14,319
it can wander into more drifting thoughts those are two classes or categories of

273
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:22,319
thinking that are useful to kind of recognize the difference between so the the active kind of thinking often

274
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:27,920
has a very strong effect on us when we're kind of charging out to think

275
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:36,319
about something so when the mindfulness returns there when the mindfulness comes back

276
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:42,000
the experience of the present moment where mindfulness has returned

277
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,079
will have been shaped by the content when we've gotten lost in the content

278
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:54,160
the experience of the present moment will have been shaped by the content of those thoughts

279
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:59,440
if you've been thinking about a conversation you had with a partner or

280
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:04,720
a co-worker that had some charged content

281
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:11,599
when your mindfulness returns very likely that content will have shaped

282
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:18,079
some of those same charged feelings so this is a beginning place to begin to

283
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:23,359
recognize okay content affects experience those thoughts when the mindfulness

284
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:31,119
returns often we know when the when the content is charged often we are aware of the the content as

285
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:36,880
we come back we know that we've been thinking about that conversation and uh what

286
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:44,880
the the content of that was so we know that the content was there and then how has that affected you

287
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:52,960
and so this is a beginning way to uh in that moment as as mindfulness returns to be aware of the thought

288
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:59,680
with the content and how it affects you at the same time so this again is a kind

289
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:05,920
of more receptive or broader kind of awareness you're not aiming at one particular area

290
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:11,119
of experience trying to say look at the body or see what the emotions are it's

291
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:17,359
more there's this thought that's been happening receive the effect that it's had and it

292
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:24,160
may be a little bit in the body a little bit in emotions you may notice many things

293
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:30,160
so it's a kind of a broader receiving of what has happened

294
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:36,880
having had those thoughts also with receptive awareness in the

295
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:43,680
practice of receptive awareness that continuing just you've become aware you've noticed

296
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:49,040
this has been the thought here's how it's affected the body the mind

297
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:56,960
then just continue to notice what what else is happening after a certain

298
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:02,960
period of exploring oh that's wow that's what happened

299
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:10,000
then something else might arise you might hear the dogs start barking next door and the attention goes to that

300
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:17,520
that's fine there's no place or object or thing particularly you need to come back to

301
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:23,920
now in the place when you have returned from a wandering

302
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:29,359
especially if the content has been charged you know there can be in in noticing the

303
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:36,880
experience noticing what's there there can be a kind of a pull back to figure something out or try to fix

304
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:42,240
something or figure out how to respond to that person so there'll be there may be some tension

305
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:49,599
in in the system what can i do maybe you can notice that too

306
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:56,720
the feeling of of those thoughts kind of propelling the mind to want to

307
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:03,839
do something so notice the wanting notice the desire to fix to figure out

308
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:10,160
to control that too can be can be known

309
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:15,280
and if at some point the pull to the thinking feels so strong that it's like

310
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:21,920
hard to resist then it might be useful to come back to something where you land like like we

311
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:28,160
started in the guided meditation land and receive the breath for a few moments

312
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:35,040
receive the breath as a skillful means to support the mind remembering what it's like to be back in

313
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:42,480
the present moment and to support perhaps letting go of that pull to the thinking

314
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:48,319
but giving yourself some time to explore what it's like to be

315
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:53,599
and what i mean by the pull to thinking is the pull to thinking and not being mindful of it

316
00:45:53,599 --> 00:46:00,560
if the thinking is happening and you can be aware oh wow the thought of wanting to do this

317
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:06,480
you know wanting to figure this out oh and that's how this is affecting the body and mind

318
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:11,920
oh and this thought what about that thing i could oh and there that's how that's affecting the

319
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:18,800
body and mind that's not being pulled out of mindfulness and so there's a learning here

320
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:23,839
that what does it mean to be aware while we're thinking

321
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:29,760
we so often might have the view or the idea that if we are thinking

322
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:36,560
it means we're not being mindful but this is where this kind of receptive awareness practice which

323
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:44,160
explores just being aware of whatever is happening can potentially support us to recognize

324
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:49,200
well i'm aware i know that i'm thinking

325
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:59,119
and so awareness is here we can be aware while thinking

326
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:06,000
and in that being aware while thinking it it is often a little bit of a broader

327
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:12,400
awareness and it's it um there's the awareness of the thought

328
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:20,160
the awareness of the content of the thought and awareness of how that whole

329
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:25,839
set of thoughts and ideas that content affects the system

330
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:33,119
so it's it's it's not a a close in or focused awareness it's much broader

331
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:38,559
there's this this these thoughts and this is how i am with those thoughts

332
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:46,640
carol wilson uses the phrase 360 degree mindfulness which is a beautiful expression of

333
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:52,880
just taking in the experience not just

334
00:47:52,880 --> 00:48:00,800
thinking or seeing or hearing or body sensation but the cli the kind of the whole picture

335
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:08,160
said the teacher one of the main teachers i've learned this practice of receptive

336
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:15,359
awareness from um he used a phrase 50 50 mindfulness

337
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:21,280
where he said 50 of the attention on what you're doing the content of what's happening

338
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:27,680
and 50 of the attention on how you are with that so that there's not the sense of the

339
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:34,400
content being something outside of the mindfulness not the 360 degree awareness

340
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:41,280
encapsulates that to some extent too so aware of content and how you are with

341
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:48,319
that content so that moment of remembering does begin to give a sense of what it might be like

342
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:53,160
to be aware with content

343
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,920
so it can be useful as i said to kind of recognize different kinds of thinking

344
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:14,319
the active thinking or the charged thinking where the mind feels like it's just rushing out of the present moment

345
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:20,400
grabbing onto those thoughts and there's some energy to thinking about them

346
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:27,520
we can call that active thinking and there's another kind of thinking that's more the mind just kind of drifts

347
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:33,839
out of the present moment no particular emotional a charge there it's just like the mind

348
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:40,559
just picks up on something it just floats out of the present moment often maybe a sense of

349
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:47,920
random thoughts in that place or hypnagogic thoughts dream like thoughts can happen in that place just a drifting

350
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:55,440
so they're very different those two um in terms of the experience

351
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:01,040
the active thinking you know with the active thinking it's it's useful

352
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:06,880
um to recognize you know kind of the charge that happens

353
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:13,040
with the active thinking so really it may be it may be useful in that situation to know there's the

354
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:19,520
content and and recognizing kind of the category of content you know planning or remembering or

355
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:24,839
fighting or judging or fantasizing if the if the content is really really

356
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:30,079
strong not to say completely step out of the content but also

357
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:36,480
let more of the attention be in the body and in the mind than in the content

358
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:42,880
because the content may be kind of the sticky place there but you know staying connected with the

359
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:49,920
content to some extent oh the mind is really caught in that plan stu is in that plan and and wow the mind

360
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:54,040
is spinning with that plan

361
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:05,280
with the drifting kind of thinking often in that situation

362
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:12,480
as i said in the guided meditation you know in the in the um in the active thinking when we remember when we return

363
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:18,880
from thinking often the uh experience will have been

364
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:24,559
shaped by the emotions the thoughts the content of that thinking

365
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:31,280
so often there will be have some agitation that will have arisen and that's a useful thing to kind of just

366
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:36,480
check into especially if you're exploring this in daily life i'm kind of talking about it more in the sitting

367
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:42,000
meditation but i'd like to also point to bringing this into daily life in daily life if you notice that you've

368
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:48,400
woken up into active thinking often there's a little less you know in the sitting meditation we

369
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:54,559
don't we don't have as much to do we're not as potentially having to make a decision on

370
00:51:54,559 --> 00:52:00,800
the spot about something so we can explore a little bit more you know okay there's these thoughts and

371
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:08,319
here's how they're affecting the body and mind in in daily life um with active thinking

372
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:13,839
if you wake up into active thinking you know you're walking down the street and suddenly you realize your mind has been

373
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:21,040
like pulled into this whole scenario a useful exploration there can be

374
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:26,640
just a simple check-in so noticing wow the mind is is kind of caught and it's

375
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:33,359
spinning and just notice kind of the agitation of body and mind that may be there

376
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:40,079
just in a kind of a simple way you don't have to do a detailed exploration the receptive awareness is

377
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:48,480
really useful for this too the the receptive awareness in daily life can take in a much broader kind of

378
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:54,960
experience kind of the the the 360 degree awareness or the wide

379
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:00,960
angle lens it doesn't have to land mindfulness doesn't have to land on specific experience it can't be much

380
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:08,160
broader and so in the awareness of thinking in our daily lives just notice

381
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:13,200
oh this is what's happening so yesterday i was taking a walk

382
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:20,319
and i was noticing some thoughts about not wanting to be taking the walk i was noticing that i

383
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:26,559
was tired that and i know that when i'm tired it's actually a really good time to take a walk but there was resistance

384
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:33,520
there was resistance to taking the walk and so i was noticing the mind i was noticing the the thoughts about

385
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:39,839
that and what i noticed is that when i you know so sometimes the mind would get a little caught in it

386
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:45,920
a little tight and it felt like there was a squeezing in the mind so that was a simple kind of piece it's just this

387
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:51,839
feeling of of squeezing and then and then noticing those

388
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:57,040
thoughts i just was hanging out with them i wasn't like saying oh let's go let go of that squeezing it's like oh

389
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:03,680
the mind is squeezing with this thought and then as in being with it it's like for a few

390
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:09,040
moments after a few moments the squeezing would let go and it'd be like oh yeah not wanting to

391
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:15,119
take this walk and yeah it's just it's okay you know just not wanting to do this is happening

392
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:21,839
but there's not the extra resistance to like the the the trying to get out of

393
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:27,440
the walk while i'm walking and so just the way the mind works so the the mind

394
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:32,559
could see that squeezing and just like oh yeah wow the mind is really wow look

395
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:39,119
at look at how hard the mind does not want to be here and then it would release

396
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:46,559
and then it would come back and i just watched this process just watch this process multiple times

397
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:52,160
i'd say maybe 10 minutes into the walk it it had finally the the mind had

398
00:54:52,160 --> 00:55:00,880
finally let go of those thoughts of i don't want to be doing this i don't want to be doing this and it was just fine to be walking

399
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:07,760
i could have powered through the walk in any case you know kind of repressed all of those thoughts and just powered

400
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:14,799
through the walk which is what i used to do but then you know the mind kind of is in

401
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:21,920
that situation the mind is kind of reinforcing the aversion it's reinforcing those

402
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:28,880
those thoughts of if i just bear down and get this over with it'll be okay

403
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:34,000
you know it's kind of just reinforcing all of that encouraging

404
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,040
reinforcing that oh look i bore down and i got through this and here i am done

405
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:45,359
with the walk that that really worked but you know it's like you can get done

406
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:51,599
with the walk without bearing down and forcing it to so so you know just to explore that the

407
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:56,720
possibility of being aware with the thoughts as opposed to the idea i need

408
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:04,319
to get rid of the thoughts in order to be okay just aware of those thoughts aware

409
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:09,839
while thinking there's a lot that we can see in this terrain

410
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:17,520
especially in the um the sitting practice when we explore um

411
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:23,440
being aware while thinking in the sitting practice noticing thoughts arising

412
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:29,760
we can start to see how those thoughts are conditioned we can see a thought will often arise

413
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:36,319
based on something that has been has happened i thought you know we hear a sound

414
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:41,680
we have a perception we hear a bird outside

415
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:47,680
and then we perhaps recognize the kind of bird oh that's a crow

416
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:53,599
and then we see an image perhaps we even see an image of the crow and imagine what the crow is doing and then we start

417
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:58,640
thinking about crows we start thinking about the crows in our backyard and

418
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:03,920
what they do there and and then the mind maybe gets lost

419
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:10,400
so we we start to see and we can start to see two um that's that's a that's a very

420
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:16,960
habitual way for our mind to get lost but we can actually be aware of how that all happens and notice that it is

421
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:22,799
conditioned how a thought a perception will

422
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:29,599
create a memory we'll think about that memory and then perhaps that memory can create

423
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:35,520
emotions so all of that arising from

424
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:42,400
a perception leading to thought we can stay present for the process

425
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:48,880
and sometimes as we stay present for the process very naturally what happens is

426
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:55,680
this is kind of funny and paradoxical but very naturally what happens is as we attend to the process of thinking

427
00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:03,440
very naturally the process of thinking begins to diminish like we see we see the we see the

428
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:08,480
thought we see the um we see the perception of crow we see

429
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:16,000
the thought of crow we see the mind start thinking about crows we feel an emotion and and we recognize oh yeah

430
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:22,880
this is all a conditioned process and with the awareness instead of then

431
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:28,319
launching into the emotions and further thoughts that are spurred from that emotion

432
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:33,599
the whole thing can sometimes fall away

433
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:40,960
and so in a paradoxical way being able to learn how to be aware while thinking

434
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:46,319
helps the mind to engage less with

435
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:52,799
reactive thinking to engage less with unnecessary thinking

436
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:57,920
this is something i've seen happening a lot in my in you know a real

437
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:04,400
lessening in my in my life around the mind just kind of going off into random

438
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:11,200
you know thinking because i'm i'm i'm much more present and so the there's there's a lot more of

439
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:19,200
a sense that the thinking the thinking that happens more is the kind of thinking that's useful

440
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:27,440
what do i need to do today how do i need to do it what what would i like to bring to this what what kind of

441
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:33,839
attitudes or mind states would i like to bring to what i need to do today can i be kind

442
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:38,880
today with what i need to do can i

443
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:45,319
recognize when i'm caught in reactivity

444
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:59,119
so another another way and especially in daily life to begin to explore this

445
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:04,160
terrain of being aware with content

446
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:10,559
because this again this is a huge place this is a huge place where we tend to

447
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:18,240
lose mindfulness or just not think it's possible to be mindful is to um

448
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:24,000
slow it down a little bit you know the thoughts thoughts happen pretty fast i'd say thoughts thoughts are pretty quick

449
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:30,799
moving and so it's not always that easy to catch thoughts and to be aware while thinking it is possible

450
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:37,599
and the more we practice with it the more possible it becomes but to practice with the content of our

451
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:42,880
thoughts often at first we we do notice that we're thinking and then how does it

452
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:50,240
affect us so it's a little bit of that back and forth we can do the same thing in daily life

453
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:55,839
around content and a great place to explore this

454
01:00:55,839 --> 01:01:01,760
with reading and writing so with reading

455
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:08,640
essentially you're taking in the content of someone else's mind unless you're reading your own stuff in which case

456
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:14,240
you're taking in the contents of your prior selves mind so you're taking in the content you're

457
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:19,520
taking in content so how does that content affect you when

458
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:26,799
you read so with reading you can slow it down and i play with this sometimes especially in

459
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:34,079
in reading the news it's like read a headline how does that land

460
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:39,359
take in the content how does that content affect the system

461
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:44,480
words are so powerful for us

462
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:49,839
a single word can shape your experience

463
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:55,200
single word can have an effect on your experience

464
01:01:55,280 --> 01:02:00,960
and so reading a a headline multiple words

465
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:06,640
with the concept embedded in that that can have a very powerful effect on

466
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:12,400
your experience and so become aware of that so read a headline

467
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:17,520
how does that land so you can slow it down with reading

468
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:23,599
read a couple of sentences read a paragraph pause so this might take um a remembering you

469
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:30,079
know perhaps you could if you if you um do your

470
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:37,680
news reading online maybe you could put a little reminder to yourself somewhere to try to try to practice with this help

471
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:45,119
yourself try to remember to do this what does it mean how does this content affect

472
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:51,599
the body the mind read a few paragraphs check in

473
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:57,920
read some more check in notice if you start getting charged

474
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:02,960
perhaps if you start getting charged and the mind starts kind of picking up and running out of the present moment

475
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:08,559
justifying your position denying somebody else's position maybe that's a time to

476
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:17,078
really let yourself settle in again it's like okay wow really charged right now this is what it feels like to be charged

477
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:23,200
with writing we can also slow that down some with writing you are

478
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:29,200
you know investigating or looking at the content you're trying to share the content of your mind with somebody else

479
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:36,079
or with yourself so it's it's more aligned with or more like

480
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:41,280
thinking in a way it's a slowed down thinking process to

481
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:47,839
put things down in writing and so you can explore this also it's like while writing

482
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:53,200
you know maybe have have a practice of while writing

483
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:59,839
a text or an email or a tweet

484
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:06,640
how does it feel what how is this content these thoughts affecting

485
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:13,039
this system is there agitation or is there ease

486
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:19,920
while creating this content that simple check is there agitation or ease with this

487
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:25,280
content hugely helpful it can be that simple you don't have to

488
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:32,240
know the details of what the kind of emotion is or just like is there is there energy like this or is the energy

489
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:38,960
like this so recognizing

490
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:45,039
that with the content that you are thinking of sharing and potentially also you know this is

491
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:52,079
this is a way into um exploring being mindful while speaking as well

492
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:59,599
you might also reflect before you send that text or tweet or email

493
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:06,240
how might the person who is the audience receive it

494
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:13,680
so kind of like it's almost like in that moment putting yourself in their shoes feeling like the recipient of it

495
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:19,920
how does that land if you were to receive this

496
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:28,440
communication again using mindfulness with content

497
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:45,039
there's some other kinds of thinking and just talk a little bit about the drifting thinking first

498
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:52,079
which i mentioned in the guided meditation with drifting thinking has been a

499
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:58,400
wonderful practice for me it's been delightful actually

500
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:04,400
what in my own experience um i've seen is often that kind of thinking

501
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:10,319
comes where the mind just kind of drifts out of the present moment it's it's like there's a there's some settledness of

502
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:17,280
mind you know there's there's some subtleness because the mind isn't picking up on its habits it's tendencies it's just kind of floating

503
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:23,119
and there's there's a when it gets into that kind of floaty

504
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:28,400
space sometimes we just lose touch with remembering to be mindful there

505
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:34,799
and so that kind of floating quality when we find ourselves having floated out of the present moment

506
01:06:34,799 --> 01:06:40,799
and waking back up into that then what i've seen often you know so

507
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:47,520
like the the recognition of the content of thoughts there is usually not that relevant

508
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:56,160
what the content of those thoughts is is often kind of random or dreamlike or nonsensical and so the content isn't as

509
01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:01,520
much to it to to work with there as it is potentially kind of recognizing

510
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:07,200
how you've noticed those thoughts so there's different modalities that we

511
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:11,359
can think in we can think in

512
01:07:12,839 --> 01:07:19,200
images we can think as if we're talking to ourselves we can think as if we're hearing

513
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:27,039
somebody else talk to us so hearing and seeing are two of the big ways most of us think

514
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:33,760
you know through as if we were hearing or seeing so there's an internal sense of hearing or seeing

515
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:41,280
there's also we can also think through any of the sense bases so we can think as though we were

516
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:46,640
kind of in a kinesthetic way we can when i was um when i was a dancer i

517
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:52,160
would also often like play the dance through in my mind

518
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:58,000
and so it's a form of thought you know you know as if i were doing it and i would feel it it would be like feeling

519
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:03,200
it in my body that's how how i would think through the dance so there's that

520
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:08,000
possibility of thinking kinesthetically

521
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:15,599
then as an example of that maybe right now if you if you're if you're sitting down

522
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:21,838
you could just explore imagine imagine

523
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:27,278
standing up is there just a little bit of a sense of

524
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:32,480
in the body some kind of sense of that experience

525
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:38,960
sometimes you can experience that or recognize that sometimes not just that's a that's maybe a little

526
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:44,880
pointer to what it's like to have that kinesthetic thinking

527
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:53,199
so we can think in these multiple ways and so with the drifting thinking it can be useful to recognize how was

528
01:08:53,199 --> 01:08:58,000
that thinking how is that thinking happening

529
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:07,758
images words and then we can start to recognize

530
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:14,159
perhaps we can start to recognize instead of being caught by those images or thoughts

531
01:09:14,159 --> 01:09:22,318
sounds in the mind we can recognize oh the mind has got these images going and again we don't have to stop them

532
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:27,920
it was so interesting to me when i learned this on on a retreat to just see oh the mind will put up these like it's

533
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:35,359
like a slideshow it's thinking about being in prague when i was traveling in in czechoslovakia and i get

534
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:43,199
these images these these like still images of various places i was and and it lasted for like you know five ten

535
01:09:43,199 --> 01:09:49,199
seconds and then it stopped and i was present for the entire slideshow it was it was quite a

536
01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:54,800
delightful experience actually remembering remembering that experience

537
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:59,840
there was a little bit of the flavor of having been there but because i was present the mind

538
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:06,800
didn't kind of pick up on those thoughts and then go off into being in prague for 15 minutes

539
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:14,320
it lasted for about 10 seconds and then it went on and so if again aware while thinking

540
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:20,800
aware of this process of thinking so those drifting kind of thoughts sometimes useful to recognize how they

541
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:26,159
are experienced the modality in which they are experienced

542
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:34,960
and if the mind does drift out of the present moment gets lost in the wandering

543
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:40,080
then that moment of returning you know as as i expressed in the in the

544
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:46,560
guided meditation again sometimes if the mind has drifted out of the present moment

545
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:53,600
when we wake up when our mindfulness returns from that

546
01:10:53,600 --> 01:11:00,800
drifting if we do not have if we do not have the

547
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:06,800
attitude or the idea or the agenda that the thinking was a problem it's just like oh mindfulness is back

548
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:12,960
what's happening in this moment if we don't have any sense of it having been a problem for the mind to be drifting and

549
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:18,159
not mindful then what often happens after a drifting is that the mind is

550
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:24,320
actually more at ease and more relaxed than it was

551
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:29,440
before the mind drifted and this is this was a huge

552
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:35,360
help for me it was almost like i was feeling like my mind the mind was

553
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:41,360
i was i was definitely you know an over striver really hanging on to that mindfulness

554
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:46,960
trying to stay present moment after moment doing doing the practice so hard

555
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:54,400
so much so much attachment to the practice and as i began to be curious about this

556
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:59,600
moment when mindfulness returns and seeing the the mind returning from

557
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:05,360
the drifting it was almost like what it felt like the mind was doing was telling me you're

558
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:12,320
working too hard here i'll show you how to relax and if i was available for that lesson

559
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:17,360
when the mindfulness came back it was like oh this is what it's like to be

560
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:23,600
mindful and at ease at the same time this is what it's like to be

561
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:30,320
relaxed while being aware and so that that exploration around the

562
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:35,800
drifting mind can be really

563
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:41,679
enlightening it can be really really uh supportive for helping the

564
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:48,400
mind recognize what it means to be at ease

565
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:51,719
with mindfulness

566
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:02,719
so yeah i see it's about we have about five minutes left

567
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:09,120
and um let's see if there's any questions those of you in the zoom room you could raise

568
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:15,440
your zoom hand i think or use the chat those of you on the

569
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:22,719
live stream could type a question in probably i'm not able to get to many questions in just five minutes but but i

570
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:28,800
think kevin will moderate the questions if there's any questions

571
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:36,080
yeah we'll give people some time to raise their hand or

572
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:44,320
put questions in chat on youtube or if you feel like it you can uh put your questions in chat and zoom as well and

573
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:47,840
we'll take them there

574
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:23,280
hey uh tom and dana um if you guys want to come off mute and ask a question we

575
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:29,719
can go ahead hi andrea hi

576
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:37,920
when um when i'm aware of my thoughts and the breath i also am aware of this

577
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:43,440
base note of anxiety so there are three things cooking

578
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:48,960
what should i do [Laughter] so you could ex you could explore it by

579
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:55,600
just knowing all of it so there's the the thought you said you said the breath the thought

580
01:14:55,600 --> 01:15:02,719
and the base anxiety you could just explore wow that's what's happening you know just like okay yes

581
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:09,199
and and is is the content of the thought kind of connected with that anxiety you

582
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:15,040
know so is it is or is it something else you know is something else because sometimes

583
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:21,199
sometimes the thoughts are kind of popping out of the base of of our emotional terrain

584
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:27,360
and sometimes they create our emotional terrain there's a kind of but it's conditioned both ways and so

585
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:32,480
kind of curious about well what's the relationship between those thoughts and

586
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:38,640
the anxiety is and if if the anxiety feels strong you know then

587
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:44,640
it's possible that with the mindfulness of it you know that the the attention might kind of gravitate towards

588
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:50,960
that side of the experience in being aware while thinking we don't have to preference also don't have to preference

589
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:56,880
the content it's like with receptive awareness it's more wow i become aware

590
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:02,239
the breath the thought the anxiety what's most obvious

591
01:16:02,239 --> 01:16:05,239
here

592
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:17,920
what's most obvious and what do what where does the attention kind of feel like it's most drawn to so that we

593
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:23,280
don't have to we don't have to choose what to pay with a receptive awareness it's more like

594
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:31,280
we don't we don't have to decide where we direct the attention it's more like can i allow this to be as it is and

595
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:38,080
what is most wanting attention right now if the mindfulness can hold that

596
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:43,600
if if the mindfulness if if the mindfulness doesn't get lost while holding that so if there can be an

597
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:50,400
allowing sense of oh yeah this is what's happening and that anxiety is there these thoughts are

598
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:56,560
there here's the breath if the mindfulness can hold that kind of a patience and a trust

599
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:03,040
that there is learning that's happening but if you find that the attention is kind of drawn into the anxiety and

600
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:09,520
starts thinking more thoughts then it could be useful to um direct the attention to something

601
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:14,719
that where you can stay present maybe with the breath for instance or if the

602
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:20,560
breath feels tied up with the anxiety maybe with hearing so that there's some skillful means if

603
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:27,440
if it feels like the the mind is pulled into the thinking and it's like it can't not go there then

604
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:35,280
it's useful to to do some directed attention to something that that allows you to to to stay present but from what

605
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:41,360
you described it sounds like there's some capacity to just know all of that so some of it is trust

606
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:47,760
you know trust that there is learning happening here we like to be in charge of the learning you know

607
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:53,840
we like to we like to know what we're learning sometimes we don't get to know that you know sometimes the buddha talked

608
01:17:53,840 --> 01:18:00,560
about the practice being very gradual very um

609
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:09,199
you know moment after moment the mindfulness just meets experience and he speaks about the wearing away of

610
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:15,440
the um the reactivity being like the wearing away of the rigging of a rope that's held up on

611
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:21,679
dry land after being at sea for six months you know just like the the sun the sand the wind

612
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:26,800
kind of wears away those the the rigging and you know after six months it's going

613
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:32,800
to be more worn after two years it'll be kind of broken and rotted through

614
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:38,560
and so the um you know the mindfulness functions like that moment after moment

615
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:43,840
minute after minute hour after hour even day after day we may not see

616
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:49,440
what's being let go or what's being worn down and so some patience and some trust

617
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:55,239
that the practice of being aware is

618
01:18:56,640 --> 01:19:02,640
enough being aware with the quality of mind that is allowing it to be

619
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:07,679
as it is and that that exploration of um

620
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:12,880
knowing that what that experience is where the mind

621
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:18,320
can be present and not pulled into

622
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:23,360
that's that's the crucial piece be curious about what is this experience

623
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:30,880
when there can be that curiosity the learning will kind of naturally naturally unfold there

624
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:38,480
so thank you for the question and i'm sorry for the rest of you who put in questions it's time so
