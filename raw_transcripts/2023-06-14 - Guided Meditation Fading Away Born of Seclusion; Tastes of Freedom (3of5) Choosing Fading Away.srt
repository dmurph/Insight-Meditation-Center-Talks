1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:06,299
greetings everyone I'm delighted uh to be back here with

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:12,059
you on this friendly virtual tour

3
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:17,360
of tastes of freedom

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:24,199
so on Monday we remembered that by

5
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:31,740
staying in the present moment and then feeling and tasting

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:40,440
our experience in the present moment that's the key that opens the door

7
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:48,600
to the path to Freedom so as the Buddha says in his

8
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,420
introduction to is great teaching on the very first

9
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:02,100
thing the practitioner does is to establish

10
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:10,100
awareness grounded in the present moment

11
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:18,600
so with that we have the ability

12
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,060
to discern which way we want to go when

13
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:33,240
the present moment is offering us something that may be tempting but unwholesome

14
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,460
or something maybe less seductive

15
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,659
but more wholesome

16
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:52,500
and yesterday we explored the factor of viveka

17
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,439
that cozy seclusion which protects us

18
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:05,640
from harmful distractions and gives us the power

19
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,879
to avoid these three poisons of greed hate

20
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:18,239
and delusion and it says wholesome

21
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,720
so yesterday I talked about you know living leaving our

22
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,239
um responsibilities and

23
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:39,840
lands and perhaps reforminations outside the door together with our shoes

24
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,540
as a way of establishing viveca this

25
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,540
Independence

26
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:01,680
and today we'll look at viraga

27
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,099
usually translated as dispassion and this is born

28
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:13,580
of the seclusion of viveca

29
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:20,280
the seclusion is like you know we're wearing a white cloth

30
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:26,700
that keeps us pure or that is it has the magic qualities of

31
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:33,980
being able to deflect arrows or evil

32
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:48,840
and viraga literally means Away From Desire

33
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,900
so in this case desire can include aversion because

34
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,420
on the one hand we might want more of something which is the usual desire or

35
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:05,879
we might desire for something to go away or to stop

36
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:11,879
and so both of those kinds of Desire uh

37
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:17,000
are not helpful on the path to enlightenment

38
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:24,120
so this brings us to the uh

39
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,540
Dharma factor of the uraga fading away

40
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:38,400
so to begin take your

41
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,759
meditation posture with

42
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:50,120
if you can a sense of confidence

43
00:04:53,639 --> 00:05:01,139
maybe some determination to stay here to the extent possible

44
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:07,800
in the present moment knowing that when the Mind becomes

45
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:13,860
distracted the wise thing to do is to not go there

46
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,780
and to come back to the breath

47
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,660
so inviting a little bit of energy into the spine

48
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,520
and living

49
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,580
gravity do the rest

50
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,199
feeling if you can the gravity of the Earth

51
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:54,419
which is holding you very securely in place as our planet hurdles

52
00:05:54,419 --> 00:06:01,880
around the Sun gravity is something we can trust

53
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:09,720
sitting and being here with whatever arises

54
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:15,020
is also something we can trust

55
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:32,940
you may have seen statues of the Buddha with the mudra of touching the Earth

56
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:39,440
in which the Buddha takes his right hand and with his fingers downward

57
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:46,740
touches the Earth for us humans who may not

58
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:52,979
be sitting completely flat like the Buddha was and having longer arms than

59
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:59,520
normal humans if we attempt in the position we're in

60
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:06,720
now to touch the Earth if we're sitting we might have the tips of our fingers just moving forward

61
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,440
slightly to touch uh the thigh

62
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,960
so imagine touching the Earth

63
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,759
and when the Buddha touched the Earth that was his response to Mara

64
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:36,780
you may have heard of Mara who is the temptress with a temp door yes it's a

65
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:42,180
male uh who um is jealous of the Buddha and wants to

66
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:48,240
do everything he can to and so when the Buddha was about to

67
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,940
become enlightened Mara started firing all kinds of I remember is a god

68
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:59,819
he has Supernatural Powers but he's not you know a good guy that wants us to

69
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:05,220
remain deluded so we start spying firing arrows at the

70
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:11,099
Buddha but the Buddha's presence is enough for those arrows to

71
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:17,220
turn into flowers and then seductive young ladies and they have no effect

72
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:22,560
either and uh and the Buddha says um

73
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:29,400
I'm going to until I'm awakened and

74
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:35,880
um and then Mara being seen for who he is

75
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:42,500
um shrivels up and disappears

76
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:50,760
so that's the power of the State of Mind of taking the Earth as our Witness

77
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,399
that we have every right to be on this path to Awakening

78
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,899
nobody can take that away from us not unless we let them

79
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:16,019
so take a deep breath but first of all close the

80
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:23,480
eyes thrusting that you're going to be okay the eyes closed

81
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:32,480
and take it deep slow full breath

82
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:39,980
on the inhale and then on the exhale

83
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:49,740
and see if you can visualize yourself from space now the Earth is just a

84
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:55,080
little marbled and you're just a little speck on the marble

85
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:00,899
with your fingers boarding towards the center of the Earth

86
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:04,519
you're really well grounded

87
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:21,720
and now we'll do brief scan from the feet to the crown of the head

88
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:28,680
and today I'd like to invite you to do that scan

89
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:37,920
with a feeling of mid Dot meta is the unconditional friendliness

90
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:44,100
of greeting each moment as a friend

91
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:50,459
so during this body scan we will greet and touch with

92
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:58,019
our awareness each part of the body that replace our awareness

93
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:07,820
in with his warm loving feeling of friendship and appreciation

94
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:15,620
so glad you're here feet so that I may walk or so glad that

95
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:21,000
you're uh here Billy

96
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:29,279
Etc rejoicing and being alive

97
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:37,640
so let the attention come down to The Souls of the feet

98
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:44,399
and open your heart to The Souls of your feet

99
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:53,120
with love take that love and bring it up your legs

100
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,860
and bring it through your pelvis

101
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:06,740
taking a moment to shower everything

102
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:15,140
in the belly with friendliness and acceptance

103
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:22,560
and now invite that shower of loving awareness

104
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,300
open to the Heart Center

105
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:35,060
again recognizing that however we feel

106
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:42,500
it's okay because that's what our experience is right now

107
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,980
and then the lovely feeling of warmth

108
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:56,820
let it Revel up to the shoulders maybe it will encourage you to release

109
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:03,779
the shoulders a little bit downward and then pouring deliciously

110
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:11,459
down through the arms and into the hands including the hand

111
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:14,959
it is touching the Earth

112
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:25,740
being alive now we invite

113
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:32,339
our awareness through the neck and into the head

114
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:34,880
area

115
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:47,300
softening the jaw maybe inviting a gentle smile

116
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:55,459
softening all around the eyes and the forehead

117
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,620
the scalp

118
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:14,660
and now letting our awareness radiate throughout the whole body

119
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,800
from The Souls of the feet to the top of the head

120
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:32,000
warm radiant awareness

121
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:46,740
and if you are so inclined

122
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:53,699
I invite you to take a vow that if the Mind should wish to go off on a thought

123
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:58,860
tangent sometimes we call these thought drains

124
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:06,120
or pleasure boats uh

125
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:12,240
that we evoke the quality of

126
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:19,019
dispassion Independence

127
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:25,860
it is born from seclusion

128
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:52,279
and when the mind and I don't say if I say when because this is what Minds do

129
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,839
um starts thinking again it was off on some tangent whatever it

130
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:03,660
is to have the mindfulness well enough in

131
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:11,279
place to see that and when you see that temptation to go

132
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:17,699
off on a trip somewhere you express

133
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:25,380
viraga dispassion or Independence

134
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:30,380
by just saying No thank you

135
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:41,540
and come back to your meditation object whatever that may be

136
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:07,558
the uraga is the factor of being willing

137
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:15,740
to let on wholesaling qualities abate let them fade away

138
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,540
by choosing not to reinforce them

139
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,720
so with the help of the breath

140
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:32,280
come back to right here in this body

141
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,360
in this mind

142
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,960
keep practicing like this

143
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:15,659
if the mind is somewhere other than your lived experience

144
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:23,940
in the present moment then with all the gentleness and sweetness you can

145
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:29,400
mustard invited

146
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:35,779
to come back to being right here with you

147
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,980
with the breath

148
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:29,000
and for the last few minutes of this sitting

149
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:38,600
if you've had even the briefest Ace of fading away

150
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:47,240
of Temptations know how healthy this is

151
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:52,640
let yourself appreciate the goodness

152
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:59,520
of letting all those distractions abate

153
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,280
even if it's only for a second

154
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:52,740
in our body scan we

155
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:59,400
invited getting in touch with

156
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:09,980
the different areas of our body by showering them with loving kindness

157
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:18,000
so now if you are so inclined

158
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,580
the invitation is to

159
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:30,139
take that loving awareness

160
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:37,100
and radiate it out in all directions

161
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:42,620
just radiating the goodness

162
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,620
of being here in the present moment

163
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:54,539
to the north East

164
00:27:54,539 --> 00:28:00,960
the South the West above

165
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,220
and be loved

166
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:20,820
may we and all beings

167
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:28,799
be protected may we and all beings

168
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,960
be peacefully contented

169
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:40,100
and maybe be free

170
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:51,018

00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,020
foreign

172
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:14,299
thank you for your practice

173
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:53,539
greetings everyone happy to be here with you again on

174
00:29:53,539 --> 00:29:57,019
this um

175
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:05,600
bus tour of a taste of freedom

176
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:16,380
but we began with was um recognizing that

177
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:22,860
um establishing mindfulness establishing clear awareness in the

178
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:30,020
present moment is the key to be coming free

179
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:37,140
and the reason is that if we stay with

180
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:43,500
our experience from lived experience we'll see what's happening

181
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:51,419
not only in the body but in the mind and as soon as the mind starts heading

182
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:59,039
in a direction that may be unwholesome we can take corrective action

183
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:08,600
because we've learned the to discern what's wholesome and unwholesome

184
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,340
and even if we're a beginner in meditation [Music]

185
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:23,940
if we begin our sit by making a vowel that will do our very

186
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:29,840
best not to move once we get a nursery

187
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:39,779
that is a huge help in getting the mind not to move

188
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:47,100
if we're you know sort of changing our posture or you know getting comfortable

189
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:52,440
or you know moving around in any way

190
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:59,039
any kind of movement there's a very strong chance that the mind will be

191
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:06,480
moving also so what we're trying to um cultivate this week in tastes of

192
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:12,960
freedom are these very Advanced dharmic factors

193
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,240
that are essential for studying the mind

194
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:26,640
and setting the body is a big step in that direction

195
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:33,000
so that's one thing you can you can try out and and it you may find

196
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,700
that it does help the mind to settle down

197
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:47,779
and on Monday we explored feeling and tasting

198
00:32:47,779 --> 00:32:55,740
as we place our awareness in the present moment and that feeling

199
00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:01,679
um allows us to determine the feeling tone vedana

200
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:09,260
of whether our experience seems to be pleasant unpleasant or neither

201
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:19,500
and then in addition to the feeling tone to take a look at the emotional tone by

202
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:27,260
tasting the present moment uh and um

203
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:35,820
the word for this in probably is Raza and it literally means taste

204
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:43,140
um but it's it was used in even in the ancient times in um

205
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:52,620
theatrical treatises that you could have little plays or whatever that have a

206
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:59,519
different tastes as part of them and so it might be sweet it might be salty it

207
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:07,039
might be uh bitter it might be sour it might be umami

208
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:16,320
um and so if we can sort of figuratively uh use the idea of taste to

209
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:23,580
um go a little bit deeper in Discerning our present moment awareness

210
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:31,800
uh what how the mind is we'll have not only the feeling tone of

211
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:39,839
just the very basic blessing unpleasant neither but we'll also have a sense a more

212
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:45,599
um in be more in tune with the the flavor of our feeling

213
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:52,378
and that can be uh you know that that can be subject to any kind of figurative

214
00:34:52,379 --> 00:35:00,180
uh use you'd like to use it for so that was that was Monday

215
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:06,900
um becoming free uh from grade eight and delusion

216
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:14,040
um by placing our awareness very steadily in the present moment

217
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:21,300
and then um yesterday we evoked the protection that is offered

218
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:30,540
by the factor of viveka it's usually translated as seclusion but

219
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:35,339
it really means um Independence

220
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:43,859
and uh and what it means in terms of meditation

221
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:49,859
is being secluded from unwholesome Habits

222
00:35:49,859 --> 00:35:56,820
so if we have you know a habit of you know it's getting to be uh

223
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:04,500
breakfast time and we start thinking about what we're going to have for breakfast that's taking us away from our

224
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,540
meditation of being right here

225
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:16,700
and so when we see that we're tending to go off on some kind of a

226
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:23,760
Frack of distraction then that's a door opener too because it

227
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,540
gives us the choice to say no thank you and to come back

228
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:35,339
and those of you who have been meditating for some for some time

229
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:41,099
I'm sure you're well aware that there's a lot of coming back to do in

230
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:46,920
this practice and you know you just got to be patient

231
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:52,320
with it and keep coming back and little by little

232
00:36:52,320 --> 00:37:01,200
you know what you'll start to get it you know the mind will start to realize that it's okay to say to say statistics excuse me to

233
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:07,500
stay centered and undistracted

234
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:12,020
for more than a minute or so

235
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:20,400
and today um I'd like to introduce to you uh the

236
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:27,900
next Factor which is called viraga in Pali and it

237
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:34,920
literally means um away from

238
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:46,560
design so V is away from and then Raga is a

239
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:53,099
desire and it also means uh die like the diet

240
00:37:53,099 --> 00:38:03,780
for changing the color of a cloth so away from the dye uh the cloth being

241
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:08,820
being washed repeatedly and out in the sunlight drying the color gradually

242
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:16,079
Fades away and in the same way as we practice uh

243
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:23,900
cultivating seclusion like not getting so tempted by distractions of the Mind

244
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:31,260
um we get more and more adept at

245
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:40,020
um having moments of viraga where of uh this Independence takes the form of

246
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:45,800
being comfortable with letting things abate

247
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:54,000
you say okay here we go again another you know another thought train and then with the decision to just like

248
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,119
okay let's just let that one slow down and go

249
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:05,880
away so um

250
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:12,960
so that's um this passion and I I do have a

251
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:20,220
passion for etymology uh in English and in French and in Bali and so

252
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:26,300
I am going to take us on a little detour um

253
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,920
and I'd like to talk about uh

254
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:38,220
rumination and so I I went to [Music] um

255
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:46,140
the great Gospel of Wikipedia and it the rumination comes from the Latin ruminare

256
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:52,020
and uh ruminari means to chew again

257
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:58,500
and um you know the there's a whole group of

258
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:04,020
mammals hoof to mammals that are ruminants and what do they do

259
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:10,020
so um rumors are buffed herbivores

260
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:16,520
grazing or browsing mammals that are specialized models that are able to acquire

261
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:21,780
nutrients from plant-based Foods by fermenting

262
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:29,760
it in a specialized stomach prior to digestion through microbial actions

263
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:36,240
the process typically requires the fermented cud

264
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:45,020
D to be regurgitated and chewed again and so rumination is the process of

265
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:50,820
rechewing the cud the further breakdown plant matter and

266
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:56,940
stimulate digestion so

267
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:03,900
um there's a there's the the same thing is happening

268
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:11,900
in our minds when we ruminate it's maybe not quite as gross as um

269
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:17,400
regurgitating the contents of our stomach but um

270
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:22,680
there is now um there's been an article recently in the

271
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:31,020
American Psychiatric Association um that is about the cycle of repetitive

272
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:39,000
thinking and how it is that that gives birth to anxiety and depression

273
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:48,420
and uh as I shared with you in last February I'm kind of an expert in

274
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:54,859
um pathology of anxiety and depression

275
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:02,520
uh so let me read to you now what the APA says

276
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:08,040
in this article on um repetitive thinking

277
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:16,079
rumination involves repetitive thinking or dwelling on the negative feelings and

278
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:21,619
distress and their causes and consequences

279
00:42:21,619 --> 00:42:27,780
repetitive negative aspect of Illumination can contribute to the

280
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:36,019
development of depression or anxiety and can worsen existing conditions

281
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:46,859
so viraga is about

282
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:53,820
you know when you're tempted to chew your gut like going to the past and relive the past and have that argument

283
00:42:53,820 --> 00:43:01,619
again or how you could have done that better or what they did wrong you know or going into the future planning what's

284
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:08,280
going to come next because you know you've got to be perfect right uh so you you know you've got to keep

285
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:14,280
thinking about what you have to do you have to have your list you know in order

286
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:20,339
you know we can let go of that we can let go of all of that

287
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:26,099
it can abate it can fade away

288
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:32,520
just like when a stained cloth

289
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:39,240
is washed and put out in the sun to dry

290
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:47,220
esteem can go away the stain of greed hate and delusion

291
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:55,500
so that's uh that's the dormant for today on miraga

292
00:43:55,640 --> 00:44:02,280
so um if you'd like a little homework assignment for the next uh 24 hours

293
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:08,880
if you see the Mind wanting to go down some unskillful track

294
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,980
that you pause and uh

295
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:20,780
and very sweetly invited to just gently fade away

296
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:28,640
thanks but no thanks I'll see it right here

297
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:36,900
hey thank you for the teaching Meg um so we'll take some

298

327
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:57,480
Mariah um she says okay no complaints thank you so much Meg for

328
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:02,640
these timely teachings I wonder if you would be willing to speak a little bit about working with practicing with

329
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:07,800
trauma what does one need to change in one's practice

330
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:14,540
oh thank you Mariah that's a beautiful question

331
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:23,160
ah well most um from the survivors like myself

332
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:29,880
need to go through very very extensive and deep

333
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:37,260
Psychotherapy um psychoanalysis uh or

334
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:44,339
um as Pat was talking about um uh things like

335
00:49:44,339 --> 00:49:50,339
um sensory experiencing

336
00:49:50,339 --> 00:49:57,180
um you know the the bodily approaches uh to letting go of trauma so that's you

337
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:03,780
know that's kind of the the truth for most of us

338
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:12,000
um but that's not enough uh for where we want to go as Buddhist

339
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,940
practitioners um

340
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:25,099
we're not satisfied with just being okay with trauma

341
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:30,720
um so we we go from being a trauma victim

342
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:39,119
eventually becoming a trauma Survivor and in my case what I had to do

343
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:47,160
to make that shift was to really dig down deep in my

344
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:53,660
soul and my heart to forgive my parents

345
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,720
for harming me and

346
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:06,660
that required on my part

347
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:13,740
finally seeing that they had done the best they could

348
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:20,220
and their best was really not very good at all for a child especially an eldest

349
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:26,838
child who was the designated family skate goat

350
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:34,260
but that's the best they could do you know so um

351
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:41,880
I also um went to a really nice uh recreated Spirit Rock a long time ago with Joanna

352
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:51,000
Macy and she had us in a circle where we evoked our ancestors

353
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:58,200
and you know realizing that my parents childhood was undoubtedly

354
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:06,240
more difficult than mine and that the trauma is can be hereditary

355
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:13,559
it can be or the the the abusive Behavior can be hereditary

356
00:52:13,559 --> 00:52:19,020
uh because if you don't know any better but also because you know

357
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:27,078
um as as the uh a guy from San Quentin says the hurt hurt

358
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:33,839
so if we've been hurt you know sometimes the the the the reaction to that is to

359
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:40,079
go out and hurt other people so uh and then he also says

360
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:47,160
um but the healed heal so this is this is you know the beautiful motivation of

361
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:52,319
letting go of our drama so the letting go like like all the

362
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:57,660
kinds of Letting Go that we're doing in this practice

363
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:04,440
is Progressive you know and it's not overnight and it has its ups and downs and it may take decades

364
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:10,200
uh but it is happening and you know if we look back

365
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:16,440
uh we can see progress so um Gill has helped me a lot also at one

366
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:24,720
point uh you know he was he doesn't usually uh

367
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:33,140
give you a devastating assignments only a few things you're ready for it

368
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:38,119
um but uh

369
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:44,099
at one point um he said to me uh Meg it's great that

370
00:53:44,099 --> 00:53:50,339
uh you're no longer uh from a Survivor you're just uh I call my

371
00:53:50,339 --> 00:53:55,740
Victim now you're a trauma Survivor but

372
00:53:55,740 --> 00:54:02,460
why don't you just forget about being a trauma anything you don't have to relate yourself to

373
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:09,859
PTSD it doesn't have to be part of your identity

374
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:17,460
so that was a kind uh um teaching that he gave me

375
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:23,640
and I won't go into the the one that that um

376
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:28,859
burning apart but fortunately I I came back together again

377
00:54:28,859 --> 00:54:34,740
anyway so I I hope that answers your question a little bit it's um

378
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:40,200
yeah it's it's forgiving is what allows us to

379
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:46,920
make that shift from identifying with

380
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:52,040
having had a dramatic experience

381
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:59,640
and in the state I have a friend who's a beautiful meditation teacher

382
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:07,079
uh Francisco and his experience with trauma was not because he was abused as a child he was in a devastating car

383
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:12,540
accident and just was you know in pieces afterwards and just constant extreme

384
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:19,440
pain day and night and I think I don't know if he's ever

385
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:26,339
affirmed this to me but my impression is that he was able to let go of his trauma

386
00:55:26,339 --> 00:55:33,799
through the depth of his practice by really going deep in meditation

387
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:40,559
so uh Francisco if I'm misrepresenting you um please forgive me but I'm letting

388
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:46,099
everybody know that I'm not at all sure if you actually said anything like this

389
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:49,579
they're probably say okay big

390
00:55:53,339 --> 00:56:00,180
okay thank you Megan uh Marlene asks is it really enough to Simply keep returning to the Dharma

391
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:06,680
and she said I missed you also Meg all right thanks

392
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:20,760
it's nourishing to teach also I remember I I taught last June I I almost a year

393
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:27,660
ago I think it was um and afterwards I was just blown away

394
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:34,079
because I had so much to learn from my own teachings but actually this is recorded in Nepal

395
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:39,720
account and there are examples of um monastics who teach and who become

396
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:47,040
awakened from teaching that that is that happens so um anyway thank you for giving me the

397
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:52,859
opportunity to teach it it is an enriching experience at albeit a

398
00:56:52,859 --> 00:56:58,260
humbling one yeah so I actually make she was asking

399
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:04,920
um is it enough to Simply keep returning to the Dharma sorry I think I may have kind of misrepresented it it was a

400
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:10,880
comment when it actually was a question um from Marlene so

401
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:17,339
I tried to answer it that way oh okay okay great well maybe uh maybe I missed

402
00:57:17,339 --> 00:57:22,859
the point um so you know it depends on your faith

403
00:57:22,859 --> 00:57:30,480
really if you have faith in the path if you know that the tempter is Mara and

404
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:37,440
he is doing everything he can to get you to give up if you want to turn away

405
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:45,660
um you know it's up to you to want to practice and so we have to come to terms

406
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:53,579
with what is our deepest intention and if our deepest intention

407
00:57:53,579 --> 00:58:00,540
is to put an end to Greed hate and delusion in ourselves

408
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:05,640
uh the way to do it is to follow this path that the Buddha

409
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:13,040
so beautifully laid out for us does that answer your question Marlene

410
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:25,559
I'm not sure she said anything in chat but I think that's uh

411
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:33,420
anyway Kevin thanks for asking again and thanks for um pushing me on it I appreciate it yeah yeah no problems

412
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:40,980
um so Robin also asks um and and let me know if you're kind of like on a uh you know if you're running out of time

413
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:46,920
Robin asked uh she says uh hi Meg thank you um and then she asked the room uh

414
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:52,200
ruminative type thoughts seem to be serving some purpose as in solving a

415
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:58,380
type of problem it seems that one both has to let those thoughts go

416
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:05,339
or encourage they're not reappearing but also to find underlying issue and let

417
00:59:05,339 --> 00:59:10,980
that go is there anything in this way of thinking thank you Robin

418
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:18,299
great question Robin um I'm reminded uh and by the way I during

419
00:59:18,299 --> 00:59:24,660
this week I'm kind of I'm borrowing a lot from Gil I had the Good Fortune to be on a two-week retreat with him

420
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:29,780
um in May um

421
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:38,400
but one thing he said was that he found it very useful to set aside

422
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:44,640
time every day to just uh sit back and have a cup of

423
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:50,280
tea and sort of you know look out the window or maybe sit down by the river

424
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:58,460
and watch the water go by without any agenda and just see what bubbles up

425
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:04,920
and that having a practice of doing that on a daily basis

426
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:11,940
gave him the latitude to let things like what you're saying uh that

427
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:17,819
you know these rumination types of thoughts they might be serving some good function

428
01:00:17,819 --> 01:00:24,420
they'll come up and you'll see them and you'll you'll be enriched by that and and have some idea of what you want to

429
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:29,460
do with it sort of like lucid dreaming um

430
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:34,980
you know where you go to bed saying that you're gonna you have a question that you want to answer and you ask your

431
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:40,740
dreams to please fill you in and then in the morning you analyze your dreams and you get the answer to your question

432
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:46,559
um so you take time out to just do nothing you know and relax

433
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:52,099
the cup of tea or something and see what comes up

434
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:57,420
and then when you're in meditation you're not so tempted to go off on

435
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:04,220
a ruminating tangent because you know you'll be able to do it later

436
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:13,500
is that helpful okay and then also Marlene uh said Thank

437
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:18,599
you at Marlene and Robin both said thank you for um

438
01:01:18,599 --> 01:01:22,040
for the comments on their questions

439
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:30,720
so I think that's all the questions we have in chat and uh um um so that'll kind of uh bring the Q a

440
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:36,000
to an end so thank you very much Meg for the time and the teachings

441
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,880
my pleasure thank you all

442
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:48,960
