1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:07,040
so good morning everyone and for those of you who were not here

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,360
yesterday i'm at spirit rock in marin county california

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:19,359
about an hour and a half north of imc

4
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:27,760
i'm teaching a retreat here um and uh through uh tomorrow so i'll be

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:35,600
doing the 7 a.m from here tomorrow morning as well and we have these wonderful um

6
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,120
rolling hills of the coast lots of oaks

7
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,879
if we're there might be uh lots of turkeys here and it's possible

8
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:53,120
that at some point we'll see the turkeys wandering around the background or the deer or something

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,719
so um and it's really nice for me to be

10
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,840
uh doing this outdoors um

11
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,280
and also these uh ren headland these these hills here

12
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,479
um my early buddhist practice was done at the green gulch zen center which is

13
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,680
on the coast in these hills here and uh when i lived there i did a lot i spent a

14
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,280
lot of time my days off hiking in these hills and mountains and and

15
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:32,079
the combination of the practice at the zen center and the walking in the mountains was the hills

16
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:38,000
was um an important formative time for me my meditation practice

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,920
so here we are so as an introduction to this meditation

18
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,920
um one of the premises that i'm offering you for what sati is

19
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,399
generally called mindfulness but which i like to call awareness is um

20
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:04,880
that it is a it is a natural form of awareness that's always here

21
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,760
but we're seldom established in it or seldom at rest in it or abiding in it

22
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,280
because the mind is busy in thoughts and desires and

23
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,640
trying to think of concerns about the future in the past and doing a lot of things

24
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,680
and so our activity our focus of attention is not on

25
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:35,440
this awareness itself and that the whole momentum movement of

26
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,879
doing mindfulness practices is to do those kinds of attentional practices

27
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:47,040
that helps us recognize and then strengthen and abide in rest in

28
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,360
this what can we call a natural awareness this awareness that's uh always here

29
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,360
but seldom um allowed to really show show us its full

30
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,680
potential one of the things that when people are doing mindfulness practice

31
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:12,400
one of the things that might interfere with the naturalness of resting in this awareness

32
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,400
and the simpler knowing which is um doesn't require much effort

33
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,239
is that we're making effort in the practice we're trying hard and we're leaning maybe a little bit

34
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,640
into the future like what trying to make something happen get something get concentrated or leaning into the future

35
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:39,280
to see can i really see here what's going on another approach is um to to

36
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,959
notice that we're aware and then uh

37
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:51,519
in a kind of way uh just uh wait in the awareness and not wait for

38
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:58,840
something to happen so much and just give time for things to be seen more

39
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:05,680
clearly um not rush off to the next thing but to recognize what's here

40
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,920
recognize that we're aware of what's here and then take a little bit of time to let what's here register more foot more

41
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,840
fully it's kind of like so it stands out more in relief

42
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,880
and so like here i'm sitting in the fog in these rolling hillsides

43
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,720
and you see a little bit of the hills behind me but when the fog is clear then you can see

44
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,560
the higher mountains there and there's more trees and you can see things with greater clarity

45
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,880
the things stand out in relief and then it's possible to take in more and more

46
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,880
perceive more of what's going on but not so much from trying too hard not trying at all

47
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:53,199
but rather lingering and allowing each thing to reveal itself

48
00:04:53,199 --> 00:05:00,000
more fully because we're there for it and it might not be long it's uh we could do

49
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,960
this with the breathing where we're not ahead of ourselves trying to get accomplished something but

50
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,240
more we're being with the breathing so the breathing the different qualities

51
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,560
characteristics of breathing the movement the pressure the release of pressure um

52
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:25,680
is um stands out in highlight in relief

53
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:32,240
so maybe we can try this today and so to assume

54
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:39,039
a appropriate meditation posture for

55
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,520
yourself

56
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,199
and to gently close your eyes

57
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:57,038
and just not trying to do anything more

58
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,520
but to be to notice what stands out in relief for you

59
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,840
as you sit quietly with your eyes closed

60
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:18,319
not thinking about something and realizing you you know forgot to turn off the lights

61
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,680
in the living room or something but what's what's here

62
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:31,520
in your body at this time in your senses if you stay here to relax into

63
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,199
here stands out in highlight

64
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,840
to open this awareness to your body

65
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:57,039
what is revealed what's what stands out in relief

66
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,759
in the range of things you can experience in your body

67
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:27,280
so then in a moment to take a few long slow deep breaths

68
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:34,000
and not searching for anything not probing or analyzing

69
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,800
as you take some deep breaths what aspect of deep breathing

70
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:48,039
is revealed is received in highlight

71
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:20,319
and perhaps the contrast of taking some deep breaths to now

72
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:26,639
going back to breathing in easy way natural way

73
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:33,120
what stands out in contrast or what is highlighted now

74
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,159
not because you're looking for the contrast but it's just how

75
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,240
something else then something else stands out clearly

76
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:06,800
and then often i suggest that you relax at the beginning relax your body

77
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:13,200
for this exercise become aware of any holding or tension

78
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,839
there is in the body don't relax it just know it

79
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:25,600
allow it to stand out in relief allow it to like you're

80
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,600
making time and space to let it

81
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,839
speak to you to let it show itself to you

82
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:51,279
maybe in the face or the shoulders the chest the belly

83
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,880
the hands the arms

84
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,800
as if tension is the language of the body

85
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,639
the body is speaking to you and you listen

86
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:20,560
without relaxing or letting go of it just listen just receive it

87
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,000
let it stand out in relief

88
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:44,480
and gently can you be aware no notice

89
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,519
a little bit what it's like to have an awareness

90
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,720
that is more receptive than active

91
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,720
more allowing things to be seen and known recognized

92
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,759
been searching for something

93
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:11,330
[Music]

94
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,360
and then settling into your body breathing

95
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:24,920
with awareness being more in a receptive mode than a searching mode or a trying mode

96
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:36,079
we receive almost as if you linger with each thing

97
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:41,600
to let it speak to you let it reveal itself to you

98
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:51,079
only because you're available

99
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:00,880
you're not rushing you allow each thing that arises and

100
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,880
occurs

101
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,800
it's it's due it's it's time

102
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,600
so things become known more clearly

103
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:46,319
including the qualities of a mind that's abiding resting in awareness

104
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,560
resting in receptive awareness

105
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,800
as if every breath and all the sensations

106
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,040
is the language of the body that's speaking to you

107
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,639
and all you do is listen

108
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:33,160
all you do is receive sensations

109
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,399
so

110
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:43,680
when you are not receptive and open in awareness

111
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,720
chances are your mind has been activated in thoughts

112
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,639
concerns relax the activation

113
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,839
relax the effort of thinking

114
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:08,480
and relax back into a receptive mode of awareness

115
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,800
trusting the mind's ability

116
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,240
to listen to see to feel

117
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:27,639
experience as it comes and goes in the present

118
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,720
so

119
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,919
so

120
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
so

121
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,400
so

122
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,480
so

123
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,559
do

124
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,720
so

125
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,120
so

126
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,679
so

127
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,679
so

128
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,520
so

129
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,519
whatever yeah

130
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,919
so

131
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,400
oh

132
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,600
so

133
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,799
they're loud

134
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:58,039
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

135
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:09,840
what stands out for you is as beneficial from having sat

136
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:15,760
these minutes here meditated are you a little bit more settled or

137
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:22,960
calm more peaceful are you more self-aware of

138
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,080
aspects of yourself

139
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:35,039
maybe aspects that are difficult or aspects that are helpful

140
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:45,440
are you a little bit more connected to your heart we're inclined to be

141
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:52,559
kind compassionate friendly

142
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:03,760
and if there is any ways that you have benefited from this meditation

143
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:12,520
or if you haven't perhaps you can dedicate

144
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:19,039
any benefits known or unknown from having meditated

145
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:23,200
to the welfare and happiness of others

146
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:31,360
rather than keeping this for yourself it's like you're opening up your mind

147
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,039
your hearts your hands

148
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:45,600
in the wonderful way that says here delightful way just here

you can have it please

150

and it's such a pleasure to release and open up and just

151
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:08,000
give it all away may it be that the benefits from this

152
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,880
practice today

153
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:22,080
may it be for the welfare and happiness of others may all beings be happy

154
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:28,398
may all beings be safe

155

may all beings be peaceful

156
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,840
may all beings be free

157
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:52,639
and again i don't have a bell with me here so i'll bow to you all and that bow can

158
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,360
be the time that we end the meditation

159
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,360
thank you

160
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:20,360
[Music] um

161
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,200
so good morning everyone and

162
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:58,240
so this week uh the topic is the seven factors of awakening

163
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:05,120
and um the mindfulness investigation energy

164
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:10,240

165
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:18,000
so these seven are uh qualities of our inner life

166
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,039
of the mind perhaps that grow and develop

167
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:30,640
as we do mindfulness practice as we do the practices that are the different sick you know exercises

168
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:37,440
that are taught in this text that we've been doing these last weeks and

169
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:44,480
the um and to something to agree these uh uh

170
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:51,440
get awoken seven factors of awakening i think of them as as we become more

171
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,880
awake more present these begin uh to become strong

172
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:02,000
and their ordinary faculties their ordinary states of being

173
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,880
that i like to i like to use the analogy of waking up from a very nice afternoon

174
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,880
nap where maybe there's uh the sunlight is streaming into the room

175
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:21,919
and um and it's and waking up content happy relaxed and

176
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:28,320
the mind is kind of clear and we might lay still in our back and the eyes open

177
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:34,240
and nothing needs to be done nothing we have to figure out or do and

178
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:41,120
just continually just laying there maybe looking at the ceiling or looking at the light is streaming

179
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:46,640
through the windows and there's dust particles in the air just kind of watching the dust particles or looking

180
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:54,080
at the texture of the ceiling or something and uh things are seen clearly

181
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:59,120
not because we're looking intently intensively but because we're not

182
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,880
preoccupied by other things and we're just there in a simple way ordinary way and

183
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,320
and uh awareness is present and uh just as present it's aware we're

184
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,599
not it isn't like we're trying to be aware we're just that in the wakefulness after

185
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:23,839
a nap we're just aware and there's a clarity to the awareness where we can see and look at

186
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:30,480
the details in the room the details of the particular texture of the ceiling or the dust in

187
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:38,320
the air or something and uh there's a kind of uh delightful energy uh that's not driving energy not

188
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:44,878
trying but it's we're certainly not um um about to fall back to sleep or

189
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:50,158
uh it's just kind of there's a a clarity in the energy that's just there

190
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:56,079
to do this wonderful gazing around the room in this after nap revelry

191
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:02,560
and it might feel kind of joyful to do it maybe joy is too strong

192
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:07,599
a post-snap experience but maybe it's a

193
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:13,359
sense of well-being and just being there and content and cozy and

194
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:19,359
there's a level of tranquility work there's a calmness there's a kind of feel tranquil and

195
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:26,160
feel almost like the body feels like it doesn't have to do anything it's just there and and um and maybe there's even some

196
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:31,760
degree of concentration present we're studying the dancing dust in the sunlight

197
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:39,040
and uh we're just kind of absorbed in that and that absorbed in in the dust and the dance is the concentration

198
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,720
and then there's equanimity like right now um all kinds of things can happen that

199
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:52,320
normally we would be concerned with but we don't care it's just like the mind doesn't knows it but it's not so concerned about it

200
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,359
and um maybe the there's some messiness in the room and

201
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:04,160
just be messiness is not something to be concerned about just more something to marvel at just seeing and

202
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:10,320
being with it so

203
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:16,160
if the seven factors awakening as as we settle into this practice

204
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:21,280
uh they become stronger and stronger and uh the second one is called usually

205
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:27,359
in english is called investigation the pali term the ancient buddhist term

206
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:32,880
that's translated as investigation is a differentiation

207
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:42,160
of dharmas so it involves a differentiation of things a distinguishing of things and

208
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:49,280
and i think of it as it as how we begin to distinguish things as there becomes more and more clarity

209
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,960
so those of you who are here from the beginning today you see that the fog is beginning to

210
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,000
clear the sun is coming out and now there's more details to be seen

211
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,800
in the hillside behind me and uh you see even see the faint outline of the higher mountain behind

212
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:12,320
the first hill and and so

213
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:19,200
as there's more as the fog clears and the light appears the eyes without studying and working

214
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,560
too much at it just notices more details and can distinguish right now i can

215
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,760
distinguish um there's a row of trees uh behind me

216
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:35,280
and i can start distinguishing uh different trees from each other and it just kind of i don't have to work at it

217
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,960
it's just obvious they're different colors and shapes a little bit and um

218
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:46,000
but before when it was so foggy it just i had a sense there was trees there but it was just a

219
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,760
row that i couldn't distinguish anything between the trees

220
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:58,079
so it might not seem like an important thing to be able to distinguish things from each other

221
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:04,480
but this is what comes with greater and greater clarity and and this word dharma

222
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,240
that we're distinguishing can mean different things um and i'll say what that is in a moment

223
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:17,040
but i just want to emphasize that it's this capacity to distinguish things to see things in their clarity

224
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:23,680
in and of themselves distinct from other things that begins to uh free the mind

225
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:29,119
uh from the fog of attachment the the mist of clinging and wanting and

226
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:35,760
aversion and preoccupations we have and um you know how many times have you or have

227
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:42,240
i met someone i've known from before and i carried with me

228
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:47,520
the ideas of who they were the past experience of them

229
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:54,240
and and in fact they had changed they were different today and it took a while to realize that

230
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:01,520
because i was living in the fog of my memory of them that i was little bit living projecting on them or seeing them

231
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:06,800
seeing seeing them and to not have bring with me the past

232
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:12,960
and be able to see something clearly for itself in the present a person a friend

233
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:18,960
then we have a chance to distinguish what's unique and what's really happening in this moment with them as

234
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:26,559
opposed to uh you know missing it because we're still living a little bit in the past information

235
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:32,480
so uh part of the distinguishing is to distinguish um

236
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:39,760
what we perceive uh one perception from another if you if you you're if you have a dim

237
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:47,040
morning light without the light on in the room you can't distinguish very much you kind of know maybe you see rough objects but

238
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:52,320
you don't see the details of the objects turn on the light and then without any

239
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:59,839
work on the part of the mind you see all these details um you know i if i take off my glasses

240
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:05,760
and look in certain distances it's all blurry but if i put on my glasses it's all

241
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:12,880
clear without having to work and now it's seeing the details so the same way as mindfulness gets

242
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:19,599
clearer and clearer more subtle to present moment awareness the details stand out

243
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:24,960
and as the details become clearer and clearer one of the one of the what we distinguish

244
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,640
is the difference between our ideas of an object of the effect of what we're

245
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:37,520
perceiving and how the the process of the perception the ways in which things are actually

246
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,560
impermanent arising and passing and constant and

247
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:50,400
and so the river of perceptions that flow through us in this relaxed open receptive mind

248
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,920
breaks up the solidity that is always going to be there with clinging we hold on to things or want

249
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:01,280
things to be a certain way or push them away because they are a certain way we don't like

250
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:09,520
and so beginning to distinguish the uh differentiate the process of change

251
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:15,280
that's constantly going on from the ideations of of constancy or

252
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:21,520
fixity or ideas we overlay on top of things the other part of this differentiation

253
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:28,000
of dharmas is dharma can also mean action activities and so we start seeing

254
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:34,400
that how we practice influences the practice itself so if

255
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:40,800
we're striving and pushing that we feel the tension of that the more clear we become the more

256
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,079
receptive we are in the present moment we become clear that

257
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:51,440
striving pushing actually hinders the clarity gets in the

258
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,720
way of the practice and we see that there's a better consequence if we don't strive if we

259
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:03,040
relax and open up if we spend a lot of time analyzing or judging after a while it becomes we

260
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:09,920
differentiate we see clearly oh when i'm when i'm mindful i've confused

261
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:16,000
thinking with mindfulness and i thought that if i spent a lot of time thinking judging my experience that

262
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,040
i was present for it but there's an in fact there's another way of being present without the

263
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:28,079
judgments without the thinking about things so much in elaborate ways

264
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:33,760
and so we're distinguishing how we're practicing and this starting to discover ways that

265
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:39,280
are more conducive for uh for peace for letting for relaxation

266
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,480
for calm for openness for clarity

267
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:50,960
in that dharma also means action we also begin more and more aware of the consequences of our actions in our daily

268
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:56,160
life and sometimes we start seeing that if i live

269
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:03,359
with dishonesty with not not breaking the precepts that that has a very deleterious effect

270
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:08,400
on me if i um and that consequence is not good i feel

271
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:14,000
the after effect of it and seeing the after effect the consequences that are not so

272
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,280
desirable helps us to uh clean up our life and live a better way

273
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:24,319
not so much because it's a moral thing to do not but rather because we see

274
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:30,160
clearly it's beneficial and we distinguish better and better of what is

275
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:37,920
beneficial and what is not and as the dharma practice deepens and unfolds with people get more and more

276
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:45,039
refined or more and more subtle or

277
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:50,720
clear about what is beneficial and what is not it's not a judgment it's not a moral

278
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:55,920
thing it's not like a statement about our our personal worth it just means as

279
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:01,839
a matter of fact you take your your hand off the hot stove uh you

280
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:06,960
don't begin uh gossiping about someone because it just feels like you take your

281
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:15,200
hand off the hot stove that doesn't feel good to gossip or demean someone or something

282
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:21,040
so this differentiation of dharmas so the word in when we translate it as

283
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:28,000
an investigation some people think they have to probe and peer deeply and kind of

284
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,599
analyze or figure out what's going on it's not that way it's more like we say

285
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:40,240
the question what is this and then we allow it to to reveal itself

286
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:45,280
to us there's almost like a little thing lingering an awareness that gives a

287
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:51,359
little time for every experience to show itself a little bit better to us oh that's how it is

288
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:57,599
so the perceptions can be clear perceptions can take in more fully what's happening

289
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:04,720
and so investigation is that that receptivity of the mind that takes in

290
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:10,079
everything with greater clarity so and in the clarity things become

291
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:16,240
distinguished become differentiated and then we're on the path to wisdom

292
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:21,440
when we start seeing with greater and greater clarity so you might as you go about your day

293
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:28,240
today experiment with this and that is i find times during the day

294
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:34,400
where you're not rushing on to the next thing the next thought but rather take some time when

295
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:39,440
to just stay there stay and just kind of take in the experience of the moment

296
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:47,119
and as if you're going to discover something new so even something you do every day

297
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:54,400
maybe take some time to just stand there or sit there with it and say just look around and relax like see what can you

298
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:59,520
see that's new is there anything new here that you never noticed before

299
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:05,359
stand in your kitchen and just look around the kitchen and let it reveal itself to you and see

300
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:11,200
if you can find something new that ability to see something new

301
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:18,880
in a relaxed way utilizes this differentiation of the dharmas the second factor of awakening

302
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,920
and as you do that that investigation that differentiation

303
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:29,838
see if you can notice how your mind is

304
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:35,839
and see if you can have a beneficial mind state as you receptively feel and look

305
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:43,119
and perceive around you to discover some what's something new that you've never noticed

306
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:48,560
so thank you and [Music] and as i'm talking i see that it's

307
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:53,680
getting a little more and more clear behind me and

308
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:59,280
it's a wonderful fresh air and the birds and the different the workers came i don't

309
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:04,480
know if you could hear them to begin their morning work then some kind of a

310
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:11,440
