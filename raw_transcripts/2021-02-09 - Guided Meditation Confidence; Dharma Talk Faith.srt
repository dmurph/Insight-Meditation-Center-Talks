1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:07,919
good evening or maybe it's not evening where you are

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:17,920
good morning good afternoon a warm welcome

3
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:30,480
so as usual i'll begin with a guided meditation

4
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,480
so allowing ourselves to

5
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:45,840
take our meditation seat our meditation posture

6
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:59,840
and just arriving here in this moment in this location

7
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,680
for now there's nowhere else to be and

8
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:26,640
nothing else to do except to be here

9
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:41,840
with this experience of beginning a meditation session

10
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:56,399
so feeling the the body the pressure of the chair

11
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:09,840
cushion bench bed couch whatever it might be against the body

12
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,599
and then noticing that the body is breathing

13
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,840
of course it's breathing

14
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,840
noticing the in-breaths

15
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:11,280
the stretching the pulling the expansion of the chest area perhaps

16
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:19,840
or the belly

17
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:33,840
and noticing the out breaths the exhales

18
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:12,239
what does it feel like to have an exhale

19
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:29,840
just in a gentle relaxed manner

20
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:57,840
and noticing the transitions between the inhales and the exhales

21
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:40,639
nothing in particular needs to be happening

22
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:53,840
just resting the attention on the sensations of breathing

23
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:56,160
and when the mind wanders we don't have to make it be a problem

24
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:03,840
we just very simply gently begin again

25
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:54,479
we're practicing with a sense of warmth and openness

26
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:03,039
not a tight constricted striving kind of way

27
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,840
but with ease and

28
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,840
sincerity

29
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:54,800
and then we might notice that there is a compelling

30
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,160
bodily sensation

31
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,560
we can let go of the breath so to speak

32
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:15,680
and invite in this compelling bodily sensation

33
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:26,800
this to this too can be incorporated folded into

34
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:37,839
our meditation practice

35
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,000
and when it's no longer compelling

36
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:19,839
just very simply return to the breath

37
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:47,040
there is something that occurs when we turn towards

38
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:54,399
a compelling or difficult or uncomfortable sensation

39
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:03,279
and are able to be with it even if it is just for a fraction of a second

40
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:12,240
but rather than reflexively jumping away

41
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:20,320
but to recognize yes this is uncomfortable this is compelling

42
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:32,560
to turn towards and invite in instead of push away

43
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:43,839
there's a type of confidence that grows

44
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,600
as we recognize yes i can be with some difficult

45
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,399
uncomfortable

46
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,839
sensations

47
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:41,120
this confidence grows as we recognize our capacity

48
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,240
to be with difficulties is increasing

49
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,720
maybe only by a small amount

50
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:07,839
that's okay

51
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,000
maybe our confidence also grows

52
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:50,240
as we recognize that we can direct the mind a little bit

53
00:13:50,240 --> 00:14:00,399
we can turn toward things towards the breath towards a bodily

54
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,839
sensation

55
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,920
our capacity for directing or inclining the mind

56
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:17,839
is increasing

57
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:24,320
sometimes it's helpful to just recognize acknowledge

58
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:34,079
our confidence is just naturally shifting the more we practice

59
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:45,920
shifting to be a little bit bigger

60
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:55,839
a little bit steadier

61
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:33,600
and as we practice we have more and more experiences

62
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:41,840
some of them have been uncomfortable

63
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:55,840
and then recognizing okay i can be uncomfortable

64
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:08,320
i don't have to make it more difficult than it is

65
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:16,000
and as our confidence increases there are less things that we have to

66
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,000
avoid shy away from

67
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:29,120
less people i need to avoid and shy away from

68
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:38,640
and with this confidence allows us to

69
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:48,240
maybe be the one that's steady when others are feeling out of balance

70
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:55,600
unsteady perhaps we increase our capacity that we

71
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,360
can support and comfort others

72
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:08,000
just by noticing that our capacity is increasing

73
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:15,919
every time that there's a difficult uncomfortable moment in our meditation and

74
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:24,320
we're able to however slightly however short of a time we're able to just be

75
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:29,440
with it be with it and in this way

76
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:37,919
our meditation can be a support not only for us but for others

77
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,720
and can ripple out from us to others

78
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:51,679
so that our practice can be for the benefit of all beings

79
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,440
[Music]

80
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,840
everywhere

81
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:50,399
good evening again good morning good afternoon whenever it is you're

82
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:56,799
listening and a warm welcome

83
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:03,919
so today i'd like to talk about a topic is something that um maybe for some of us

84
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:09,760
isn't our favorite topic let's say this i know it certainly wasn't my favorite topic

85
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:17,039
before i actually kind of shied away and felt uncomfortable with it and

86
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:23,279
maybe even a little bit angry about it in some kind of way

87
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:30,000
and that is to maybe build a little bit on with this on the guided meditation this idea of

88
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:37,679
confidence that comes as we the more we practice it grows and really can be a support for us

89
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,720
but that's not what was making me angry or people shy away from

90
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:48,640
but sometimes the word faith is used rather than the word confidence

91
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:54,559
sometimes we might also use the word trust or conviction

92
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:03,440
but i thought i would unpack this a little bit for us and explore and examine and tease apart

93
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:10,320
some of these different parts or these different elements of faith

94
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,639
trust confidence conviction

95
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,200
and specifically to say that the topic of faith can be difficult for some people because

96
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:28,480
it's associated with mindless belief perhaps with this idea that we

97
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:36,158
have to proclaim allegiance to a particular doctrine or creed or something

98
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:42,720
and not only do we have to proclaim an allegiance but then we will be judged by this

99
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:50,000
judge ourselves or maybe we're judged by others by one's degree of

100
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,878
compliance or one's degree of belief or something like this

101
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:05,280
so when we use faith in a buddhist context it's very different from this very different

102
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,320
but it's natural of course that we might have some different associations with

103
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:17,838
this word with the whole concept the whole idea of faith

104
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,800
but faith is a part of buddhist practice it's just not this kind of faith where that's we have

105
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:30,720
to pledge an allegiance to a doctrine or something like that

106
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:36,640
but um maybe i'll start with this little a quote of bef that the buddha

107
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:43,119
gave before he was a buddha so he talks about faith here but clearly

108
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:48,160
it can't be faith in buddhism or faith in

109
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:55,920
him or something like this because he's not a buddha yet when he's saying this and

110
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:02,480
where it's in the context of the commenting how the buddha wished

111
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:08,320
everyone a better life he wanted people to have a good life

112
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:15,359
and it was summarized in this verse faith morality learning intelligence

113
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:24,320
restraint and justice much good else wealth possessions partners and children

114
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:31,760
flocks kin friends colleagues health beauty and happiness

115
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:38,480
these things he wished for others that they might keep and never lose

116
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:45,680
so faith is here at this beginning of this long list of all these desirable things that

117
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:51,359
people might have in their life and he was wishing that everyone might have this

118
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:57,359
so clearly faith here isn't um isn't maybe what we're thinking it might

119
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:03,520
be instead it's uh goes with the possessions partners and children

120
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:10,400
and health beauty and happiness so what what is faith and the way that

121
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:16,240
it's here and how might we consider it in the buddhist practice

122
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,680
well i'd like to suggest that uh faith has different aspects maybe you won't be

123
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:27,200
surprised to hear that and we can consider some of these different aspects

124
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:33,839
in one aspect is that it has a relational practical

125
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:40,640
cognitive value to it that is it provides motivation to do

126
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:48,560
something that it's underlying like activity or action it's like a readiness to do something

127
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:54,400
with the belief with the confidence that this thing that you're going to do

128
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:01,119
will lead to um go in a particular direction that you'd like to go

129
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:09,680
so one aspect of faith is kind of a mobilizing force it's a way to

130
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:15,440
stir up the energy maybe to do something because you have a belief

131
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:22,320
that what you're about to do will be supportive for you in your practice

132
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:31,520
and we can see that in in one particular quote from the dhammapada

133
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:38,320
where faith is associated with diligence and it's uh um

134
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:44,400
it's contrasted with laziness and sluggishness

135
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:52,079
so this um two little verses here in the dhammapada says whoever lives focused on the

136
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:58,320
pleasant senses unguarded and moderate with food lazy and sluggish

137
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:05,040
will be overpowered by mara as a weak tree is bent in the wind so overpowered by

138
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:11,920
mara mara we can understand is this personification of things that get in

139
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:18,800
the way of awakening so being focused on the pleasant senses

140
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:25,599
unguarded and moderate with food lazy and sluggish these are help or help create the

141
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:33,440
conditions in which things will hinder will be an obstacle to greater freedom and then the

142
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:40,880
next verse says the opposite whoever lives focused on the unpleasant

143
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:47,680
so we're not saying that we have to focus on the unpleasant all the time it's just uh countering focused on the

144
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:54,640
pleasant so it's this recognition that there's pleasant and unpleasant and neutral in our

145
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:00,320
experience but sometimes we're always only focused on the pleasant

146
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:08,839
whoever lives focused on the unpleasant senses guarded that means to not always

147
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:14,560
be if we know that it's the equivalent of

148
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:20,319
if you know you don't want to eat a lot of cookies not going down the cookie aisle in the grocery store

149
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:26,480
if you know that you really need to sleep more it's not starting that movie at

150
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,520
a midnight that you're going to watch or something like this

151
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:38,880
whoever lives focused on the unpleasant senses guarded moderate with food faithful

152
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:46,160
and diligent will not be overpowered overpowered by mara as a stone mountain

153
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:52,640
is unmoved by the wind so in this verse faithful and diligent

154
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:58,720
counters in the earlier verse lazy and sluggish so it's this way in which we can

155
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:04,839
consider faith as a way that provides some motivation some

156
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:10,960
inspiration to act to do something it's a

157
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,800
it's maybe it's a um aligned maybe with an inspiration has a

158
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:25,200
heartfeltness so it's not just an action because um we feel like we have to do

159
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:31,839
something to make something unpleasant go away but it's more of a feeling like yeah

160
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:37,520
this this is the direction to go this is the direction for greater freedom greater peace

161
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:44,800
greater well-being so the practical volitional

162
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:51,599
cognitive aspect of faith and then another aspect of faith might

163
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:57,520
be this heartfelt this emotional affective aspect of faith

164
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:07,039
that is maybe this feeling of reverence devotion love esteem

165
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:13,599
this more of a heartfelt this um

166
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:21,040
yeah what is how what is a way to describe devotion but not devotion with

167
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:28,000
a sense of zealots or um or that's blinded or something like this

168
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,280
but with a real commitment maybe a warm commitment something like this

169
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:38,960
maybe this feelings of confidence that's coupled with an attitude of devotion and

170
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,560
commitment and it's maybe this is like we can think

171
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:50,160
of a belief in something so this

172
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:58,480
heartfelt confidence a warmth a warm confidence

173
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:05,280
and we can find um a short little verse that also talks about this

174
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:11,119
aspect of faith and this verse takes place in the

175
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:17,040
context there's a number of brahmins so these are non-buddhist they aren't the followers of the buddha

176
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:22,880
instead they're priests of the dominant religion at the time

177
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:29,680
and they go to the buddha and they ask him questions and after the buddha answered all their questions they

178
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:36,079
were so inspired and touched by what the buddha had to say that they became his followers

179
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:42,160
and one of the brahmanas pingia he returned from after seeing the buddha

180
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:47,440
and he told some of the other brahmanas how wonderful the buddha is and one of

181
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:54,240
these other brahmins said to him but why don't you spend all your time your

182
00:43:54,240 --> 00:44:01,680
every moment with this person gotama gautama's clan name of the buddha

183
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:08,720
and pingia responds this way my faith joy mind

184
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:15,599
and mindfulness do not go away from the teaching of gotama whatever direction the one of great

185
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:21,599
wisdom goes to there is the place i incline

186
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:28,319
so pointing to how his heart and his mind are in inclined towards this direction of

187
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:34,400
the buddha even though he's not there all the time with him like physically there but

188
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:41,838
as this connection this commitment we might say this word devotion

189
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:48,319
so that's another aspect of faith it's not a devotion that asks us to

190
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:55,680
get rid of our intellect or our rational thinking or unre reasonableness it's not a devotion

191
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:03,040
that asks us to give up our autonomy but it's a warm

192
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:09,760
hearted commitment that's born out of a recognition that there's

193
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:16,240
something special here something that's worthwhile

194
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:22,240
and then how do we know that or how do we tune into that is maybe the third aspect of faith

195
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:28,800
which is more the intellectual cognitive mental aspect of faith

196
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:35,599
and this way we might define faith as provisional knowledge that is

197
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:41,119
we have this belief that so maybe it's not so much belief in but belief

198
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:48,000
that it makes like this belief that this is true it makes sense to me it's consistent

199
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:55,440
with my experience it's consistent with my understanding but i don't know it first hand myself

200
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:01,520
right now so it's a kind of provisional knowledge a provisional

201
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:09,760
understanding that implies a willingness to accept on trust

202
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:16,240
certain teaching certain propositions that we can't experience for ourselves

203
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:24,000
directly at this time or we haven't yet so this willingness to accept on trust

204
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:30,400
so it might lack adequate it might lack adequate evidence at this time

205
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:37,119
but it isn't irrational it's not necessarily inconsistent with

206
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:42,880
our experience we could see how perhaps there could be experience that

207
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:50,079
leads that direction and through practice we

208
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:56,800
a big part of practice is where we make this transition from belief into knowledge maybe you had this

209
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:03,359
certain belief that meditation practice would be helpful and would be a support and

210
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:09,520
use initiated started meditation practice through some before you had the first

211
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:16,800
experience there was something that supported you encouraged you

212
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:22,079
and then you did some meditation practice and and said yes there is something here

213
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:27,520
that's valuable and continued so maybe your confidence

214
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:34,400
in the practice grew maybe your trust and the confidence grew

215
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:41,760
so there's three different aspects of faith one is you could use this word practical

216
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:49,040
but it's kind of supports action the second one is an emotional maybe a

217
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:55,440
heartfelt commitment or confidence the third is intellectual like a

218
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:01,359
provisional knowledge a belief that something seems reasonable but i don't have direct

219
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:07,599
experience yet and when we think about it in fact there's so many things that we have this

220
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:14,400
provisional knowledge for right black holes for example like okay

221
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:21,119
it seems consistent that there might be this place and space where gravity pulls so

222
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:29,040
much that light can't escape but you know i i'm not a physicist i

223
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:35,040
don't know this for myself but i'm trusting that uh those people that are talking about it

224
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:42,079
know what they're talking about seems consistent with what i do understand about physics

225
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:48,319
so there's so many things like this right that we have this i'm using this expression

226
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:54,079
provisional knowledge but there's a little bit of trust we have trust or or this confidence that what

227
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:59,440
they're saying makes sense even though we don't have this direct experience

228
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:07,359
so i've been describing a little bit of some of these aspects about faith but another way that we can unpack

229
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:13,280
or examine or look at faith is well what function do we see it playing in

230
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:21,520
buddhist practice what role does it do how do people use it how is it supportive

231
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:28,559
rather than just describing what it is how is it show up in people's lives how does it

232
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:35,280
affect people so there's one way it's a little bit

233
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:40,640
about in the guide meditation is this recognition that this

234
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:47,520
confidence that we can gain through having more and more experiences

235
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:55,440
can provide encouragement inspiration dedication and not in a zealous way

236
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:01,599
not in an overt exaggerated way but in a way that helps us to feel a

237
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:06,800
certain amount of reassurance or a certain amount of contentment

238
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:12,000
yeah this is this makes sense to me this is a direction i want to go

239
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:19,040
my my heart is in here too it's not just my mind but my heart

240
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:25,440
so one way that faith shows up in the buddhist teachings is in a number

241
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:32,640
of lists some people are like oh no please not the lists

242
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:38,240
i'm one of those people i like the lists i kind of enjoy them

243
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:44,400
but one thing that i'll point out i'll share a few

244
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:50,880
uh lists uh with us and one of maybe is the obvious one is

245
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:57,040
um i did a list of the five faculties and of course faith is the first element

246
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:03,520
in that list faith energy mindfulness concentration and wisdom

247
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:09,599
you'll notice that faith is first and wisdom is last

248
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:16,800
so there's maybe two things i'd like to point out here faith is not standing by itself

249
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:23,359
it's with four other elements so when the buddha talks about to

250
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:28,640
cultivate and develop the faculties he doesn't say

251
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:36,640
cultivate and develop faith by itself it's with these other qualities

252
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:42,000
and in the beginning of this talk i give this long list of things that the buddha was wishing

253
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:49,119
for other people and faith was part of a collection of positive things

254
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:56,000
and that's the case this is how faith always shows up is part of a group of practices or

255
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:04,400
qualities or things that can be cultivated or developed it does not show up by itself

256
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:11,200
and very often i think actually every time it's the first element in the list

257
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:17,760
which suggests that it's a starting place so faith is not the end it's not the

258
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:24,240
goal of practice it's a support and it's a place to begin for our

259
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:29,520
practice so i'd like to introduce you to

260
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:36,240
some maybe some other lists that talk about faith the five

261
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:42,720
factors that support meditation it's also called the five factors for

262
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:47,920
exertion sometimes these get translated

263
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:55,040
these two different ways the first element is faith the second

264
00:52:55,040 --> 00:53:02,480
element is health that's defined as being seldom ill or afflicted and having an

265
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:10,480
even digestion so faith health honesty honesty here is defined

266
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:15,760
as revealing themselves as they really are to their teachers and fellow

267
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:20,800
practitioners so really honestly knowing oneself

268
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:27,920
and being able to share that with others who are wanting to support you in your practice

269
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:32,960
so faith health honesty for this energy

270
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:39,920
we um are familiar with this it's a in a applying um

271
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:46,720
a little bit of effort towards abandoning those things that are unwholesome and cultivating those things that are wholesome

272
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:52,079
so a certain also maybe a steadfastness or perseverance

273
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:58,559
and then wisdom so here we are again wisdom is the last one and faith is the

274
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:05,839
first these five factors that support meditation

275
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:13,599
and faith is one of these elements and then here's another list don't worry

276
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:19,760
this the whole talk is not going to be just filled with list after list but i wanted to share one more is that

277
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:25,359
five qualities that allow a person to live happily

278
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:32,318
we all want to live happily and if those of us who have meditation practice we want to

279
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:38,000
have supports for meditation so five qualities that allow a person to live

280
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,839
happily it says in the sutta if a person has

281
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:51,040
certain qualities they will live happily without distress anguish or fever

282
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:56,799
i think they of course don't mean fever literally it's more metaphorically without getting agitated

283
00:54:56,799 --> 00:55:03,920
and upset about things okay so what are these five qualities

284
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:11,680
faith is first conscientiousness prudence and then here's energy and

285
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:19,920
wisdom so this list these um

286
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:25,200
what i'd like to point out here is that faith is just a support for our practice

287
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:33,280
as different elements it's not the purpose of practice it's not instead of practice but instead it's a

288
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:40,000
way to help us find our way with um cultivating wholesome qualities

289
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:45,760
and abandoning unwholesome qualities our way with allowing

290
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:52,960
wisdom to rise and then maybe the last way

291
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:59,200
that i'll look at faith here so first we talked about there's these different aspects and then we talked about well what function

292
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:06,400
does it have and it functions with other qualities to be a support for our lives

293
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:14,400
and then we might ask well is it ever actually flat out defined anywhere and the question would

294
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:20,880
with the answer would be yes sometimes faith is defined

295
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:28,480
as a person is a person of faith a person of faith

296
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:35,839
is one who places faith in the enlightenment of the tatakita

297
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:42,799
places faith in the enlightenment of the tatakata

298
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:49,280
many of you know tattoogata is how the buddha speaks of himself this is faith in the boot and the

299
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:55,359
enlightenment of the buddha there's two different ways we can understand this

300
00:56:55,359 --> 00:57:01,520
one that enlightenment is possible the enlightenment did happen

301
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:08,400
for gautama and made him to be the buddha or

302
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:14,640
we might have faith in the buddha's

303
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:21,280
enlightenment that what he is teaching is comes from a place of

304
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:26,960
awakening a place without greed without hatred and without delusion

305
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:32,720
so this faith that enlightenment exists or maybe faith in the buddha as a

306
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:38,079
teacher maybe each of us gets to find our own

307
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:44,720
way with us and maybe it changes at different stages in our practice or

308
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:51,599
different circumstances but i like to think about this sometimes

309
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:59,520
that how both are true the paulie supports interpreting it either way

310
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:08,319
faith that enlightenment exists and faith in the buddha as a teacher

311
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:16,160
this can be a support for us maybe it's some provisional knowledge maybe we see there's

312
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:24,559
it makes sense we can see how we have more and more freedom and ease with the more we practice maybe there's

313
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:29,599
some emotion some heartfeltness a commitment to

314
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:35,359
the buddha and his teachings maybe when we take refuge in the buddha dharma and sangha there's a

315
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:41,280
heartfeltness and maybe faith that enlightenment is

316
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:48,839
possible or even in the buddhist teachings supports us helps us to continue with meditation

317
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:55,279
practice continue with uh listening to dharma talks

318
00:58:56,240 --> 00:59:02,960
so in this way faith i'll have to say maybe this is one thing that i love about

319
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:08,720
kind of studying and practicing together is there such a depth here there's so

320
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:13,839
many different ways or like a richness

321
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:20,000
it feels um a certain like juiciness if i'm allowed

322
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:28,000
to use that kind of language you know like an aliveness faith it's we're invited to explore

323
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:34,400
and examine and investigate these three different aspects of it how

324
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:41,040
faith might work with other qualities other factors to support awakening support our meditation

325
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:46,480
practice and to support living happily

326
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:54,160
and may our faith be a support for us so that we can be a support for others

327
00:59:54,160 --> 01:00:01,520
of course we're not just practicing for ourselves but for others so that we might make our

328
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:08,640
communities and those we come in contact with a place where people can bring their

329
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:15,839
best versions of themselves so thank you
