year um yeah maybe I'll speak a little bit about that before we transition into our

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,560
practice so so yes in some ways it's you know every moment every every mind

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:35,399
moment every moment it's a continuation and yet there is a goodness there is a

6
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:41,280
value um who to Transitions actually

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,559
um psychologists uh studies tell us that

8
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,320
when there is a transition when there is actually the new year or even a new

9
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,539
month or even at the beginning of a week or Monday for example they're they're

10
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:04,378
very psychological effects that we can take advantage of we can take advantage of there's a sense of a fresh start

11
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,540
there's a sense of a fresh start even though yes we all know that every moment

12
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,600
really can be a fresh start and instead of

13
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,700
self-flagellating and and beating ourselves up for say having been X Y and

14
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,220
Z or not having been X Y and Z we can just begin again at this moment a fresh

15
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:34,320
start in this beginning every moment um the New Year's Day every moment fresh as

16
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,320

17
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:47,100
beauty in this in this um convention that uh yeah the year changes

18
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,799

19
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,840
psychological because we're yes we're all we're uh Spiritual Beings we're

20
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:06,560
Divine beings and we're also psychological beings and these were not immune uh us us dear lovely fragile

21
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,540
strong human beings were not immune to the psychological effects so let's take

22
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:19,200
advantage let's take advantage of of this this Fresh Start effect this

23
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,420

24
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:32,760
the idea of the Fresh Start yes and still the first week of January and today is the first Friday of course if

25
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:40,500
you're in a time zone like Mario Christine in Australia it's already Saturday but uh but uh for those who are

26
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:46,200

31
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:17,000
to be kind to others and didn't quite happen but it's okay it's a

32
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,980
what does a fresh start require in each it

33
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:34,200
well many things but one thing that it does require is mindfulness is awareness

34
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:40,560
a fresh start as a support for meta requires mindfulness it requires

35
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:47,220
awareness it requires connecting with intention of course for a fresh

36
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:54,120
start but more than anything else it requires awareness mindfulness in in

37

are welcome Graham thanks for joining us on YouTube

175
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:50,040
um Jerry says easy to start but it got more difficult at the end with distractions

176
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:57,000
okay no problem nothing is a problem get to know the mind but

177
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:03,660
that is getting attracted to distractions what is Juicy about it

178
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:08,700
Laura asks I was struggling with sleepiness how do you recommend dealing

179
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:15,839
with that what is the advantage to continuing to meditate as opposed to just going to bed

180
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:22,079
ah okay good question good foundational question Laura

181
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:28,820
um well it really depends um what the source of the sleepiness is

182
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:35,640
if you are tired if if you have sleep

183
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:42,119
um if you have lack of sleep sleep deprivation Etc then yeah maybe actually

184
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:50,040
taking a nap is is the wisest thing to do however a lot of times actually

185
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:55,579
um sleepiness is not just

186
00:39:55,579 --> 00:40:01,440
being sleep deprived Etc sometimes it's masking something else

187
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,960
it's masking agitation sometimes when you're agitated or even remorse or even

188
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:12,180
sadness or a lot of different hosts of of um

189
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:18,720
emotions and mind states that can actually be masked with what's called

190
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:25,560
sloth and torper it's one of the five hindrances in in Buddhism and practice

191
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:31,020
so then then just actually going to bed is is not helpful just taking a nap is

192
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:37,859
not helpful learning how to skillfully work with it and recognize it is more uh

193
00:40:37,859 --> 00:40:45,480
is is wiser um so you have to recognize actually what is happening and

194
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:52,020
um they're in in a list of recommendations from the Buddhist

195
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:58,980
teachings their long list of things suggested you know there's there is uh I'm going to bed taking a nap is the

196
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:05,579
last one first is you know you can actually open your eyes a little bit with a little bit of light in not that

197
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:13,980
you're staring at it and you're just letting your eyes open up a little bit foreign and you can open up your eyes

198
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:19,200
just a little bit or you can stand up you can do standing meditation uh that

199
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,599
brings in energy you can have some not at night I don't recommend this but if

200
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:30,720
it's during the day and you're meditating and you're sleeping you can have some green tea you can go for a

201
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:36,540
walk fast walk bring up the energy many many different things one can do

202
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:42,960
one can actually just can just just sit up a little straighter than that actually just a little bit of shift in

203
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,980
the posture can bring up more energy there are a lot of things we can do and then the last thing on the list of

204
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:55,020
recommendations from the Canon as well picking up if nothing is worth then take a nap so

205
00:41:55,020 --> 00:42:02,040
foreign let's see a few other gosh let's lots of

206
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:08,280
things are coming in um yeah thank you for the message that new

207
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:14,160
beginnings are always available even when going through a huge live transition yes

208
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:21,240
another person asked is that why you say not to drink caffeine before sitting in the morning uh

209
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:26,339
uh well I don't think I've said that but

210
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:32,760
um are you saying in general you've heard that don't drink caffeine before sitting in the morning

211
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:38,099
um it's it's [Music] um

212
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:46,020
basically no excuse me this is a longer uh

213
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:51,660
you know longer treaties longer longer conversation about caffeine can caffeine

214
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:57,300
tends to agitate the mind and I've had many people who've gone along Retreats who

215
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:03,180
've been drinking lots and lots of coffee on retreat they they're still used to it but they try to reduce their

216
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:10,020
coffee and then they realize wow when they drink coffee their mind is so agitated just a very very different

217
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:16,880
state of mind [Music] um

218
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:25,980
let's see I thought I heard you say that once I asked another I'll ask another time I

219
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:31,440
don't remember saying that but but in general the as I shared the uh the uh

220
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:36,720
caffeine can agitate the mind in this way in general and and yet so many of

221
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:44,579
and and to say actually sometimes a little bit of caffeine like with green tea can be skillful just a little bit

222
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:51,599
but but I've discovered and also other practitioners have discovered that strong coffee can agitate their mind a

223
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:59,339
little too much on the body too and see for yourself be a scientist of your own mind don't take any of these

224
00:43:59,339 --> 00:44:07,260
um and face value um and YouTube couple of comments thank you

225

226
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:19,260
person grabs a standing meditation helps me be more energized yes great fantastic I love standing meditation and walking

227

228
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:31,020

229
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:36,060
that I've been feeling Despair and having many realistic thoughts this

230
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:42,480
practice today gave me moments of feeling that maybe I don't have to answer any questions about what the

231
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:48,540
point of it all is but maybe the questions of meaning itself is almost

232
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:57,420
absurd within the ceaseless flow of life as it simply is moment to moment I felt

233

relief thank you um thank you for sharing that insight and

246
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:34,800

247
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:39,900

248
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:46,680

249
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:54,300
be actually be more quiet time to get together in small groups and not so much talking so much but actually

250
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:59,520
the invitation I want to have is can you show up in this so in this small social

251
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:05,819
context but not feel so much Social like I have to say something I'm expecting no what if you just showed up with

252
00:47:05,819 --> 00:47:12,480
awareness showed up with awareness internally externally you just showed up internally

253
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:18,359
externally with awareness and maybe words come up and you say something

254
00:47:18,359 --> 00:47:24,839
maybe it's the stream of Consciousness oh I'm feeling myself sitting I I'm

255
00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:31,619
aware that yeah that I'm feeling a little nervous with two people in this

256
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:37,880
room right now in this breakout room you can just be a stream of Consciousness or it can just be silently holding space

257
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:43,920
there's no nothing needs to happen nothing needs to happen socially nothing

258
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:49,859
needs to be said nothing needs to happen so notice notice if there's this drive

259
00:47:49,859 --> 00:47:57,560
of wanting to make something happen wanting to say wanting I just sit with that sit back with that and just be kind

260
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:03,500
just know just know if you're just talking to fill in the space the silence

261
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:08,520
sweetheart sweetheart sweetheart tell yourself sweetheart pull yourself back

262
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:13,619
and just sit Silence with others maybe few words will come

263
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:19,260
even comes but a sense of it can be actually quite magical to just be in a

264
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:24,540
state of awareness with others flowing together the sense of flow

265
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:31,800
together so all right and make space for each other of course

266
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:36,859
it's inviting a lot of presents this could be magical this can be quite an

267
00:48:36,859 --> 00:48:43,319
experience so try it out be kind be kind curious be in

268
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:50,160
your body be in your body not in your head be in your body okay all right take care of yourself

269
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:55,740
take care of each other here are the rooms here we go

270
00:48:55,740 --> 00:49:01,560
the rooms are closed now everybody's back welcome back

271
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:09,000
everyone and uh it's seven o'clock but I wonder if maybe one person can tell us

272
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:15,540
how it was if there was it was different from usual or if it wasn't someone who

273
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:22,020
doesn't usually speak I like to invite you to move forward foreign

274
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:35,640
person says thank you so much Nikki this was lovely oh yeah great beautiful

275
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:42,960
good to see you yay any other reflections

276
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:48,780
well I don't see anyone jumping in so so I think there's a lot of presence and

277
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:54,839
silence here and so this is great we'll just keep that and and we'll dedicate

278
00:49:54,839 --> 00:50:03,020
the Merit may all beings everywhere be happy and free including ourselves

279
