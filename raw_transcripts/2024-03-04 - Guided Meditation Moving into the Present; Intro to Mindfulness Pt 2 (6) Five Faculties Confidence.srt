1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:08,960
so good morning from the morning of California at dreadwood city and hello

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,559
to those of you in other time

3
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:21,920
zones and we are here for the beginning of our new series for this

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:28,960
week and as a followup on the hindrances the topic will be the five

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,480
faculties and the reason to follow up is that the five faculties line up with the

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,960
five hindrances in a nice way and our supports to do the very opposite that

7
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:47,000
the hindrances do whereas the hindrances uh obscure and hinder

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,960
awareness and Present Moment attention kind of IM immersing ourselves

9
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:01,559
in our present moment experience the the the What's called the

10
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:08,600
faculties um support awareness promote awareness support us in bringing forth

11
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:16,640
our capacity to really be immersed in this present moment experience that

12
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,520
we're uh that meditation is about

13
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,400
mindfulness so first of these faculties is usually

14
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,439
considered to be uh translated as faith in English I'll talk more about it later

15
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:44,640
and it probably might not be the best translation for everyone but it what uh gives support

16
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,680
and strength to whatever the effort is that's needed

17
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:58,600
for meditation some people like to call it confidence um so it's not about

18
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:04,840
believing in something except for believing in the value of a

19
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,840
particular kind of action and for this morning that action

20
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:17,680
is a very unique thing that's sometimes not associated with action which is

21
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:25,160
meditation maybe it's an activity that we engage in and even that activity means the

22
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:31,599
ending and stopping of a lot of our doing physical verbal and even mental

23
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:39,159
doing it's still we're involved in an activity of calming of settling of quieting of becoming

24
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:45,720
still we're in the evolved activity of seeing clearly what's here seeing

25
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:52,800
clearly enough so that we're not in conflict with what's here we're not struggling with it and we're not for it

26
00:02:52,800 --> 00:03:00,000
either we're not holding on and trying to make something happen and that this is part of a

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,080
invaluable path to bring suffering to the end

28
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:12,040
invaluable path to reduce our suffering and live in a way that's the heart is

29
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,480
set free and to have confidence this is what we're

30
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:24,000
doing this is what and to remember that at the beginning of a sitting so that we

31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,920
can lovingly kindly relaxingly

32
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:38,360
give ourselves over to the practice whole wholehearted

33
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:47,239
practice whole being practice so to assume a meditation

34
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:56,239
posture and closing the

35
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:04,799
eyes and the whole wholeheartedness of practice for some people can be

36
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:11,599
initiated by the posture that we set ourselves in to

37
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:17,560
meditate that we're putting ourselves into an intentional

38
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:28,080
posture maybe it's a posture that you're familiar with you found for yourself long ago but still you're

39
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:35,919
intentionally finding a a posture that you think allows you to be most present most

40
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,240
wholeheartedly present without any

41
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:50,320
strain so it is a bit of an intentional

42
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,160
posture whether you're lying down in bed or whether you're sitting or standing to

43
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,720
meditate it's still intentional

44
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:08,000
intentional because it supports a wholehearted

45
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,280
engagement to be here in our

46
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,360
experience and then taking a few long slow deep

47
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:31,440
breaths and part of the deeper breaths is is to begin to launch ourselves into

48
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,720
the present moment it's kind of like

49
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,680
um you know maybe a rocket going into space there's a launching engine that

50
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,960
gets it going maybe a booster engine which keeps it going and once it's in

51
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,520
space it's doesn't need much prop propulsion anymore just kind of is there in a

52
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,880
peaceful quiet environment allowing to it to travel along the

53
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:12,800
Dharma Pathways so the deeper breaths is kind of like okay here I am this is what I'm

54
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,599
doing and then letting the breathing return to

55
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:25,919
normal relaxing the body

56
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,720
maybe this rocket has gotten wobbly as it takes off into

57
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,319
space And so there's uh whatever Rudders

58
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:51,759
or whatever it has that it begins to smooth itself out so we smooth ourselves out by

59
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,680
relaxing the

60
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:05,720
body and quieting the thinking mind so that our travels and meditation

61
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:13,198
the unfolding can go smoothly here and

62
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:31,000
now and then settling into the breathing

63
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:46,120
and maybe I'm allowed another metaphor kind of rowing in a

64
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:52,800
boat where the momentum forward is with every stroke of

65
00:07:52,800 --> 00:08:00,800
the ore the rhythmic circle of

66
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:08,520
lifting a paddle and moving it through the water

67
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:17,680
and so the cycle of the breathing each cycle of breathing like

68
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:24,000
an [Music] ore where you can give yourself over

69
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:31,039
wholeheartedly to the onward momentum

70
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:38,000
of being immersed here now with just

71
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,560
this present aware of what's

72
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:53,959
happening and if you find yourself pulled away from the breathing

73
00:08:53,959 --> 00:09:01,440
by some other present moment experience be aware of that

74
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,399
peacefully but if it's a strong pull see if there's something in the system the

75
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:15,079
mind the body the heart that can be

76
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:23,120
relaxed softened and then return to the

77
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
breathing

78
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
for

79
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
for

80
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
for

81
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
for

82
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
for

83
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
for

84
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
for

85
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,120
for for

86
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:21,959
and a rowo you're always in the water and if you're rowing you're always

87
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:30,639
moving through the water we're always in the present moment

88
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:37,720
if you give yourself over to the breathing to the

89
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:47,160
mindfulness you're always moving forward in the present

90
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:55,000
moment entering the present more deeply fully over and over

91
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,440
again moving on the

92
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,600
path the pathless path here in the present

93
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
moment

94
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
for

95
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
for

96
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

97
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
for

98
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
for

99
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
for

100
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
for

101
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
for

102
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,679
for e

103
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,840
with each in breath you're dipping yours into the

104
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:55,960
water of the present moment and pushing yourself forward into

105
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:01,520
the present moment through through the present

106
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:15,480
moment so completely involved in the

107
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:23,880
activity that everything else can get still and quiet just

108
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
this

109
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

110
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
for

111
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

112
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
for

113
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
for

114
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,360
for for

115
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,880
and then as as we come to the end of this

116
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:39,600
sitting to again Center yourself on the

117
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:51,679
breathing and then Center yourself in Your Heart A Heart Center or

118
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:59,679
wherever you Center yourself to be close to your kindness

119
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:06,520
friendliness love compassion Good

120
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:21,080
Will and let yourself breathe together with your Good

121
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:29,039
Will and as you breathe the ores moving you forward

122
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:37,120
into Good Will into the ocean the Sea of Love or

123
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,840
kindness towards the people in your

124
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:52,559
life so your good will is not static it's

125
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:59,679
Dynamic orienting yourself to others

126
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:06,279
even if you don't step towards them your your your good

127
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:11,559
will inclines leans towards

128
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:33,279
others rowing in the ocean of good will bringing your good will extending

129
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,639
your good will to

130
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:45,399
others may all beings be

131
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:52,559
happy may all beings be safe may all

132
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:59,600
beings be peaceful may all beings

133
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,919
be

134
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,679
free and may our capacity to have good

135
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:17,679
will both move us towards

136
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:24,480
people and something we move through like rowing through the

137
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:33,480
sea rowing forever into the world with Good Good Will and

138
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:52,799
[Music]

139
00:28:52,799 --> 00:29:01,080
love thank you for

140
00:29:55,799 --> 00:30:03,440
so hello and welcome to this new five-part series this time on the five

141
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:09,360
faculties and following up on the hindrances um I want

142
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:17,080
to point out that last week in talking about the hindrances I talked also about how uh

143
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:23,480
especially the last three hindrances interfere with our ability to

144
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:29,760
practice they they inhibit action the first two hindrances desire

145
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:36,159
and ill will they might Propel the wrong kind of action greedy

146
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:42,200
desire and hostile ill will we act on those those those those

147
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:49,640
aren't very good in the in the um the five faculties

148
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:56,320
it's a little bit the same thing that the opposite so the first two faith and

149
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:03,080
effort um invol olve action activity engagement and the last three

150
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:08,279
mindfulness concentration and wisdom are which support

151
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:14,639
action so the Buddha was said to be a teacher of action and you know that uh

152
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:20,679
he was a um um kada an

153
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:27,080
actionist maybe and um and uh maybe Buddhism isn't

154
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:33,440
often associated with action if we when we're in the meditation traditions of

155
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:39,799
Buddhism because in hang on a minute I'm going to clear my

156
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:48,600
throat not associated with action because of uh meditation tradition we

157
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:54,080
sit still we're quiet and often partly because in the west people are such busy

158
00:31:54,080 --> 00:32:00,320
Minds spinning Minds that it's so and so striving or pushing or trying to do so

159
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:06,080
much that a lot of the teachings is don't do anything relax settle um just

160
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:11,600
be just be don't do just be however for the Buddha I don't think

161
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:17,279
he ever really said just be he was a he was a teacher of action of engaging

162
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:24,120
being active in the world and there are three ways in body speech and mind

163
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:29,760
they're all activity nothing is static and the deep immersion into the

164
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:35,240
present moment where deep Stillness and peace can happen is a kind of activity

165
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:41,799
it's a way of being active a way of doing that uh brings deep peace and some

166
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:47,200
people who are athletes or musicians or there's different activities that people

167
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,799
do some of them expend tremendous amount of physical energy but in doing that we

168
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:58,080
come into harmony into kind of the Mind become still some inner Stillness and

169
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,840
quiet takes over that um it's very you know when we stop the activity we just

170
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:10,000
feel so peaceful and calm maybe concentrated so activity and being calm

171
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:17,279
activity and being peaceful and centered and quiet being still even in a certain kind of inner way are not opposed to

172
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:22,799
each other so the uh first of these five

173
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:28,840
faculties is usually translated as faith when we do that in English many people

174
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:34,480
then associated with Western religious ideas of Faith having faith in a tenant

175
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:40,840
having faith in something else outside of us having a faith in our you know the

176
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:46,399
purpose of life or meaning or what's most sacred or some

177
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:51,760
understanding for the Buddha the when he used the word Sada

178
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:57,159
Sada um it was explicitly a kind of

179
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:03,120
mental state mental activity that had some kind of desire as

180
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:08,440
part of it so that's why it's associated with the first uh hindrance kind of

181
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:13,638
parallel with it first hindrance is sensual desire or avariciousness want to

182
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:20,118
have things uh Faith this Sada is also a desire it's considered a wholesome

183
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:27,358
desire it's a desire that for us to engage in the path of practice to engage

184
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:33,398
to be interested in our from becoming interested and motivated to work for the

185
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:39,320
end of our suffering and and to start that path to

186
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:49,320
engage that this is what I want to do is to end my suffering to become free and um and so it's not a faith in a

187
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:55,638
Doctrine but more of a a faith or belief or confidence that uh there's something

188
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:02,000
to do and we want to do it we want to practice we want to meditate we want

189
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,280
to live by the precepts we want to live by the eful

190
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,800
path yes uh we want to meditate there's a big

191
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:20,599
yes behind or comes out of this so-called Faith confidence that um that

192
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:26,839
is the first of the faculties to call it confidence uh is

193
00:35:26,839 --> 00:35:33,839
Associates more perhaps with we're confident we can do something take care of ourselves or engage in

194
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:40,000
activity but what it confidence might miss is a kind of heartfelt that's

195
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:46,599
behind it the affective quality of Faith where faith is kind of can be an inspiring heart

196
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:52,960
quality and um so somehow the word Sada in Buddhism maybe is a combination of

197
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,560
these meanings in English of faith and confidence yeah I have this um

198
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,119
need to clear my throat today a

199
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:11,359
lot so um

200
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:17,240
so I think it's helpful to appreciate that the Dharma path that

201
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:26,000
we're on calls on us to act and so for example uh

202
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,480
meditating meditation doesn't work unless you do it so to show up maybe

203
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,839
every day to meditate and to do it regularly a lot of the benefits of meditation come from

204
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:44,720
doing it regularly even if you think meditation is mostly just sitting and being very just letting go very very

205
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:49,800
deeply so you can just be here without the normal tensions of daily life it's

206
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:57,359
still the activity of getting to your seat and sitting down to do it but even in meditation there can be a

207
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:04,160
a delightful and healthy and calming way of thinking of meditation is an action

208
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:11,680
as well and the metaphor that I gave for the last meditation was that of rowing a

209
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:18,640
boat on the Sea on the ocean uh you're always on the ocean when

210
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:24,079
you're rowing on the ocean but every uh stroke of the ores

211
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:30,800
you're moving forward in the water always arriving in the ocean but always

212
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:37,359
moving through it always immersing yourselves into the ocean coming going

213
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:43,599
going and you're going forward into the ocean so here we're immersing ourselves

214
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:48,839
in the present moment but it's not a static event we're kind of allowing

215
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:54,400
there's a movement there's a momentum on the path on the moving forward into it

216
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:00,720
more fully and so the idea that the breathing might be the yours the cyclic movement

217
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,960
of breathing in and breathing out and you might figure out for you yourself

218
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:11,800
which is which uh is the is the in breath or the out breath the stroke is

219
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:17,880
the out breath or the INB breath lifting of the ores out of the water you know different people might have different

220
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:25,160
associations but it's not meant to be astray not that you're looking into the future for something else you're just

221
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:31,640
looking to be really right here here in this ocean of the Dharma the

222
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:39,040
ocean of the present moment and there's a movement moving forward and that moving forward in the

223
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:45,839
practice is not that you're going someplace but you're kind of moving

224
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:52,640
forward into being more immersed here in yourself in this moment here there's a

225
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:58,319
dropping away the the water that rushes back off the hull of the boat is all

226
00:38:58,319 --> 00:39:04,440
your thoughts all your preoccupations they just wash away wash away and so we

227
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:12,000
can just be here in this moment with ourselves in some full way and to have faith that it's valuable

228
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,680
to do this invaluable to have confidence it's invaluable to be on this Dharma

229
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,880
path and to engage in all the pieces of the path that we

230
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:31,240
understand that um that there is the possibility of freedom from our hatred

231
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:36,720
freedom from our greed our addictions freedom from our resentments and envies

232
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:43,040
it is possible to be free of our anxiety free from our negative selft

233
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:49,160
talk it is possible to free ourselves from these things so that the beautiful

234
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:54,280
parts of ourselves The Marvelous parts of Good Will and compassion kindness

235
00:39:54,280 --> 00:40:01,560
Peace So that our ethical sensibilities sensitivity can be guiding us to do well

236
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:08,760
in this life and not to cause any harm we can learn we can find a way deep

237
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:14,680
way to live a harmless life to not cause any intentional harm the world needs

238
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:21,520
people like that so to be inspired to feel yes I have faith in the activity

239
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:28,560
the path the action the engagement this is a this is a PA path of action the

240
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:35,599
Buddha gave it just is but however we have to be very careful that it's not action

241
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:43,440
that we're straining it's not an action that we are tensing it's not a competition it's not

242
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:49,440
a race to get someplace it's um it's uh we have to

243
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:57,359
find a way to engage in this path in the meditation and the eful path whatever it is that you understand the Dharma to be

244
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:05,800
in a way that uh the way you do it the way you act is nourishing is

245
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:11,599
feels good of course you want to do it this is a good way to do it and that's

246
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:18,839
the art not only is it a Buddha teaching of action

247
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:24,040
in terms of you have to act but he's also a teacher of action in about how

248
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:31,560
you act how you engage but there has to be Faith or confidence

249
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:38,680
or trust or inspiration yes this is what I want to

250
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:44,960
do so for the Buddha the primary purpose for

251
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:50,040
Sada was to begin and continue doing the

252
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:57,240
practice and since that's what we're here for is to practice together that uh

253
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:05,359
um may it be that your inspiration your confidence your trust your

254
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:10,440
faith in this possibility of being in a path to

255
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:17,359
Freedom is a wonderful fuel wonderful motiv

256
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:25,119
motivator and let not just motivate you in how you meditate or even just

257
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:32,000

258
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:40,599
