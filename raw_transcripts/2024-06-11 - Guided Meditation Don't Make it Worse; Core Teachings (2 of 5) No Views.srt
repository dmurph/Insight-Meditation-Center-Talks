1
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,920
so hello everyone and welcome to this

2
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:30,160
meditation broadcast from Insight Meditation Center I'm delighted to be with you and

3
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:37,920
the names that I recognize on the chat it's also very wonderful to see thank you for being

4
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:44,360
here yesterday uh in the guided meditation the focus was on

5
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:50,640
ease and uh recognizing what takes you away from the ease so the simple

6
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,000
instruction for meditation was could be be uh set yourself at

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,519
ease and and notice how you lose the ease or what takes you away from the

8
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:08,720
ease and doing that we start seeing the activities of the mind where we get uh

9
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:16,439
agitated or shut down or confused or get caught in thoughts or desires or

10
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:22,400
aversions and then the question is if you see that um what do you

11
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,600
do and uh what we do is uh we're mindful of it we see it clearly that what we're

12
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:34,159
doing is kind kind of a truth telling oh look at that look what I'm doing I was

13
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,320
at ease and now I'm less at ease just that information begins shifting maybe

14
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:45,040
our PRI priorities shifting what we want to devote ourselves

15
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:52,520
to and uh so today I want to orient a little differently in that

16
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:58,439
um the um uh at any given moment setting

17
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:06,079
yourself at ease and calm some whatever whatever is capable you're capable of even if it's ever so

18
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:12,560
slight let yourself let yourself be at ease and uh don't make it

19
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:20,120
worse don't make the situation worse uh uh don't choose to

20
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:26,160
follow the the option which brings you more

21
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:34,440
unease brings you stress brings you distress kind of makes you more agitated

22
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,840
or less less at ease don't make it

23
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,080
worse and uh it might be the situation is pretty bad pretty difficult for you

24
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,360
some kind of way and life can be that way for sure and um and this simple teaching

25
00:02:52,360 --> 00:03:00,440
don't make it worse and what worse means in the subtlest forms of that is that the mind

26
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:06,120
gets fixated on something gets stuck on something gets focused on something

27
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:14,720
where the Mind loses the It's ability to have a relaxed open attentiveness to the

28
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:22,280
present moment where the awareness does not flow along with the present

29
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:28,000
moment uh but it gets get caught in something involved in something and

30
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,280
reactive to something it might be caught up in judgments might be caught up in

31
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,840
opinions preferences uh it might uh so don't

32
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:46,519
don't make it worse and uh whatever way you are and let's see if that could be a

33
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:52,319
orientation for this morning and see what you learn in that process you don't

34
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:58,400
have to do it well uh because if you don't do it well

35
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,480
and then feel discouraged or upset about that you're making it

36
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:13,079
worse H just allow things to be don't make them worse and if anything else let yourself

37
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:19,440
be at ease so assuming a meditation

38
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,639
posture and gently closing the

39
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,280
eyes and

40
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:45,560
become aware of your body the whole body as globally as it's easy for

41
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:55,000
you and do you have more aware of your the

42
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,638
front of your body or the back of the body or equally throughout

43
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:11,280
are you more leaning to the right or to the left or is it

44
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:34,560
balanced and within this global whole body taking a few deeper

45
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,440
breaths and relaxing the whole body as you

46
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:54,240
exhale breathing in relaxing

47
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:46,360
letting your breathing return to normal with a normal

48
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:55,360
breath relax your thinking mind soften the

49
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:05,319
mind maybe the thing thinking mind can broaden and spread wide

50
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:44,879
as you exhale in whatever way is easiest for

51
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:53,319
you or however slight set your heart at ease

52
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:09,720
and then stay attentive to during this meditation to the

53
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,400
breathing breathing in and breathing

54
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,599
out and stay also attentive to what your mind is

55
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:33,360
doing and is there any way in which you're meditating or doing anything else with the

56
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:40,399
mind that diminishes the quality of

57
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:51,839
your well-being how you are do you somehow make it worse

58
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:18,160
the more calm and quiet and centered you are the more subtle is the recognition

59
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,720
of what makes a situation worse the option which is less

60
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:30,680
desirable because the mind has gotten activated or agitated

61
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,760
maybe in ordinary life it would be a normal state to be in

62
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:49,440
and but in meditation there are ordinary states of

63
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,120
being which are not the best

64
00:09:56,079 --> 00:10:01,839
option don't try to make those options but

65
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:10,640
avoid the options that make it worse stay close to your sense of

66
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,200
ease even if you feel

67
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:31,320
uneasy be attentive that you don't make it worse

68
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:36,279
stay with the situation breathe

69
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
for

70
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,160
for for

71
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
oh

72
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
for

73
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
for

74
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,000
for e

75
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,680
sometimes the Mind drifts off in thought

76
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:06,759
and our state becomes worse becomes more distressed or stressed or

77
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:12,920
agitated sometimes it's almost second nature to judge

78
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:21,839
and find out what's wrong and the situation becomes

79
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:32,639
worse allow yourself to be a simple and as at ease as you

80
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,759
can with ease and

81
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:45,079
simplicity stay here with your

82
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:51,880
breathing appreciating how Simplicity and ease and

83
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:58,680
attention can be a protection

84
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:08,720
from the automatic ways that we might make it worse for

85
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
ourselves

86
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
for

87
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
for

88
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
for

89
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

90
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

91
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
for

92
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
for

93
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
for

94
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
for

95
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,480
for for

96
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
for

97
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,360
for for

98
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
for

99
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,278
for for

100
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,480
and then as we come to the end of this

101
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:21,640
sitting to take a moment to

102
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:33,200
recognize if there's something about the calm or the

103
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:39,600
subtleness the ease or peace

104
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:46,760
Clarity or anything about the meditation that provides you with a

105
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,360
reference

106
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:59,440
point to recognize when you are making it worse for yourself

107
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:08,600
Maybe by reacting judging coming to fixed

108
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:15,200
conclusions resisting pushing

109
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,679
away do you have a heightened sensitivity for

110
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,880
that based on how you are now at the end of The

111
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:48,360
Meditation and then may it be that as you go into your life

112
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:54,360
today whatever way is next for you

113
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:04,720
that the benefits of this Insight the benefit of this

114
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:12,440
meditation can be applied to not making any situation

115
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:24,080
worse for ourselves for others by what we say by what we do even

116
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,720
by what we think

117
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:38,440
and to to refrain from what makes it

118
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:48,720
worse and may the be may we hope that in doing

119
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,840
so the benefits of this

120
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:59,879
meditation are something that we can share with others

121
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:08,159
may we care for Others May their well-being be of our interest

122
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:15,399
in our orientation may we live for the welfare

123
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:21,840
and happiness of Others May all beings be

124
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:28,640
happy may all beings be safe

125
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:39,039
may all beings be peaceful may all beings be free

126
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:53,679
[Music]

127
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:02,089
thank [Music]

128
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:30,880
you e

129
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:18,600
the theme for this week is to try to share with you some of

130
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:24,919
the building blocks the foundations for my particular orientation for

131
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:30,799
teaching Buddhism teaching the Dharma and maybe from causes and conditions

132
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:39,279
life experiences personality all kinds of reasons teachers have their own take

133
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:44,519
their own orientation and um and so I thought

134
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:52,519
maybe it' be useful to try to provide you with mine that's behind what I how I teach maybe not always so

135
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:59,799
evident and um yesterday I emphasized how um at the because it's I feel like

136
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:07,960
the Rock Bottom Foundation of what motivates me in the Dharma and guides me in the Dharma is uh sensitivity to

137
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:13,799
suffering and the end of suffering and the possibility of a radical end to

138
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:20,880
suffering the possibility of a lessening of suffering for myself and for

139
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:30,000
others and that uh there are times in my life that I thought that was um rather simplis IC orientation to

140
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,360
be the center of my the Buddhism that I practice and teach but uh I've come to appreciate

141
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:43,519
that it's actually quite a profound orientation and um it's

142
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:49,120
uh um philosophically profound doctrinally profound buddhistic

143
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:57,200
profound because suffering and the end of suffering um is at the is a thread that

144
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:03,120
goes through all aspects of our lives and it touches everything and the the

145
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:08,599
end of suffering uh similarly kind

146
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:15,000
of touches everything we do and everything we we are in deep deep way so

147
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:22,000
it's a profound thing and for me it's enough that's enough for what the Dara

148
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:29,440
is about if I take it one more step then um

149
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:36,118
uh the um I have an orientation maybe from my zen practice

150
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:44,280
partly maybe based on my background that um I kind of have an orientation to not

151
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:49,560
settle to not Center on any view any

152
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:55,240
philosophy any point of view um even though I just provided one

153
00:34:55,240 --> 00:35:03,480
the end of suffering and the end of suffering but not to Center not to rest there not to hold on to that as being it

154
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:10,800
and so if anything the idea of having no view is uh is the view that I like to

155
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:17,440
not rely on any particular understanding um but rather to rely on

156
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:23,880
awareness to rely on letting go to rely on showing up fresh for the next

157
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:29,320
moment not bringing anything with me um and

158
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:36,520
um and uh so you know as a teacher I listen to

159
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:44,720
people as they talk to me about their practice their their life and one of the things I'm listening to do they have a

160
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,800
um a view that they're holding on to do they have an orientation that that maybe

161
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:56,319
is a useful one but they're little bit too attached to it orientation views are

162
00:35:56,319 --> 00:36:01,440
useful and they they have their place in practice and in life um but they also

163
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:08,960
have their limitation and sooner or later in Buddhist practice we see the limitation of All Views and the

164
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:16,800
possibility of living without views of being without views maybe even if it's just temporarily in deep

165
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:22,800
meditation and um and along with that uh is

166
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,079
um uh not not having some idea

167
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:33,319
of anything that is Ultimate a view about something is the best and the most

168
00:36:33,319 --> 00:36:40,839
wonderful and the Ultimate Experience the Ultimate Reality the ultimate teachings uh that something is Ultimate

169
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:48,839
and better than anything else uh and this is a orientation that we see in the in the earliest very

170
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:54,280
earliest Buddhist texts uh that the earliest teachings perhaps of the Buddha

171
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:59,440
in a text called the in English be called The Book of eights the

172
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:06,920
ataka and um and I have a translation of it in uh that's published that's a title

173
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:15,640
of the book is called the Buddha before Buddhism and the reason for that title is that U the orientation there under

174
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:20,839
under kind of undercuts All Views uh and kind of lends itself to

175
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:27,319
this idea that there's nothing ultimate to have some idea of ultimate is a view and uh it sets up a contrast with what

176
00:37:27,319 --> 00:37:32,640
is not ultimate and with other people's religion and um and the earliest

177
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:38,760
teachings of Buddhism uh uh kind of pulled the rug from underneath any

178
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:44,040
attempt to make Buddhism into a religion that has ultimate kind of value and

179
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:50,200
purpose and uh some people find this kind of idea maybe even offensive

180
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:57,800
difficult uh unappealing I find it liberating I find it just delightful to

181
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:05,480
be able to live without holding on to any View at all related to this idea is uh in later

182
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:13,200
Buddhism Mahayana Buddhism there's a two two uh contrasting philosophical

183
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:18,800
traditions one is called um uh the the U

184
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:24,520
the the middle the middle tradition or the middleness tradition and the other

185
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:32,599
is called the mind only tradition uh uh and uh or yogachara which means

186
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:39,240
the practitioners of yoga and uh the um the mamica the

187
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:45,079
emptiness people believe that uh there was nothing which is not empty

188
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:53,599
everything is insubstantial insubstantial everything's impermanent shifting changing everything is uh uh

189
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:59,560
conditional contingent and um and there's nothing no place to land with attention to take a

190
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:05,160
stand to hold on to anything and this just Freedom just allow everything to

191
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:11,680
just move through us and for us to be part of the river and of life and just find our way and navigating the river

192
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:18,200
but but everything nothing no place to stand the yogachara school the um uh

193
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:24,040
chatra School mind only School believe the same thing that everything is empty

194
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:31,319
except for the mind or except for consciousness and uh we find uh even in the modern

195
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:37,040
world uh a divide between those teachers who want to emphasize that uh everything

196
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:42,760
is empty but there's also Consciousness it's a form of Consciousness or form of mind which is Ultimate and

197
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:50,400
Transcendent and those who are more mamica these middle length middle people middleness people that

198
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:56,440
um that believe in uh The Emptiness of all things and nothing has ultimacy

199
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:02,880
nothing is has any permanence and so I'm more in the this mam orientation I'm more in the

200
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:11,520
orientation that doesn't want to take anything as it doesn't see anything as uh ultimate as sub as permanent as the

201
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:19,200
thing and then everything is in the process of flow everything's in the River of Life and that uh to take a

202
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:25,119
stand anywhere in a view in a position and the idea that anything is um is

203
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:30,280
Ultimate um makes a situ ation worse it adds a little bit of stress a little bit

204
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:37,280
of holding on so that's my orientation uh and I to be this this

205
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:44,520
explicit about it I kind of have some reluctance to do because I don't want to be dismissive or be disrespectful for

206
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:52,359
people have a different orientation and um people who have a different orientation are uh teachers

207
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:57,720
have phenomenal practitioners and and to have come to their understanding it

208
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:03,400
comes from a very very deep practice and uh and sometimes the way to

209
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:11,240
harmonize these two is that um it's uh like a difference between uh you know is

210
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:19,319
is light a particle or a wave and they say well it's neither particle or wave or it's both particle and wave and um

211
00:41:19,319 --> 00:41:26,319
and so uh is there something ultimate or is there nothing ultimate um is there

212
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:31,920
both ultimacy not ultimacy is there a kind of view that we can hold on to or

213
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:38,400
have um that uh is neither of you or or not of you or is both of you and not of

214
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,960
you or is it two sides of the same coin same two sides of the same hand and uh

215
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:49,079
depending which way we look at it we come to a different conclusion so you

216
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:55,599
know we don't have to even take the what I'm offering the view that of no view

217
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:01,040
the idea the view of nothing ultimate um uh it's not very interesting

218
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:06,200
to make those views and hold on to those um there's ways of just kind of letting

219
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:12,680
that go too and not being so focused on it and not making those ultimate and the

220
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:21,839
thing so in this way um um the um if you know I'm kind of closer

221
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:27,280
to the emptiness School of Mahayana Buddhism and and I think that uh in

222
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:33,480
early Buddhism they don't have these schools they don't have articulate the philosophies as much but in the earli

223
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:38,800
tradition it's just the practice to practice non- clinging to understand the

224
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:47,079
value of not holding on to anything at all and that the freedom from suffering is freedom from not fixating on anything

225
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:52,920
including religion including philosophical views doctrines any kind of idea that

226
00:42:52,920 --> 00:43:00,559
something is the ult the thing the ultimate thing and so in focusing on the

227
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:06,520
suffering and the end of suffering you know it's kind of like that's ultimate for me or that's the

228
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:13,280
foundational but even that's not something to hold on to there's nothing there to hold on to and Let Freedom from

229
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:21,240
clinging is um freedom from suffering is kind of like the hand has uh has a fist

230
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:27,920
has finally been opened opened up and um and it just uh you know know an open

231
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:35,200
hand is just an open hand there's nothing the the hand itself is not holding on to anything but if I love

232
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:41,119
that open hand and want to make it into something or and make and grab it then

233
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:46,319
I've lost the open hand and now I have a fist again so you know so you the end of

234
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:52,800
suffering can't be made you know you don't want to make that the thing and then hold on to that so there's nothing

235
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:59,040
to hold on to nothing to hold on to and how profound that is

236
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:04,559
so um so

237
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:10,319
um so suffering in its end no View and no

238
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:17,200
ultimacy are part of my Dharma at least for now and I say at least for now so

239
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:22,720
that um that's also not taken as being kind of ultimate truth and I'll end with

240
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:31,480
a little story I'm not sure where it comes from but there's a story of Mara who is um

241
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:39,359
kind of the Buddhist personification of all Temptations and hindrances that uh

242
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:46,319
Keeps Us in the world of sensual desires desires and and uh and prevents us from

243
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:51,760
becoming awakened and free and uh Samara is this kind of being

244
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:59,119
this supernatural being that goes around and tries to stop people from practicing and getting enlightened and all

245
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:06,079
that and um and so what there Mara is out wandering around and with his

246
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:14,040
attendant and they come across a a meditator who's uh doing walking

247
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:19,680
meditation and um and

248
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:26,800
um uh and the meditator has some deep realization deep insight and exclaims

249
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:33,280
how happily I see the truth I see the truth and uh and it Mara just continues

250
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:38,839
without being concerned and the intendant says tomorrow aren't you concerned this person's discovered the

251
00:45:38,839 --> 00:45:44,119
truth and probably on the brink of Awakening or you know or you know making

252
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:49,839
progress along the way or and uh Mara says no no I'm not so concerned soon

253
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:58,000
enough uh the person will make it into turn it into a belief so we can say see things that are

254
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,720
powerfully true but then we make it into a belief and then we're back in Mara's

255
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:13,400
hands kind of so thank you and I'll continue with this tomorrow
