1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:07,240
good morning welcome welcome so today is the fifth day the

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,719
last day on I'll be continuing this series on the Poetry of

3
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:19,680
practice and as I've been doing in the earlier days in the week do a little bit of a guided

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,880
meditation well and then I'll drop in a poem and

5
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:33,840
then after the meditation I'll talk about the poem a little bit there's something about uh

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,399
poetry in some ways it can be really supportive of practice in that it uh

7
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:47,960
uses language in a way that maybe has some precision and yet it has can be very

8
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,960
evocative too in some ways there's a a meditation can be like this too where

9
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:00,280
there's some precision and yet uh be evocative and not in precision and terms

10
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,920
of using the usual language but maybe there's a way in

11
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,320
which it feels like this you know with meditation we're sometimes talking to

12
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,080
that that direct experience like what's actually happening and poetry is

13
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:26,200
pointing to an experience and maybe not So Much by describing it directly but

14
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:32,159
helping it to maybe arise in the reader of the

15
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,360
poem I don't know if that made any

16
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,079
sense and there's this way I guess

17
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:50,439
um part of the Poetry of practice for me is how

18
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:57,520
poetry uses language to help you listen and

19
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:03,880
experience but without uh being prescriptive maybe that's what I'm

20
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:10,039
pointing to and so there's a way in which

21
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:16,440
meditation practice often is prescriptive but the art of practice is

22
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:22,959
finding our way with the directions that are given some of you know right there's

23
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:30,959
these 16 steps of anti or you know all these distinct steps inti Pana Su or you

24
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,080
know I myself I've given plenty of meditation instructions and that's

25
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:43,920
really helpful but there's also another part of our s that maybe that's the

26
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,120
poetic part that is reading between the

27
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:56,480
lines that is feeling our way into the moment instead of just following the

28
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,959
instructions okay so with that as a short

29
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:08,560
introduction we'll take a meditation

30
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:21,840
posture and feeling into this moment

31
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:39,599
what is the experience of this moment

32
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:10,400
can we inhabit the body be present for the bodily

33
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,000
experiences in this moment the thoughts will do what

34
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:24,120
thoughts do can we just be here now

35
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,280
feeling the foundation of our sitting

36
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,560
surface we're not floating in time from the past and the present the mind

37
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:01,039
is perhaps doing that but the body is

38
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:08,800
here now connected grounded

39
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:47,639
feeling the pressure against the body of our sitting surface

40
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:08,520
and allowing the spine to be upright reflecting Our intention

41
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,918
to pay attention

42
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:45,160
noticing any areas of tightness tension in the

43
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:52,199
body on the eyes or

44
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:05,199
mouth maybe with an exhale letting the tension drain

45
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:30,479
away now in the shoulders to move away from the ears

46
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:50,840
allowing the back to feel supported if it is

47
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:57,280
supported if it's not to feel the uprightness

48
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:31,440
allowing the chest to be soft and the belly to be soft

49
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:39,800
we don't need to armor ourselves this meditation session can we

50
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:47,039
just be open at ease

51
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:35,800
bringing an aliveness of attention to the bodily

52
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:03,720
experience resting the attention on the sensations of

53
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:15,360
breathing tuning into being sensitive to what it feels like to have an in

54
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,360
breath

55
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,560
and what it feels like to have an out breath

56
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,560
noticing the tensions and the transitions between the

57
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:31,000
in breaths and out breaths I sit the we tension

58
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,160
but maybe that was a slip a sticky

59
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:43,600
transition I have a little tension in the body this

60
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,240
morning e

61
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:54,320
and when the Mind wonders we just very simply

62
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:01,600
gently Begin Again with this sensation of

63
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
breathing

64
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

65
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

66
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
e

67
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

68
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

69
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

70
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

71
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

72
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

73
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760

74
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

75
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

76
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,679
e e

77
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,720
I'm going to drop in a poem

78
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:07,679
just allow the poem to be received you don't have to decide

79
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:17,840
whether you like it or not or what it means or and it just be received and maybe

80
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:25,278
allow it to touch you if it does if it doesn't that's okay too

81
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:39,600
this poem is called in the Moment by Billy Collins In the Moment by Billy

82
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,480
Collins it was a day in June all lawn and

83
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,559
Sky the kind that gives you no choice but to unbutton your shirt and sit

84
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:58,799
outside in a rough wooden chair and if a glass of iced tea and a

85
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:06,320
volume of 17th century poetry with a dark blue cover are available then the picture could hardly

86
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,760
be improved I remember a fly kept landing

87
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:19,200
on my wrist and two black butterflies with white and red wing dots bobbed around my

88
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:25,400
head in the bright air I could feel the day offering itself

89
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:33,080
to me and I wanted nothing more than to be in the moment but which

90
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:40,279
moment not that one or that one or that one or any of those that were scuttling

91
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:46,960
by seemed perfectly right for me plus I was too knotted up with

92
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:54,120
questions about the past and his tall evasive sister the

93
00:22:54,120 --> 00:23:00,240
future my churchyard held the bones of George Hubert why did John Dunn's wife

94
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,600
die so young and more pressingly what could we serve the vegetarian twins who

95
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:13,320
are coming to dinner that evening who knew that they were going to bring their own grapes and why was that

96
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:18,600
driver that pickup flying down the road toward the lone railroad

97
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:27,679
track and so the Priceless moments of the day were squandered one by one or

98
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:34,640
more likely a thousand at a time with quandry and pointless

99
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:42,200
interrogation all I wanted was to be a pee of being inside the Green Pod of

100
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:48,520
time but that was not going to happen today I had to admit to

101
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:53,720
myself as I closed the book on the face of Thomas trahern and returned to the

102
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:59,919
house where I lit a flame under a pot full of floating brown eggs

103
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:05,240
and while they cooked in their bubbles I stared into a small oval

104
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:11,480
mirror near the sink to see if that crazy glass had anything special to tell

105
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,720
me

106
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
today

107
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,360
e e

108
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:41,000
I'll read this poem again in the Moment by Billy

109
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:47,880
Collins it was a day in June all lawn and Sky the kind that gives you no

110

John George Herbert why did John Dunn's wife die so

121
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:02,880
young and more impressing what could we serve the vegetarian twins who were coming to dinner that evening who knew

me

133
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,120
today e

134
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:29,919
[Music] here we go

135
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:35,380
[Music]

136
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:47,069
[Music]

137
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:16,440
good morning welcome welcome as we have encountering a Billy

138
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:25,360
Collins uh this poet some of you might be familiar with him he was the poet laureate I think from 2001 to

139
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:31,279
2003 and uh he writes a way that seems like very

140
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:37,679
accessible and often with a little bit of Whimsy in it and talks about uh like

141
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:46,799
the ordinary experiences and if I remember correctly this poem I think was published in 2016

142
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:55,200
so relatively not so long ago this poem of uh it's called in the

143
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,919
Moment by Billy Collins

144
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:06,240
maybe I'll say uh before I read the poem again something that I love about this

145
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,360
poem there's so many fun things here but one is he's talking about like oh he's

146
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:18,120
just not mindful he's just not being present and yet he's giving us

147
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:25,720
details minute details about his day he actually was present he actually was

148
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:33,399
being mindful but he has this idea about what mindfulness is supposed to look like

149
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:40,720
what the experience is supposed to be and because maybe it's not matching his expectations he's uh like just kind of

150
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:47,200
like oh I'm not mindful or maybe he's using poetic license and saying he's not mindful but

151
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,440
then demonstrating that he is I don't know it's kind of fun for me

152
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:58,080
though to this he's like protesting that uh he's not being Mindful and yet he's

153
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:04,960
rating how much he notices about what happens in the part of a

154
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:11,840
day so even just yeah okay maybe I'll read the poem and then I'll talk about a little bit

155
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,919
more so again the poem is in the Moment by Billy

156
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:24,320
Collins it was a day in June all lawn and Sky the kind that gives you no choice

157
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:31,880
but to unbutton your shirt and sit outside in a rough way wooden chair and if a glass of iced tea and a

158
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:37,200
volume of 17th century poetry with a dark blue cover are available then the

159
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:43,360
picture can hardly be improved I remember a fly kept landing

160
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:50,399
on my wrist and two black butterflies with white and red wing dots bobbed

161
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:56,399
around my head in the bright air I could feel the day offering itself

162
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:02,639
to me and I wanted nothing more more than to be in the moment but which

163
00:33:02,639 --> 00:33:08,919
moment not that one or that one or that one or any of those that were scuttling

164
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:15,399
by seemed perfectly right for me plus I was too knotted up with

165
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:20,720
questions about the past and his tall evasive sister the

166
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:28,080
future what churchyard held the bones of George Herbert why did John Dunn's wife die so

167
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:35,799
young and more pressingly what could we serve the vegetarian twins who were coming to dinner that evening who knew

168
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:42,760
that they were going to bring their own grapes and why was the driver of that pickup flying down the road toward the

169
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:49,159
lone railroad track and so the Priceless moments of

170
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:55,919
the day were squandered one by one or more likely a thousand at a time with

171
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:02,480
quandry and pointless inter conation all I wanted was to be a pee of

172
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:08,599
being inside the Green Pod of time but that was not going to happen today I had

173
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:15,200
to admit to myself as I closed the book on the face of Thomas trar and returned

174
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:22,960
to the house where I lit a flame under a pot full of floating brown eggs and while they cooked in their

175
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:29,118
bubbles I stared into a small oval mirror near the sink to see if that

176
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:34,358
crazy glass had anything special to tell me

177
00:34:34,359 --> 00:34:40,878
today I know this poem makes me smile it makes me smile when I uh read it I

178
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:46,358
appreciate like he has this idea okay the conditions are finally perfect I'm

179
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:51,480
going to meditate here and it's going to be great it's like this Serene summer

180
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:59,240
day and he has presumably something that's enjoyable this book of poetry and I love this little detail he

181
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:06,200
gives us the color of the cover of the book so he's definitely present and later when he closes the book he even

182
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:12,040
tells us that what page he's on he's on the book the page that has the picture

183
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:19,400
of this person TR Thomas Thomas trahern I don't know who Thomas tahar

184
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:26,359
is and he notices maybe that um he has this idea

185
00:35:26,359 --> 00:35:32,480
about time it's very interesting for me that the way time shows up in here in so

186
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,640
many different ways I could feel the day offering

187
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:43,560
itself to me and I wanted nothing more than to be in the moment so he wants to

188
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:49,640
be like in the particular place of time like just

189
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:58,440
now and he says that uh he wanted to be this P of being you know P like green

190
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:06,520
peas snap peas chick peas going to be a p of being inside the

191
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:11,880
Green Pod of time I don't know when I hear this I

192
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:19,560
feel like the Pod of time is something that's oppressive I mean that like squishes you in you're like like peas

193
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:27,400
Sal peas in a pod or I don't know is that the expression that we use that they are like they're snug like in peas

194
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:34,400
of it peas in a pod but meditation isn't like that it's like you know the moment after moment is

195
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:40,680
going and we're just uh noticing we're being present as these

196
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:46,640
Peas I don't know are are going I don't it's something I feel like it he has

197
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:53,480
this idea about time that doesn't feel quite right even though it's a little bit playful when he talks about uh that

198
00:36:53,480 --> 00:37:00,079
he was um I was too nodded up with questions

199
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:06,000
about the past and his tall evive sister the

200
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,680
future questions about the past and the future so noticing that the mind is in

201
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:18,200
these different places time whereas he wanted to maybe be here in the moment

202
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:24,560
where the body is and he talks about how so much like

203
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:30,839
some of the things that we think about turn out not to matter I don't know who George Herbert is or

204
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:36,880
John Dunn but he asks what churchyard had the bones of George Herbert these

205
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:42,640
things I guess are pretty inconsequential we don't whether the bones are here or there it's not like we

206
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,839
can change them more and why did John Dunn's wife die so

207
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:54,440
young this is also something else that we can't change to things that uh maybe don't

208
00:37:54,440 --> 00:38:02,760
have a consequence even if we do know the answer to them how often are we thinking about

209
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:10,680
things or wondering about things that turn out not really to matter interesting you know he doesn't

210
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:15,960
uh mention like Google in this poem even though this is that he this got

211
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:22,160
published in 2016 so the internet is there and it's available but maybe

212
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:28,000
there's some modern day like what these things that we are looking on our phone trying to find the answer to that

213
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,160
turn out not to be so inconsequential and so getting back to

214
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:40,760
this idea of um time he talks about the Priceless moments of the

215
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:49,560
day this idea that you know time is fleeting and that there's some beauty of

216
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:55,400
it maybe the some of the pricelessness of it is maybe the sense of

217
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:01,119
pricelessness is maybe what made feel him like he wanted to grab on to each of

218
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:08,000
them so one thing that I will that really strikes me about this poem is the

219
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,560
lack of uh is describing his inner life his inner

220
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:19,599
experiences all about maybe things that are happening out

221
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:25,200
there I guess may maybe he's talking about um questions that he has but again

222
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:31,079
it's not related to his inner life he feels really disconnected from his body

223
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:37,440
and instead these are all just things that are happening in his mind he does mentioned his body but what it's also

224
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:44,119
about things that are out there when these butterflies are near his

225
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:51,079
head and his wrist I remember a fly kept landing on my wrist and two black

226
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:57,920
butterflies with white and red wing dots bed around my head and the bright air

227
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:04,040
so that's our only clue that this person even has a body but it's only because uh

228
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:12,240
there's something out there that's interacting with them I think this is part of the connection between not being

229
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:18,839
here in time in this moment and not being connected with one's

230
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:27,280
body right the mind we know this is often in the past and not in the future

231
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:35,400
so I just get a kick out of this poem there's this uh I don't know you just imagine sitting

232
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:42,160
in the backyard thinking it's going to be lovely and then trying to meditate or be present and then like I'm just going

233
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:49,480
to go make some eggs but he's present for that too he's present for the the way that the water

234
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:54,800
is bubbling and the eggs are brown and that's okay so I'll read this poem

235
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:02,560
one more time it was a day in June all lawn and Sky

236
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:07,680
the kind that gives you no choice but to unbutton your shirt and sit outside in a

237
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:15,319
rough wooden chair and if a glass of iced tea and a volume of 17th century poetry with a

238
00:41:15,319 --> 00:41:20,520
dark blue cover are available then the picture can hardly be

239
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:27,599
improved I remember a fly kept landing on my wrist and two black butterflies

240
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:36,240
with white and red wing dots bobbed around my head in the bright air I could feel the day offering itself

241
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:42,440
to me and I wanted nothing more than to be in the moment but which

242
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:48,839
moment not that one or that one or that one or any of those that were scuttling

243
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:55,640
by seemed perfectly right for me plus I was too knotted up with

244
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:05,000
questions about the past and his tall evasive future his tall evasive sister the

245
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,560
future what churchard held the bones of George Herbert why did John Dunn's wife

246
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:17,839
die so young and more op pressingly what could we serve the vegetarian twins who

247
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:25,720
were coming to dinner that evening who knew that they would bring their own grapes and I'm hoping that Zoom is doing

248
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:32,400
some noise cancellation for me here and I apologize if it's not and there's a lot of noise

249
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,720
outside who knew that they were going to bring their own grapes and why was the

250
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:44,160
driver of that pickup flying down the road toward the lone railroad

251
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:50,920
track and so the Priceless moments of the day were squandered one by one or

252
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:58,800
more likely a thousand at a time with quandry and pointless interrogation

253
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:05,000
all I wanted was to be a pee of being inside the Green Pod of time but that

254
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:12,480
was not going to happen today I had to admit to myself as I closed the book on the face of Thomas trahern and returned

255
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:18,400
to the house where I lit a flame under a pot full of floating brown

256
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:24,079
eggs and while they cooked in their bubbles I stared into a small oval

257
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:29,400
mirror near the sink to see if that crazy glass had anything special to tell

258
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:36,839
me today may you find yourself being

259
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:42,000
present for some moments today whether they're munding whether you find

260
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:48,200
yourself asking pointless questions or whether you find some beauty and Grace

261
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:55,040
today whatever you experience may you be present for your life as it's unfolding

262
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:02,680
thank you and thank you for practicing with me today it's been lovely to share this

263
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:07,880
poetry of practice this week thank you

264
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:01,240
it's say thank you very much for your comments it's very sweet to read your

265
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:08,000
comments I know poetry isn't for everybody and there were seasons in my life when it certainly was not for me I

266
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:16,240
wasn't a fan of poetry but I don't know now just uh love it
