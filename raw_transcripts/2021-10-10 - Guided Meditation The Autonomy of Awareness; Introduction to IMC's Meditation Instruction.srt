1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:10,240
so good morning everyone or good day and welcome to our meditation session

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:17,119
and as we begin this meditation i'd like to suggest

3
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:23,199
an idea maybe some of you will find it meaningful

4
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:30,800
and that is that there are two halves to meditation there's what you bring and there's what

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,440
you receive there is what you contribute

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,440
to your meditation and then what

7
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,600
you allow and the meeting of those two is where meditation is

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:56,879
and so on one hand what you contribute it has to do with your autonomy your ability to engage

9
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,879
autonomously independently from what is happening around you what's

10
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,320
happening within you and and then

11
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,320
what you receive is i like to call it the natural world

12
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:22,479
that uh kind of like you're a naturalist who is clearly autonomous in engaging observing

13
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,680
the natural world that's being studied but is also not interfering with it and

14
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,119
allowing the natural world to kind of unfold the way that it is so they can be

15
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:41,040
studied and so we ourselves are a natural system nature is found right here in our body

16
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,880
and our minds our hearts and our emotions the whole working of our psychophysical

17
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,399
system you know 99.9999 percent of it they're

18
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,920
at at the minimum is this uh phenomenal natural system

19
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:04,479
that's evolved over millennia and uh

20
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:12,400
you know we don't still don't even know the full extent to which this whole psychophysical system really works and

21
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,879
and um and but it works it keeps us alive keeps us going for a good number of years

22
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,640
and uh it's a probably more of

23
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,080
who we are is the product of our natural

24
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,720
of nature doing its thing through us than it is what we think or what we do what we feel

25
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:44,560
we're responsible for what we judge ourselves for what we criticize ourselves for what we

26
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,720
so in meditation we're sitting here to be autonomous to send up

27
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,200
metaphorically upright present attentive the attention is where the autonomy is

28
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,599
found so in order to get make some complicated idea of individualistic autonomy

29
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:10,720
but it's the autonomy that comes from showing up and being present for the experience for being aware of this is

30
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,720
what's happening and in that this is what's happening

31
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:24,640
then there's also what's what's happening isn't is nature and nature can be trusted nature

32
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:31,200
uh if if we stay autonomous if we don't interfere and don't participate

33
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,480
and that's the autonomy part don't participate don't get entangled or caught in anything almost like you're

34
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:43,440
making a room to wow this is nature this is a natural world unfolding here

35
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:50,400
and my proposal is you assume the natural world moves towards health

36
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,840
if there's tension it moves towards relaxation

37
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,360
if there's fear it moves towards relaxation

38
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,280
if there is anger it moves towards release

39
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:14,560
if there's sadness it moves to a freeing of certain kind of

40
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,680
healing of the sadness there's all this forces inside of us

41
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:27,120
that moves towards health if we allow it and so this meeting and this gesture of namaste bring our

42
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,440
hands together and anjali of putting our hands together like this it's our autonomy

43
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,759
and nature that meet in this practice and then we see what happens

44
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,000
so um to assume a

45
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,560
appropriate posture for meditation appropriate for you

46
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:01,919
and relax your gaze if you're looking at the screen for example you might

47
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:08,400
turn your head your gaze down at about 45 degrees

48
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,039
in a way with their eyes can relax

49
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,720
and if it's comfortable you might close your eyes

50
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,080
and then to

51
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:38,039
take a few long leisurely and deep breaths

52
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:45,039
maybe three quarters full so you don't doesn't tire you two breathe deep

53
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:55,120
then a long exhale slow relaxed long

54
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,479
but not so long that it becomes a strain

55
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,160
and then deep full inhales to feel your body

56
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,560
your torso your shoulders rib cage

57
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:28,240
many of the things that you feel as you deep breathe in deeply in your torso

58
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:37,280
you share with many other animals that breathe as well ribcage and shoulders and movement

59
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:45,599
filling of the lungs it's a natural process

60
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,240
and then as you exhale to relax the body

61
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:04,720
sometimes as the shoulders the belly different parts relax

62
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,680
it's appropriate to adjust the posture a little bit

63
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:19,520
maybe sit up little [Music] straighter open the chest a bit more

64
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,560
and then letting the breathing return to normal

65
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,880
and on the exhale softening the face

66
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,080
around the eyes

67
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:59,840
maybe the lips can in the middle of the lips maybe they can part a little bit

68
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,360
maybe just a millimeter that allows maybe the lip area the mouth

69
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,800
ear to be a little bit more relaxed

70
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,520
on the exhale to relax the shoulders

71
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,878
maybe feeling the weight of the shoulders allows for something to release

72
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,399
relaxing to the pull of gravity

73
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,959
on the exhale relaxing the area around the heart

74
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:04,959
maybe relaxing together with the phrase it's okay

75
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:12,600
for now it's okay however you're feeling however things are

76
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,839
and then the exhale relaxing the belly

77
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,720
sometimes relaxing the belly and letting it maybe sag forward

78
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,959
the weight of it to settle further down

79
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:50,080
can be a reminder to be grounded here

80
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:58,360
rooted here in the body in the lower torso here now

81
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:12,320
and the autonomy i'm talking about is very very simple

82
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,920
the autonomy of being aware

83
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:29,120
to be aware [Music] without entanglement

84
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,560
to be a naturalist of yourself

85
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:43,920
an awareness perhaps that's receptive allowing

86
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,839
you might have preferences you might have ideas and judgments about

87
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:57,040
what's happening but awareness does not

88
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:04,240
to disentangle yourself from your preferences and

89
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:10,240
agendas judgments let them be

90
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:19,440
and take refuge in the simplicity of awareness there is where we discover our autonomy

91
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,079
and freedom

92
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:33,680
and for now just assume that everything else is nature

93
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:48,800
and you're allowing there to be a meeting a recognition and knowing

94
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,880
contact between awareness and nature

95
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,680
and with the rhythm of breathing being relatively constant

96
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:22,480
it's a good place to stabilize steady yourself

97
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,160
in that meeting between awareness and nature

98
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,079
nature is a natural functioning

99
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,639
even if you you are controlling your breath

100
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:51,320
it's okay it's that's nature true too

101
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:59,680
just be aware of how things are in an autonomy

102
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:07,120
of awareness just aware and the meeting of awareness

103
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,360
and breathing

104
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,640
how simple can you be

105
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:16,200
with your awareness present moment awareness

106
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:24,320
just aware what is and everything else everything what is

107
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,639
is nature

108
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,240
be aware don't participate in it

109
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:41,200
just see it for what it is nature

110
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:49,679
and as you step away maybe the healing

111
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:55,120
forces of nature the harmonizing forces

112
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,919
have a chance to operate

113
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,919
you

114
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:30,240
as we come to the end of this meditation

115
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:39,840
it's a gift to yourself and to others

116
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:49,518
to have this open autonomous capacity for awareness

117
00:33:51,679 --> 00:34:00,240
inclusive of the people in your lives people you'll encounter today

118
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,480
the people of your communities immediate communities

119
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:16,398
wider communities the communities of people on your continent where you live

120
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:20,118
and around the world

121
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,040
and in this autonomous autonomy of awareness

122
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:36,000
to let it be a channel through which your heart can sing

123
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,560
your heart can smile in appreciation

124
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,760
and valuing of others

125
00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:00,880
they too are nature profound

126
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:06,880
important part of a whole

127
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:16,920
who knows what important parts they play

128
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:27,680
but they too can move towards harmony healing

129
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:34,560
wholeness when they're held in awareness

130
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:40,560
and care and may we with our capacity for

131
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:46,720
awareness hold all beings in our care

132
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,838
may all beings be appreciated

133
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,960
may all beings be valued

134
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,520
may all beings be happy

135
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,960
may all beings be safe

136
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:15,680
may all beings be peaceful

137
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,359
may all beings be free

138
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,838
and may we contribute to all that

139
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:45,380
[Music]

140

144
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:23,200
barry and jan rothman are going to

145
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:28,880
have to host a discussion group after the dharma talk

146
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:35,920
on zoom and i think that the zoom link is at the very top of the chat

147
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:43,119
and i'll i'll try to post it at the end when i finish here it's also on imc's website

148
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:48,400
on the bottom right it's in the what's new section

149
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,760
there's an announcement there for it and um in the calendar which is in the bottom

150
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,880
left uh it's listed there as an event and you click on the event and then the zoom

151
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:04,640
information is there so it's a nice time nice way of being in community and

152
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,838
talking about the dar mine

153
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:16,800
so for um the talk today i want to start with a story i'm fond of

154
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,279
as an introduction to what i'll be talking about

155
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:29,200
there was a person who was well learned in buddhism

156
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:34,720
many years studying with the great teachers of the era

157
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:43,000
studied all the great books and sutras and commentaries and

158
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:48,480
so but then at some point i went to a zen master

159
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,320
and now with the piece of beautiful paper calligraphy paper

160
00:39:54,320 --> 00:40:01,119
and asked the zen master to do a calligraphy to write down the most important teaching of buddhism

161
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:08,079
in this calligraphy there's a tradition especially in japan of that zen masters will do calligraphy

162
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:14,319
and and sometimes they're on scrolls and their scrolls are hung in a respectful place

163
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:23,280
in a home and so in that custom the person went to the zen master and made that request

164
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:29,520
and so they uh then master thought about it for a while and then wrote

165
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,640
great focus and presence wrote something on the scroll

166
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:40,640
and the person was very excited that this great zen master was going to write the essential kind of nugget to what

167
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:48,240
buddhism is about and the zen master wrote on the but the character in japanese for

168
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:55,200
attention just that one word attention single character

169
00:40:55,359 --> 00:41:01,680
and um and the zen master and the and the person said oh no no you seem to not

170
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:08,000
quite understood uh you know i want the most important the essential the key

171
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:14,240
teaching and so the zen master took another piece of paper and with great focus and

172
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,720
presence wrote another two characters now and the person was

173
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:28,240
very excited to see it now but certainly there'd be something profound and the zen master had written attention

174
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:34,800
attention so then the person explained you know they're well studied they've

175
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,000
read all the great philosophies of buddhism they they really have surveyed the whole

176
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:47,359
terrain lots of teachers they've studied with and and they're sophisticated and they know a lot already so you know can you really

177
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:54,000
kind of capture the the really the essence of the philosophy of the teachings of you know

178
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,280
and the zen masters oh now i understand okay

179
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,560
and um took another piece of paper and with great focus and presence looked at

180
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:10,400
the paper composed attention in the moment

181
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:18,880
grounded here and then wrote attention attention attention

182
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:25,280
so this idea of attention is so important for this tradition for

183
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:31,440
buddhism and everything you need to know and need to occur in buddhist practice

184
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:37,200
happens through the vehicle of paying attention being attentive to what's going on

185
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:43,680
and a beginning class in meditation would tell you to start being mindful

186
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:50,319
start engaging your attention in the present moment so in some ways it can be seen as

187
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:56,960
beginner's practice but it's the same practice for someone who has been practicing for years

188
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:02,160
someone who has matured in the practice reached full mutual maturity for it

189
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:08,480
it's still attention the core practice is the same and so the practice of a beginner and

190
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:15,440
the practice of someone's practice for a long time is in some ways the same

191
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:23,119
and people who practice for a long time it's always good to go back to the beginning to really start over again in a sense

192
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:29,119
but we start over again if we've done practice for a long time we don't quite start over the practice

193
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:35,359
is the same attention the basic instructions might be the same as for a beginner

194
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:41,839
but we bring something along something accompanies us from the maturity of our practice

195
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:47,839
that creates a little different context for doing the basic practice

196
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:55,760
so what i'd like this talk to be about is an introduction

197
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:01,040
to meditation practice and and

198
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:08,400
so it's meant for people who are maybe pretty new to all this maybe this is your first time coming to

199
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:13,839
talk at imc and also some of you i know i practiced for a long time and i hope it's going to

200
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:18,960
work for you too that you don't say you know you're ready to you know turn off the

201
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:26,319
youtube channel because oh it's just going to be an introduction to meditation i know all too well what meditation is about

202
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:32,400
i hope that you'll appreciate as i these minutes that i talk that it is

203
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:40,720
offer something a little different so the reason for this uh topic is that

204
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:47,920
my current plan which is subject to change by tomorrow morning but is to for the next few weeks on the

205
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:54,960
7 a.m teaching that i do to go through the basic instructions in

206
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:00,480
meditation practice that i teach here at imc and

207
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:07,119
and like i teach a five week intro to meditation class periodically and

208
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:14,640
and that follows a pattern and the pattern is the first day first evening we talk about breathing

209
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:23,119
the second evening we talk about a body mindfulness of the body the third time day is um

210
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:28,400
mindfulness of emotions the fourth one is mindfulness of thinking and then the fifth time is

211
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:34,480
everything else kind of um and um and so i thought we would go through

212
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:40,079
that one week at a time so a week on breathing a week on

213
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:45,920
body a week on emotions in a week on on thinking and then maybe a week or two

214
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:53,119
or some other things and and i feel it's really really useful to come back to the beginning to basics for

215
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:59,280
everyone and as i said i think that basics are not just basics for people who have a

216
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:05,359
lot of experience it's still the basic practice but hopefully something accompanies that

217
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:11,440
there's a understanding and insight a an approach to starting over again

218
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:18,240
that is both just starting over again sharing the practice of a beginner but somehow there's something else that's happening

219
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:24,800
there along with it and

220
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:30,560
so that's the plan and so this talk today is a little bit like an introduction to the series that

221
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:37,040
i'm planning to do so i wanted to take the opportunity to contextualize

222
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:43,920
a little step back a little bit more more objectively contextualize the instructions and meditation that i've

223
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:49,359
been doing here during this pandemic time and also at imc and how it fits into the

224
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:54,839
larger scene because all instructions

225
00:46:54,839 --> 00:47:01,760
are probably not best choice of words but are contrived are artificial they're

226
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:09,119
something that are constructed and made and presented and as such they have history

227
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:15,599
and um the way that i teach this five-week intro class at imc

228
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:21,359
um i had it uh i'll tell you the origins of it

229
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:28,480
so when i went to practice vipassana insight meditation in thailand and burma

230
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:34,400
the instructions were very simple in fact in burma i showed up at kind of like the ground headquarters this ground

231
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:40,160
zero for the whole in some ways the vipassana movement that spread into the west

232
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:46,319
and um and they gave me a cassette and a cassette player

233
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:51,520
with the 15 minute instructions in the meditation and that was the extent of the

234
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:57,200
instructions that i was supposed to i used for them for eight months that i was on retreat there

235
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:03,839
every all the instructions were given in 15 minutes and the simplest way of understanding

236
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,839
repeating those 15 minutes is

237
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:15,920
focus on the sensations of your breathing and if something becomes more

238
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:22,240
predominant more compelling than your breathing let go of the breathing and bring your attention to

239
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:28,960
really see what it is that's pulling you away or what's more compelling and when that's subtle enough

240
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:34,960
somehow it doesn't have to stop but subtle enough and no longer so compelling go back to your breathing

241
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:40,880
and so it was a lovely practice for me to discover because in doing zen practice before

242
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:46,000
that the focus was so much on breathing and on posture

243
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:52,000
that there was no instructions for emotions for thinking for all the kind of wider range of our experience

244
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:58,079
and vipasse and i learned that this simple instructions included this wide all of our humanity everything was

245
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:03,760
included and i remember when i was after practicing in burma for a while

246
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:10,720
i got so happy when i realized at some point that distance practice taught me to be

247
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:16,640
mindful be present for all everything in my experience

248
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:22,160
and and uh and the reason i became so happy was that

249
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:27,760
i knew that if i was mindful there was a way of being free liberated from

250
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,960
experience and this idea that that no matter what the human experience

251
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:39,119
is because i knew now how to be mindful of it i could find some kind of freedom

252
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:46,000
some kind of peace some kind of independence some kind of autonomy disentanglement with it all

253
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,599
and i still couldn't do it so well but i now i knew the theory i could be free anywhere i go

254
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:58,000
if i keep practicing mindfulness so um so that was what these extra

255
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,760
instructions was very simple and there's certainly more that happened in those 15 minutes of instructions but it was all

256
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:11,040
done like that i came to practice a little bit here in the west and um and then at some point i

257
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:18,720
was invited to become a teacher in this vipassana tradition and um and only then did i really kind

258
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:24,800
of start attending western insight meditation retreats i hadn't done a lot of things here in the

259
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:30,079
west and and here i've discovered they taught the

260
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:35,440
instructions in a different way on retreats they would start on the

261
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:40,800
first day teaching about breathing meditation and they get grounded get settled

262
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:47,040
the second day they talk about mindfulness to the body partly because by this by the second day

263
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:54,800
people's bodies were aching and challenging the third day they would talk about instructions in mindfulness of emotion

264
00:50:54,800 --> 00:51:00,079
and uh and by third day that was often kind of challenging for people so that was

265
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:05,200
useful and the fourth day they talk about mindfulness of thinking

266
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:10,319
and then there'd be some other things the next days of the retreat and that was a pattern

267
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:16,400
and so i was introduced to that pattern and i thought this was a nice pattern

268
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:22,480
as part of my teacher training starting in 1990 i was asked to

269
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:28,079
take over a group small meditation group in palo alto and i taught them for every week for

270
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:34,839
about a year or year and a half or so until it became clear it'd be useful to do in instructions in meditation for

271
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:40,400
people so then i offered the first time but i had never received any kind of

272
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:46,160
basic meditation class instructions and meditation class which i was about to teach

273
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:52,480
and so i you know i didn't i didn't have any reference points for how you do it and i wasn't certainly i wasn't going to

274
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:58,720
do the 15-minute instructions that i got in burma so i thought well these the way that they're taught on

275
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:04,400
retreat that's a very nice sequence and and it leads up to the way we're taught

276
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:10,160
in burma because after you get the full set of instructions then you know how to be present for

277
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:16,079
everything and that was the that was what they're building to on the retreats by the fifth sixth day then the

278
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:21,200
instructions were similar to what they are in burma so i thought why didn't i teach a

279
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:26,319
five-week course following the the instructions on the retreats

280
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:31,680
and one of the reasons i was motivated was that the the class was an hour and a half

281
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:37,680
actually initially i think there were maybe 45 minutes and um but it's longer than that 10 15

282
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:43,599
minute instructions on a retreat and so i then

283
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:49,119
i thought you know those instructions are so brief there's so much more to say about the instructions for each of these

284
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:55,520
things so i want more time so initially i had 45 minutes and then eventually became an hour and a half

285
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:00,800
in order to go into some real explanations real care around how to teach

286
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:07,200
mindfulness with each of these areas and and so i kind of made up this

287
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:14,800
course that way and that's what i've been doing and other people at imc have been doing now for almost 30 years

288
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:21,839
and i think it works very well but it's only one way of practicing one way of giving the instructions

289
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:28,559
in the pandemic last earlier this year i gave like 60 or so

290
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:35,200
talks there were basically instructions on mindfulness of breathing according to the anapanasati technique

291
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:40,839
and that's a whole other way of practicing which i find tremendously valuable but it is

292
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:45,920
different i've been asked now repeatedly to do a similar series on the sati

293
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:52,319
patana suta the four foundations of mindfulness which if you take that as your primary instructions is a little

294
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:57,359
bit different again it's a little different technique so these are all kinds of realizes all

295
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:05,119
these different ways of doing it and so and so my hope in offering the classic

296
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:10,880
now for 30 years away it's done here at imc on this you know sequentially

297
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:16,880
is that even if you don't take that as the as the as the

298
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:22,880
core technique in a sense it's laying a very good foundation

299
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:29,359
for how to include breathing body emotions uh thinking in

300
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:35,839
whatever technique you do become wiser you're more understanding i've also hoped in teaching this at imc

301
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:42,480
this way that is also relevant people who never meditate that people in their ordinary life

302
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:49,200
will also find it useful to understand some of the

303
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:55,680
principles ideas that i teach around breathing body emotions and thinking and

304
00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:00,960
the rest of it and and so i'm and when i do interclass i'm trying to kind of

305
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:08,160
make it relevant in such a broad way so that's kind of like the background and so some of you i'm going to

306
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:13,520
hopefully prevent a little bit of confusion if some of you come to the 7 a.m teaching and say wait

307
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:21,680
a minute just early in the year we had this all 60 steps you know the 16 16 steps the 60 talks about it

308
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:27,040
on anapanasati now how does this fit in so i hope this helps a little bit

309
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:32,839
and the so

310
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:39,119
um um in terms of the sati patano suta i'm planning next year

311
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:46,240
to do a series on it and probably do a little gap before i do it after doing this current series on

312
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:52,720
the basic instructions here and hopefully the basic instructions here will be tremendously supportive

313
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:58,880
for understanding sati patana so um

314
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:04,240
so there are these basic instructions and and

315
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:11,839
and as a beginner the instructions are more prescriptive meaning these are the things that we do

316
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:17,920
for someone who as we mature there starts to be a shift in the practice where it becomes less and less something

317
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:24,960
we do and more and more something we allow so because more and more the so-called

318
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:31,680
instructions are no longer prescriptive they become descriptive so

319
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:37,839
it's more and more that we are discovering a capacity for being aware here

320
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:43,359
and then we're just receptive in a certain way and then we're aware

321
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:49,440
of breathing and so it isn't so much we're

322
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:56,240
following instructions to be with the breathing breathing has found us and that's where the practice is

323
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:01,359
at some point sometimes the the body speaks up and so then we're aware of the body it's

324
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:07,599
the loudest thing happening and so that's what fills this autonomous independent kind of capacity just to be

325
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:13,599
aware sometimes emotions sometimes thoughts sometimes other aspects of all

326
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:19,599
this and and so awareness becomes more

327
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:27,839
something we allow it develops certain independence it's not being directed necessarily but

328
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:34,240
it might be very specific if one thing is the loudest thing but it's not like we're doing it

329
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:40,160
it's more like we're allowing it and over time as practice matures and

330
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:47,599
there's some degree some experience some some um taste of what freedom is like

331
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:55,359
then the awareness shares with some of the qualities of that freedom that it's still the basic

332
00:57:55,359 --> 00:58:01,839
practice but it's accompanied by a sense of what freedom is

333
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:09,520
or a feel for freedom and and disenchantment and uh

334
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:16,880
um uh and the equalities of that are come

335
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:23,520
from a sense of freedom and independence that i call it for autonomy

336
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:29,680
that there's a sense that awareness becomes more autonomous not that you become autonomous

337
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:34,720
because that's dangerous in terms of conceit like i look at me i'm autonomous and

338
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:40,880
capable independent the idea that you are independent that you are anything

339
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:49,200
is not really needed in the freedom and the ease and the peace of autonomous awareness

340
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:57,520
and so the autonomous awareness the awareness that can just be is has lent itself to like in the west

341
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:03,760
to the language of to have non-judgmental awareness to have an awareness that's accepting of

342
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:08,960
everything uh to have uh open awareness

343
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:14,720
to have um there was a time that was popular was something called choiceless awareness

344
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:21,680
and so over time there are different trends about how to talk about this and the current trend as of today here

345
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:28,640
with me is to talk about in terms of being autonomous autonomous awareness

346
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:34,880
and um and as practice deepens as i said rather than the mindfulness of

347
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:41,040
something we do mindfulness something we allow we allow that autonomy of awareness

348
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:46,640
that is not entangled or cut up or for and against any experience

349
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:52,480
and and then it becomes more and more kind of a marvel kind of a wondrous thing

350
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:58,960
that there is this free feeling of awareness that's free and independent and

351
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:05,760
not pushed around not attached to anything not for anything or against anything

352
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:12,640
and then everything else becomes nature even things which are unfortunate

353
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:18,559
say that you're angry with someone that they're in a hostile with someone in a very unfortunate way

354
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:24,319
um the autonomy means that you're not going to give in to it you're not going to

355
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:29,440
participate in it the forces of australian anger exists within you

356
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:35,119
but this precious core of who we kind of since are the awareness

357
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:40,799
allows us just to leave it alone and maybe seeing it it's and then not

358
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:46,160
identifying with it and this is one of the characteristics of a mature practitioner

359
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:51,520
is that there's less and less identification with whatever the experience is

360
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:56,799
identification here means that we define ourselves by it we limit ourselves and

361
01:00:56,799 --> 01:01:03,280
this is who i am we hold on to it we grab onto it that now i know who i am that immediately

362
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:08,319
limits the range and the wholeness the fullness of the experience

363
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:15,280
and it's not a denial of certain appropriate identities that people have it's the movement of identity movements

364
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:20,880
of the identification that we have that is the issue

365
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:28,000
and uh and so as practice matures it's still the same practice but what we're doing is we are

366
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:33,440
no longer identifying with these things

367
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:38,359
and so we are um

368
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:44,319
and so the um and so everything we see then

369
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:50,880
becomes nature that it becomes just part of the process

370
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:56,000
and that kind of independence being having those two meet

371
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:04,240
to ho or to hold in awareness whatever the experience is breath body emotions thoughts

372
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:10,079
challenges pain suffering whatever it might be it's a remarkable process

373
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:17,440
because then the natural functioning of who we are begins to operate better and better and

374
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:23,680
this idea of being able to step feel the freedom and allowance of a natural functioning

375
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:31,839
that comes when we don't restrict nature we don't limit it when bottle it up we don't become attached to it

376
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:37,119
and uh the kind of understanding of buddhism is that all the

377
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:43,280
unhealthy ways that we live our lives all the ways that we cause harm to ourselves and others

378
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:48,640
comes from not not leaving things alone not letting things

379
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:53,920
equilibrate come to harmony it becomes entanglement wanting

380
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:59,359
contracting around something resisting something judging something

381
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:06,240
identifying with something in a heavy burdensome way so

382
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:13,440
so the instructions are very simple basic

383
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:20,000
and the more longer ones practices the more one has

384
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:26,240
practiced them then basic instructions become even more relevant than they were when you were a

385
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:32,240
beginner because of what accompanies it because now there's a sense and a feeling and

386
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:38,960
this possibility of having to be simpler and simpler and simpler is not simplistic

387
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:44,079
simpler is where where freedom is found

388
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:49,200
so um so that's the introduction and hopefully

389
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:54,240
um for those of you who are not gonna come to the 7am

390
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:59,440
hopefully that was nice for you and and um and uh

391
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:05,359
and for those of you who do i certainly look forward to seeing you tomorrow morning or seeing you being with you

392
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:10,160
and we will us

393
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:18,000
hopefully go through it in a way that all of us including me find valuable and meaningful

394
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:26,440
so thank you all and wish you all a good week
