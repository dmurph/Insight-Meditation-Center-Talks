1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,319
all right welcome and let me just see how many we

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:13,360
are here welcome everyone good to see

3
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,400
everybody and a wonderful Friday to

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:28,640
you hope the week's been good to you so today we'll wrap up with our exploration

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,599
of the of the five spirit spiritual faculties as they're

6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:40,520
called Monday we talked about confidence Tuesday about balancing energy in the

7
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,960
practice Wednesday about complete presence yesterday about collectiveness

8
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:54,640
of mind the steady mind and today we'll we'll talk about the fifth

9
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,000
faculty which is generally uh called wisdom

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,720
but because wisdom can be sort of a high bar it's a great aspiration of

11
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,159
course uh we'll we'll we'll take a look at it in terms of

12
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:19,920
discerning and seeing clearly verbs instead of something to acquire

13
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,159
accomplish achieve like wisdom and uh we'll bring those verbs

14
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,920
into our practice so first

15
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,720
let's sit

16
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:46,360
together we can adjust our bodies and find our sitting

17
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:51,840
posture can bring the eyes down or focus them in the middle

18
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,439
distance and maybe do just a brief checkin of the body feeling its weight

19
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:01,840
in the chair on the cushion

20
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,200
and

21
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:16,879
uh maybe feel any tension in the body any holding any bracing any Echoes of

22
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:24,920
the day or hours past any sort of stress that's around preparing for

23
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:30,840
what's to come in the rest of the day or what Remains of the Day

24
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:37,239
and if we can just sort of soften around those areas of

25
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:44,519
tension we don't have to fix anything we don't have to make things

26
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,800
better there's ways in which this is a practice not about feeling better

27
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:58,200
quickly but about feeling more so just being aware of all that

28
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,840
comes into our awareness

29
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:09,560
and in the middle of it all we can find our way to the to the

30
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:18,920
breath and this morning in keeping with

31
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:25,400
the theme for the day of discerning seeing

32
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:32,560
clearly when we find find ourselves back with the breath each time we return to

33
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:39,799
the breath maybe instead of focusing so much on the breathing

34
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:45,640
today we can focus a little more on the way we know the

35
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:53,760
breathing what can be noticed as we come back to the breath is how effortless The

36
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:01,720
Knowing is that knows the breathing

37
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:14,799
so let's bring attention to the breath connecting as we have been the last few days with some of the natural

38
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:21,880
characteristics of the breathing the balance the Simplicity the relatively slow pace of

39
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:27,520
the breathing and just connecting in a way where there can be a little Delight

40
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:34,520
taken in the way when we connect our attention with the

41
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:43,080
breathing some of these characteristics that are just natural and easy for the breathing sort of rub off on us rub off

42
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:51,840
a bit on the mind every time we return there's a chance to an opportunity to rebalance to

43
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,919
touch in with Simplicity to slow down a little bit

44
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,919
maybe to unwind a little bit and just

45
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:12,199
rest here in the in the breathing and the sensations of the rise and fall of the abdomen the chest the

46
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:19,240
shoulders or perhaps noticing the breathing in the mouth or nose

47
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:44,600
and of course the mind will roam the mind will get caught up and snagged by

48
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,479
things this is the the mind being

49
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,520
mind and because we rely on the mind to do these things for us

50
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:07,479
I always feel a certain appreciation before I bring the Mind back to Center back to the breath appreciate the mind's

51
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:13,800
ability to do all those things to think about the future remember and re re

52
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:21,440
rewrite the past to think about other people to think about myself all all those things

53
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:29,039
have their place and sometimes I find it nice to just express some

54
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:35,199
gratitude to the mind for its willingness to try to

55
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:43,360
help maybe provide some solutions or suggestions or ways to fix and then I just go back to the

56
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,680
breath right now without pushing those aspects of Mind away I'm just coming

57
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:55,240
back to the breathing here and resting the mind steadying the mind gladdening the

58
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:00,160
Mind resting the mind like we did yesterday

59
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:09,240
and today when we connect with the breathing

60
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:17,400
let's notice how the breathing is known this knowing that goes

61
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,720
on so

62
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,240
effortless so light a touch

63
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:41,879
this knowing that happens in itself is

64
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,240
free the knowing that happens effortlessly when

65
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:59,520
we reconnect with the breath we can notice in itself is free of agitation

66
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:07,720
free of attachment it's just

67
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:16,599
knowing knowing and indistinguishable from what's

68
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:20,080
known so

69
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:34,560
easy so this knowing can know the agitated mind without

70
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,399
itself being

71
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:46,440
agitated can recognize and register strong emotion without itself being

72
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,360
colored by those

73
00:08:53,839 --> 00:09:00,640
emotions snowing can connect with Pleasant and unpleasant B

74
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,680
sensation without being affected by the pleasant or

75
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:15,279
unpleasant so when we reconnect with the breath each time this

76
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:23,360
morning let's notice the knowing just the ease of the

77
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,880
knowing we can rest too in this effortless

78
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,480
knowing that's free of

79
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
agitation

e e

115
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:32,679
as this meditation period comes to a close we can once again

116
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:36,760
reconnect our attention with the

117
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:45,840
breathing and take account of the knowing that's happening and the quality of this

118
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:54,279
knowing and maybe if some gladness of mind and some steadiness of

119
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:59,679
Mind have become present

120
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,760
can notice that this knowing seems to register

121
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:14,640
change changing intensity in what's known or changing quality of what's

122
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:24,080
known but this effortless unagitated knowing

123
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:38,278
is an innate capacity that we can cultivate in the

124
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:48,880
practice maybe letting it lead a little bit following its

125
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:59,720
lead let's dedicate the Merit of our practice today to all beings

126
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:07,640
may all beings be safe and secure whole and body and

127
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:12,600
mind may all beings live at

128
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:19,519
ease may all beings be free from suffering

129
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:38,508
[Music]

130
00:30:53,600 --> 00:31:00,840
so welcome again if you weren here for the earlier

131
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,480
welcome welcome

132
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,600
Friday just going to look back over at the chat see what's

133
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:22,638
happening yeah all looks good

134
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:28,399
um so today we will finish with this brief exploration of the five spiritual

135
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:36,000
faculties so-called these five capacities of mind that we each have within and that

136
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,039
can be cultivated strengthened as our practice Deens in

137
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:49,880
ways that reflect the deepening of practice and also also support uh

138
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:57,880
practice the fifth faculty PA in poly is frequently

139
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:04,360
translated as wisdom and I said at the outset that sometimes that can seem like a high

140
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:10,960
bar uh wisdom and so a perfectly legitimate

141
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:17,399
alternate translation that Gil points to among others is discernment or to make

142
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:25,039
it a verb Discerning we can say Discerning we can also say seeing

143
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:30,360
clearly and uh something about making these

144
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:37,639
verbs I think brings them more into the realm of something we can we can actually do in our

145
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:45,159
practice so we can let aspiration remain as our uh sorry uh wisdom remain as our

146
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:51,200
aspiration and then we can practice day to day moment to moment sit to sit we

147
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,200
can practice Discerning seeing clearly

148
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,600
so first something about

149
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:11,880
Discerning uh this is something we do all the

150
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:19,159
time we walk into a room we walk into a space and with this effortless knowing

151
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:24,440
that I was making reference to in the guided meditation we pick up what's

152
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:29,519
going on and we probably see some of it pretty

153
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:35,200
clearly and then there's other things we see less clearly but it's like this in the

154
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,559
meditation to we walk into a room that is we find ourselves in a particular

155
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:46,919
moment of the meditation and uh we can be aware of

156
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:52,960
what's going on and within that we can sort of by degrees see more and more

157
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:59,760
clearly ah this is what's arising this emotional current thought pattern this

158
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:08,679
bodily sensation and we can just take it as it comes we can take it without um judging

159
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:14,638
without preference without making up our mind about anything without reacting

160
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:20,599
quickly and this is this gift of of

161
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:26,440
discernment that we can know what's going on and we can pause we can take it

162
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:32,760
in as it's coming on its own terms without immediately reacting in perhaps

163
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:39,480
a way that we've reacted many times before so this is a key thing about

164
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:46,280
discernment is that it makes it possible for us to change how we

165
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:57,720
respond possibly it points out the direction of response and that sort of leads us to

166
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:02,960
toward a place of Greater ease greater skillful action and the

167
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,320
like the end of the meditation I talked about letting this knowing lead instead

168
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,680
of instead of me leading what if I let the knowing lead what if I let dis

169
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:20,640
Discerning lead what if I let this scene clearly lead then then what

170
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:27,040
happens maybe something new discernment or Discerning to keep it

171
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:32,240
as a verb Discerning allows greater

172
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:40,320
creativity in in meeting a moment so to give some examples what

173
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,520
what what's being discerned things in the meditation but

174
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:51,319
also in daily life like what's the attitude of Mind toward What's Happening

175
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:57,079
Here what's the predominant mood with which I'm meeting this

176
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:02,480
experience various ways of asking what's my

177
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:09,720
relationship to this experience that is being known we can ask what what operating

178
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:16,200
system has been engaged here is this you know reaction

179
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:24,040
1.0 which which particular uh set of reactive impulses have been activated or

180
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:30,240
triggered by this situation is the Mind

181
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:35,400
operating with a lot of wanting in it a lot of aversion in it a lot of concern

182
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:40,760
with self in it this can be

183
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:51,240
discerned does the relationship that I have with this experience have stress in

184
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:57,319
it have suffering in it just like walking into a crowded room

185
00:36:57,319 --> 00:37:02,640
we can start to get very good at figuring out what's going on

186
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:09,480
here and then um how to respond the Discerning

187
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,800
also helps figure out what we might do in response to a

188
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:21,160
particular experience other words from here seeing

189
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:29,160
more clearly if not perfectly clearly sufficiently clearly what's going on

190
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:35,000
we can frequently sense which direction leads toward less suffering and less

191
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:41,000
harm which leads toward greater harm greater

192
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:51,359
suffering and this is a I think a really important thing to notice is that all we're doing is paying

193
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:56,440
attention the the direction is usually very clear not

194
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:01,920
always And yet when we get when we get good at this or when Discerning becomes

195
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:10,400
second nature taking a careful look seeing clearly becomes more second nature it also becomes more

196
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:16,440
obvious which of which which way of inclining the Mind leads towards greater

197
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:23,319
suffering and which way of inclining the Mind leads away we practice this in the meditation

198
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:28,480
so that it becomes easier in daily life it's not the only reason as I said yesterday today we practice it in

199
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:34,319
meditation because it leads toward deeper and deeper and more um enjoyable

200
00:38:34,319 --> 00:38:39,680
and refreshing and healing meditation in and of itself but it also helps us lean

201
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:45,960
in towards what's skillful and what's away from what's unskillful in in our

202
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:53,720
daily life so you can ask yourself what in

203
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:59,319
this situation seen with discernment seen with some

204
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:04,920
clarity what action of Mind of of speech

205
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:12,200
or of body what action leads toward greater harm and what leads toward a

206
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:19,319
avoiding harm causing on or as Gil has put it sometimes what

207
00:39:19,319 --> 00:39:29,920
might be born here what's waiting to be born here what might be born here that's

208
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:39,160
new so I think it's useful emphasizing as I've been trying to do all week and I

209
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:45,480
do a little bit just by taking wisdom from its place as kind of a high bar uh

210
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:53,640
and softening it I hope and making it more achievable by thinking of it as a verb

211
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:58,720
something we do instead of something we have something we apply instead of

212
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:06,680
something we achieve or attain and hold on to as ours something we seek to

213
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:14,720
perfect is not in other words not something we seek to perfect but something we seek to uh

214
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:24,440
learn to uh engage learn to take with us as we meet

215
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:30,760
experience something that is a a a way of meeting experience or a method for

216
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:36,319
meeting experience and coming to a decision about what kind of action is a

217
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:43,280
appropriate response so part of part of doing this too we can invoke this idea that it

218
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:49,400
doesn't have to be perfect it can be sufficient and it's as as we practice we

219
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:56,119
don't move directly toward um skillful action in one step what happens over

220
00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:02,079
time is that more and more we find ourselves in wholesome mind States and

221
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:07,760
from these wholesome mind States more and more skillful action uh

222
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:13,079
emanates and with time the the wholesome mind State and the skillful actions that

223
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:20,040
follow become the the more natural way that we that we meet

224
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:26,880
experience so the fact that we still um don't see as clearly as we'd like that

225
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:32,520
we respond in ways that are the same old ways we've always responded with frequently the same

226
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:38,520
results that doesn't mean that we can't at the very same time be on more and

227
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:45,400
more occasions finding ourselves with greater Clarity of Mind Discerning more clearly what's going on here what's

228
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:51,520
arising in my experience and meet that experience with

229
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:59,079
something new something that's more creative something that uh is more of a

230
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:03,920
skillful response than a reflexive

231
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:11,560
reaction and over time that proportion of skillful action eventually swamps on

232
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:17,800
skillful action and we become more and more effective at being

233
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:25,559
fully ourselves in the world so in sort of summarizing for the

234
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:31,319
week um and this could be done in any number of ways math was never my strong

235
00:42:31,319 --> 00:42:38,960
point there's probably some um way that this is a you know a matter of

236
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,760
um combining five different elements in a myad different

237
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:49,960
ways but what I'm struck by in just saying what I've just said is that as we

238
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:55,000
to give an example of how these five factors can be related that as we become

239
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,119
more skilled at Discerning a aware that okay there's some clear seeing happening

240
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:07,119
here and um in that clear say seeing or because of it or on the basis of it can

241
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:13,400
see that this way of inclining the mind of speaking of engaging in bodily action

242
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:19,960
this way is healthier for me for others this way

243
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:27,920
is a wholesome mind state that emanates in skillful action

244
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:33,160
with that our confidence grows confidence being the first of these five

245
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:38,280
faculties with that confidence growing the energetic balance that we talked

246
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:43,400
about on Tuesday becomes easier and easier there much less time is spent

247
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:49,800
doubting is this the right thing to do am I all the doubts that come up you

248
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:57,079
know particularly the doubt around do I have what it takes we come more skilled at Discerning our confidence grows less

249
00:43:57,079 --> 00:44:03,000
energ is wasted or unless heat is given off without any light in the area

250
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,559
of um uh the energetic balance that

251
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:13,920
energetic balance makes it much easier for mindfulness to be uh to come into

252
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:20,680
play to bring our attention to things without judging because that's a lot of energy lost there with the judging the

253
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:26,400
bringing in all the extra stuff we can just meet experience at ease with

254
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:32,760
mindful atten that in itself is free of all that extra

255
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:38,119
baggage that provides a basis as we said yesterday for sustaining that attention

256
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:43,440
in a way that brings great Stillness and gladness to the

257
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:51,280
mind so that's just briefly that's one way of relating relating these five faculties uh we could do that beginning

258
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:56,359
with any one of them and talk about how they all of them are strengthened by U

259
00:44:56,359 --> 00:45:01,960
considering a this way I'm going to I'm going to end on this note just to say

260
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:07,720
that uh it's been a pleasant week in the chat I noticed that uh there's some

261
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:14,000
exchange for somebody who has just realized that this morning meeting has been going on for four years and I

262
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:20,720
didn't I wasn't aware of it or i' forgotten it the Gil began with an exploration of the anapan Sati the

263
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:28,800
attention to mindful attention to the in andout W and I just thought I would uh close

264
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:35,000
this isn't the end of a four-year cycle or anything but uh it's been true I think throughout these four years

265
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,880
certainly when I've sat in that those same instructions show up

266
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:46,480
yesterday's instructions glading the mind steadying the Mind resting the mind

267
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:52,240
that's the third group of the four instru of the third group of four instructions of the 16 instructions that

268
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:58,160
appear in the anapan satita today's guided meditation focusing on knowing

269
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:05,000
the change that's going this is drawn I wasn't thinking about it but this is drawn from the fourth tetr or the fourth

270
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:11,000
group of four instructions that are part of that 16 part of those 16 instructions

271
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:17,520
in that in that discourse at any rate just want to say that we keep coming back to these foundational

272
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:23,680
practices the um the meditation experience and the way we meet it the

273
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:29,880
way we cultivate these faculties and these strengths of mind captured so well in that first discourse

274
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:35,040
that Gil discussed um this is the heart of the practice so anyway until we next

275
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:41,640
meet until our pnik cross I wish you all well and uh uh wish you all the best for

276
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:46,039
your practices and take care
