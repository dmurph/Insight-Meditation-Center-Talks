1
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,439
foreign

2
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,440
welcome everyone I'm Tanya Weiser really nice to have you all here and

3
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,840
don't worry if you weren't here last week you can also go to YouTube and

4
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,879
watch the video from last class because there's you know we won't be able to

5
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:57,480
review it all but we Don will give us a little bit of an overview or a reminder of what we covered

6
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:03,300
but it's all good so yeah warm warm welcome to each of you

7
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:09,000
in addition to YouTube I want to especially encourage you to go to audiodarma.org

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,600
because there you can either listen to an audio recording you can watch the video there and you can also download or

9
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:23,820
view any of the handouts so if you missed a class or just want a refresher that's a great resource

10
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,280
um and I just want to start before we really get into it by

11
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,640
asking if everyone's okay the practice here usually is that the teachers remove

12
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:43,200
their mask while teaching and that everybody else stays masked we've got HEPA filtration in the big system and

13
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,900
these little blue air filters all around so just make eye contact with me and let

14
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:55,640
me know whether or not that's all right with you okay all right great

15
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:13,680
okay now that I'm not wearing a mask is the volume still okay or am I blowing

16
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,500
you away so welcome to part two of a five-part

17
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,260
introduction to meditation series my name is Dawn Neil Tanya Weiser

18
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:31,860
already introduced herself and um just want to offer a really brief

19
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,379
overview of the highlights from last week the first week

20
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:43,739
this is a mindfulness course mindfulness meditation course and as many of you

21
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:50,640
probably know mindfulness meditation or mindfulness in general can be engaged in without being Buddhist

22
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,980
there's absolutely no requirement that you change your beliefs in any way

23
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:04,080
this is a cultivation of learning a certain kind of intimacy with life

24
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,080
of what's Happening while it's happening rather than thinking about it imagining

25
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:18,180
it projecting it remembering it and so that intimacy that checking in

26
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:25,500
with what's happening while it's happening is a more kind of direct experience than

27
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:32,099
living in the world of ideas what this tends to cultivate is the

28
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:39,180
capacity for choice but capacity for a distance between what is happening in

29
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:45,599
our world or in our minds and our response to it and um

30
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:52,620
that choice in um sort of the Buddhist ethics that we draw

31
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,659
on allows the possibility for non-harming a

32
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:03,239
life of non-harming and I like to think of it as non-harming

33
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:11,280
begins at home and our bodies our home our hearts our minds our home

34
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,100
so this body this heart this mind is where

35
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:24,600
we're going to be exploring and the home base for most of us here

36
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:31,259
is the breath and we use some kind of terms of art or special language that

37
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:39,060
I'll explain briefly um the breath is the home base

38
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:45,060
of where to bring the attention back to for most meditators that's also

39
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:53,520
sometimes called the anchor the anchor of your meditation or the object of attention so if we talk

40
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,280
about an object of attention we're just talking about what we're paying attention to on purpose

41
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,159
so you'll hear each of us use those words interchangeably

42
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:11,160
so meditating or many many forms of meditation but

43
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:17,520
mindfulness meditation is observing with awareness seeing knowing what's

44
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:25,620
happening here now while it's happening it's like a naturalist observing nature

45
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:31,680
and it's helpful in that process to

46
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:38,520
take an external posture that's comfortable but alert so you can just check in with how you're sitting now

47
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:46,199
and an internal posture or stance that is also balanced

48
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:52,259
open receptive kind forgiving

49
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:57,080
maybe even a little bit playful or experimental

50
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:04,620
so we covered two sitting two postures meditation postures last week sitting

51
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:11,759
and standing there's not time to go through the different sitting postures tonight later in the night I'll touch on

52
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,759
lying down as an option as well and and later on in the course we'll

53
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,919
talk about walking meditation so

54
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:28,020
that's a very brief overview does um if

55
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:33,720
you if there's anything else you want to say I think you could take a couple more minutes if there's just just saying if

56
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:39,240
you feel like there's okay um I think I'd like to see what

57
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:45,180
questions are in the room and then maybe I'll say a word or two after that so

58
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:51,300
does anybody have questions either based on what I've heard so far or based on what I've said so far what you've heard

59
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:56,300
so far or um from last week

60
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:11,039
we got a lot of people here who've done the class before or have never done the class at all so yeah so I think what I'd

61
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:18,099
like to do if you're all right with it is for us to start with names [Music]

62
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,539
maybe we can just go around and with Tanya

63
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,500
my name is Chelan

64
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:38,099
thank you Michael and Grace I'm Scott I'm Kevin

65
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:44,120
I'm Loki hi everyone Andrew

66
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:51,440
and Tanya great great

67
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:58,520
so um just tapping into what might be helpful

68
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:04,380
for those of you who have is there anyone here who's never meditated never

69
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:12,380
looked at an instruction nothing no okay

70
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,660
um I think maybe the only other thing that

71
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:24,120
is really important to say is that um

72
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:31,139
it's always always okay to begin again and again and again

73
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:37,560
and if thoughts are popping into your head or distractions are popping into your head and your mind is going all

74
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:44,640
over the place to just be easy with it it's pretty rare in meditation that

75
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:52,140
thinking stops and it's not necessarily what we're trying to cultivate especially when beginning

76
00:08:52,140 --> 00:09:00,540
it's much more about a hopeful healthy relationship to what's

77
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:08,519
happening in our hearts and minds and bodies that the incredible skill that this

78
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:13,640
practice confers and if I were to distill

79
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:20,100
all of Buddhist practice mindfulness practice down to one sentence I would

80
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:26,519
say the core of it is about relationship how we relate to reality

81
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:34,440
so that's what I have Tanya would you like to add anything before moving into the

82
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,440
instructions

83
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:46,440
I think I'll um since I'm talking next I think I'll go ahead and whenever you're done with this

84
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,959
section I'll just sort of maybe add my pieces and okay great

85
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:59,100
so we teach the class progressively we first week we focus on breath so that's

86
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:05,820
what we talked about last week was mindfulness of breathing and sort of the experience of where you

87
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:11,720
can feel the breath at the nose and the back of the throat the chest the belly

88
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:17,160
helping ourselves sort of invite ourselves to let the belly relax

89
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,860
so maybe put your hands over your belly buttons with me for a moment

90
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:29,580
see if you can breathe in and press your hands out with your breath letting your

91
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:34,220
belly really poke out

92
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:40,680
so it's shifting or breathing from a lot of us do chest breathing

93
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:46,800
and so the idea here is try and breathe into the hands expand the belly it's going to feel artificial and weird to

94
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:53,579
get started and then with exhale press you know the belly in with the

95
00:10:53,579 --> 00:11:00,500
hands and help bring the belly button toward the spine breathe out more air than you brought in

96
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:06,540
and then you'll feel yourself wanting to take a breath go ahead and let it come in deep and

97
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:13,760
you'll feel it's starting to right come in a little deeper easier just repeat that a few times right so breathing in

98
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,380
pressing the belly out with the hands our hands out with the belly

99
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:25,800
really full and then the exhale pushing and using your hands to support the belly button

100
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:31,320
going toward the spine and pressing out more air than you breathed in

101
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:37,500
and then waiting to feel that wanting to breathe and really allow to come down in

102
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:44,880
and deep could I see some bellies moving

103
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:51,240
Can you feel it in your belly you feel like you got the diaphragm oh yawning that's a good indicator

104
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:57,060
nice anybody feeling like they can't quite get it

105
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:02,940
oh okay good so just now allowing your breath to return to however it wants to

106
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:10,680
breathe this is just a nice practice when we get started to help us find that full breath

107
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:17,399
another thing is to lift those shoulders up and roll them back

108
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:23,700
kind of a counter stretch to how we go through most of the day in our lives

109
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:29,220
and you can press the elbows down towards your hips

110
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:34,380
kind of keeping the shoulders back but then allowing the hands to rest in your

111
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,519
lap or on your legs

112
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:45,540
so becoming connected to our breath can be very helpful for meditation it's

113
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:52,980
often kind of the core anchor object of attention sort of the

114
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:59,480
tether the things that kind of helps us stay connected to the present moment

115
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:11,339
you might just take a three breath Journey right now just see if you can't stay intimately connected with

116
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:19,019
your breath like kind of like writing a wave sort of the really letting it come in

117
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:25,860
and lift you up rising up and then the wave recedes just staying

118
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:31,019
really close to that whole expansion and contraction

119
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:36,899
seeing if there's a pause at the end of the exhale at the top of the inhale

120
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:43,579
just staying right with it just three breaths just three breaths

121
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,480
and then notice how you feel just notice what how it

122
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:09,600
felt to take a three breath Journey do you feel any different

123
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:16,579
you feel any more present a little bit yeah

124
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:22,560
sometimes um when we're having a meditation period it

125
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:30,660
can be helpful to come back to this idea of just three breaths just try and be with three breaths in a

126
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:37,260
row especially if we're struggling to stay present with our thinking or emotions

127
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:44,519
you know too much try this three breath Journey any point in your meditation

128
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:52,500
it's a goal that feels pretty doable and just and just enough to help us kind

129
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,639
of reset sometimes

130
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:06,480
so the amazing thing about breathing is um it is we can be aware of just the breath

131
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,660
but we also can feel the breath in the whole body

132
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:17,220
and just just see for a moment or two just see what happens if you just kind of open your

133
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:25,079
awareness up to fill your whole body here and experience your body breathing

134
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:28,040
what can you notice

135
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:41,399
you might want to once again take a longer deeper breath just because that gives you a little bit of an extra oxygen

136
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:48,740
boost that sometimes is very tangible in the body

137
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,920
it looks like you are all fairly comfortable with being with your breath is that correct is anybody

138
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,240
uncomfortable with the breath

139
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,300
no everybody's okay all right great

140
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:26,339
so let's imagine let's just pretend you were at class last week

141
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:31,740
you had these instructions you started to feel this intimacy with

142
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:38,880
the breathing and that you spent time cultivating your

143
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:45,720
relationship with breathing this last week he meditated or maybe you were aware of

144
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:52,800
your breathing as you walked around imagine sort of just doing that in and

145
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:59,040
out of the flow of your life now you might be feeling a little bit

146
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:06,000
more connected to the experience of breathing this this week after a week of

147
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,600
practicing

148
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:16,980
maybe you would have experienced some moments of like oh that was helpful

149
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:21,798
like remembering to take some breaths you know

150
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:33,840
and so this week we'll expand and this week the practice will be to start to

151
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:41,480
tune into the body the whole body and the experiences through the body

152
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:47,700
and that doesn't mean you won't notice breathing okay right so you're going to still

153
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:53,160
notice breathing but we're going to kind of expand like it's like growing the circles of

154
00:17:53,160 --> 00:18:00,299
awareness so last week we were working more on the breath and now we'll grow it a little bit and include all the

155
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:06,840
experiences that can happen through the body seeing touching smelling tasting

156
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:13,760
hearing Sensations in the whole body

157
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:24,019
but before we start you know I start giving instructions on how to do mindfulness of the body

158
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:31,740
you're going to hear this a lot I think from Donna and I we both emphasize this a lot which is this idea of

159
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:36,860
how are we relating to our body

160
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:44,280
and you know what what is your relationship with your body like

161
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:50,580
you know some people really feel at home and comfortable in their body and some people really feel

162
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:56,700
very uncomfortable in their body there's a James Joyce novel that starts

163
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:05,419
with uh describing the main character who lives just a little bit outside of his body

164
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:14,700
so when you think about yourself how much of you do you think lives and

165
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:20,880
grounds in your body and how much of you stays a little bit removed ahead of or

166
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,120
away from that felt sense of the body

167
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:33,780
so the you know if we if we're someone who tends to not be that comfortable not

168
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:40,080
that at home in our body it could either feel really great

169
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:46,980
to come home to the body or it also can sometimes mean that we feel feelings

170
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:52,260
that we haven't been wanting to feel so just

171
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:59,480
as much as you can be very compassionate with yourself and try and stay with what arises

172
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:06,960
I was trying to stay close to that feeling of the body sometimes we trust our body bodies a lot

173
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,380
we have a real like to me there's this awe you know like

174
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:19,140
we don't have to tell our body how to eat how to digest the food that we eat

175
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:24,900
just does it or to clean it out or to pump the blood

176
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:30,299
or like the body knows how to do this it's remarkable it has so much

177
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:36,720
intelligence in it can you imagine if we had to try and tell the body what to do with all these

178
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,179
processes that are going on and sometimes things happen in our lives

179
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:48,780
that trigger a sense of mistrust in our body because we get sick or something happens

180
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:54,780
so just check in right now and notice where's my trust level with my body

181
00:20:54,780 --> 00:21:00,780
right now it's important to honor what is

182
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:07,740
comfortable for you but what can you trust about your body

183
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:15,620
the hair grows my eyes blink I breathe

184
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:30,360
there's another part of our experience that can impact our relationship with our body which is kind of the commentary

185
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:37,440
The Narrative that we might have like I should be skinnier I should be more fit

186
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:43,919
I should be taller I should be shorter you know I should have

187
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,140
brown eyes or green eyes or blue eyes you know I should have curly hair no I

188
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:54,960
should have straight hair no I should have long hair short hair you know I shouldn't be balding I should be you

189
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:01,559
know like I should shave it all up there's so many messages that we get and can carry around

190
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:07,440
that have that affect our ability to settle in and be comfortable in the body

191
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,158
that we have

192
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:19,020
and this matters because we need to kind of understand are we coming to our body

193
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:25,320
with a sense of trust and comfort contentment as best we can

194
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:30,360
or are we hesitating or feeling critical

195
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:35,580
because that that energy of being critical or distancing or not wanting to

196
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:41,640
be in our bodies will affect our experience in meditation and so it's you

197
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:47,280
may not be able to change that but it's good to know it that inner posture the inner

198
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,919
relationship to ourselves and as much as possible be soft and kind

199
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:57,080
around it whatever's there

200
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:07,580
the thing about the body is it itself is not ruminating

201
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:14,700
Isn't that cool we our minds are but our bodies are not ruminating right the body is just

202
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:20,100
feeling and being present it's aware and vibrant

203
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:25,140
in in other words it's already mindful

204
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:32,100
so the body is this incredible Gateway incredible way for us to find the

205
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:37,260
present moment because you know if you just sit here

206
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:44,039
for a second and feel the sensations they're they're happening right here

207
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:53,120
they're changing you know can you feel into the sensations in your body

208
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:02,520
it's um the sensations are like the language of the body

209
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:09,179
it's how the body communicates it tells us a lot you know those feelings of butterfly when you're nervous well it's

210
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:16,620
actually connected to the brain and communicating you know what we're sensing

211
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:21,980
so there's a lot of wisdom for us to tune into in the body

212
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:30,360
the way that we let the body know it's heard is that we feel

213
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:37,820
it's like the listening is to feel to receive the sensations to receive the signals

214
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:46,559
Body Sensations can be pleasant and unpleasant and neither

215
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:53,760
kind of more neutral so sometimes it can be helpful just to have a very simple noting of oh this is

216
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:59,400
a pleasant sensation or this is unpleasant or I don't know this is neutral this is

217
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:04,740
neither plus a nor unpleasant and then just if we're having in

218
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:11,100
particular when we're having unpleasant Sensations just trying to keep it really simple and Don will talk about pain

219
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:16,220
working with pain in the body later you know

220
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:26,159
so you know are you any of you sports fans watch sports Nancy back there

221
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:31,640
how do you feel about the commentators in in sports

222
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:42,120
uh-huh yeah so you know I'm sure even if you aren't sports fans you've watched sports

223
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:48,539
right and you've heard the commentators right and they really pump up the energy

224
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:53,820
and some of them are too much maybe like Nancy's saying and others may be more

225
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:59,340
subtle right depending on the sport or the commentator and

226
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:07,440
um but if you can imagine whatever sport you might be thinking of in the moment imagine the volume off

227
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,919
you're watching the sport and there's no commentator

228
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:21,179
just seeing if you're watching tennis the flow maybe hear the you know ball or football

229
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:27,539
or you know whatever it is baseball soccer just seeing seeing the moment in

230
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:33,419
your mind's eye watching the sport without any comments

231
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:41,279
just the natural flow seeing things moving can you feel how different that might be

232
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:49,200
to watch the sports without the commentator I see grace saying yes anybody else can

233
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:57,120
you imagine how different that would be so in the same way actually when we're

234
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,460
meditating it's possible to turn off the commentator

235
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:09,419
to turn the volume way down anywhere to stop tuning in to the inner commentator

236
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:15,179
so just by tuning in just to the sensations to the flow of the breath to

237
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:20,400
the experience of hearing if you're having a hard time as you

238
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:28,700
meditate because the commentator is really going maybe open your eyes it's okay to open your eyes

239
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:34,919
what we want is to be present and we we need to trust

240
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:40,799
what helps us be present so even though we might invite you to close your eyes

241
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:49,399
if you're having a hard time orienting and it helps you to open your eyes please open your eyes

242
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:57,179
one little thing that after sometimes when we open our eyes we need to orient like we need to actually look around for

243
00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:03,779
a minute help us it's sort of like helping us oh yeah okay this is where I am

244
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:09,600
okay everybody else is meditating too okay I'm all right you know sometimes

245
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:15,059
that's kind of what we need to do after we do that then it can be

246
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:22,799
it can help settle if we just gaze like a 45 degree Slant with our eyes down on

247
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:28,220
the soft carpet just a soft dropping of the eyes

248
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:35,539
and and then let it sort of just be you know a little blurry

249
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:42,240
we take in a lot when we look around there's a lot of stimulation in the visual world

250
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:48,480
and so we need to learn how to direct our

251
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:54,960
awareness right and be with what we're directing so let's do a little experiment in this

252
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,600
regard to learning how to move our awareness around to choose what we focus

253
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:06,620
on so let's start by feeling our feet

254
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,139
so just what do you first notice just being aware

255
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:19,020
and then see if you can kind of let your feet be flat and really feel maybe even

256
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:24,179
pressed down a little bit and see if you can feel even pressure

257
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:30,539
on the inside outside edges the front and the back of the feet where they're making contact with the

258
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:36,899
carpet or the cushion maybe you can even tune in to where the

259
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:43,940
arch is that isn't pressing into the surface

260
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:51,480
that's feeling the sensations of the bottom of the feet and then maybe wrapping the awareness up to the top of

261
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:57,539
the feet and feeling you know sort of the tops of the toes maybe even

262
00:29:57,539 --> 00:30:03,179
can you feel into where the toenails are and if you can't feel just imagine this

263
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:08,279
whole Space nothing wrong if you don't feel any of

264
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:13,940
these details you can just hold your awareness around the area of your feet

265
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,880
and then just hold the foot the both feet as a whole

266
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:28,980
seeing what you can open to and sense into heat cool

267
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:34,919
tingling pressure skin touching skin like the toes

268
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:41,899
pressing into each other all these different things that we can feel and just our feet

269
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:47,840
and with the next inhale and exhale letting go of the feet

270
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:55,760
and then bringing your awareness up into like the head and the neck

271
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:04,279
is sort of exploring this area feeling maybe the jaw

272
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:08,960
cheeks nose

273
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:16,559
temples eyebrows maybe the forehead and with that

274
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:22,020
forehead just seeing if you can't take a deep breath in and invite not

275
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:29,000
forcing anything but just inviting a little bit of a relaxation in the face

276
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:37,760
we tend to hold a lot of tension in our eyebrow area eyes and face and jaw

277
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,710
[Applause]

278
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:53,240
I hear a yawn that's always good and then notice the top of the head

279
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,440
see if you can feel the hairs on your head

280
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:15,120
and then again expanding to feel the the whole of the head the front the sides

281
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:23,898
the back just feeling the sensations

282
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:32,120
how it feels different in the face than it does in the neck than it does on the head and the ears

283
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:40,640
and then taking a breath in and out letting go of the head and neck

284
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:49,039
and then let's place our hands if they're not already touching put your hands together

285
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,700
and fill your hands

286
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:02,240
just notice what you can feel build where they're warm when they're touching or maybe they're cold

287
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:10,440
Can You Feel the space in the middle of the Palms that aren't touching can you

288
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,840
feel what isn't tuck being touched

289
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:28,940
noticing the difference between the palms and the backs of the hands and how they feel different

290
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:36,179
how the air might be very gently very lightly cool when it where it

291
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:39,200
touches your hands

292
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,658
and then with the next inhale and exhale letting go of the hands

293
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:56,640
and then let me ask you what happened to your feet when you were paying attention

294
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:02,519
to your hands laughs or your head when you are paying

295
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:08,299
attention to your feet did you know you had a head when you were paying attention to your feet

296
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:15,300
you just did an amazing practice of moving your awareness of choosing what

297
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:22,138
you were paying attention to and it was all about Sensations and

298
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:27,319
experience you were having in your body in this moment

299
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:33,060
so it's not that we lose our hands our feet or head when we're paying attention

300
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:39,020
to something else they're always there

301
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:46,580
but we prioritized being aware of these body parts in this exercise

302
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:53,158
and so as we move into more of this meditation practice on the body

303
00:34:53,159 --> 00:35:00,599
the invitation is to prioritize being aware of Sensations in the body

304
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:06,200
doesn't mean you won't have thoughts or feelings emotions

305
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:13,560
you're just going to kind of prioritize what you're taking in what you're giving your awareness

306
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:20,220
which is what your most precious commodity in my view what you're giving your awareness to

307
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:24,140
what you're tuning it into

308
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:33,660
so it's very helpful to do this kind of as we did here with this light sense of curiosity and investigation

309
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:41,640
we were sort of exploring together would you say so bringing this this kind of inner

310
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:47,880
relationship like this inner relationship of being curious attentive

311
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,160
right we were very attentive here

312
00:35:53,820 --> 00:36:00,420
and we're sort of exploring what's happening how are things unfolding

313
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:06,140
did anyone try to make their feet feel a particular way

314
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:14,579
right we just came to see what was there and so this is the idea this is we just

315
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:21,119
had this perfect experience to help you right this reference of oh how did I do it oh yeah yeah

316
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:26,880
right so you don't need to make anything happen in your meditation

317
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:34,140
no two meditations will be the same it's really about opening up and being

318
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:40,920
with our experience tuning into what's happening in the present moment without a lot of the

319
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:48,480
extra commentary just the simple like noting maybe cool or warmer hands or sensation right

320
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:56,900
neutral unpleasant feelings whatever just just that little bit that's all we need

321
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:05,280
all right so you're all already meditating it feels

322
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:11,400
to me so we'll just kind of continue here for a little bit longer

323
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:17,579
and we'll start I'll start you with some guidance that's going to be focusing on the breath

324
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:23,760
just as kind of to give you that experience of tuning into the breath

325
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:29,299
and then we'll you know open it up a little bit to the body

326
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:38,460
so you might take a moment to adjust your posture maybe a rock back and forth

327
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:47,299
or front and back and just stretch a little bit maybe move the shoulders or you know

328
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:52,700
stand up if you want to do standing practice

329
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:00,660
and when we when we're sitting formally it's very helpful to be very conscious

330
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:08,160
about it sort of like okay we need to kind of tune tell our brains and our bodies okay

331
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:13,740
it's time we're gonna pay attention to our experience we're going to meditate

332
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:20,579
you know so all right so in this posture and taking a posture that's upright

333
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:25,920
so just a little bit of an uplift feeling like the head reaching toward

334
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:33,300
the ceiling and we're not if we slouch forward we're

335
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:39,240
going to cut off our capacity to breathe and we'll get kind of sleepy so we want to kind of pull it up and roll those

336
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:46,800
shoulders back feel the feet firmly planted and find the hands in a comfortable

337
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:56,060
posture and take a few deep breaths yeah

338
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:04,800
and notice if you're you know breathing with a diaphragm right now on

339
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:10,320
automatically and if you're not you might want to take

340
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,300
those conscious deeper belly breaths

341
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:21,839
it's kind of helpful pretty much every time I sit down I start with a few longer slower deeper breaths really

342
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:27,140
consciously breathing and helping reset my system

343
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:36,119
and so okay mind and body here we are

344
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:43,338
we are ready to pay attention to our experience of breathing

345
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:50,760
may I tune in to my experience of breathing and be curious and interested

346
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,020
and stay connected

347
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:06,000
you might just start by noticing the feeling of the breath it comes and

348
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,440
goes from the nostril area

349
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:27,540
can you feel the way that it feels different to inhale the air past your

350
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:31,520
nose versus exhale it

351
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:58,020
and you can also notice the feeling of the breath and the throat the back of the throat and

352
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:03,680
sort of massaging the chest and the belly

353
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:10,079
and just getting a feel for where is it easiest for me

354
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:17,099
to stay connected to breathing what part of the breath sit down in the belly

355
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:23,880
sit at the nose where is it easiest for me tonight

356
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:31,260
right now to feel the breathing and wherever that is just spend a few

357
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:36,660
breaths tuning in and being curious about that

358
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:40,099
area that experience

359
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:23,539
and you might notice at some point that your mind wants to think about something

360
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:29,060
it's what Minds do you think

361
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:39,680
so it's not a problem right just allowing the mind to have its thoughts

362
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:47,960
and if you happen to get caught up in thinking

363
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:56,000
some point you'll remember oh oh yeah

364
00:42:56,099 --> 00:43:00,500
I was trying to pay attention to my breathing

365
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:05,720
which means you're already mindful

366
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:12,260
which means we can just be like great

367
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:18,559
that's right I want to notice my breath

368
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,220
that's all that's all

369
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,500
how does this breath feel

370
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:50,900
thinking's nature it's not a problem

371
00:43:51,599 --> 00:44:01,079
we're working not on trying to make it not happen but just to change oh maybe how an enum how unraptured we

372
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:07,920
are by it to maybe be able to choose when we want

373
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:13,619
to think and pay attention to the Watson when we want to direct our awareness

374
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:17,539
to a different part of our experience

375
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:29,640
so if thinking is strong or emotions are strong you could just note oh thoughting

376
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:36,420
thinking's happening or emotion

377
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:50,119
just taking a few more of three breath Journeys here

378
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:35,299
and then allow your awareness to just open up to the whole body

379
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:44,180
wherever there's prominent Sensations or feelings

380
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:50,400
in the body just allowing those to be known be received

381
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:58,880
member Sensations is the language of the body and feeling them is how they're heard

382
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:49,579
just tuning in again to the sensations

383
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:56,960
maybe a gentle label of pulsing

384
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:05,640
cool warm keeping your awareness more on this

385
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:09,559
experience than on the name

386
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:42,078
maybe noticing hearing

387
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:23,559
[Music]

388
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:38,099
so there are two microphones on the floor which you both pick those up and

389
00:48:38,099 --> 00:48:45,060
turn them on there's a little button to push just kind of push it in and hold it pressed and you get your little green

390
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:50,460
light that's right and um you know this class is being

391
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:57,839
recorded so it's very helpful to use the microphone to speak into

392
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:04,800
and we're going to take a few minutes Don and I both to we would like to hear from you about what did you notice how

393
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:10,520
was it for you what was easy what was hard

394
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:15,720
do you have a question it's really a benefit to all of us if

395
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:21,839
you could share a few words about your experience and so Grace are you willing

396
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:24,859
to share something

397
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:36,000
batteries out a technical note if you hold it kind of

398
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,339
like this close close and sort of like pointing at your mouth

399
00:49:41,339 --> 00:49:44,359
it picks up

400
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:58,079
um maybe it's the energy of being together I was able to concentrate on

401
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:06,180
breeding better than doing it myself and this became easier to just

402
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:13,500
concentrate on breathing so that was my experience tonight and your boys very calming that really

403
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:19,619
helps stay with it beautiful yeah usually my thought just goes everywhere

404
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:24,660
and I can continue yeah so I'll just keep up but

405
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:30,000
today was very um I was able to sustain that peace just

406
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:37,800
culture and breathing um I like that great thank you Grace

407
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:44,760
thank you sharing and I'll start on this side I'm Scott and I had a rough day at the office I

408
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:50,579
thought I would cheat and have a drink before I came decided not to this is actually so relaxing as my first

409
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:56,280
meditation I almost find myself almost falling asleep twice which I normally don't do at this hour so it was really

410
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:01,619
interesting just seeing how calm and relaxing it took the stress of

411
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:04,039
the day away

412
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:17,819
hello dawn hello Tony hello everyone yes I I too as Scott was saying I was very

413
00:51:17,819 --> 00:51:23,760
relaxed which is why I was trying to keep my eyes open rather than clothes for this meditation because

414
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:29,040
um I did try the from last week's class the whole focusing on one area and then

415
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:35,640
just kind of zoning it out like keeping it within like my periphery kind of worked but then I

416
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:42,240
I found myself closing my eyes and then I'm like no I'm falling asleep so let me open them again and

417
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:48,000
but it was okay not trying to resist anything and just being mindful of the

418
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:55,380
breath and what else just knowing when I wasn't focusing on that just

419
00:51:55,380 --> 00:52:02,339
going back to that and it's just it's like Ping Pong back and forth yeah I'm

420
00:52:02,339 --> 00:52:08,220
like okay but um I was it was nice to know as Don had mentioned that in

421
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:15,359
meditation thinking is always present I mean but the awareness practice with the feed

422
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:20,819
in the hands it was very simple but then I realized oh my my presence isn't so

423
00:52:20,819 --> 00:52:27,680
much in my body but up here and right and I I'm like oh I sometimes I bring

424
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:33,980
whatever's up here into my meditation and then it's I'm aware of something that I would rather not be aware of

425
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:39,000
rather than just on the breath and just sitting and being

426
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:45,020
I was thank you great great chair thank you

427
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,099
thank you great

428
00:52:55,020 --> 00:53:03,720
hi my name is Chelan um what I've found is that it really it

429
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:09,780
really um is a real add-in to my life because I

430
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:15,420
find that if I really practice this breathing um when I go when I gone go to bed and

431
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:22,800
I'm thinking about all the things from the day and so I just focus on the breath and my body and you know just

432
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:29,099
relaxing and wow I'm out so it really is helpful that

433
00:53:29,099 --> 00:53:35,640
way I mean I'm doing it on purpose so I now if I sit here and I yeah then

434
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:44,220
I'm not doing that on purpose but it really helps helps me at night to just calm down and be able to doze off

435
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:49,640
great Nathan did you no

436
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:56,099
foreign am I allowed to fall asleep like maybe

437
00:53:56,099 --> 00:54:01,740
not in the beginning but like I've heard of like monks kind of falling asleep and it's like that's okay

438
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:10,200
yeah there are different schools I've thought about this as a beginner or relative

439
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:16,859
beginner it's helpful to try to stay awake um and unless you're using it

440
00:54:16,859 --> 00:54:25,099
intentionally I do the same thing at night I breathe myself to sleep and depending on the style of meditation

441
00:54:25,099 --> 00:54:30,599
it can be possible to watch your mind descending into sleep

442
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:36,780
so I don't recommend trying it at first necessarily but you could play with that at night and see

443
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:44,660
like what what's the last thought I noticed what's the last breath I notice

444
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:50,059
that's interesting thank you

445
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:58,920
anyone have any questions about the instructions anything that didn't feel very clear

446
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:03,680
or you want repeated or said differently

447
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:14,339
yeah thank you hi um when you when I'm concentrating on

448
00:55:14,339 --> 00:55:20,220
the breath and the commentator the Mind start you know disrupting or talking too

449
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:27,300
loud um I find it difficult to concentrate on the breath again so what I do is I I

450
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:32,640
don't know if it does okay but I just get one word and I just repeat it and

451
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:38,700
repeat it and repeat it until the comments go away and then go back into

452
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:45,839
the breath is that a no no a good thing

453
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:51,540
so there are so many different kinds of meditation and sometimes repeating one

454
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:56,760
word can be like a mantra meditation if you're trying to practice mindfulness

455
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:03,500
meditation you may try one word that's linked to your physical experience

456
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:09,839
like breathing or sitting or thinking

457
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:16,140
okay for me I find it super helpful to name whatever process is happening in a

458
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:21,359
simple way just naming that thinking is thinking okay

459
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:26,579
pops the awareness out of getting sucked into the thinking

460
00:56:26,579 --> 00:56:32,460
and that cultivates that muscle that Tanya's talking about that strength

461
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:39,300
so I don't know is that helpful at all yeah thank you and it's totally valid there are entirely valid traditions of

462
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:44,420
meditation that do use a word in fact in

463
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:49,740
some beginning meditation courses people will count from one to ten and Back

464
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:57,300
Again so if my mind is going absolutely Bonkers sometimes I still do that like

465
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:03,420
count the breaths exactly counting the breaths one on the in-breath one on the out breath two on the in-breath two on

466
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:08,660
the out breath so and that keeps it again linked to your physical Sensations

467
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:15,420
okay yeah it was really skillful what you did I mean it worked right I just

468
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:22,079
said one one one one great yeah uh so the commentator went away

469
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:27,780
beautiful so you know that's that's an example of um

470
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:32,880
choosing what you put your awareness on you were choosing to put it on the word

471
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:39,180
one right now like Don's saying try and Link it with what's hap something that's

472
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:45,540
happening right because that's the that's the kind of Pinnacle of mindfulness pain you know the present

473
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:53,280
moment practice of mindfulness but very skillful thank you yeah it doesn't work to try

474
00:57:53,280 --> 00:58:01,079
and fight with the thinking if you haven't noticed if you try and get in there and argue with it you're

475
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:08,280
just still thinking so you did a nice job of Shifting your awareness you were choosing

476
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:12,619
that's beautiful thank you

477
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:20,579
all right okay so that's also a beautiful example of

478
00:58:20,579 --> 00:58:27,059
creativity and meditation right and we want to encourage you to experiment and

479
00:58:27,059 --> 00:58:33,660
find ways that work for you it's okay to bring your intelligence your creativity

480
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:39,480
even a little bit of your imagination to your present moment experience the key

481
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:45,180
is to your present moment's experience imagination can easily go spinning off into

482
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:50,579
the virtual reality engines we all carry around inside of us

483
00:58:50,579 --> 00:58:56,339
so um I'm gonna do a little bit of a talk

484
00:58:56,339 --> 00:59:02,700
about working with discomfort and pain but before I start I'm going to model a

485
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:08,579
lying down posture right here on the floor and just to name

486
00:59:08,579 --> 00:59:13,619
that for me I started I came in through what we call the ducadorway the

487
00:59:13,619 --> 00:59:21,000
discomfort or pain suffering doorway into meditation so the lying down posture was my only

488
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:28,260
option for the first year or so so you don't need to do it in some ways it

489
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:33,359
is the most challenging posture because as many of you have noticed when the mind starts getting relaxed what are we

490
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:40,799
conditioned to do it's right fall asleep so but if you find you know you've got

491
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:45,839
awful back pain or hip pain or neck pain or something I just want to provide this

492
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:50,880
as an alternative and it's a completely valid form there's

493
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:57,960
many descriptions of the Buddha meditating lying down so he had a bad back towards the end of

494
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:03,799
his life so we're going to try this with the icon

495
01:00:04,819 --> 01:00:11,579
offer a couple of quick options you're welcome to use a little pillow

496
01:00:11,579 --> 01:00:16,980
behind your head or under your neck if that's helpful or one under your knees

497
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:23,640
I find it helpful to use if the intent is to stay awake and meditate a different spot or a different posture

498
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:28,799
than I sleep in so

499
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:33,900
one option is to leave your knees up like this and

500
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:39,780
you tint them so that they support each other and the pressure is very light as if

501
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:45,079
it's just enough to maybe hold a piece of paper between your knees

502
01:00:45,299 --> 01:00:50,400
or and or you can lift one hand up or

503
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:55,680
some people do both hands up 90 degrees

504
01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:01,200
it is pretty much impossible to fall asleep during this because as soon as you start

505
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:07,079
we'll do that and that wakes you up usually before your hand even hits the ground

506
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:14,040
and then another option is to take some kind of intentional posture with the

507
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:18,859
hands like this or this

508
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:27,900
so that's a way of relaxing your nervous system very quickly physically

509
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:33,180
and a really safe place to play with this is in bed at night before you're

510
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:41,720
ready to go to sleep because if you fall asleep it's all good you win either way

511
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:48,480
so working with pain

512
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:54,780
one of the most maybe the most helpful thing is

513
01:01:54,780 --> 01:02:01,339
again Tanya and I keep talking about noticing your relationship to what's happening

514
01:02:01,339 --> 01:02:07,920
noticing the relationship to any discomfort in the body I'm talking here

515
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:14,160
tonight about physical pain we'll talk about more emotional kinds of stuff later in the course

516
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:19,440
so um pain is composed of layers there's the

517
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:26,819
raw Sensation that the nerves are sending to the brain and then there is the layer of the

518
01:02:26,819 --> 01:02:32,280
mental response to it and pain is often

519
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:38,579
hard to ignore it is designed to be hard to ignore this is not a coincidence right

520
01:02:38,579 --> 01:02:45,319
so any layers of extra reactivity resistance

521
01:02:45,319 --> 01:02:51,540
disliking anger that is directed towards the pain

522
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:59,220
clinical Studies have shown it does make the subjective experience of the pain worse sometimes much worse

523
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:06,599
now it's far easier for me to say that from than for any of us to change our relationship to it

524
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:12,059
however knowing it might be helpful right just knowing that

525
01:03:12,059 --> 01:03:19,079
so um to give one of the most helpful attitudes to bring relationships to

526
01:03:19,079 --> 01:03:26,220
bring is to consider this body your lifelong companion your lifelong

527
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:32,940
companion and to offer compassion towards that part of the body or just

528
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:40,200
your whole body as it hurts that mental attitude will often help

529
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:46,440
soften things some for me when I first started experiencing major pain I blamed myself

530
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:52,140
and guess what that did right

531
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:59,220
okay so on a practical level that's noticing the inner commentary

532
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:05,700
am I bludgeoning the pain am I budgeting myself because of the pain can I be kind can I notice the tone of

533
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:12,020
my internal voice so that to one way of approaching it

534
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:18,119
noting labeling as Tanya was talking about is also really helpful

535
01:04:18,119 --> 01:04:25,440
and you can label using hurts or pain it's actually more helpful to drop it

536
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:30,720
down a level to kind of the raw sensation

537
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:36,359
so is it burning is it hot

538
01:04:36,359 --> 01:04:41,760
is it contracted intense just noticing all the little Sensations

539
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:46,799
around it okay so that's another way of working

540
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:53,280
with it micro Sensations within the pain and each of these techniques work for

541
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:58,380
different people at different times okay okay I'm naming each of them and you can

542
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:03,780
use them in concert with each other if the pain is really intense sometimes

543
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:10,920
it's helpful to be around the edges of it right not dive straight in the middle

544
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:18,000
although if your mindfulness is strong really focusing on it without aversion

545
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:25,200
without them or attitude can actually help it decompose to its

546
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:30,780
the sensations that make it up and it can dissolve or shift or change and to

547
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:36,980
notice all of the little Sensations that are dissolving shifting changing

548
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:42,359
when we're having an negative relationship to a

549
01:05:42,359 --> 01:05:48,059
pain it's really easy for it to become really solid and feel kind of like a block

550
01:05:48,059 --> 01:05:55,140
and if we get curious almost nothing in our bodies is actually the same for very long

551
01:05:55,140 --> 01:06:01,559
and so to just notice the shifting notice that and they're even usually

552
01:06:01,559 --> 01:06:08,880
little gaps moments of not pain or places technique number three places

553
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:14,400
in the body where there are not pain there is not pain when I first started practicing I got

554
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:19,280
this instruction on the only place I could find was my earlobe

555
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:27,480
so I focused on my earlobe both earlobes actually so it can be like almost like finding a

556
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:32,520
safe space in your body tip of the nose works for a lot of people

557
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:38,520
elbow sometimes toe so um

558
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:43,980
it's like Tanya was talking about that practice of intentionally Shifting the attention

559
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:50,400
it's the opposite of the allowing it of the attention to rest in it if that's

560
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:55,980
too intense shift it somewhere else it can be the whole body maybe the

561
01:06:55,980 --> 01:07:04,160
container your whole body feels better than just that one spot

562
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:13,559
um so the classic kind of instruction is to turn attention towards the predominant

563
01:07:13,559 --> 01:07:21,720
sensation for as long as it lasts and when it shifts and changes to return your attention

564
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:27,799
to whatever was your major focus of the whole body the breath

565
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:33,240
another way of approaching it is um

566
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:39,299
in that sort of safe space if it's too much is to

567
01:07:39,299 --> 01:07:46,020
practice with another anchor object of attention entirely

568
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:53,579
and that for many people is sound sound tends to bring us out the

569
01:07:53,579 --> 01:08:00,059
attention outward and I don't know if any of you could just hear the distant sound of the train

570
01:08:00,059 --> 01:08:06,359
I that's a really good example you can almost feel your attention expanding out

571
01:08:06,359 --> 01:08:15,000
to where the sound is that's often the perception and allowing the attention to rest there

572
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:21,838
can provide a perception of more space

573
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:29,239
for the sensation to be in so

574
01:08:29,819 --> 01:08:38,100
just to invite all of us to take a few minutes to let that rest

575
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:45,000
do you have any specific questions about what I just said before I start us in a meditation anything that I said that

576
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:51,660
didn't make sense okay we'll play with it and there'll be more

577
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:58,400
opportunity for questions later so finding a comfortable posture

578
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:03,540
balances relaxation and alertness however makes most sense for you right

579
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:10,100
now sitting standing lying down

580
01:09:12,239 --> 01:09:19,040
and taking a moment to notice your whole body

581
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:26,299
just how it is right now in a really General sense

582
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:38,000
noticing sensations of warmth or cool

583
01:09:39,239 --> 01:09:44,539
contact of your feet on cushion or floor

584
01:09:47,699 --> 01:09:52,859
all of the little emotions and Sensations that let you know this body

585
01:09:52,859 --> 01:09:55,400
is alive

586
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:16,560
and now allowing the sensation of breathing for just a

587
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:21,380
moment or two maybe in your belly your diaphragm

588
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,099
to be your anchor

589
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:36,679
one two three breaths three breath Journey

590
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:58,699
and then to notice expand the attention through your body

591
01:10:58,739 --> 01:11:04,800
and notice if there are any predominant Sensations other than breathing

592
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:10,760
it could be discomfort or pain or it could just be something else and

593
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:15,560
the purpose of experimenting

594
01:11:19,699 --> 01:11:25,020
allowing that that sensation

595
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:30,500
be the main focus object of attention for a moment

596
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:40,699
noticing the area around the sensation

597
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:50,658
noticing any tiny shifts

598
01:11:51,360 --> 01:12:00,080
micro changes within the area maybe a bunch of little Sensations

599
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:07,880
noticing any way it changes

600
01:12:10,199 --> 01:12:15,800
maybe applying a soft label a mental note

601
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:18,800
bribing it

602
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:41,120
and now if it is faded

603
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:50,119
Shifting the attention again back to the breathing

604
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:07,698
and when the next sensation comes along besides breathing

605
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:12,739
allowing that to be in the foreground

606
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:23,960
noticing the area around it within it

607
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:35,179
noting simply the difference is there

608
01:13:58,679 --> 01:14:06,300
and now inviting the attention to move to hearing

609
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:08,960
sound

610
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:15,860
perhaps the sound of my voice

611
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:24,739
the soft sounds in the room in the building

612
01:14:29,159 --> 01:14:35,719
distant sounds of movement

613
01:14:36,179 --> 01:14:39,679
outside of the building

614
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:58,940
noticing the coming and going of sound

615
01:17:55,380 --> 01:18:02,100
noticing the relationship of your mind and your

616
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:06,920
heart with the sounds

617
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:12,840
[Music]

618
01:18:18,470 --> 01:18:23,289
[Music]

619
01:18:29,190 --> 01:18:33,670
[Music]

620
01:18:48,659 --> 01:18:54,900
so thank you for your practice and now we have another brief period of

621
01:18:54,900 --> 01:19:01,520
questions sharings answers with both Tanya and myself

622
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:11,719
thank you for the meditation Don you're welcome

623
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:17,658
what'd you guys notice

624
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:28,679
hi oh sorry

625
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:37,260
um for me this standing meditation here really works I the commentator goes away

626
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:43,980
and I was concentrating it is more focused on my

627
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:49,260
on my body and the sensations and and so

628
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:56,580
it was I really like it really on breathing and balance it was that

629
01:19:56,580 --> 01:20:01,739
beautiful me beautiful so let me make sure I understood you you said that

630
01:20:01,739 --> 01:20:06,960
particular meditation session you felt like the commentator really

631
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:12,300
died back yes uh the previous session I did the

632
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:19,140
standing too but it was more towards not falling asleep it was to be when I was

633
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:24,300
sitting down I was so relaxed I was falling asleep yeah but this time the

634
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:29,640
standard meditation was I barely had a commentator it was just

635
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:37,080
breathing and and balancing my body to be standing relaxing and and at the same

636
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:42,560
time aware wonderful thank you

637
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:49,560
hello um I have a question regarding like when you're

638
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:54,840
meditating and you're your attention is on the pain whether it

639
01:20:54,840 --> 01:21:00,120
be like a sensation I know for this talk it was about like

640
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:07,199
body sensation but what if you are thinking about something that's bothering you that's painful but it's

641
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:12,719
emotional and I suppose like when I do resist I don't

642
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:20,340
know if that's should I wait next week for the next come back next week it's perfect it's great it's all that's

643
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:26,400
you're right on track that's right hold that Curiosity yeah yeah

644
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:32,699
it's a great question [Music] and you can if you have stuff come up

645
01:21:32,699 --> 01:21:42,239
you can use some of these tips just to apply them kindness always helps

646
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:48,239
what like I found myself in the meditation like oh I I ate too much

647
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:54,960
before going to the meditation so I'm feeling uncomfortable but I'm like I just noted that and and so that was okay

648
01:21:54,960 --> 01:22:00,719
but like what what else can I say regarding that like oh may I be happy

649
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:07,560
safe peaceful and and free that that thing I mean beyond that

650
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:13,380
or just like what else do I say or do I have to say something in particular

651
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:21,840
so it's a bigger question um you don't need to say anything

652
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:27,780
necessarily but just like the the shortest version

653
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:34,920
is it's okay it's okay but you hear the tone of my voice

654
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:40,520
it's more about the tone than whatever the words are

655
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:46,679
and just like Tanya has been saying notice it it's great noticing that

656
01:22:46,679 --> 01:22:52,020
you're noticing it that's good mindfulness and so

657
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:55,520
to feel good about that

658
01:23:08,699 --> 01:23:14,400
any other questions or comments I'm really curious how that meditation

659
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:18,980
was for some of the other people in the room

660
01:23:21,179 --> 01:23:27,199
did you ever come it looked like you were I was kind of rubbing my knee but I do have a question

661
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:33,300
oh my God thank you Mike I'm a bad I have a bad knee and it's been bothering me but um earlier you had said something

662
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:39,719
along the lines that a researcher study showed something about exacerbating the pain if you thought I was wondering if

663
01:23:39,719 --> 01:23:47,340
you could repeat that I didn't catch that part yeah yeah so um clinical pain psychologists research

664
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:52,699
psychologists have discovered that um

665
01:23:53,840 --> 01:24:00,540
catastrophizing pain or having a really negative attitude about it or like oh

666
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:06,960
this is going to last forever and it's horrible and it's going to get worse all of those things actually increase our

667
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:13,080
subjective experience of the pain like it actually feels worse

668
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:19,380
um even this is a little Jedi mind trick that I didn't think to put in the talk but

669
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:27,000
um calling it my pain can make it stronger and allow and just noticing pain is

670
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:33,600
arising or discomfort is arising can disidentify with it a little bit so that

671
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:39,179
it is not quite as strong so it's so much about what you were

672
01:24:39,179 --> 01:24:45,060
talking about like that that voice that commentary is um

673
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:52,400
a lot of what can help lock it in or increase it or start to

674
01:24:52,620 --> 01:25:00,480
ease it a little bit it's it's both psychology and sensation is in pain

675
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:06,480
I hope was that helpful yeah yeah that's very helpful I just kind of missed that part it might be a question for next

676
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:13,560
week though but I wonder how that is also related to like the um psychological pain or the emotional pain

677
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:19,620
well I'll say one real quick thing which is that actually physical pain and

678
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:28,500
emotional pain share the same circuits in the brain so they are very connected and and in

679
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:33,719
fact there's studies now that are being done on painkillers and how they can

680
01:25:33,719 --> 01:25:40,140
affect your emotional states so yep Tylenol I saw one in particular

681
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:46,460
in Tylenol that um so there you go

682
01:25:47,159 --> 01:25:52,199
a quick bit um so I've been coming here for a few months now and then today traffic was hectic and I thought I

683
01:25:52,199 --> 01:25:59,520
should just turn around I'm not going to have good meditation session or whatnot but I was able to drop into the mindfulness and and have a good

684
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:04,980
meditation session but I've noticed I used to have a judgey part of myself when I first started coming here my mind

685
01:26:04,980 --> 01:26:11,280
is wandering I'm thinking about something embarrassing that happened and I'd really Snappy judgy and now I notice

686
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:16,560
myself being a lot more compassionate but I'm starting to mourn at the old uh

687
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:25,739
um sort of uh judge EB but yeah that's just something I noticed today that's beautiful great example of noticing how

688
01:26:25,739 --> 01:26:31,880
you're relating the inner relationship it's this this practice is

689
01:26:31,980 --> 01:26:38,460
you can't do this practice without paying attention to how you're relating to yourself yeah

690
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:43,679
it's so critical it makes all the difference it will

691
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:48,679
completely impact your experience of meditating

692
01:26:50,420 --> 01:26:53,719
me too

693
01:26:55,440 --> 01:27:03,138
so let me shift and just give you um just a reminder as you hopefully you all got a handout

694
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:09,080
on the second side it has your your homework

695
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:14,639
so the invitation is to practice for 20 minutes every day

696
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:24,000
I always like to say you know it's more important that you practice every day than for 20 minutes so if you

697
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:30,060
can't do 20 to 15 if you can't do 15 do 10 if you can't do 10 do five if you

698
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:36,300
can't do 10 do two right or five you could do two but and

699
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:44,000
you can also break it up so the goal is to try and get 20 minutes of practice every day

700
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:50,280
yeah so this week mindfulness of the body

701
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:55,560
that the what we were doing in in this sculpt room together that's what we want

702
01:27:55,560 --> 01:28:00,960
you to practice this week and the handout will have some beautiful instructions for you to help you

703
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:06,060
remember so um

704
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:13,440
another invitation is that you know during a two-hour period of the week

705
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:20,940
being mindful of your body while you're doing something right periodically noticing what's

706
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:27,300
happening your shoulders your stomach your face your breathing right just

707
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:33,540
noticing tension and just ease and try and relax when you

708
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:39,060
find yourself tensing up the third thing invitation is to do one

709
01:28:39,060 --> 01:28:44,219
meal mindfully eating this really practice mindfulness of

710
01:28:44,219 --> 01:28:50,219
eating it's the body and wow there's some great things to start to notice

711
01:28:50,219 --> 01:28:55,920
you might start salivating before you get your food in your mouth you know if you take your time you'll you can notice

712
01:28:55,920 --> 01:29:04,380
these things and then the fourth is to kind of be curious about when when it

713
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:10,820
is your attention gets distracted or fragmented or you know

714
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:16,800
pulled into something that you don't you didn't really Choose Or wouldn't want to choose to pay attention to so start to

715
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:24,719
notice what your patterns are where do you get caught where does your attention get snagged in something

716
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:30,540
um and then if you have if you have anybody you're talking to about meditation take

717
01:29:30,540 --> 01:29:34,639
time to share what you're noticing with them

718
01:29:35,639 --> 01:29:42,179
we're over a minute so let me move quickly then into just the dedication of Merit which is

719
01:29:42,179 --> 01:29:48,900
um you know we have in this in this lineage it's very important to understand that

720
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:57,360
we practice for ourselves others and both right we that we benefit ourselves but

721
01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:04,080
as we benefit ourselves we benefit others and it benefits both and that we it's very helpful to

722
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:10,320
acknowledge this and so may we dedicate the benefits of

723
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:16,260
this practice to all beings everywhere without

724
01:30:16,260 --> 01:30:23,699
exception may all beings benefit from being able to direct their awareness

725
01:30:23,699 --> 01:30:30,138
and tune into how they're being aware of their experience

726
01:30:32,270 --> 01:30:35,609
[Music]

727
01:30:37,620 --> 01:30:44,940

728

729
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:57,780

730
01:30:57,780 --> 01:31:02,179
all right take care you guys
