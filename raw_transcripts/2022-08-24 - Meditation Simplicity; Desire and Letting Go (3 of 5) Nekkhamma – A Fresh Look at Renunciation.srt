1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,120
okay it's good to see everyone nice to see all of you joining hello

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,600
this always feels nice to know how many people are out there from so many different places

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,640
so we can feel connected in our worldwide sangha as someone said in

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:29,439
their comment so why don't we go ahead and get started

5
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:36,079
let's sit together so just bringing the attention

6
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,520
to your body your mind sitting here

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,520
however you are now and just finding

8
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:55,280
your spot settling in letting go of whatever you had to do to

9
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:02,800
get here so that you can be here

10
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,840
if you're comfortable doing so you can close your eyes

11
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,520
but you don't have to and just allow the posture

12
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,320
to settle into something that's upright and also relaxed

13
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:32,840
connecting in with the sense of the straightness of the spine

14
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:47,759
by the place that you're sitting [Music] your seat against the cushion or the chair is a

15
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:55,798
solid foundation and then the body rising up from that

16
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:04,880
sometimes i have the image of a sea plant rising off the sea floor

17
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:12,000
so it's held at the bottom and then the rest of the body can kind of float upward

18
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,440
softening the eyes the jaw the neck

19
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:36,120
softening the shoulders the arms

20
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,599
down through the torso area

21
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:55,280
just relaxing the muscles that are around that straight spine [Music]

22
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:02,280
muscles of the chest the belly the low back

23
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,840
releasing any bracing in the legs

24
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,840
and feeling all the way into the feet

25
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,120
so just bringing the attention through the body

26
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,799
to invite some degree of ease

27
00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:01,840
and then turning the attention toward perhaps the sensations of breathing

28
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:10,000
or the body sitting whatever feels easier to connect to

29
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:17,680
and just allowing the mind to naturally know what's happening with the body or the

30
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:24,600
breath in a simple way

31
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,520
maybe opening to sounds also in a simple way

32
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:54,320
we don't have control over what we'll hear next so it can be useful

33
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,000
just to connect to the sounds

34
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:10,400
the intention for this sit is to invite this connection to

35
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,560
simplicity in the body and in the mind

36
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:24,030
so we have a simple object like the breath or the posture

37
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,110
[Music]

38
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,840
we can maybe even see how simple that could get so instead

39
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:44,639
of oh that's my back and i need to sit in a certain posture so that my

40
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,520
cervical vertebra are at the right angle

41
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,918
we can just feel a slight amount of pressure

42
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,080
shifting easing of the pressure

43
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:08,639
or in the breath simple sensations like the touch of the air against the

44
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,840
upper lip or the nostrils the

45
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,160
coolness of the air as it goes in

46
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:27,039
simple feelings like expansion or the touch of the clothing on the skin

47
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:33,840
shifting i sometimes call these the elemental

48
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,280
sensations of the breath very simple

49
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:46,919
not about concepts like body parts or difficulties

50
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,240
simple

51
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,479
when we have a simple connection to the body and the breath

52
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,638
that encourages the mind also to be simple

53
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:33,360
we can feel that a lot of thoughts are complicated

54
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:43,039
they're about complicated abstract ideas

55
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:51,360
intricate stories trade-offs and balances

56
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,960
hopes and fears

57
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:04,800
and what if all of that was just for this sitting just thought

58
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,319
we don't need to figure any of that out now

59
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:20,960
so bringing our mindfulness back to the very simple

60
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,319
aspects of having mind and a body

61
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:47,800
it could even be said if it's not simple it's not mindfulness

62
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,680
if the mind has gotten complicated

63
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:17,600
and we just tuned back in to something simple

64
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:26,360
a sound an elemental sensation

65
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,800
a simple label of thought

66
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,040
um

67
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:53,369
[Music]

68
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:49,920
we may begin to sense that simplicity is connected with ease

69
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,880
allow the body to relax

70
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,750
allow the mind to rest in non-complication

71
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:14,959
[Music] and sense the particular form of ease that comes from simplicity

72
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,399
the distinctive flavor of that

73
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:41,880
sometimes the mind is dissatisfied with simplicity

74
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:48,639
wishes for something more stimulating

75
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:57,120
and even that is simple it's just the simple dissatisfaction of the mind

76
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,400
another thing to notice

77
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:09,120
and if there's any sense of joy or

78
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:17,360
peace associated with inclining toward the simple

79
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,320
that can also be noticed

80
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:37,720
it's even a simple kind of happiness that's possible for humans

81
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:53,840
just resting with the body and mind in a simple way

82
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:33,720
to cultivate simplicity is not to become simplistic

83
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:45,039
in fact cultivating simplicity allows the mind

84
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:49,519
to be more open and available

85
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,639
so that we can see more nuance

86
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:02,080
maybe more subtlety in situations that we're in

87
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:12,480
so perhaps feeling into how the simple mind

88
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,840
can be responsive

89
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,480
has more flexibility than a mind that is

90
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,158
caught up in complicated scenarios

91
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,960
many concepts and

92
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:46,919
ideas feeling the openness of the simple mind

93
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,039
so we can sense how this kind of simplicity

94
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:12,799
the simplicity that comes with awareness and mindfulness

95
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,320
it's actually a service to the world

96
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:25,360
to have this openness this ability to respond

97
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:34,240
not having so many preconceived ideas or knowing already what something is as we

98
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:41,440
come into it it makes us more caring more able to

99
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,559
help others if we're so inclined toward that

100
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,840
it's the complicated knotted up mind and body

101
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,760
that can't be easily of service

102
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:09,360
so maybe for today an idea could be to

103
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:17,840
approach your life with a sense of seeing it in a simple way

104
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:26,000
some new situation oh i wonder what this is i won't assume that i know

105
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:33,840
already or even a familiar emotion or feeling that comes up

106
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:39,039
oh yeah there's that same feeling of anger i know anger

107
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:44,080
maybe you don't what if we just looked at it in a simple

108
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:50,720
way and the same with other people could we

109
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:59,120
see our partner fresh not the way we know they already are

110
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,039
or our children or our pets

111
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:08,278
people that we meet

112
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:21,360
so that we might offer something of benefit today

113
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:31,760
it comes when we are not so caught up in complication

114
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,799
some way that we can help

115
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,670
[Music]

116
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,789
[Music]

117
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:25,360
okay so today i'm i'm traveling over the um

118
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:32,559
yesterday and today and i stayed overnight at a friend's house which is where i am this morning

119
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:40,159
and they have a completely beautiful home they've lived here for a long time and

120
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:46,880
it's grown to be a space with a lot of love and care in it and it seems like everywhere the eye falls

121
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:52,240
there's some beautiful thing that they've brought from somewhere and

122
00:30:52,240 --> 00:31:00,559
used to decorate the place so i think it's the perfect setting for our uh topic this week of desire and

123
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:06,559
letting go yesterday we talked about sense pleasure and sense desire

124
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:12,399
and i find it intriguing how people hear the buddha's teachings about this um

125
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:17,840
how they hear it compared to what the teachings actually say and what the teachings say is that these

126
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,880
things simply that these things are not ultimately satisfying and that they're

127
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:29,120
not the deepest form of human happiness whereas what people tend to hear is they

128
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:35,200
hear judgment or right and wrong or some directive to stop enjoying things or to

129
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:41,200
get rid of things that's an interesting reaction to explore in your mind

130
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,240
so being here in this beautiful place is the perfect setting to talk about

131
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:54,000
renunciation which is today's topic so yesterday we talked about how

132
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,600
not only the buddha's teachings but also our practice enables us to see

133
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:05,679
that sense desire and sensual pleasures are not they're not all that they're cracked up

134
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:13,200
to be you know they're not ultimately satisfying and the word as we said for this whole sense domain that we humans

135
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:20,559
find so enticing is comma the long a comma

136
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:26,480
so the buddha also talked about a term called me comma

137
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,679
and that is the word that's usually translated as renunciation but please

138
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:37,360
hold on to your associations with that word um it's going to be a little bit different

139
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:43,600
so it's an interesting word nicoma necoma can be resolved into its

140
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:49,039
linguistic roots in two different ways one of them is

141
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:55,279
near plus comma the negation of comma essentially so that would mean something like

142
00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:02,159
restraint of sensual desire uh doing so out of wisdom and we'll talk about that in a moment

143
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:08,159
and then another way to resolve it is uh nis plus committee

144
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:14,720
which is a verb and the verbal form would be knee committee which means something like walk away

145
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:20,159
from and uh the related noun nakama would mean

146
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:27,360
leaving a life of pursuing cinch pleasures or more abstractly turning away from greed hatred and

147
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:32,559
delusion and it may be that there's a play on words and both of those meanings are

148
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:40,399
intended in the word new comma so it's interesting right because the first meaning of opposing sense pleasure

149
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:46,720
tends to invite our common association of renunciation with grim austerity

150
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:53,279
and then the second meaning of about letting go of great hatred and delusion well that's the aim of the

151
00:33:53,279 --> 00:34:00,480
buddhist path that's very inspiring and it's what peace and the deepest happiness are

152
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:06,559
so there seems to be something of a contrast maybe in our associations so we see that we're going to have to

153
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:13,599
maybe release our english our associations with the english word renunciation

154
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:18,878
so let's see you know more carefully where this word nakama is used in the

155
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:25,919
buddhist teachings and how how the buddha meant that word so we're talking today about

156
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:32,320
two triads two sets of three of qualities that are are contrasting

157
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:39,440
each other they're almost opposing each other and one of them is an unskillful triad or unwholesome and the other is a

158
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,878
skillful triad of qualities so in the unskillful one

159
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:52,079
comma is put together with ill will and cruelty so we have sense desire ill will and

160
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:58,240
cruelty linked together on one side so as we saw yesterday uh sense desire

161
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:04,720
and pleasure don't come off too well in buddhist teachings they're linked to ill will and cruelty

162
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:11,839
and then the skillful one is the opposite it's me comma or renunciation and non-ill will and

163
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:16,880
non-cruelty so we see that renunciation which we could

164
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,480
also call letting go is connected with qualities of care and kindness

165
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:29,200
the absence of ill will and cruelty so this is where we have to suspend our common western associations with

166
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:35,839
renunciation it's different in buddhism i don't think that there's a single

167
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:42,480
maybe a better single word to translate the word nakama if i had to translate it as one single word okay probably

168
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,760
renunciation is good but the range of meaning is different in the dharma than

169
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:54,079
it is in our common associations so these two triads

170
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:59,119
in the teachings these two sets of three are connected to some important

171
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:04,720
activities of our mind it's connected to intentions thoughts

172
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:10,880
and perceptions so that's and those are important movements of mind

173
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:16,240
so for example um in the eightfold path the second step

174
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,599
is wise intention or right intention or appropriate

175
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:28,400
intention and the definition the very definition

176
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,680
of wise intention is the intention of renunciation the intention of non-ill

177
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:40,160
will and the intention of non-cruelty that's the definition so it's the second step of the april

178
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:47,119
path and then there's also a suta where the buddha talks about this

179
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:53,359
is before his awakening he talks about how he looked at his own thoughts so we're now looking at thoughts rather

180
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:58,400
than intentions and i want to read a section from that suta

181
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:04,800
he says as i abided thus diligent ardent and resolute a thought

182
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:11,359
of sensual desire and the word is comma there arose in me i understood thus

183
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:16,960
this thought of sensual desire has arisen in me this leads to my own affliction to

184
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:26,240
others affliction and to the affliction of both it obstructs wisdom causes difficulty and leads away from nibana

185
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:31,280
and then he says a thought of renunciation has arisen in me me comma

186
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:38,640
this does not lead to my own affliction or to others affliction or to the affliction of both it aids wisdom does

187
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:44,320
not cause difficulties and leads to nibana and then there are other

188
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:51,599
sutas that mention that sensual thoughts have a kind of a blinding or obscuring qualities to them whereas renunciation

189
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:57,440
thoughts uh remove blindness and produce vision and have sort of openness and clarity

190
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:04,160
to them and sometimes as i said that triad applies to perceptions sonia

191
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:09,359
instead of thoughts so um [Music] so it's interesting we'll have to check

192
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:16,320
for ourselves if that's really true but it does seem to me that when my thought my my thoughts are very much caught up

193
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,680
in things that i want or even things that i enjoy there's a little bit of narrowing a

194
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:27,440
little bit of um yeah of obstruction in some way whereas

195
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,880
when i even if i'm in the presence of things that are beautiful like i am here in this house

196
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:39,680
uh if it's not a sense of grasping onto it then there's just a feeling of openness and clarity i

197
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,960
can see those things and uh and my mind is still wise

198
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:51,440
so the the suta that i just read about thought also includes a famous line that

199
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:57,599
some of you may have heard it's even quoted out of context in other traditions uh it says

200
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:03,680
whatever a person frequently thinks and ponders upon that becomes the inclination of their

201
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:08,880
mind so that suggests that renunciation this

202
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:16,079
word nakama can become a beneficial predisposition of the mind if you will

203
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:22,480
so i like to name nikama as an attitude that's a word i'm trying to

204
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:28,880
choose to capture intentions thoughts and perceptions is that we could have an attitude of me comma

205
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:34,480
and what does that mean practically maybe what it would mean is that we

206
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:41,359
would walk around the world with the view or the idea that situations are

207
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:47,280
opportunities to release the binding of unhelpful desires

208
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:53,680
so just to be to give a concrete example suppose we find ourselves struggling in

209
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:59,200
some way we are irritated by somebody or we're

210
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:05,040
frustrated that we can't get something to work or we're impatient we're waiting for something to

211
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:11,119
happen and it's not coming so we're struggling in some way and if if we have mindfulness at that moment

212
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:18,560
and we realize oh i'm struggling right now maybe the thought would occur

213
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:24,160
what would i have to let go of to make this easier so that would be the attitude of

214
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:30,560
renunciation what would i have to let go of to make this easier this is vastly different from the

215
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:36,560
approach of most people or in most situations so instead of wishing for that thing

216
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:42,880
that i'm trying to get or that result that i'm trying to create we would realize that our desire for

217
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:48,640
ease or for peace or for not struggling is more important in that moment

218
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:55,119
maybe we realize that we'd rather figure out how to help someone than try to get them to be the way we want them

219
00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:01,520
to be so this attitude of renunciation helps

220
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:07,440
redirect our mind in helpful ways if we were to live by this attitude of

221
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,720
letting go of things that are not helpful letting go of unbeneficial desires

222
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:19,119
the effect of that is to gradually elevate our desires remember when we talked about the

223
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:24,800
diversity of desires there were five and the fourth and fifth kinds

224
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,839
i named were kind of the elevated human desires the desire to help others the

225
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:35,280
desire to be ethical and eventually the desire to be free these are the helpful

226
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:41,119
desires that support the spiritual path so renunciation

227
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:48,640
the attitude of letting go moves the mind toward the more beneficial kinds of desire

228
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:54,079
if we can't let go of sense desire and sense pleasure and sort of ordinary

229
00:41:54,079 --> 00:42:00,960
wishes that the mind comes up with i would suggest that we're not going to be able to fully realize

230
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:09,920
the the better forms of happiness that are available for humans we have to let go of one to get the one that's better

231
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:17,920
so in the texts in the buddhist teachings the affective or emotional quality

232
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:23,440
that's associated with me comma is described in terms that are clearly

233
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:30,560
positive so the words for it are things like delight happiness even bliss

234
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:38,160
i want to read just a couple of examples so here's one there are these two kinds of happiness

235
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:43,359
what to sensual happiness and the happiness of renunciation

236
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:49,599
of these two kinds of happiness the happiness of renunciation is the poor most

237
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:55,599
so that's a fairly just a straightforward kind of prose uh description of it and then there's

238
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:03,839
also i want to offer also a verse it says even the gods envy the awakened ones the

239
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:09,599
mindful ones the wise ones who are intent on meditation

240
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:16,560
and delight in the peace of renunciation how about that even the gods envy those

241
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:21,839
who know how to delight in the peace of renunciation so

242
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:27,680
this word renunciation i hope what we're doing is reshaping our ideas about it

243
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:33,280
how it's used in the buddhist teachings may not be what your gut reaction to it is

244
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:38,480
and to see that there's there are choices about which pleasures we go for

245
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:45,040
and the uh the ones in the sense domain are real enough we have them we may be

246
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:50,640
surrounded by them and there are options that are better and we can incline the

247
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:58,240
mind toward them by having this willingness to let go this willingness to be open which is also associated of course with

248
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:05,040
non-ill will and non-cruelty so good things good ways for the mind to be directed

249
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:11,800
so thank you and we'll continue our exploration tomorrow
