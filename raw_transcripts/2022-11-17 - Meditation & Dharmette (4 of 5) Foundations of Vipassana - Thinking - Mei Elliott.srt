1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:06,060
well good morning and welcome back my name is May Elliott and here we are in

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,820
our week-long study of the foundations of vipassana meditation these are the

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:19,380
basics that you would be taught if you went to most Insight or vapassana centers in the west so today we will be

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:27,480
focusing on thinking the first day it was on breath then on body then yesterday emotions and today the

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,880
thinking mind so um so let's get started with our meditation

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:40,440
foreign a posture that is both

7
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,940
upright and energetic as well as relaxed

8
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,539
connecting with a felt sense of the body

9
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,860
and touching in with the breath or your primary anchor

10
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,580
settling into the Here and Now

11
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:52,439
befriending the breath giving a powerful attention as we drop

12
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:56,360
into this moment as it is

13
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:50,340
as we begin this meditation together we'll be rooting our attention with the

14
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:57,019
breath and when thoughts arise we'll simply let them go to start

15
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:10,940
we're allowing the breath to steady the mind to stabilize the mind

16
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,480
foreign

17
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,140
foreign

18
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:25,800
and sustaining our attention on the full length of an inhale

19
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,520
and the full length of an outhale and exhale

20
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,620
feeling the complete release of an out breath

21
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,120
foreign

22
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,800
foreign

23
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,400
foreign

24
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,538
thank you

25
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:19,100
foreign

26
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,160
foreign

27
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:58,440
shift in our attention moving our awareness away from the

28
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,600
breath and instead we'll imagine

29
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:10,459
we'll we'll open the awareness in front of us

30
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:17,700
open the awareness in a way where

31
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:24,620
it's as though you might be looking at a blank screen in the Mind's Eye

32
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:37,459
and soon a thought will arise and unfold through that space in that space

33
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:43,740
so I invite you to just notice

34
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:51,920
the first thought that comes into the mind after I finish this sentence

35
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,660
foreign

36
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:25,200
stay for a moment and pass away if not that's fine too

37
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:32,420
and if you did this is mindfulness of thinking in the present moment

38
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:37,699
thoughts occur as present moment phenomena

39
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:46,459
the content of the thought often is not in the present but the thought itself is

40
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:54,300
opening again now to that open space in front of you maybe tapping

41
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,820
into the sense of a blank screen in the mind

42
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:07,920
and go ahead and see if you can notice the first two thoughts that enter the mind after I

43
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,000
finish this sentence

44
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,560
foreign

45
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:50,660
and then returning the attention to be with your anchor again

46
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,519
foreign

47
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,620
space this sense of a blank screen

48
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,839
and see if you can pay attention to every thought that comes up after I

49
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:49,040
finish this sentence see if you can maintain the awareness for a little while

50
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,980
foreign

51
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,760
to your primary anchor maybe the breath

52
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,260
you may have found that you were able to be with the thoughts and uh you might

53
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:57,540
have gotten lost in thought and that's okay mindfulness of thinking is a very

54
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:04,820
slippery object as we're so apt to get lost in the content

55
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:20,579
so for the rest of this meditation so you're allowed to think

56
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:29,880
see if you can look straight at thinking being aware ah this is thinking

57
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,880
foreign

58
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:42,240
that you are watching a group of people standing around and having a

59
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:51,180
conversation with each other but that you're standing maybe 15 feet away so you're not lost in

60
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:58,100
the content of what they're talking about just see the process of them speaking to each other

61
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:05,339
we can relate to the mind in that way watching this process of thinking from a

62
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:08,240
little bit of a distance

63
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:19,940
and at any point if you find yourself getting too lost in thought or if

64
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:27,720
you need to just ground in the breathing or if the thoughts subside you can

65
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,860
return to the breath

66
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,480
foreign

67
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:54,300
as you do this you might take a look to see

68
00:15:54,300 --> 00:16:00,260
do you think in images or in words

69
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:45,600
to your thoughts have a tone of voice

70
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,600
foreign

71
00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:57,139
is harsh or soft

72
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,120
judgmental or gentle

73
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,400
foreign

74
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:05,520
do you notice any physical Sensations associated with thinking

75
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:14,480
maybe contraction in the forehead in the jaw or the Torso

76
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,200
foreign

77
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:31,390
foreign [Music]

78
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,799
s that go along with the thinking

79
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,940
foreign

80
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,620
foreign

81
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:03,539
foreign

82
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:28,640
hook are they very compelling

83
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,059
do they pull you in

84
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,280
foreign

85
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:58,280
to find yourself with the desire to keep thinking

86
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,960
wanting to continue with the content

87
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,580
foreign

88
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:56,360
just observing whatever happens no need to judge or reprimand

89
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,039
just doing our best

90
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,380
no right or wrong

91
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:22,820
if it's helpful for you you can use a soft mental note with thinking

92
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:29,640
when a thought arises you might just know thinking

93
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,480
thinking

94
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:45,919
and then if you return to the breath you might note in I'm going to inhale

95
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:50,840
and out on an exhale

96
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:57,500
very light note

97
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:06,480
and if you notice a repetitive thought and that seems to keep coming back you

98
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:12,659
might choose a specific label for it so that you're not as easily caught in

99
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:19,260
its gravity this might be

100
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:25,100
rehearsing or planning

101
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,700
Maybe judging

102
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:45,799
and When the Thought moves on you see what happens next

103
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,158
foreign

104
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,240
foreign

105
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:04,940
as we come to the end of our sitting together

106
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:11,220
you can dedicate the Merit we can dedicate the positive energy of our time

107
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:18,080
spent together to all beings everywhere

108
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:27,080
so they may be happy healthy safe and free

109
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,940
foreign

110
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:12,360
welcome back so here we are mindfulness of thinking

111
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:17,580
so at the beginning of the meditation I mentioned how

112
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:22,740
up to this point the meditation instruction has been to just stay with

113
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:28,919
the anchor of the breath and if a thought takes us away we don't

114
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:36,179
give it our attention we let it go and we come right back to the breath and because of this really standard

115
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:42,779
meditation instruction let go thinking uh you know don't get engaged in it uh

116
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:48,980
many meditators think that meditation is about getting rid of thoughts

117
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:54,000
when really that's actually not the goal of meditation

118
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:02,700
so the goal of meditation is to be free from suffering to be liberated and in order to be free we need to learn

119
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:08,940
to have a skillful relationship to our thoughts part of this skillful relationship

120
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:14,220
is in knowing that our mind produces thoughts and that's okay

121
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:19,620
the Mind produces thoughts in the way the mouth produces saliva it's just the

122
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:25,799
function of that organ it's nothing that we need to beat ourselves up about and this doesn't mean that we're

123
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:33,120
complacent with thoughts we don't let them run wild it just means that we don't need to be aversive to them that

124
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:39,539
we don't need to get rid of them so our skillful relationship to thoughts

125
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:46,140
we'll also include letting go of them at times but we don't need to reject them there's

126
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:51,960
a distinction there between letting go of thoughts and pushing away

127
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:57,179
thoughts Koto Conlin uses this image of we let go

128
00:31:57,179 --> 00:32:02,940
of thoughts just like releasing a balloon a really light touch there's no

129
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:10,200
rejection there and one thing that can be helpful to

130
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:16,020
remember as we learn that our thoughts are not the enemy in meditation

131
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:22,140
is to remember that thoughts can do wonderful things we can have Loving Thoughts generous thoughts wise thoughts

132
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:28,080
like all of the Buddhist teachings the four noble truths these can all be

133
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:34,080
transmitted because of thinking and we can have very onward leading thoughts

134
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:41,640
so another interesting aspect of thinking is that thoughts themselves occur in the present moment and this is

135
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:46,919
what we were exploring in the meditation right so their their content is often in

136
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:52,080
the past or the future the content of the thoughts is taking us into ancient

137
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:58,020
history and planning what we'll do next but thinking itself regardless of the

138
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:04,740
content takes place in the now so knowing this we can learn to be mindful of thinking in the same way that

139
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:09,919
we can be mindful of sights smell sounds Etc

140
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:18,240
as our practice with thinking matures and we stabilize in the present moment

141
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:24,539
we learn how to see our thoughts simply as additional phenomena arising in the present

142
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:30,240
and being able to incorporate our body emotions and thoughts in meditation one

143
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:37,019
of the impacts is that of this is that we're able to meet everything as worthy of our attention and that's something

144
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:42,840
that's so beautiful about vapassana is nothing's left out as we learn to

145
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:48,360
include everything in mindfulness nothing's excluded

146
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:55,080
everything is included everything can be folded into our meditation practice

147
00:33:55,080 --> 00:34:01,500
because of this there's no such thing as a bad meditator because of too much thinking thoughts

148
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:06,740
are just another phenomena phenomenon to be mindful of

149
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:18,179
now the trick is it's hard to be mindful of thoughts

150
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:25,378
because mindfulness of thoughts isn't getting not lost in the narrative isn't getting lost in the storyline that

151
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:32,460
the thought is weaving it's being present knowing that thinking is occurring

152
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:39,599
now if the mind is really active and the thoughts have a lot of gravitational force likely to kind of suck us up into

153
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:44,700
their content this is a good time to just practice letting go of thoughts

154
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:51,898
because if we don't let them go we're going to disappear into them so this might be a time if the thoughts

155
00:34:51,899 --> 00:35:00,000
really have a ton of gravity that you might just do breath practice maybe not the best time to practice mindfulness of

156
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:08,160
thinking if as soon as you look at it you get sucked into it Once the mind is more stabilized though

157
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:14,640
we can begin to see thoughts more clearly so on Monday I spoke about mindfulness of breathing and I use this

158
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:22,380
analogy of a tripod when we practice focusing on the breath and uh and letting go of thoughts this

159
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:27,839
stabilizes the Mind much like a steady tripod so when a tripod is steady we can

160
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:35,220
put a telescope on it and see the stars much more clearly than we ever could before if the tripod isn't steady we're not

161
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:42,720
going to see much of anything so in the same way when we focus on the breath and let go of our thoughts our mind becomes

162
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,839
steady and we can see the Mind much more clearly and from that place we can begin begin

163
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:54,240
to see more clearly how our thoughts function as process rather than as

164
00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:01,560
content so um we begin to be able to see more clear clearly whether we think more in images

165
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:07,320
or in words whether the thoughts have a tone of

166
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:13,740
voice like you might discover that a certain thought patterns might have a critical voice of a parent or the loving

167
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:21,839
voice of a sibling and some some thoughts may not have a distinctive tone at all but uh we kind

168
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:28,020
of we can get to see um how our thoughts are speaking to us

169
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:33,839
um can be incredibly helpful to notice the physical Sensations associated with

170
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:39,900
thinking that even often pleasant thoughts will have some level of contraction in the

171
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:49,880
body it can begin to investigate our the way our emotions go along with our thoughts

172
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:56,280
uh and we can see how um how compelling they are we can see how they they pull

173
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:01,619
us into their gravity so these are all great things to investigate

174
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:08,940
because these observations over time they begin to show us how flimsy thoughts are some teachers talk about

175
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:15,380
thoughts as being like little Holograms or energy wisps

176
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:21,660
and yet as Joseph Goldstein said if we're not aware thoughts are little

177
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:28,320
dictators saying get married get divorced so when we can see them for what they are we learn that we don't

178
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:33,500
have to believe them they don't have to be the dictators of our life

179
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:38,520
and this is one of the most freeing experiences to realize

180
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:45,180
that we don't have to live by limiting fears that we don't have to believe our

181
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:52,160
judgments that we don't need to be enticed by our addictions

182
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:58,380
we don't have to take our thoughts so personally or believe them

183
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:04,880
I have a refrain that I often say to myself the thought is not the thing

184
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:12,540
the thought is not the thing we so often mistake our concepts of

185
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:19,680
things our thoughts about them as the actual thing but our thought is not the thing the concept is not the actual

186
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:25,500
experience that's the great teacher Moon indraji said

187
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:30,740
your thought of your mother is not your mother

188
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:36,599
so as we begin to see this we start to like to let go of our obsession with

189
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:42,540
thoughts um when we realize how often their false prophets that the news is

190
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:48,140
not always good and the the news is not always true

191
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:56,040
so another aspect to consider regarding thoughts is that they're not ours nor

192
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:00,619
did we deliberately choose to put them there

193
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:09,020
I sing the line we all live in a yellow

194
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:17,520
I bet a certain word popped into your head it might have been submarine so if you

195
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:24,480
grew up listening to The Beatles or familiar with them that conditioned what happened in your mind

196
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:31,980
you didn't intentionally put that there we didn't put that thought there did you it was conditioned so there's a way that

197
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:37,859
we think uh that our thoughts feel so personal and like if we think something

198
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:43,140
that does that seems unwholesome or unethical that we're a bad person for

199
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:49,980
thinking that that it's all conditioned uh thoughts are impersonal and important

200
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:56,460
uh impermanent not sorry impersonal and impermanent but we give them so much

201
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:02,339
weight and it can be helpful to remember that we don't need to be bothered by our

202
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:10,140
thinking I often relate to my own thinking as off-gassing the pancreas produces

203
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:15,540
insulin and the mind produces thoughts no big deal it's just how that organ

204
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:21,480
functions and when we begin to question the

205
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:27,240
stories of suffering that we tell ourselves so much room can open up

206
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:34,740
we still think thinking is an incredibly helpful thing that we do but the thinking is lighter less believable

207
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:39,859
that no longer Reigns over the castle

208
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:44,780
the quote by Guy Armstrong

209
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:55,740
the per the deeper purpose of meditation is not simply to enjoy moments of calm

210
00:40:55,740 --> 00:41:03,000
as rewarding and meaningful as they are but to understand deeply how our minds

211
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,400
lead us into unhappiness so that we can stop the activities that lead to those

212
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,619
States to reach this understanding we have to

213
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:19,020
learn to observe Thoughts with as much presence and discernment as we bring to

214
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,700
the seeing of breath

215
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,619
another way that we can do this is by getting to know the patterns of thoughts

216
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:38,099
I mentioned this in the meditation often will have repeating tracks and it

217
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:45,660
can help to name them kind of like the top top 10 hits of your thinking mind if you have a repeating track you might

218
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:54,740
name it planning or wedding thought or judgment or football game thought

219
00:41:54,900 --> 00:42:02,040
and remember don't follow the content if you want to get to your destination you need to stay on the freeway don't

220
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:07,079
get off at an exit if you get caught in the content of your thinking it's like

221
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:13,040
getting off at the exit stay on the freeway

222
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:20,760
I lived for a number of years at tasahara Zen Monastery in the Ventana

223
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:27,660
wilderness and each month the community would have a full moon ceremony where we

224
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:32,940
would renew our vows and perhaps the most Central vow in the Zen tradition is

225
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:39,960
the bodhisattva Val I vow to save all beings and one of my teachers at tasahara

226
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:47,099
Leslie James put a playful Twist on The bodhisattva Vow by altering it to say I

227
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:53,640
vow to save all beings from what I think of them hmm

228
00:42:53,640 --> 00:43:01,260
so while this is a little cheeky it's also right on target our thoughts about others can cause a

229
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:06,599
lot of harm the acts of killing stealing lying all

230
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:13,079
begin with thoughts so if we can get to know the mind and

231
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:18,780
see the insubstantial insubstantial and the selfless nature of thinking

232
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:25,339
you have much greater agency in choosing what thoughts we want to act on

233
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:34,319
I thought about killing stealing and lying red light don't do that thoughts about

234
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:39,960
shaming blaming or othering red light don't act on that

235
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:46,500
thoughts based in kindness uh compassion renunciation green light

236
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:52,980
yeah that's a good one to act on so our level of agency

237
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:59,460
is equal to our level of awareness our level of agency is equal to our level of

238
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:05,760
awareness so if we are aware of our thoughts we have greater agency we have

239
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:12,420
greater choice in what we do in our life and we can make skillful choices to

240
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:17,700
um to move towards Awakening and to reduce

241
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:24,900
harm in the world so I will close by reminding you that the thought

242
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:31,260
is not the thing don't mistake your ideas of others for

243
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:37,440
who they really are if you want to help others

244
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:43,380
practice mindfulness of thinking if you want to help yourself

245
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:51,000
practice mindfulness of thinking so may all beings be free

246
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:59,460
from what we think of them thank you very much I hope you all have a wonderful day and

247
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:04,560
I'll go ahead and I'll put that uh the quote that I read from guy Armstrong in

248
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:10,160
the chat I saw that somebody was interested in that
