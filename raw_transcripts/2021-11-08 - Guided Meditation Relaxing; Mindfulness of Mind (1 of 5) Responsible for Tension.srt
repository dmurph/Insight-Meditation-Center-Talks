1
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:19,199
so hello on this monday morning welcome

2
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,320
and

3
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,960
this week we'll continue this series that are more based on the introduction

4
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,360
to mindfulness course that i teach and add something which um

5
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,719
for a week something that i ca on occasion i've added to the intro to meditation course

6
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,640
as one of the foundations of mindfulness one of the basic areas

7
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,840
and it has to do with can be called mindfulness of mind

8
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,640
or mindfulness of attitude and i'll talk more about that during the

9
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,280
dharma talk at the end of now but i would like to again use an analogy for the practice

10
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,560
this morning and that is um

11
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,479
if uh your technology your computer or something is

12
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:28,320
not working properly and you need to have it work or it's important for you that it works

13
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,920
it's possible to get tense trying to figure everything out and trying to make it work and

14
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:41,119
and and so the less it works the more more you

15
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:47,360
can't succeed the more tense it is perhaps and then you start feeling kind of lousy

16
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:54,240
feeling tense kind of miserable and headachy and then one reasonable or not

17
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,920
reasonable but maybe one common strategy at that point is to blame the technology for how

18
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:07,280
you're feeling and maybe then storm off to repair shop or

19
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:14,160
put the technology in the wastebasket and go get buy a new one or you know something but blame the technology for

20
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,480
how lousy you feel another strategy is to appreciate

21
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:27,200
that the tension that's building up in the shoulders the back the eyes the neck

22
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:36,480
is not inherent in the in the technology but in their relationship we have to it

23
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,000
whereas maybe we can't solve the technology problem we have

24
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,920
a lot of capacity to solve the tension problem

25
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,760
so if we're blinded by the technology and trying to solve it or fix it or how bad it is

26
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:00,720
we might not notice the tension and we might even blame the technology for how we're feeling

27
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,120
but the pathways of suffering goes through our reactivity our

28
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,519
relationship how we respond to something and that's

29
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,640
in the pathways of our lives that's where meditation sits it sits there

30
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:25,599
where we are relating responding reacting to what's happening

31
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:32,400
and and if we notice that oh the tension there's physical tension here

32
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,120
the tension is not in the technology it's not i don't know somewhere else it's just here and my shoulders and my jaws and my

33
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:46,159
eyes then we can take a moment maybe to close our eyes take a deep breath and relax and

34
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:53,360
soften we can take responsibility for how we're feeling the tension

35
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,040
the technology the computer is not going to take responsibility for that

36
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:06,879
the only person who can do that is yourself so part of meditation is to

37
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,920
place ourselves or stay close to that place that location where we can take

38
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,599
responsibility for our reaction our response

39
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:24,160
and not be not have the reaction the response the tension

40
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:31,919
somehow color how we what we're thinking about what we're focusing on

41
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,960
even if that is the meditation itself it's possible to get tense over how

42
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,680
meditation is going

43
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:51,680
so it's this morning it's about relaxing it's a very profound topic it can seem

44
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,639
superficial so assuming a meditation posture

45
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:05,880
and gently closing your eyes

46
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,639
and maybe rocking back and forth a little bit forward and backwards side to side

47
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:25,520
partly a ritual of embodiment the rocking kind of you feel your body a

48
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:33,919
little bit more in certain places perhaps a little beginning of relaxing

49
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,600
and also helping you find center where your sitting bones are centered

50
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,600
where you're lined up your weight is balanced

51
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:03,360
and continuing the process of embodiment to take a few long slow deep breaths

52
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,759
and use that time to feel the body

53
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:17,880
the wide global awareness of body as you breathe in and as you breathe out

54
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:44,880
and letting your breathing return to normal and as you inhale

55
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,880
feel some part of your body that there's likely to be tension

56
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:59,599
and if there is then on the exhale relax that part of your body

57
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,280
relax in a relaxed way

58
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:39,599
breathing in breathing out relaxing

59
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:47,720
softening releasing

60
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,400
and then settling into your breathing just

61
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,160
feeling the inhales the exhales

62
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,760
and with kind of a feather touch very lightly

63
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:44,000
very gently without any ambition

64
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:52,399
as you breathe gently relax the exhales

65
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,640
gently relax around the inhales

66
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:10,839
almost like you're softening relaxing around the edges of where your body feels itself breathing

67
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:45,440
and if anything takes you away from your breathing thoughts feelings body sensations

68
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,639
see if what what you can relax

69
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,399
what will soften

70
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:11,200
and what might relax also is your attitude towards it

71
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,079
every opportunity for whatever you're aware of

72
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:27,040
gently feel your way into what can be softened

73
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:34,480
and relaxed feel your way to where the tension is

74
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:49,360
and relax in a relaxed way relaxed about not being able to

75
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,680
just holding the tension

76
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,880
and if there's no attention no pressure or tightness

77
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:11,800
return to the breathing breathing gently softly

78
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,920
what can be relaxed as you're sitting here

79
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:05,839
in the face chest belly in the mind

80
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:15,959
the hands the thighs what can be relaxed and softened

81
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,039
okay

82
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,320
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

83
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:31,799
to see if you can relax some more what can soften in you

84
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,759
what can be released

85
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:45,840
what are you tightening around what are you holding on to

86
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:55,960
that for a few moments here you can put down let go of

87
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:04,720
and then to stay as relaxed as you can to turn your attention now

88
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:11,559
to the world of people around you that you might encounter today

89
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:19,760
and notice if any tension returns and if it does

90
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,720
can you relax again

91
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,799
in particular relaxing the heart

92
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:47,279
into from your heart to wish others well

93
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:55,840
to wish their day well their life

94
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:05,840
a few moments of well-wishing that continues the practice of relaxing

95
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,840
opening

96
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:19,720
removing barriers to our care and our attention to others

97
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:29,360
and as we go through the day may we keep these

98
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,519
wishes close by

99
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:39,760
may others be happy

100
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,360
may others be safe

101
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,440
may others be peaceful

102
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:04,360
may others be free

103
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:15,360
and may i avoid getting tense

104
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:21,039
and if i do let me relax

105
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,039
and with those wishes close by for this day

106
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:32,360
may your day go well

107
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:40,280
[Music]

108
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,640
uh

109
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:32,960
thank you so then i'll start over again

110
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:41,279
so um so today we start the week on

111
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:46,640
mindfulness of the mind and it's a continuation of these last four weeks

112
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:52,880
where we kind of explored the basic instructions in for mindfulness meditation that we teach

113
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:58,159
here at imc kind of exploring the territory first week was mindfulness of breathing

114
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:05,360
then mindfulness of of um body then emotions and thoughts

115
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:10,398
with each of those areas it's easy to have

116
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:16,800
get focused on those things so we're breathing and we're focusing on the breathing and the breathing seems like

117
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,919
what's most important or if there's pain especially we're focused on the pain in the body and that

118
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:29,358
seems the most important or for emotions the emotion seems really you know central key

119
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:34,960
juicy and so the attention is focusing on the emotion or on thinking

120
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:41,599
whatever it might be and that's part of what mindfulness is but in doing so

121
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:47,520
what's also important is the focus itself is the attention that's brought

122
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:53,760
how are we with the attention what attitude comes with the attention

123
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:59,280
and it's a little bit like driving a car with a windshield has been cleaned

124
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,720
and maybe to go on a long road trip on the freeway and ever so slowly

125
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:10,079
the windshield gets uh dirty and it happens very slowly

126
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:15,359
and now you don't see it building up and after a while you don't really realize that

127
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:20,480
still restraining to look out the windshield and it's a little hard and

128
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:26,480
and then maybe you stop to get gas and you clean your windshield and lo and behold wow

129
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:33,839
is it clear again and you realize that some of the tension that was building up was the difficulty of seeing

130
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:39,280
and but you hadn't realized it was difficult it happens to me sometimes with my

131
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:45,599
glasses when i wear them that they get dirty without me knowing it but i don't really notice sometimes

132
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:52,720
that things aren't quite right with trying to see because the focus is so much on the

133
00:35:52,720 --> 00:36:00,000
driving and getting and being safely other cars we don't notice the seeing itself and how that's changed

134
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,640
or something like that so so the art of this is to be able to

135
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:12,880
step back or turn the attention around 180 degrees and notice the quality

136
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,079
of the attention we're bringing the the um the quality of the how we

137
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:24,400
practice and so there's always two things i like to say it's kind of

138
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:31,280
there's only two things there's what's happening and our relationship to what's happening

139
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:37,280
and so here we're going into the domain of how we're relating to whatever is happening whether it's within us or

140
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:42,560
around us and starting to notice um today

141
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:49,359
because today's the day we focus on relaxation is um are we tense

142
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:57,280
are we contracted are we tight are we pushing are we forceful are we resisting in a tense way

143
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,720
and and it's easy to justify that tension and tightness

144
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:09,040
because there are challenges the world brings and um

145
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:14,079
the um and so you know it's easy to see the

146
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:19,839
problems out there the problems with that thing that i'm focusing on and we have to fix that or do something

147
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:26,240
with it or get away from it not noticing that there is this tension that's building up

148
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:31,760
and uh and not wanting maybe even take responsibility for that tension

149
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:37,599
when we do mindfulness practice when we're focusing on the dharma

150
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:45,119
the way that we relate to what's happening is crucial essential the way that we the attitude we have the

151
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:51,839
the reaction we have to it the way in which we bring attention to bear on whatever we're doing

152
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:58,400
that is really part of the pathway of suffering and it's a part of the pathway where we

153
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,640
can take the most have the most

154
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:09,440
regular and ongoing responsibility or make the biggest difference

155
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,280
maybe it would be a little bit like um

156
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:22,640
well they'll say the analogy i used before that um if uh

157
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:28,720
we'll say it this way that if someone's angry with you say it's uh not

158
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:34,560
on a scale of one to ten it's not ten maybe it's a 5 or 4 or something

159
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:40,560
but it's still what they're angry about seems to you

160
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:49,838
not right and so you get upset and part of being upset is being tense

161
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:55,680
now the person who is angry you could perhaps

162
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,720
ask them politely to stop being angry you could perhaps insist that they have

163
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:06,320
to stop or you walk away or you could ask them let's talk about it

164
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:11,680
or you could uh shake them upside down and try to shake the anger out of them

165
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:17,440
all kinds of things your options you have and sometimes most of those might work

166
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:24,560
but sometimes they don't and so then the irritation the frustration can build and the tension

167
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:30,240
builds as well the we might say that person is making

168
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:36,640
me tense and that's you know in some kind of way there's there's a

169
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:43,520
there's a relationship between that person's anger and the tension you have but the tension is your contribution to

170
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:49,040
the situation uh that that goes into the anger goes into

171
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:54,079
your mind and maybe you have uh associations to what anger is a

172
00:39:54,079 --> 00:40:00,320
frightening thing or anger before there's been injustice to you and hears you're getting the

173
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:07,040
person's angry and it reminds you of all the injustices you've had to suffer or or maybe there's fear

174
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:13,520
and the person's anger happens to angry happens to remind you of an angry bully when you're young

175
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:19,760
and so so all these reasons why the tension and the reactivity might arise

176
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:25,200
but that belongs to our inner world or in our life our preferences our

177
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:31,839
experience our memories our our our judgments our desire to protect ourselves all these

178
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:36,880
things come into play so there's pathways there's a loud angry

179
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:44,240
voice coming to us we receive it we hear it we hear it and we process it

180
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:50,400
we process it and we feel afraid we tense a certain way we process it and feel angry in return and it tends up in

181
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:56,960
a different way and so that's the pathway and then we react and we maybe get angry

182
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:03,040
back or we say something but if we can sit in that place where there's

183
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:09,920
a choice whether to be relaxed or tense whether to go with attention or allow it

184
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,440
or to relax then we're getting close to where the dharma is that we're taking that now

185
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:21,520
we're focusing on our contribution to our suffering

186
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:26,800
and that is one of the key things that mindfulness practice can do or the dharma does

187
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:34,960
is it we we're very keen to take responsibility to our own contribution to whatever is difficult

188
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:42,640
it doesn't deny that things need to be changed or fixed in the world but it um but at least we can always

189
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:48,240
look at what our contribution is to our suffering and the place that i'd like to recommend

190
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:56,319
today is how you've become tense how you've gotten contracted tight

191
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:02,560
pulled in the ways in which you kind of feel that compulsion to push and to do and

192
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:09,359
we're kind of restless and and and and so that

193
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:14,480
can maybe maybe be relaxed not relaxed and softened so the real

194
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:20,560
world issues are denied if there are real world issues but relax

195
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:27,839
so that we can come to them with the most wisdom and the most care and the from the best place that we know

196
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:34,880
the more tense we become most people don't respond with a lot of wisdom

197
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,920
don't respond with a lot of care and sometimes respond in ways that

198
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:45,119
actually detrimental there's a lot of justification kind of

199
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,240
unconscious for being tense there's a lot of justification or feeling that the

200
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:58,240
blame is in the other person or the situation and so that keeps the focus out there

201
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:03,440
in mindfulness of the mind we're turning the mind attention back to see what is

202
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:10,240
happening in our attitude our relationship and with ourselves and that we train ourselves to do that

203
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:17,839
keep looking there and see where the tension is see where the and then relax

204
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:23,599
and to get be given the instructions that to relax might seem superficial not

205
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:28,720
very profound not very you know spiritually

206
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:34,079
you know ultimate or valuable but it's uh

207
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:39,200
relax is a kind of a simplistic way

208
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:45,599
of referring to the deep letting go the deep opening up that spirituality buddhist spirituality

209
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:50,880
kind of moves to and so relaxing is part and parcel of this movement

210
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,920
towards deep freedom and so to take seriously the way we

211
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:01,520
become tense is bringing us into the territory of the world

212
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:07,760
where we contribute to our suffering and where we can contribute to our freedom from our suffering

213
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:15,838
so don't overlook your attention don't justify being tense

214
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:23,680
maybe occasionally it's okay but the opportunity in this practice

215
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:31,280
is to turn around take an honest look at it and see what can relax

216
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:37,599
and then once you're kind of relaxed then you can turn your attention around again to what needs to be

217
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:42,880
addressed so may uh the

218
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:48,160
bliss of relaxation the blessings of relaxation

219
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:54,720
be something that you study and work with today as you go through the day it's not a simplistic thing

220
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:00,480
it's a it has this is a deep root in so many profound areas of our life

221
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:08,160
and hopefully you'll enjoy it may your shoulders your belly your face your eyes your hands your heart and your

222
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:15,960
mind find more relaxation today thank you
