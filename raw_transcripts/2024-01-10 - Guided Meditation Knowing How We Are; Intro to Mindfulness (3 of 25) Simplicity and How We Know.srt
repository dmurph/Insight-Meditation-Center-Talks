1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:07,720
and welcome or good day and welcome to all of you and

2
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:15,200
uh it's a pleasure to sit here to be

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:23,119
prepared to do the offer this teaching so one of the common

4
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:30,519
associations with meditation or meditation with on breathing is that uh we're supposed to

5
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:36,200
be concentrated on the breath and uh stay kind of one-pointed just on the

6
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:42,480
breath and not uh get distracted not wander off from that and there is a

7
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:49,960
place for becoming deeply composed deeply centered on

8
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,120
breathing but that comes in its due time when we do mindfulness practice

9
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:01,480
mindfulness is first and foremost um knowing recognizing being

10
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:07,560
aware of what's happening and uh with a uh idea that

11
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,119
what's happening is a wide field that it's whatever that is

12
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:19,840
compelling whatever is obvious to us to know it in a in a qualitatively

13
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,799
different way than how we usually know things and one of those ways is um not

14
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:33,200
to be identified with the experience not to be defined by it not to have it

15
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,280
reflect back on us in some way that what we can and can't do or what we're good

16
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:47,680
at or not good at or successful at and not successful at and um and but to know it in a light

17
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:55,640
way a clear way a full way but without um um being attached to what we know

18
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:01,280
identified with what we know resistant to what we know so there's a kind of a

19
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,439
light touch to The Knowing but light doesn't mean removed it means just the

20
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:15,040
right way to recognize what's there without um becoming activated or or

21
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,319
reactive to what's happening and maybe the simplest way for

22
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:29,160
some of us to say that is to know without being identified with what we know to to know

23
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:36,040
without being bringing a lot of expectations and and

24
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:42,239
requirements uh in that knowing just to know so when we people think that the

25
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:49,800
point of meditation is to get concentrated on breath it's all too easy then that it gets complicated and uh

26
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:57,120
that uh there's identification with somehow or other I'm not good at it or I can't do it or I'm supposed to do it or

27
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,599
look at how great I am uh because I can can concentrate and so uh so that

28
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:14,879
concentration will come later but for now uh the um uh as we settle in and

29
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:20,480
that's an important quality we prepare ourselves we settle in at some point uh

30
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:27,400
one of the useful things to do when with around breathing is to become interested

31
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:33,120
in it to uh be interested in how to be

32
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,799
aware in a light way to how to be aware so that the being with the breath is

33
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:46,120
enjoyable without the pressure of it needing to be in any way or needing to

34
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,879
be concentrated or needing to breathe any particular way so so that's the

35
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:59,519
background for what we'll do today so to assume a meditation posture

36
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:06,280
that that's appropriate for you and as I like to say is a posture

37
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:14,400
which in in your way uh brings into a kind of balance the possibility of being

38
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,720
relaxed in the body but also Alert in the

39
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:28,240
body and depending on how you are on any given

40
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,479
day one of those two maybe gets emphasized more sometimes what gets

41
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:40,639
emphasized is relaxing if we're tense sometimes what gets emphasized is

42
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,160
alertness if we're sleepy or dull

43
00:04:50,840 --> 00:05:01,560
or and then to lower the Gaze and maybe gently closing your eyes

44
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:19,360
and then with a an approach way that is somewhat gentle and kind and

45
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:26,000
curious gently take a few longer

46
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,120
breaths calm breaths long little bit longer than

47
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:38,440
usual inhale and a longer

48
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,600
exhale maybe slowing the breath down just enough so it still stays

49
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,840
comfortable just longer still

50
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,680
comfortable and as you

51
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,520
exhale allow your body to

52
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:20,039
relax the exhale is a kind of letting go releasing and let the body release with

53
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:22,319
the

54
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:36,000
exhale and perhaps the inhale is more the

55
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,880
alertness and the exhale is more of the relaxing and a gentle Rhythm between

56
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,120
those

57
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
two

58
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
e

59
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:52,280
and letting your breathing return to normal and on the exhale to scan through

60
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:58,319
your body to see what can be relaxed in your

61
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,639
body maybe on the

62
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:10,039
inhale feeling and knowing where you might be tense

63
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:16,240
tight but to know it lightly without identification or

64
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,599
reactivity know it very matter of factly on the

65
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:29,280
inhale and on the exhale to soften relax that part of your

66
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,440
your

67
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
body

68
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,440
breathing

69
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:20,200
normally and as you breathe without identification with

70
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:28,120
breathing or reactivity or as little as possible a light

71
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:35,120
touch not leaning into breathing

72
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:42,800
or expecting too much with breathing find where in your

73
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:50,880
body your experience of breathing is most

74
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,480
Pleasant where there might be a subtle

75
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:03,680
pleasure on the inhale or on the

76
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:16,120
exhale and maybe that pleasantness is a small piece of comfort in the

77
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:31,040
relaxation the release of the diaphragm the chest the belly as you exhale

78
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,800
maybe there's a welcoming feeling in breathing

79
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:54,320
in and that pleasure of breathing might be only in one little section of the

80
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:00,279
whole cycle of breath but where in your body body is

81
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:06,360
the experience of breathing most comforting or

82
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,600
Pleasant to know to be present

83
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,399
for it might be in the

84
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,879
belly in the chest

85
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:34,360
movements it might be and the sensations of the air going in and

86
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,880
out through the

87
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,920
nostrils it might be be the threedimensional expansion of the whole torso as you

88
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:52,440
breathe in and the coming back and Contracting

89
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,160
as you

90
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
exhale

91
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:13,680
and if there is some pleasure or pleasantness in the breathing the point is not to lean into

92
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:19,320
that or to hold on to it or expect

93
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,120
it the point is to know

94
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:33,720
it and if other parts of the breathing are

95
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:40,279
unpleasant not so comfortable that also is

96
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:45,480
okay the art of this is not to lean into that or react to that

97
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:51,199
or identify with that judge

98
00:12:51,199 --> 00:13:00,839
it but with a light touch to know it

99
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,839
and in the Cycles so breathing in and breathing

100
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:19,000
out to let whatever experience of breathing there is Let It Come and Let

101
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,240
It

102
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
Go

103
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:05,160
okay and if your mind is distracted

104
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:13,360
and that's completely okay the function of mindfulness of

105
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:21,399
breathing is to help you see more easily that you're Swept Away in thought

106
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:30,680
caught in thought and know that with a light touch

107
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,519
we often are pulled in or lean into our

108
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,320
thoughts Let The Knowing of

109
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,800
thinking have a light touch and nonidentification

110
00:14:52,759 --> 00:15:00,680
and then Begin Again with your breathing

111
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,720
where whatever is Pleasant or comfortable with

112
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:24,959
breathing is the welcoming of attention here feel

113
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:32,240
this let this be how to to ground yourself Center yourself on

114
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:38,759
breathing through the door of what is Pleasant in breathing in the

115
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
body

116
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
for

117
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:24,120
if you are involved in a lot of thinking if you're

118
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:30,080
distracted see if there's something in your mind and body

119
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:38,200
that you can relax soften distractability is connected to

120
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,240
tension that we

121
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:55,559
carry and maybe on the exhale relax and

122
00:17:55,559 --> 00:18:00,400
soften that tension

123
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
for

124
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:07,840
and if you can as you feel the breathing feel the rhythm of the body

125
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:13,120
breathing in and breathing out how the sensations of your body

126
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,799
shift and

127
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:26,320
change the experience of breathing in is different than the experience of breathing

128
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
out

129
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:52,679
and as you feel that Rhythm feel the moment or

130
00:20:52,679 --> 00:21:00,120
moments where some part of that experience of breathing is Pleasant

131
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:11,039
and let that pleasantness encourage you to stay there with the

132
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:29,720
breathing and either the experience of breathing or the idea of a pleasant

133
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:37,799
experience is a reference point to know that part of the breathing which is not

134
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:44,919
pleasant breathing might be tight or contracted or

135
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,919
forced and if any part of the breathing feels

136
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:58,600
uncomfortable let that be a prompt

137
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:06,000
to relax in your breathing some parts of your body can it

138
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,400
soften relax the diaphragm the

139
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,640
belly the

140
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,000
chest the arms the

141
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
hands

142
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:44,919
and with a light Touch without

143
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:54,080
identification feel the rhythm of breathing what your breathing is

144
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
like

145
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:14,679
maybe with the relaxing on the exhale letting go of thoughts as you

146
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
exhale

147
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
for

148
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
for

149
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
for

150
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,679
for

151
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,600
for

152
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:50,480
and then as we come to the end of this meditation to take a few moments to

153
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:56,600
check in with yourself here and now at this

154
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:03,000
moment how would you know yourself how would

155
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:10,840
you be aware of yourself as you are with a light

156
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:16,760
Touch without identifying with how you

157
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:26,080
are just knowing how you are your feelings your mood your body

158
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,080
feeling how you are are in your

159
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:41,480
mind knowing it lightly knowing it e

160
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:46,960
easily and easeful knowing of how you

161
00:27:52,159 --> 00:28:01,919
are and then to prepare coming out of the meditation taking a few long slow deep

162
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:09,760
breaths so you feel your body more fully so you feel the connection of your

163
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:15,320
body against any surface your body is touching the

164
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:19,039
floor chair the

165
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,399
bed letting your breathing return turn to normal

166
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:41,960
and consider with your heart your mind The Wider Circles of people in your

167
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:48,920

185
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,320
free thank

186
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,159
you

187
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:13,720
so hello and welcome to this third talk on meditation that following these 30

188
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:18,880
minute guided meditations that are supporting what we're doing each

189
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:26,760
day and um so in a sense during these this in

190
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:33,840
this uh course that they're offering here of instructions in mindfulness

191
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:40,960
meditation uh we're slowly building putting down the foundations of the different elements that are useful to

192
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:47,080
take into account to be to be inclus included as we do mindfulness

193
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:53,159
practice and um it'll be 25 talks in the end so there'll be lots kind of go

194
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:58,760
deeper and deeper in a sense or with greater full applications in our life on

195
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:04,360
a path to Freedom path to Greater uh

196
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:11,919
goodwi and um and if uh all of it was kind of compressed into a 15minute talk

197
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:19,639
it would seem extremely complicated but I'm hoping that by stretching it out over 25 days that uh

198
00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:25,880
it able to support you to stay very simple uh because uh Simplicity is one

199
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:31,600
of the Hallmarks of mindfulness practice uh even though there might be your life

200
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:37,600
and your life experience and how it's happening might a multifaceted the idea is to find a way

201
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:44,720
to stay simple and easeful as we know it as we show up and a present for our

202
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:52,519
experience and one of the ways of appreciating this Simplicity is to recognize that um maybe

203
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:57,720
it's a little bit um for the purposes of teaching to make this next point

204
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:06,120
but the point is that there's always only two things happening there is what is happening and

205
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:11,480
how we're aware of it the knowing of it so what we're aware

206
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:18,079
of could be many many varied things of course but how we know of it everything

207
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:24,599
is known through the lens of knowing everything is known by through seeing

208
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:29,919
hearing touching thinking about taking it in

209
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:35,440
somehow uh we passes through the lens of

210
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:42,520
recognition of awareness and then once it we recognize it or know something then it might get

211
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:48,240
complicated again uh with the uh memories and thoughts and values and

212
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:55,679
expectations desires fears uh all kinds of things might happen but there's a imagine that

213
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:05,040
there's a it's kind of like an hourglass where the sand goes through this narrow neck and um and uh all if

214
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,560
it's very very narrow that neck everything every particle of sand can be

215
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:18,079
seen as it goes through and um and uh but if there was no narrowing

216
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:24,880
of the glass you would just all the glass all the sand would just fall very quickly and and you wouldn't see what's

217
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,200
going on maybe it's a little bit unfortunate metaphor this idea of narrowing and

218
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:35,920
tightening up but the idea is that everything in our experience does go

219
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:41,160
through a uh a little uh kind of a a

220
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:47,520
simp simple area of just being known in the most simple possible

221
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:52,599
way beforehand the world out there might be quite Broad and

222
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:58,240
multifaceted after we know it um it gets picked up by the mind and memory and

223
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:04,520
desires and Fantasies and projections come into play but in between there's

224
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:09,880
this a wonderful door this wonderful doorway of simple

225
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:16,240
knowing and uh and that's where the domain of mindfulness is whether we know

226
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:22,319
what's in the world or we know what's going on within us the idea is to have

227
00:36:22,319 --> 00:36:29,160
these two these two areas we know something and how we know it is

228
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:34,720
important and the how uh is a big part of what we're

229
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:40,440
exploring here so uh uh it's we don't just

230
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:46,359
know uh it's kind of unconsciously or just know matter of factly because if we

231
00:36:46,359 --> 00:36:51,440
don't pay attention to how we know how we're aware how we're

232
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:57,160
attentive um we bring along it's all too easy to bring along a lot of our uh

233
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:03,599
attitudes a lot of our emotions our desires our agendas our fears and it

234
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:10,599
kind of colors the way that we know and um and that's okay we don't

235
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:16,280
have to be troubled by anything when we do mindfulness that's the kind of the

236
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:22,520
Simplicity of it the idea is to know that too to know that to oh that's how

237
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:29,000
it is that's how I'm knowing I'm when I know I identify I identify with the

238
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,680
breathing with what's happening when I know something I immediately measure it

239
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:41,000
or judge it or evaluate it in relationship to me myself as a doer

240
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:48,440
myself as a victim myself as a consumer myself as as um as

241
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:54,520
a um you know trying to get something or prove myself it's all kinds of oh that's

242
00:37:54,520 --> 00:38:01,480
how it is that's how it is so when we sit down to meditate with

243
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:07,000
mindfulness uh the idea is to keep it very simple and not complicated

244
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,920
immediately with ideas of getting concentrated because then the knowing is already biased in a certain way there's

245
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:20,920
a leaning in and identification and looking for the concentration um it's uh and even the

246
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:28,280
idea that they're supposed to be continuously Weare uh and not be distracted can be another little kind of

247
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:36,079
uh cloudiness or agitation for the knowing the idea is to step back relax

248
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:45,400
enough and then just be content just to know what you can know the breathing is a anchor or the

249
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:52,839
breathing is a always there breathing is always in the present

250
00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:59,960
moment breathing always occurs now so to keep an eye out for the

251
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:07,839
breathing not so that you get focused on the breathing but that's that reference point for the present every time you

252
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:12,960
come back to the breathing and be with it it might help you to see more clearly

253
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:20,560
how you are that you're distracted you're irritated you're you're sad

254
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:26,119
you're happy you're relaxed you're tense and that's part of the function of all

255
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:31,359
this to see that none of it is wrong for the purpose of

256
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:37,400
meditation in ordinary life we come with all these attitudes about what we know

257
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:45,160
so if we're happy we're we feel like maybe proud or or hopeful we add we add

258
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:50,720
those things to it if we feel kind of lousy don't feel good or tense we feel

259
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:57,480
like Oh I'm a failure I'm wrong or embarrassed or you know something

260
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:03,440
and so to keep it really simple and this is why for some people find mindfulness

261
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:10,640
meditation to be extremely forgiving or accepting or uh like they have there's breathing

262
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:16,839
room to be who you are no matter how you are there's breathing room for it and

263
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:24,720
part of that breathing room that spaciousness is how we know it oh this is how it is and when you know this is

264
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:31,599
how it is now you are being Mindful and um in the Paradox is that if

265
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:37,839
you're distracted and you know you're distracted you're no longer distracted

266
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:44,760
even if the thoughts of distractions are still going um if you are caught up in some

267
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:50,040
emotion and you know that you're caught up then you're not no longer quite

268
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:55,319
caught up anymore part of you might be

269
00:40:55,319 --> 00:41:03,480
so so to feel to notice how you are and in the guided meditation I we just did

270
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:11,400
um we took another step with the breathing not just using the breathing as a reference point for distractability

271
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:18,760
or where the where we can to learn where we can relax more but also we can use um

272
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:24,200
and search for where the breathing is pleasant and it took me a long time in

273
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:30,200
meditation to learn that I that was fine it was okay it was actually supportive

274
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:35,800
of meditation to find where find the where where

275
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:41,480
meditation was pleasant and enjoyable and let that be a support for staying

276
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:47,200
present not being attached to it or prioritizing it too much but just look

277
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:54,680
where where is it so where is breathing Pleasant it might be just a moment at the end of the out breath or part of the

278
00:41:54,680 --> 00:42:00,319
end of the out breath is Letting Go and relaxing some people that's not pleasant

279
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:07,640
it might be the beginning of the INB breath or the smooth feeling of expansion with the in with the in breath

280
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:15,400
it might be the somehow the sensations of the air going in and out through the nostrils it's got a nice tingling and

281
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:22,599
and U sharpness to it there might be a softness in the belly uh at some point as the belly

282
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:28,000
relaxes with the breath it might be possible to slightly

283
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,280
adjust this Rhythm the speed the depth of breathing make it a little more

284
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:40,920
shallow a little deeper a longer a little shorter so that it just so it's still normal in a sense but so that it's

285
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:46,640
a little bit more pleasant how you're breathing and the value of touching into

286
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:53,440
the pleasantness of breathing again is not to feel more pleasure but rather

287
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:59,040
that also is a reference point to see better how where the tensions are where

288
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:05,319
the challenges are where the discomforts are so that you might be able to relax

289
00:43:05,319 --> 00:43:11,480
further soften the body soften the mind so you might be able to know

290
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:17,359
it with this Simplicity of knowing oh I'm feeling sad look at

291
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:24,240
that but the knowing of sadness is not sad look at that I'm

292
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:29,400
irritated I'm afraid I'm

293
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:36,240
agitated but and the knowing of those things is not defined by the sadness the

294
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:43,440
irritation the agitation it's just knowing so I believe that this is a lot

295
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:49,119
of words that I've said a lot of ideas and so it can lend itself to maybe now

296
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:56,480
becoming complicated trying to remember what I said and um but I'm hoping that uh you

297
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:03,119
will somehow take it in um with this message that keep it

298
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:11,839
simple and let the breathing support you to be very simple with to recognize how

299
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:18,200
you are what's happening with you because that is the that's the

300
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:25,000
compost that's the material that's the the basis for greater Clarity of

301
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:32,160
awareness is actually how you are not to bypass how you are but to recognize how

302
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,319
you are and how you know is really the

303
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:44,520
one of the central things we're doing here it's half the picture there's what's what you know and how you know

304
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:51,400
it so uh as you go about your day today you might see if as you go through

305
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:58,680
different activities whatever you're doing check in with your yourself periodic quick L and ask yourself how is

306
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:04,200
it I know my environment how is it I'm taking

307
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:11,559
it in how am I relating to it how is it being known is it being known through the

308
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:17,720
filter of emotions and agendas and beliefs is it being known

309
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:24,920
simply what would it mean to know simply right now without all the baggage I

310
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:30,359
carry with me just to know that would be I think a wonderful

311
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:35,680
exercise and I would love to hear from all of you actually uh what you learn

312
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:41,920
from that I know that's not possible so um thank you very much for

313
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:47,880
today and I look forward to continuing

314
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,880
tomorrow
