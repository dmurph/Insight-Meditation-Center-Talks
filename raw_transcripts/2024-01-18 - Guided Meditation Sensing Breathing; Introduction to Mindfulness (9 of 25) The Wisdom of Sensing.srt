1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,279
so good morning good

2
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:22,960
day and in some ways some of us are here to today to befriend our

3
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:31,160
bodies to become intimate with our bodies

4
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:39,320
to not treat our bodies as something foreign to us something that we take for

5
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,600
granted and Ed to kind

6
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:51,960
of do the things that the Mind wants to do the self wants

7
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,640
to do can an object of

8
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,680
transport to reconcile or heal our relationship to

9
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,880
the body so it's not something to be aversive to or angry to

10
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:21,079
or [Music] or ashamed of or all kinds of

11
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:24,680
difficulties that people have with their

12
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:35,360
bodies but to have a healed relationship with the body so there's

13
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:42,560
no wound between you and your body there's no fear of the body no shame of

14
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,438
the body no anger there no ignoring of

15
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:57,399
it and one of the ways to do this is to listen to the body

16
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:04,280
deeply as if the body has a voice as if the body

17
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:12,319
has an expression that wants to be known to treat the body with tremendous

18
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:18,319
respect with care with love it

19
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,680
too wants to be known and maybe that's a little

20
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:31,760
bit my own kind of language for that but what something profound happens

21
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:40,280
when we make room in Awareness for the body to be

22
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:47,519
itself and to know the body from the inside out from the outside in we could treat

23
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,760
the body as an object and then we can have all these relationships with that object that

24
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:59,599
thing the body but to treat the body or care for

25
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:05,159
the the body as a subject From the Inside Out not from the ideas the

26
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:11,799
memories the histories the standards we judge it

27
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:20,760
by but from the inside out to allow the body to have its own

28
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,840
experience not mediated by how we compare our bodies to

29
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,360
other bodies don't compare ourselves to how our body was an earlier age in our

30
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:38,200
life where we don't relate to our body through our fears of what will happen to

31
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:44,519
the body without judgments just allow it to

32
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:51,920
be allow it to be itself and if you can allow it to be whatever it is for it to know

33
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:59,680
itself then there starts to be the wisdom of the body can operate the the

34
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:06,480
the way in which the body is a a river a stream a move of

35
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:14,280
movement of processing the body is not a thing it's a process the body is not a

36
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:23,199
singular event it's an ongoing unfolding and to allow that unfolding to

37
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:29,160
occur without interfering with our judgments interfering with our fixed

38
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,440
ideas interfering By ignoring it is a phenomenal

39
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,758
process tremendous amount of benefits can come from

40
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:47,360
that so we begin

41
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:54,560
by learning maybe not an easy task of how to have the awareness of the

42
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:01,080
body be simple

43
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,439
without strain without resistance without

44
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:14,720
judgment and one mode for doing that is to have a receptive attitude towards the

45
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:21,240
body allowing attitude towards the body as it

46
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,000
is in this moment while

47
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:31,479
meditating and then to that simple

48
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,240
awareness and then to ask the question as we're aware of

49
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:45,680
the particular parts of the body what the body is expressing what is this what is this

50
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,080
Sensations what what's happening here but not to get

51
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,680
a answer that you can talk about but rather to ask the

52
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:04,440
question as a way of kind of stepping Clos closer with open arms stepping closer with an open heart and open mind

53
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:11,080
what is this to let it register more deeply and this letting it register more

54
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:17,720
deeply what is going on here so that we begin

55
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:26,880
to move beyond the concepts the ideas the stories the judgments we have of the

56
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:33,039
body and we get to feel not the abstractions of Sensations happening but

57
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:38,560
get to feel the details of Sensations meaning the

58
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:47,039
particularity of hot and cold and stretching and pulling and moving

59
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:56,240
and flowing and and um and um hardness and softness all the

60
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:03,759
particularity not because we're straining to understand it but we're letting that particularity

61
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,800
register and so maybe we it's easy to

62
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:15,039
know so becoming friends with our body

63
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:20,639
assuming a posture that is not the posture you

64
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,759
think you should have but the posture you feel that the

65
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:32,919
body would like so that it can be fully present here for

66
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:39,520
you for itself a sense of a alert calmness in

67
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,759
the

68
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,199
body and to gently close your

69
00:07:52,919 --> 00:08:02,080
eyes and take a moment in your own way to greet Tre your

70
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,680
body as if you're just just meeting after being aart for a

71
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:14,240
while checking in how are you what's going

72
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,959
on and in a way that just in a way that

73
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:42,080
feels nice for your body take some breathe more

74
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,279
deeply and relax on the

75
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
exhale

76
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
for

77
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,720
letting your breathing return to

78
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,560
normal and on the inhale

79
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:57,600
allow [Music] receive some part of your body where

80
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:04,279
there's some tension or hold holding and on the

81
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:10,040
exhale kindly relax the body

82
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
there

83
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
for

84
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:17,079
and then to Center yourself on the body's

85
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:19,800
experience of

86
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
breathing

87
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,920
and then to do a little exercise with exploring the sensations

88
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:47,560
of breathing what

89
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:54,440
Sensations Heralds the beginning of the

90
00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:00,959
inhale what is the first Sensation that indicates your body is breathing in

91
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:14,600
in it might be a little relaxing and

92
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:20,920
expanding maybe in the belly the

93
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:30,880
diaphragm or it might be a little movement of pressure diaphragm pushes down

94
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,120
a little movement of expansion as the chest

95
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,560
expands or the first tingling in the nostrils as the

96
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,480
air gets pulled

97
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,920
in as you continue to feel the first sensations of breathing

98
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,199
in you might become aware of different ones there

99
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:17,120
first or maybe different on seem to occur simultaneously and you're naturally

100
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,360
aware of different ones different

101
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
breaths

102
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:45,240
and then what particular Sensations marks the end of the

103
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,880
inhale sensation of stopping

104
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:05,079
holding feeling of pressure or

105
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,360
tautness a momentary Stillness where there's no more

106
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
movement

107
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:48,120
and between the beginning and the end can you notice some unique

108
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:56,160
sensation there some sensation it might be the movements in your body tingling and

109
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:04,320
warmth expansion how's the breathing

110
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,800
experienced between the beginning and the

111
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,240
end very

112
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:42,319
lightly now receive the whole journey of the in

113
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:46,959
breath from the beginning middle and

114
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:56,160
end as if the windows open

115
00:15:56,319 --> 00:16:05,000
and the rhythm of a breathing appearing blows gently through the

116
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:26,800
window relaxing any way in which you're straining or

117
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,279
tense so that aware Ness can be

118
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:41,759
receptive allowing the whole journey of sensations of in

119
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,519
breathing to reveal

120
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
itself

121
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:14,480
and then become aware of the first Sensation that Heralds the beginning of the

122
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:22,319
exhale maybe a release a

123
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,558
softening a

124
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:33,960
movement a warm tingling or sensation in the

125
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,600
nostrils a

126
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
pulling

127
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,840
becoming aware of the last sensation of

128
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:34,159
exhaling maybe the final sensations of exhaling

129
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:36,600
fade

130
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:50,840
away maybe there's a sensations of settling of

131
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:01,519
weight pressure or the release of

132
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:28,880
pressure and between the beginning and end of the exhale can you recognize a s

133
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,559
stion somewhere in the

134
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,400
middle maybe a small sensations of

135
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:51,480
movement or strengthening sensation of warmth

136
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,440
or tingling in the

137
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
nostrils

138
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:22,960
without being too concerned for the inhale for the next few

139
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:31,720
exhales allow yourself to feel be beginning middle and end of the

140
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
exhale

141
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:25,240
and now allow yourself to feel

142
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:33,960
receive the sensations are breathing in and the sensations are breathing

143
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:41,679
out remembering that sensing and Sensations occur in the same

144
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:48,080
place it's not something we do from the control tower but

145
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:55,080
rather an allowing to ourselves to feel what's happening in the

146
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:05,640
body and like the waves that wash up and down the Sandy

147
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:13,919
Shore follow watch be with waves of inhale and

148
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,360
exhale as sensation in the

149
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
body

150
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
for

151
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
for

152
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
for

153
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:28,720
rather than treating the [Music] body

154
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:34,960
with judgment or as a foreign body or as an

155
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:42,600
object that you judge or have stories

156
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:50,600
about relax and allow yourself to

157
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:58,960
experience the body's Sensations how the body speaks

158
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,880
speaks and listen

159
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:12,039
non-judgmentally allowing those Sensations to exist

160
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:18,398
peacefully without any conflict without being

161
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:25,000
ignored Maybe by feeling the sensations of your body

162
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
breathing

163
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,600
e

164
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,600
for

165
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,880
and then as we come to the end of the

166
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,520
sitting to whatever degree that you could experience your

167
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:29,520
body non-judgmentally without a

168
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:36,960
story allowing it to be as it

169
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:43,120
is open that kind of awareness to this world of

170
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:49,640
ours and giving yourself permission for a few

171
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:58,159
moments here to allow the world the the world of

172
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:07,360
people to be as it is without your judgments without your stories

173
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:13,679
and projections of the future memories of what

174
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:19,399
happened just allow all things to be as they are at this

175
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:25,000
moment and you relaxed and open

176
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:31,880
breathing so

177
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:39,440
that your deeper heartfelt compassion for care and love and

178
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:46,440
kindness is unfiltered unobstructed by the stories

179
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:52,480
and the memories and judgments and fears and

180
00:28:54,840 --> 00:29:02,320
desires and in the special circumstance of

181
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:08,679
meditation where we don't need to say anything to anyone or do anything for

182
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:19,290
anyone here to have unfiltered care unfiltered compassion love

183
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:24,559
[Music] kindness here

184

00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:18,760
we end this meditation with may that be the

191
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:24,559
beginning of bringing Good Will into this you into this

192
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:32,480
world may all beings be

193
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,909
[Music]

194
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:59,240
free thank you

195
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:02,679
so this will be the fourth talk on mind fulness of the body

196
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:12,200
and an analogy I like to use that um is directly connected to the body is

197
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:18,360
the body's capacity to heal itself from a cut you might be in the kitchen

198
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:25,880
chopping vegetables and do a little cut in your finger

199
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:31,240
and you your job is to keep the cut clean to clean it maybe protect it with

200
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:36,519
a Band-Aid to keep dirt out of

201
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:43,120
it but um and then the body can has a

202
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:50,639
best circumstances in which to heal itself if

203
00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:58,600
um um so our job is to kind of get out of the way but keep it protected

204
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:05,880
we can't engineer the healing probably no one knows all the different all the different physiology

205
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:12,840
of healing a cut that goes on but uh the body knows how to do

206
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:20,799
it so there's all this capacity the body has of healing itself of coming back

207
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:26,559
into homeostasis coming back into peace calm that if we can get out of the way

208
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:32,559
and allow for the body's wisdom and innate capacities to operate a lot of

209
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:39,039
things can benef can happen I've been by with people who have

210
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:45,240
died and uh sometimes it's remarkable to see uh people's faces right after

211
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:53,559
they've died because the muscles relax and uh and there's a sometime

212
00:33:53,559 --> 00:34:01,320
occasionally a deep sense of Peace in the face because tension they've been carrying in the facial musculatures have

213
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:09,520
finally released we get little bit the same kind of at the end of a 7-Day Retreat when we

214
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:14,878
see people's faces after seven days of meditation so much as softened in the

215
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:21,800
face and they haven't been focusing on relaxing the face it's just the circumstances of of the retreat of

216
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:29,919
leaving on themselves alone very deeply allows something to relax and um and maybe little bit heel

217
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:38,800
in the face in the muscles of the body everywhere so the the uh the body has a

218
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:45,720
capacity to relax to heal sometimes the body is the first it

219
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:51,560
gives a feeling of discomfort when something feels wrong something doesn't feel quite right and there's a kind of

220
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:58,720
feeling of um tension or anxiety in the belly or little pressure or something feeling oh

221
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:04,839
this is not right and it might that body might know that before the mind has

222
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:10,119
understood it and uh some people have learned to really pay attention carefully when the body gives this

223
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:15,800
feeling something's not right here and then by paying attention we discover what it

224
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:22,680
is so the ability to allow the body its own

225
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:27,720
process uh gives us access to a lot of uh

226
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:34,119
Capa much more capacity for health for healing for wisdom for

227
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:40,400
spirituality than if if all those things are negotiated only with the mind and

228
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,640
part of the reason for that is that the mind all too easily is

229
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:52,520
hijacked by stories by judgments by Memories by fears by desires by

230
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:58,040
aversions hatred all kinds of things the mind gets caught up in and concerned

231
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:03,640
with and as it said it's in Buddhism that sometimes the mind is like a

232
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:12,000
puppeteer that has these strings from the fingers of the Mind down into all the different muscles and um and some

233
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,720
things that uh some ways of thinking um actually uh create tension

234
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:24,319
in the body maybe that sometimes a severe tension chronic chronic tension

235
00:36:24,319 --> 00:36:31,200
in the body and you the advantage of being getting calm in meditation is to

236
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:38,160
then to notice on when we start thinking about something and the impact it has on the body the tension that comes

237
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:46,240
in and um and starting to appreciate that how what a strong role

238
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:52,000
the thinking mind has on interfering with the body's own

239
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:59,400
capacities and so as we meditate the idea is to um no longer experience the

240
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:09,040
body through the filter of all our thoughts and stories and memories and history but begin to

241
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:16,880
receive and allow for the body's experience of itself and there's as I've been doing

242
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:22,960
here sometimes I use the language of allowing and receiving and that's sometimes very

243
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:29,640
helpful but there's a limit to how much allowing receiving accepting you want to do because

244
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:37,319
sometimes that lends itself to being very general and kind of have a generalized kind of sense of experience

245
00:37:37,319 --> 00:37:43,079
here and now the deepening of mindfulness meditation comes when we in

246
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:48,960
this relaxed open allowing awareness we allow things to touch the soft tens

247
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:55,599
tender part the sensitive part of awareness and really we get to know it

248
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:01,760
well feel it well and uh recognize what it is as I put my finger on the softest

249
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:08,640
more sensitive part of my palm then it's not just feeling a finger which is a

250
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:15,800
kind of abstraction there's feelings of warmth feelings of pressure softness little bit

251
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:22,920
of uh radiating warmth and a little bit of uh little bit of texture there a

252
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:28,760
little bit of um uh elasticity there's a little bit of pressure there

253
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:34,079
there's all these very particular Sensations the deepening of osna

254
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:41,040
practice comes when we com combine this kind of relaxed and soft receptive

255
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:46,200
awareness that is not filtered with carried not carried by or influenced by

256
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:51,440
a lot of thoughts ideas concepts of what is to really start feeling the

257
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:57,920
Simplicity of the moment of the actual Sensations themselves so even if I put

258
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:03,800
my finger against my palm and and and if someone says what are you experiencing

259
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:09,839
and I say I'm experiencing my finger touching my palm that's not exactly what I'm

260
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:15,359
experiencing that's the concept of finger concept of palm yes they're

261
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:20,480
touching that's the that's what's happening but the experience the

262
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,720
sensations is not the finger sensation is not the palm the sensation is the

263
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:33,599
warmth the pressure the elasticity the texture um the the pleasure that I feel

264
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:39,400
in that contact those are the sensations and the same thing happens

265
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:47,280
with pain that um uh pain is a little bit pain is real for sure but it isn't

266
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:54,240
the word pain is an abstraction and uh and if we stay at the abstraction it's kind of like saying the

267
00:39:54,240 --> 00:40:01,200
experience of the finger against the palm um it's not actually what's happening what's literally happening is that there

268
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:07,119
might be intense piercing or shpat or um

269
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:13,680
uh twisting or stabbing Sensations there might be a very you know that there's

270
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:20,000
the pain is there's many different kinds of pain and uh and so what's which kind of

271
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,079
pain is it now and to feel the sensations of it the advantage of doing

272
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:30,839
that with anything including pain is that as as long as we stay little bit

273
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:38,599
separate by the concepts the idea of what it is and not in the sensations we're not allowing ourselves that

274
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:44,760
intimacy that to allow that deep sense of way in which awareness makes room for

275
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:49,960
those Sensations to unfold to do what they want to do and that is one of the

276
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:57,800
great Arts of inside meditation is to be so close to the experience in a gentle

277
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:05,440
soft relaxed way that it's almost as if the awareness make know is not writing

278
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:13,040
tightly on top of our experience concerned with it struggling with it but rather the awareness is a great open

279
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:21,440
space that allows things to unfold to unravel to open up to shift and change

280
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:27,920
as they need to do so it's like uh creating room mind is like creating

281
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:34,520
space so it's not just a moment of mindfulness we want it's like

282
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:41,920
oh uh warmth and then allow that warmth to be felt pressure allow the pressure

283
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:49,800
to be felt um uh pleasure allow that pre the pleasure

284
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:57,280
to be felt not for the sake of of experiencing it for oneself but rather

285
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:05,359
to allow the sensations room so that they can move along and do what's next

286
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:11,319
all Sensations are processes all Sensations are in movement and active

287
00:42:11,319 --> 00:42:16,880
and dynamic and to start living in that Dynamic place that's one of the

288
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:23,800
functions of deeper inside practice and so what I'm teaching today is a stepping

289
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:29,359
stone step towards that capacity it's not necessarily easy to rest there

290
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:35,839
but it's part of mindfulness of the body is to begin uh finding ourselves not

291
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:41,760
with a gener generaliz general presence for the body but with a relaxed

292
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:50,000
receptivity to the particularity of the sensations in the body so today in the guided meditation

293
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,079
we did this exercise to do that with the breathing and the breathing is part of

294
00:42:55,079 --> 00:43:02,800
mindfulness of the body and to start allowing oneself to kind of get absorbed by the particular

295
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:09,040
Sensations that come into play like the Kaleidoscope or the the of these Sensations that flow through as we

296
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:14,079
breathe in and flow through as we breathe out and

297
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:20,400
um and uh it's kind of like getting out of the way while feeling in feeling it

298
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:27,520
intimately getting out of the way where we're really connected we're allowing for the particular sensation s to play

299
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:34,960
their dance not the general idea of breathing but the actual particularity

300
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:43,119
of Sensations so um we'll continue with this tomorrow so

301
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:50,160
if this didn't make so much sense to you don't worry uh the um it might be they

302
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:56,200
whatever you understood from what I taught today just kind of even if you didn't know how to apply it uh just just

303
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:02,079
kind of store it away for now and with time I think it'll become clear uh that

304
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:10,480
how this works in a way that's not a strain not a lot of effort and work so um we'll have one more day on

305
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:18,720
mindfulness of the body and we'll do a little bit more on this idea of Sensations and uh and that'll set the

306
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:26,520
the foundation for uh a way of practicing mindfulness of emot

307
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:33,119
tions and um I won't be here next week so the week on emotions will be in two

308
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:40,079
weeks and um with this uh what first the breathing last week and body this week

309
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:46,760
all this sets the ground for um for a wise way of being with

310
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:52,880
emotions so thank you very

311
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,960
much
