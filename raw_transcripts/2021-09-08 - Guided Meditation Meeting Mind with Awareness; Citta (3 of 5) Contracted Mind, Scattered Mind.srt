1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:12,400
so hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,800
to our time here to meditate and explore some of the teachings

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:26,320
so the topic for this week is the mind and the state of the mind

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,519
and but not just the mind itself

5
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:37,120
but the mind that we're mindful of that uh the mind state the quality of

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,399
the mind the quality inner quality of our state being that

7
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:50,160
it's one thing for it to be what it is and it's something different to be aware of it to be mindful of it

8
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,480
i like to think of mindfulness practice as the meeting of two things it's meeting of

9
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,680
life experience of life whatever it might be and

10
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:08,240
uh mindfulness a kind of awareness which is a little bit intentional

11
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,760
especially initially a little bit um full

12
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,960
uh dedicated devoted attention to whatever is

13
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,360
to itself devoted to attention but the meeting of attention and experience

14
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,840
and so it's one thing to breathe it's another thing to breathe mindful breathe

15
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,079
mindfully it's one thing to have a body it's one another thing to be mindful of the body

16
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:45,360
to have the awareness meet the experience of the body and uh it's one thing to have

17
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,960
experiences of mind and to be aware of him for today the kind of general state of

18
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,560
the mind and um and so the

19
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,479
the what i'd like to emphasize today is something very simple about the mind the

20
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,920
mind state the mood or the disposition of the mind

21
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,480
it has many flavors many aspects but the one today is that a mind can be

22
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,879
the mind state can be one that is contracted

23
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:29,120
or it can be scattered it can be dull and sinking mind or it could be

24
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,239
over energized and kind of uh kind of

25
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:41,200
spinning out and and uh jumping around so uh one is called the sinking mind

26
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,319
sometimes that's called um uh

27
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,440
overactive mind and uh and so

28
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,280
or sometimes the mind feels contracted and small and tight just kind of caught up in its little concern and there's no

29
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,280
nothing outside of it and other times not just not not the opposite is not exactly expanded that's

30
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,560
for later but the opposite is to be scattered and distracted and fragmented and

31
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,239
and just jumping all over the place so what happens

32
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,519
if we're mindful of that we're aware of

33
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:26,319
that so um and so the kind of the label i like to

34
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:33,599
suggest you can choose your own for these two states but uh uh contracted mind

35
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:39,440
and scattered mind and if you're caught up in thought even if the same train of thought it's kind of like more like a

36
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,959
scattered mind distracted mind contracted mind or

37
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,400
distracted mind maybe that's maybe a good pairing

38
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,680
and and so when you find yourself kind of sinking mind dull mind contracted mind

39
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:06,239
recognize it as such when you have a scattered mind a distracted mind an over energized mind

40
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,920
recognize it as such and

41
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,040
recognize what it's like to be mindful of it

42
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,560
what changes when you settle back and clearly recognize it

43
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:29,120
without reactivity without judgment without stories what it means just a very simple

44
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:38,000
like you're taking awareness i'd like to think of silent awareness and meeting the state of the mind

45
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:45,919
and um and if your mind is not any one of these two scattered dull

46
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:52,320
um sinking sleepy if it's not distracted scattered

47
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,320
fragmented um and then maybe just uh appreciate what the mindfulness is like what

48
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,840
awareness is like then so i'm hoping this instruction is very

49
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,800
simple so it's either contracted or scattered

50
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:17,759
or there's an experience of what it's like to be aware of that the mind that's aware of itself what

51
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:24,720
happens to the mind then if this instruction is too complicated for how your sitting is going and how

52
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,160
you're used to sitting you can just not worry about it but

53
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,759
it might think of it's little addition to your practice and maybe not doing it all the

54
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,400
time but once you start getting settled into it

55
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,880
so assuming a comfortable posture

56
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:55,759
and in the comfort of this posture adjust it so that it's also alert

57
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:05,039
so the posture brings a kind of wakefulness or

58
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:12,280
a little bit of energy that supports attention

59
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:29,520
scanning your body making now small maybe not so small making adjustments in

60
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,600
posture shifting a little bit

61
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:41,120
rocking little teeny bit back and forth or sideways and

62
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,240
twisting yourself a little bit just kind of come

63
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:52,240
finding a midpoint where things feel balanced

64
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,280
gently closing your eyes

65
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,599
then taking a few long slow deep breaths

66
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,199
relaxing as you exhale

67
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:41,280
letting your breathing return to normal and on the exhale

68
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,400
relax different parts of your body release them

69
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,560
the holding

70
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:18,960
and then settling in with your breathing and taking on the next minute or so

71
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:26,960
to be as simply present for breathing as you can with not any agenda but just seeing for

72
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:33,518
one minute you can hang in there experiencing every in-breath and every

73
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:42,159
out breath without strain but with devotion dedication

74
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:48,519
as if it's the most important thing of for this minute

75
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,200
and then settling in again with just breathing quietly

76
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:35,519
noticing the general quality of your mind state

77
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:42,480
this your mind state state of mind

78
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,839
seem contracted or dull

79
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,800
sinking

80
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,839
does your mind state feel scattered or distracted

81
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,240
fragmented and jumping around

82
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:21,200
and if it's one of those two things or if it's something else

83
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:29,440
to be mindful of that to be aware of it to have the me there be a meeting

84
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,920
of the state of your mind and the awareness of it

85
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:44,399
an awareness that's simple almost permissive of how you are

86
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,360
so just simply aware of your mind state

87
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,000
and what happens when you do so

88
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,880
to meet your experience

89
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,759
in such a way that your experience feels safe

90
00:15:52,560 --> 00:16:00,320
from your judgments your over-involvement your fixing wanting something different

91
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,320
to be a good friend to your experience by

92
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,320
meeting it simply for what it is

93
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:26,880
and becoming aware of the quality of your mind your mind state

94
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,079
with a simple meeting of it this is how it

95
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:41,279
is noticing if it's contracted or scattered

96
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,560
dull and heavy

97
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:04,279
or distracted over energized

98
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:14,839
and what happens to your quality of your mind state when it is met with awareness

99
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:33,600
taking the time to step back and observe the state of your mind

100
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:43,320
quality of your mind sinking mind or over energized mind

101
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,799
dull mind active mind

102
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,360
and then allowing it to be that way but to observe it clearly

103
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:04,960
a meeting of awareness and the state of your mind

104
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:13,679
recognizing it clearly what happens to the state of mind as you

105
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,840
do so

106
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,320
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

107
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,440
if you've learned something about awareness

108
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,240
meeting experience

109
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:51,960
to let your awareness meet the world or how you

110
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,880
construct the world that we live in

111
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:07,840
turning your attention outward and simply meeting it as a witness

112
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:14,720
as someone who cares but is without being over-involved or

113
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:21,760
under-involved without being for or against

114
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:27,919
just to see and meet be present first and foremost

115
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:35,840
to know the world in whatever way that comes to mind

116
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:45,120
and to perhaps drop into your heart

117
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,519
maybe the feeling center or the place where you feel

118
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,799
good will kindness generosity or

119
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:04,720
care compassion or love

120
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,480
what might be called the heart center

121
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:22,320
and then meet the world now from the heart center

122
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,840
meet it with your care and kindness good will

123
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,159
gaze upon the world kindly

124
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:45,840
gaze out across the lens with goodwill and care

125
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:56,240
and it's a powerful thing to end meditation practices

126
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:04,000
with reflecting upon evoking even this good will and care for the world

127
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:12,240
for others and to connect the meditation practice

128
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,200
with benefiting the world

129
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,240
and then so then in in may it be that in intentional and

130
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:32,799
unintentional ways in ways that you know in ways you don't know

131
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:40,320
may it be that this meditation session can be for the welfare and happiness

132
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:45,520
of others may it somehow spread from each of us

133
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:54,039
individually and from all of us as a group may it spread out across the lands

134
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,840
as a movement is a

135
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,760
domino effect of goodness generosity

136
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:12,240
care and love may it be

137
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:17,840
that somehow our practice is for the welfare and happiness of the world

138
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:26,240
may all beings be happy may all beings be safe

139
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,440
may all beings be peaceful

140
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:37,480
and may all beings everywhere be free

141
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:53,559
[Music]

142
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,720
me

143
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:55,279
so for this third talk on the third foundation of mindfulness

144
00:31:55,279 --> 00:32:01,519
mindfulness of the cheetah wonderful term

145
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:09,200
and here we're taking it to be the mind state the general quality of the mind

146
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,720
and here the mind doesn't necessarily limit it to what we think of as the mentality

147
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,000
related to the brain the control tower but rather

148
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,279
some kind of the general state of being a state of mood

149
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:31,279
that once we settle in and relax and really feel ourselves deeply

150
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:38,000
what's the general quality of our being that we have and that's probably closer to what this

151
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,919
mind state is though sometimes it does feel very closely connected to the mind in some

152
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:49,360
identifiable way and exactly where this is it doesn't matter too much

153
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:56,399
it matters more that we are meeting and being aware of kind of the inner quality of our being or state the state that we

154
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:03,440
are in and but when meditation gets deeper and quieter

155
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,640
the body becomes more and more subtle and sometimes the sense of body kind of

156
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:16,240
disappears and or not really prominent very much at all and so what that which is left seems

157
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:22,399
much more belong to kind of a mental world or that part of the

158
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:28,159
beingness which is not so body centered and um

159
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:34,480
and uh and so maybe then it's more clearly recognized as the mind state

160
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,600
anyway so as the this uh instruction in the

161
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:45,840
uh there's a eight sets of instructions or eight pairs of of things to notice

162
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:52,000
in this four uh third foundations of mindfulness and what's interesting is that

163
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:00,240
how the it's a particular aspects of the mind the mind states which are emphasized

164
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,679
and i think the reason for that is these are the parts of the mind mind states that are

165
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:11,760
most useful to notice for the purposes of the path of liberation

166
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:19,440
if you're really interested in becoming free notice these aspects of the mind

167
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:27,040
and that's uh distinct from maybe other ways that people are interested in their mind uh their preferences their

168
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:33,280
their expectations their um you know they have all kinds of

169
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:39,440
priorities about what you might want to pay attention to the content of the mind the stories we

170
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:45,599
have in the mind or what it all means but the the description here is very simple

171
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,800
so as i said yesterday it begins with knowing the mind when it's with greed or

172
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,839
without with ill will and without

173
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:03,359
with delusion and without those are the first three the fourth one of these eight pairs

174
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:09,680
is to notice whether the mind is contracted or scattered

175
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,720
or exactly what these words mean in pali is not really that clear

176
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:22,560
the commentaries associate um contracted with sloth and torpor and uh the scattered with agitation and

177
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:28,240
restlessness and remorse and things like that so

178
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:34,079
you know we each find ourselves in relationship to these words but something very simple

179
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:39,520
a sinking mind that gets dull and duller or an over energized mind that's

180
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:45,520
restless and scattered or a mind that gets really small

181
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:52,240
it's fascinating to be aware of ourselves kind of really consumed with some preoccupation or really

182
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:58,400
caught in something and in that cottness or preoccupation the whole state of the mind seems to get

183
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:04,480
very very narrow and small and uh just like this becomes the bl and end all everything's kind of

184
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:10,079
kind of wrapped up around uh contracted around some black hole in

185
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:15,920
the mind that it just you know the gravitational pull is so strong that

186
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:23,440
um light doesn't come out just because you were so wrapped up in something and um

187
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:29,440
and so um um so so you know and then sometimes the mind just seems

188
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:35,359
like it's scattered or someone's has their mind in the clouds or

189
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:41,040
uh someone is just really really feels spacey um not because we

190
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:46,560
feel spacious but just spacey and like hardly here but the mind is kind of drifting and

191
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:54,720
vague and so these are all kind of words that kind of maybe touch into what

192
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:00,240
the buddha is talking about here and contracted or scattered

193
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:06,560
and and of course the mind can be other ways but a mind that has

194
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:12,000
agreed in it our mind that has without greed might be one of these it might be

195
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,040
scattered or it might be contracted and small or it might be expense expanded it

196
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:23,040
might be energized and agitated and distractible or it might be really kind of

197
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:29,680
tight and small and focused on its desires same thing with ill will a mind of ill

198
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:36,640
will might be contracted or scattered a mind of delusion might be scattered contracted or scattered

199
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:44,400
so this is let's so these things can co-exist but to simply tap into touch into

200
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:52,640
this this quality of the mind that somehow feels dull contracted or scattered or

201
00:37:52,640 --> 00:38:00,160
over energized and to begin to notice the range of ways in which this works it

202
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:06,079
can be very big the different uh or it can be very subtle the way this works

203
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:12,160
and then notice what happens when you're clearly mindful of it

204
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:17,280
this is where the magic begins happening what happens if you

205
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:24,880
cannot be for or against your mind state it's easy to be against something that feels uncomfortable or not so nice

206
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:31,040
but what is it like for you to to not be forward against it or before

207
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:36,320
and against it and leave that in there put it up on the shelf put that aside for now

208
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:41,760
and just bring simple clear recognition

209
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:47,359
to the quality of your mind state and to meet scattered mind a scattered

210
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:52,640
mind to meet contracted minds contracted mind

211
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:59,520
as if you're as if you are getting a phd in quality states of mind

212
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:05,680
and you you have to write a whole you know excuse me for a moment

213
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:15,119
as if you're getting a phd and you have to write a whole you know chapter on what a scattered mind is like or

214
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:22,000
contracted mind is like so you have to be a naturalist you have to really kind of stay present

215
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,040
for it and not disturb it too much just be there with it

216
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:33,839
but what we're really getting a phd in is not in the scattered mind or distracted mind

217
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:39,680
but we're getting uh a stud or studying what happens when awareness

218
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:46,320
meets that non-reactive awareness non desirous awareness non-aversive

219
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:52,800
awareness simple awareness very simple it just meets it

220
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,839
touches it recognize it observes it

221
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:03,040
what happens to this quality of the inner of your inner life of the mind

222
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:09,359
when it's known when it's seen in this simple way it's so easy to get pulled into the mind

223
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:15,280
or be reactive to the mind especially if it's uncomfortable or doesn't feel good

224
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,480
or if it feels really great and also get pulled into it and celebrate it

225
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:28,079
but what happens is magic of just meeting it and seeing it that's what we're studying here

226
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:34,319
and so there's a shift of paradigm from being so interested in

227
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:40,560
what we're experiencing because what we're experiencing is important and we have to kind of adjust it or fix it

228
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:46,400
to being more interested in the experience of awareness of

229
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:52,000
experience it shifts the paradigm and shifts the direction like for example it can make

230
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,359
us more less selfish because when we're looking at the experience itself and and

231
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:02,800
trying to get just the right experience or reacting to it so much of the self comes along

232
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,920
but if we just sit back and just know the mind state oh this is how it is

233
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,960
um and then what happens in that meeting does uh

234
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:19,040
this this contracted mind begin to open up does a scattered mind begins begin to

235
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:27,200
settle does the dull mind get a little more light and

236
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:33,040
does the distracted mind it can

237
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:40,240
you know get less distracted you know what happens in that meeting that's what's interesting

238
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:48,079
and so as i said yesterday that we're talking about the third foundation so it assumes that for the really to do

239
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:54,400
this in a refined way it re assumes that the mind is fairly quiet and stable

240
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:00,160
we've developed some concentration some stillness and so we don't want you don't want to

241
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:06,319
be ahead of yourself you want to just practice in what's appropriate for you so sometimes it's appropriate just to do

242
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:13,119
mindfulness of breathing or mindfulness of the body and settle in and let go of your thoughts

243
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:18,720
and come back and if the mind is too energized maybe it doesn't work too well to do mindfulness

244
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:24,400
of the mind but as uh it gets settled that's where it gets more interesting

245
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:30,480
to start becoming aware of the mind and it tends to happen naturally by itself so you don't have to be ahead of

246
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,520
yourself if you just follow to keep doing the practice

247
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:42,880
with time as i said the body becomes more subtle or more settled or calls for less attention to itself

248
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:48,000
at some point meditation becomes um not so much concerned with pleasant

249
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,880
and unpleasant sensations anymore and that concern kind of recedes a little bit and then what's kind of left is to

250
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:01,359
become aware of is the quality the state of the mind and um so that's what we're exploring

251
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:08,960
this week and so in the next two days i'll talk about the final four pairs

252
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:15,359
of uh mind states that we that the buddha taught and there's a shift now from the

253
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:21,280
first four to the second four and this second four tends to be now

254
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:26,800
more the states of meditation or the states of mind that begin opening up or

255
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:34,720
appearing when we really learned well to have this non-reactive mindfulness

256
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:41,920
awareness meet our experience including meeting all the different vagaries of how the mind states might be

257
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:48,720
but as we learn that meeting then the mind begins to shift and change and

258
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:56,240
to be able to recognize how the mind changes is little bit the task of these last four for the next two days

259
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,760
and so one thing i've been fond of as i've talked today is talking about this meeting of

260
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:07,119
awareness and our experience awareness and the mind and how it brings the hands

261
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:14,960
together into this namaste into this gesture of respect and as you explore and consider your own

262
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:20,960
mind mind state maybe as you go through today you'll kind of check in with and see how it is and

263
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:26,880
maybe you think of it as this meeting as something like a bow respect

264
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:36,200
that we meet with respect our experience so thank you very much

265
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,880
you
