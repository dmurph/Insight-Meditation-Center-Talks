1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:07,240
it's nice to see all the greetings on the chat and

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:13,120
uh I'm sure there's lots of people who would rather not chat publicly or don't

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:19,160
know how or something and and but I see these wonderful good mornings as kind of

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:26,240
representing a large community that we are coming here these weekday mornings

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:34,200
and uh it's very heartwarming it's inspiring and and is uh inspires me to come down here and and

6
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:41,039
teach I love teaching um and

7
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:47,280
um teaching to me feels like an extension of the practice that we

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,879
do so one of the ways that um our own

9
00:00:52,879 --> 00:01:00,519
practice can be inspiring or can be supported protected even is is if we

10
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:07,320
don't take it too personally the the momentum in the mind

11
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:14,280
to Define things or refer things back to ourselves in some kind of definition of

12
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,759
who we are or some kind of idea some kind of

13
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:27,000
feeling that uh lends itself to such ideas as Me Myself and mine this is

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,439
mine and then defining ourselves with these things it lends itself to

15
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:41,560
writing close to all our experience and kind of navigating it as if uh we're

16
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:48,320
kind of trying to improve the self or defend the self or hide the self or um

17
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,719
everything is kind of referred to ourselves and the idea of progress idea

18
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:59,320
of gaining something in practice um can have very much associated with Me Myself

19
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:05,240
and mine like I have to get something out of this or why do I do it that's a kind of

20
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:13,640
reasonable point of view but also it too easily brings along a lot of self a lot

21
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:20,319
of conceit a lot of kind of self- preoccupation which is one of

22
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:26,800
the great hindrances to discovering the Deep peace

23
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:33,080
that's possible through meditation the freedom that's possible and the idea that we would

24
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:41,239
practice meditation in a certain kind of way not for ourselves uh is confusing and is

25
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:48,120
um offputting for some people because of course I'm here and don't I count and

26
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:57,760
shouldn't I be taken care of myself but there is something very profound about not engaging in this uh

27
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,040
exercise of selfing of measuring things against some Notions

28
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,560
of self judging who we are what we're doing trying to get better experiences

29
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:16,319
for ourselves Gathering things to say so Gathering experiences so we have good things to say to our friends um trying

30
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:23,959
to make progress in meditation so we can prove ourselves some way and um so this is a delicate thing this

31
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:30,080
selfing and of course we want to heal ourselves of course we want to improve ourselves and that's the whole

32
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:38,120
Enterprise in Buddhism is to find to improve ourselves to heal and find Freedom to develop love and

33
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,879
compassion it turns out that the whole Enterprise the whole momentum of

34
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:53,200
practice can be a lot easier if we put to rest the ways in which we take

35
00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:00,599
things personally the ways in which we consider our experiences what's happening to us that I'm responsible for

36
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:07,599
this that I'm making something happen or this is because I did this in the past

37
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:13,519
and and um and one of the opportunities in practice is to practice

38
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:20,440
sincerely but to view what's happening impersonally not impersonally in some

39
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:26,720
cold aloof way but impersonally in a way that allows for a deeper intimacy

40
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:34,039
without the filter of me myself in mind and so the art of practicing and seeing

41
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:41,600
things as being somewhat impersonal or non-personal or

42
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,600
transpersonal and uh to put to rest the Me Myself and

43
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:55,919
mine and for some of us it's hard to imagine how we can make effort without that idea of self and me doing it and

44
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:02,560
that's okay but to begin the process of uh lightening up loosening up the grip

45
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,199
of Self in relationship to lots of things so for example uh if there's pain

46
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:14,880
while we meditate there's a wise way of seeing it in an impersonal way just pain

47
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,319
without calling it my pain if the mind is wandering awful lot

48
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:26,039
just call it you know a Wandering mind as opposed to I am wandering off I'm not

49
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:33,280
able to meditate if the breathing doesn't feel as comfortable and easy as you know it can

50
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:39,960
be then it's just simply a uncomfortable breathing nothing more nothing less as

51
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:46,680
opposed to wow what did I do that I'm breathing this way and I have to figure out the solution and this is not a I'm

52
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:54,800
not being a good breather right now so instead of all the self- referencing kind of a matter effect kind

53
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,280
of like the way a naturalist we just watch what's happening in nature and record it

54
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:06,520
without judgments or without making it into something that it's not without

55
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:14,039
making it into herself for himself their self so may you sit this way may you be

56
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:22,199
the naturalist of your experience curious present

57
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:28,080
open available

58
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,319
without taking it personally without the added

59
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:41,520
effort of making it mine or making it something that defines

60
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:51,520
me or something that characterizes myself so to assume a meditation

61
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:01,400
posture gently close your eyes

62
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:10,960
and if in some way it's not about you being comfortable in the meditation posture but rather your body you want to

63
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:19,720
put in a in a assume a posture that your body feels as good feels that

64
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:29,120
is energizing engaging where the body feels like yes

65
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,319
it's

66
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:50,639
here and the next few breaths that you do breathing is something we share with

67
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,479
other humans and other mammals and other

68
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:03,159
creatures it's such a universal characteris istic of much of animal life

69
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:11,280
to breathe here

70
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:20,120
now this deep animal nature of our being that

71
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,280
keeps Us Alive is our

72
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:31,440
breathing to assume if you take a few long slow deep

73
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:38,560
breaths appreciating that this has been going on for millions of

74
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:47,480
years creatures breathing on this planet and relaxing on the

75
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:06,720
exhale then letting your breathing return to

76
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:15,959
normal maybe like a creature that has feeling safe

77
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:28,120
contented the breathing itself can begin to

78
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
relax

79
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,959
making space for breathing to breathe

80
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:05,040
itself and if you go into a place of

81
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,720
Nature and just watch all the elements of natures the creatures the plants the

82
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,959
sky the ground as part of the natural

83
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:23,640
world so as you gaze within to your breathing your body your

84
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:31,040
feelings your thoughts see them as part of nature

85
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,519
no need to take them personally or to make

86
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:45,839
yourself out of them no need to have whatever is happening

87
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:54,959
within be tied to me myself in

88
00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:00,480
mind just nature being nature kind

89
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:07,680
of nonpersonal intimacy with the natural

90
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:17,279
world this is what's possible with being mindful of

91
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:24,399
ourselves mindful of our experience Moment by

92
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959

when you find yourself entangled with

106
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:52,880
thinking don't make that something to do about yourself as a naturalist just go

107
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:59,000
wow that's entangled see it clearly

108
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,240
in the Simplicity of what it is

109
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:11,120

and then as we come to the end of the sitting

129
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:36,559
sometimes when meditation brings us a degree of calm

130
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:44,879
peace well-being sense of safety and coziness something in that

131
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:54,799
family the Instinct the ability for us to be have wish well wishing for others

132
00:27:54,799 --> 00:28:01,000
wishing people well can arise as an act of nature not

133
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:09,200
exactly a personal decision we're inclined to meet people in a friendly way and respectful way

134
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,398
open way not asserting ourselves but

135
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:22,640
available and in this kind of way kind of an almost a nonpersonal way or

136
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:29,440
something deep within deeper than any notion of self

137
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:36,000
maybe from there there can be well wishing for this

138
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:46,600
world may all beings in this world be

139
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,799
happy may they be

140
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:59,399
safe may they be peaceful

141
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:07,320
may they be free and may they

142
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:14,039
know that I offer my respect and Good

143
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:20,559
Will from some deep place within where I'm available to support

144
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:25,720
this possibility may all

145
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,320

e

150
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:58,639
greetings from inside meditation center and continuing in this 10p part

151
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:05,200
series on that's called the pro the 10 protectors or the 10 supporters or

152
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:12,880
helpers of 10 helps and uh this one today is

153
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:21,120
um uh in a skillful and Wise Way caring for supporting the

154
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:28,679
sa caring for and supporting the practice your practice community

155
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:35,000
now ever since we I was involved in this IMC song guide got involved many years

156
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,360
ago when it was just a small sitting group of Monday nights about 12 people

157
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:47,120
15 people came and I joined them as a teacher had been already in place for

158
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,880
maybe four years and uh coming out of uh kind of

159
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,919
monastic training i' had seen how phenomenally useful it is powerful it is

160
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:06,639
to care for the place that we practice in and um the uh it's a place where

161
00:32:06,639 --> 00:32:11,720
we're supported location and friends and community and maybe teachings and

162
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:17,559
there's something in the Alchemy of practice that changes for a good way when we also care for the place we

163
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:24,080
practice in so because of that when uh we were just a small few people coming

164
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,639
uh it was easier for me to take care of the logistics it was very few things there was a key that opened and closed

165
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:35,240
the church library where we met there was flyers from Spirit Rock Meditation

166
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:41,559
Center that we put out to let people know what was happening there was very little inside meditation opportunities

167
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:50,159
in the Bay Area back then and um and um that was it someone with a key

168
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:55,760
someone took care of the Flyers and I could I could easily have done that myself but it felt like such an

169
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:03,880
important thing to provide people with an opportunity to care for the place they practiced in so we found someone

170
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:09,159
and I think the person who then uh carried the key open the place every

171
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:15,200
week uh I told them that they were the president of our sitting group gave them

172
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,440
some you know some higher level caretaking responsibility for it and

173
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:26,360
even though there was almost nothing to do I thought it was useful for people to step into a little bit of a leadership

174
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:33,720
role and I didn't know what was going to happen with that but and then slowly we grew and developed and it was remarkable

175
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:39,320
how many people step forward to volunteer and what part of the benefits

176
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:45,840
of volunteering was uh forming a sense of deeper sense of community and connectedness with other practitioners

177
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:53,600
and this idea of kind of caring for the practic center so there's more sense of connection Community also supports and

178
00:33:53,600 --> 00:34:00,840
protects our own practice that uh sometime which is is not available too much when we practice just alone all the

179
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:06,279
time one of the important uh and so we come and become we can become in a sense

180
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:12,800
a protector of the S which is a powerful thing to do to be but more importantly

181
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:18,079
there's a way in which um being a little bit selfish selfless a little bit kind

182
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:24,480
of extending ourselves to support others uh is a protection for our from our

183
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:30,760
selfishness protection from us doing the practice in a little bit too self-centered ways too preoccupied by me

184
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:37,599
myself in mind it's my practice I'm going to get enlightened I'm going to get concentrated I'm going to you know

185
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:44,320
you know all these people are getting the way they just make life more difficult and complicated and but to

186
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:50,520
rather uh to see that we grow in in connection to the community we they

187
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:58,680
mirror who we are they Mir how we might be a little bit off or how we are confused and how we might might uh take

188
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:05,200
things excessively personally or it might be situations where our our uh

189
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:12,280
judgments of others come forward but being in community working with people becomes a mirror for ourselves and this

190
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:19,320
is one of the reasons first reasons I think that I decided to go live at a Buddhist center was uh I'd been

191
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:25,520
practicing Zen uh in college I meditated in zazen Zen meditation twice a day uh

192
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:31,800
on my own and um and but I would visit San Francisco Zen Center uh occasionally

193
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:40,640
uh once a month or something and I noticed something peculiar there that I was young I was about 22

194
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:48,359
and um but I had all these social games that I played you know I wanted to present myself in a certain way so they would think of me in a certain way um I

195
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:56,920
had some way I wanted to be seen and so I was talking and engaging in ways to try to get that response from people and

196
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:04,480
uh so playing the social games to try to get to reinforce a certain identity that I wanted to have and so when I went to

197
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:09,560
Zen with when I was with my friends I didn't even know I was doing this we were all doing it so it was all kind of

198
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:15,640
one big kind of social kind of thing where we were kind of we were good friends and got along well but there was

199
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:21,599
this kind of you know moving in and out unconsciously with this kind of game of self and

200
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:27,280
self-presentation but when I came to uh San Francisco Zen Center and talked to some of the more senior practioners

201
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,760
there a remarkable thing happened that I would uh you know do

202
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:40,000
this social kind of games of presenting myself in a certain way and there would be no response they weren't playing the

203
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,400
game and they were kind of a mirror and I was like wow then I really saw what I

204
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:50,760
was doing in a way that I hadn't seen before and so I thought this is

205
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:56,839
invaluable to have people mirror my the ways that I'm kind of off I want to see

206
00:36:56,839 --> 00:37:03,359
this more clearly and so that was the first uh desire to go live at the San Francisco Zen Center to be around these

207
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:08,839
people who mirrored me in in ways that showed me where I needed to let go where

208
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:15,280
I needed to grow where I needed to kind of really take a good look at myself and see the things that were not necessarily

209
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:22,319
so um wonderful about me and I felt so lucky that I'd found a place to go to

210
00:37:22,319 --> 00:37:27,359
have this mirrored for me that I would kind of see this about myself and even

211
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:34,520
though some of it was you know rather um embarrassing maybe or uh you

212
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:42,000
know little bit I would you know cringe about what I'd see in myself I was so

213
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,520
happy I felt much safer as a human being moving through the world when I was

214
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:54,200
being mirrored when I was being shown all the ways in which I was off and um

215
00:37:54,200 --> 00:38:00,440
so that was a protection for me and I love this protection I felt safer being in such a

216
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:07,240
community and um so to be uh to have Community for support to know people

217
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:13,599
more personally uh to be able to witness people's goodness in a way that sometimes you don't see it unless you're

218
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:20,160
sharing and caring for the community life and um and

219
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:26,160
um and so here at IMC I felt it was always important to make it available

220
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:31,480
for people to be volunteers but never require it I

221
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:37,280
thought it was extremely important to not have any sense of obligation around it in any sense that you were less a

222
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:43,480
member of the community if you weren't volunteering so this art of kind of making it very available to people

223
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:49,760
people have all kinds of circumstances in their lives and people have busy lives they have personal circumstances

224
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:57,079
that keep them quite CH are might challenged by and they don't have the ability to the time or the interest to

225
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:02,599
volunteer at their local sa in the community um so the art of that finding

226
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:08,839
that balance of making it available but having no one had any sense of obligation was um kind of The Balancing

227
00:39:08,839 --> 00:39:15,359
Act that we've tried to do here for these many years at IMC as we grew and

228
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:22,359
um and uh so to so whatever your community

229
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:31,480
Buddhist communities that you have that you practice in to offer some care to them and um so you know if you live

230
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:38,720
someplace where there's no no Buddhist community that you're directly connected to if this YouTube is your community

231
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:44,280
these years um maybe there's some simple way that you could volunteer for IMC in

232
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:50,560
the distance uh there are you know people help with technology or help with

233
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:57,160
managing some of the some of the zoom and different things that we do recordings and

234
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:04,079
um so that you know it's not always easy to find volunteer positions for people but it's it's essential for who we are

235
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:09,440
and but I'm not so I'm not trying to not get offering this of fishing for people trying to get people to volunteer here

236
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:14,920
what I'm trying to do is uh talk about this protector this protection we get um

237
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:20,160
when we protect the sa we're protected as well and the primary protection that

238
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:26,640
I celebrate is uh it's a protection from being excessively self-preoccupied

239
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:32,359
maybe even selfish and uh it's hard to see how that works and so to be in some

240
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:39,280
situation where you have to stretch yourself beyond your usual sense of self where you have to drop it and there's

241
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:45,520
all kinds of ways to do that besides supporting a sa so there's other ways there's other SAS there's other

242
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:51,079
communities uh I was struck by how much this was the case um having uh little

243
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:56,560
babies and toddlers boy was that a mirror for myself boy was that the place

244
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:02,680
where I saw ways in which I was self selfish maybe or self-concerned self-

245
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:07,839
preoccupied in ways that I had no idea because it was it those there were ways

246
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:12,880
in which I could do it so freely without in a reasonable healthy way no one could

247
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:18,760
see it I couldn't even see it but the demands of uh caring for young children

248
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:24,599
was such a good mirror wow and um I saw all kinds of things about me that were

249
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:30,359
challenging to see and challenging to let go of even but it was a fantastic s

250
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:35,560
fantastic way that I it was a protection for me to see things that about myself

251
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:43,720
that I haven't even seen in you know long monastic life so to find some ways so uh to be in

252
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:49,240
connected to other people supporting other people that uh steps you out of

253
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:55,319
the little world of self that you might have or um and uh stretch yourself in such a

254
00:41:55,319 --> 00:42:00,520
way that some something that's not needed can be let go so that you find

255
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:06,200
yourself Freer in relationship to living this life where you not don't have the

256
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:13,599
windrag of self-concern you don't have the tension of uh conceit you don't have

257
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:18,680
the you know something you're involved in the world kind of in a more kind of

258
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:24,599
selfless way or impersonal or non-personal way or um without uh you

259
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:30,040
being the center of attention um and uh but the other becomes more

260
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:37,359
valuable and in situations where I've been that way in my life uh I just felt like so it was a freeing movement to do

261
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:43,640
that and uh and in some ways I saw more the possibility of freedom from self-concern self-

262
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:50,640
preoccupation um in supporting and helping others and working for others than sometimes I've seen in meditation

263
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:56,680
itself so this kind of going and going back and forth between meditation and having this challenge of how we live in

264
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:02,119
the world is a wonderful balance and

265
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:07,599
um and uh for some people this teaching about you know being you know doing

266
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:13,200
things more non-personally or without self selfishness and preoccupation needs

267
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:20,440
to be heard very carefully because it's not meant to be any denial or diminishing of the value of this person

268
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:26,920
that we are and U that's me meant to be kind of sacrificing of ourselves uh for

269
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:32,559
others it's meant to uh be able to step forward more fully and become ourselves

270
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:39,960
more fully uh rather than being less but this more fully way of stepping forward

271
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:50,160
um there's something that do the the shell the the ties of self-c concern can um

272
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:56,920
fall off as we do so so thank you

273
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:05,920
and um May you consider ways in which your support your care for

274
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:13,559
others uh May uh be a mirror for you to see yourself better and help you break

275
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:22,000
out of the ways that self-c concern is limiting for you so thank you very

276
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:26,839
much
