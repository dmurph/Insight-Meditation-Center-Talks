1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,960
good evening good evening welcome welcome

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,799
wherever you might be i hope that you're doing well

3
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:21,759
and we'll do a little bit of a guided meditation here

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:31,279
um just settling in to

5
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,520
this moment to this experience

6
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:51,360
and feeling what it feels like

7
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,320
to be here now

8
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,120
how does it feel in the body

9
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,799
just in a global sense

10
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,880
how does it feel in the mind just in a

11
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:28,799
general way is the mind busy is the mind feeling sluggish

12
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,118
or maybe there's a brightness a

13
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,439
sharpness

14
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:53,200
however i might be with the body with the mind

15
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,280
can we welcome our experience

16
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,280
without pushing any of it away

17
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,920
without quietly demanding that it be different

18
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:25,280
but instead tuning into aligning with

19
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,879
the experience right now

20
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,560
maybe tuning in to the experience of breathing

21
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,800
feeling the body breathe

22
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,959
feeling the stretching expanding

23
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:34,519
from there contracting non-stretching

24
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,120
just in an easy natural rhythm

25
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:02,760
resting our attention on these sensations of breathing

26
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:50,160
it wouldn't be unusual wouldn't be surprising

27
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:58,400
if we find that the mind has some momentum and momentum with thinking

28
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,440
and we find ourselves perhaps lost in thought

29
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:11,840
a little bit disconnected from our breathing we don't have to make that a problem

30
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,960
just oh here i am meditating

31
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:27,479
very simply gently begin again with the sensations of breathing

32
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,840
by resting our attention on the sensations of breathing

33
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,840
we start to notice how much the mind

34
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:36,560
wants to be making stories or planning remembering

35
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:44,319
fantasizing chances are we would notice

36
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:50,800
if we hadn't set the intention of noticing the breathing

37
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,400
that's one of the functions of mindfulness of breathing

38
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:14,160
is to highlight help us notice what the mind wants to do

39
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:20,280
the momentum the inclination of the mind

40
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,440
it can be helpful to notice not only

41
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:40,279
these movements of the mind of planning or fantasizing remembering

42
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:47,839
but also to notice those little subtle thoughts

43
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,440
maybe that arise when we first become aware that we've been lost

44
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,040
in thought is there a little voice like oh shoot

45
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:07,959
or maybe oh that's right i'm supposed to meditate

46
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,920
we can notice those thoughts too

47
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:38,800
otherwise we just are hanging out with the sensations of breathing

48
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,480
it can be helpful to set the intention to be with the

49
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,839
entirety of an in-breath

50
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,800
and the entirety of an out breath

51
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,760
beginning middle and end

52
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:58,720
the entirety of the in-breaths and out-breaths and the transitions

53
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,680
between the types of breaths

54
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:06,880
we might notice that there are little subtle thoughts

55
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:16,319
where the intention is on the breath maybe a fleeting thought

56
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,240
oh i feel this more in my chest i used to

57
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:28,800
feel this more in the abdomen or maybe there's a little

58
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:36,000
fleeting thought in between the in-breath and the out breath during that transition

59
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,000
we don't have to make it a problem we're just noticing

60
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,799
so sometimes our thoughts

61
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:37,679
are subtle we don't notice them but they may have an impact on us

62
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:44,080
they may have an impact on those we come in contact with

63
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:50,240
in the sense that what we're thinking affects us maybe in ways that we don't notice

64
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,279
and then we're find ourselves saying things or doing

65
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:03,559
things that are in response to these subtle thoughts that perhaps we hadn't seen

66
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:10,240
so as part of our meditation to be aware of what's happening in our

67
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:16,278
minds in our

68
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,880
and this subtle and not so subtle ways that our minds work

69
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:28,320
not that we have to make it a problem and not that we have to make it different

70
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:35,279
but there's something about just noticing that can help us not be pushed around by

71
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:43,679
them so may this practice that we do

72
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:49,000
be for the benefit of all beings everywhere

73
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:57,630
[Music]

74
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:45,120
good evening good evening welcome welcome

75
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,399
a really warm welcome

76
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:58,000
so i would just like to share with you this

77
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,320
this verse that i stumbled upon in the suit does that i've just been thinking about and i really

78
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:10,480
appreciate for a number of different reasons so the verse goes like this and i

79
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:16,320
thought that maybe i would unpack it and we could explore it together

80
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:24,399
little thoughts subtle thoughts when followed stir up the heart

81
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:29,760
not comprehending the thoughts of the heart one runs here and there

82
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,799
the mind out of control but

83
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:42,159
comprehending the thoughts of the heart when followed stir up the heart

84
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:47,840
an awakened one ardent restrained and mindful

85
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:54,880
lets them go without a trace so i appreciate this

86
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:00,799
this nod to subtle thoughts little thoughts subtle thoughts

87
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:06,880
sometimes we just like this idea of thinking just gets put into one

88
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:13,519
um category like there's just one type of thoughts but i think so many of us recognize that there's the type of

89
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:19,519
thinking that's a long complicated story or that we're building up and like

90
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:25,919
maybe it's a whole novel that we're writing and sometimes i talk about this that uh

91
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:31,200
sometimes story uh sorry thoughts can be more like oh okay just a chapter before

92
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:38,159
we realize oh yeah i'm supposed to be meditating maybe it's just a paragraph

93
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:43,440
just a sentence sometimes maybe even just a word

94
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,880
maybe they're really loud and obvious and maybe they're not so obvious maybe

95
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:55,039
they're subtle but we could ask ourselves or we might even imagine like how many

96
00:31:55,039 --> 00:32:00,880
small seemingly insignificant thoughts do we have

97
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:09,600
oh during the day and we probably don't notice them and we might follow them innocently enough

98
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:15,919
thoughts like oh i wonder what the news is i haven't checked the news yet today

99
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:23,440
and then we go when we check the news on our favorite gizmo and we find ourselves going to another

100
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:30,799
website and then to another website and maybe before we know it's right we've

101
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:36,320
much more time than we were expecting or anticipating has been spent just kind of

102
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:44,159
like surfing the way of going from one thing to the next there's nothing wrong with that right on the internet but

103
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:51,519
we might notice that somehow we're getting pushed around maybe our intention was not to spend so much time

104
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:57,840
surfing the internet or clicking on this clicking on that

105
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:04,640
but instead we notice that there's that we have this little uh

106
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:11,120
this maybe this push this drive it might be really subtle

107
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,480
to click one more thing one more thing and we might not be noticing kind of a

108
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,919
subtle the sense of lack the sense of

109
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:28,000
there's not enough sense of i need more

110
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,480
and somehow thinking that okay clicking on that next whatever it is somehow going to make us

111
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:42,159
feel better that we need more objects like we need to purchase this thing or

112
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:49,120
i have to consume this information over here read about this other thing or

113
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:57,440
this sense of just needing more maybe we're not even sure what it is that we need

114
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:05,039
so this sense of wanting more can be really subtle or really obvious

115
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:12,398
there was a time on a retreat i remember said uh during the meditation noticing

116
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:20,398
like the desire coming up i didn't notice it at the very beginning but then notice like oh yeah lots of desire here

117
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:27,358
kind of relaxing with it noticing it naming it and feeling kind of like the desire dampening down and

118
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:32,878
sometimes it would flare back up again like oh okay here's desire just

119
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:38,878
one of the hindrances it doesn't have to be a problem just bring some attention to it and like

120
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:44,398
soften and relax and allow it to be there so

121
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:50,079
you know and then the mind starts to settle and i notice this as it starts to settle

122
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:55,760
towards the end of that particular sit the feeling pretty settled but then the

123
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:03,839
bell rings and noticing okay this flare up again with this desire it's going to be the

124
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:10,000
midday meal was going to be next lunch but i thought okay you know i'm just

125
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,000
going to continue sitting and let everybody else go ahead of me in the line

126
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:23,040
noticing that little desire arise but then the mind could just settle again it was very pleasant to kind of

127
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:28,079
like notice how the desire had really abated and settled down just by making

128
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:34,960
room and being for it being with it so then i decide okay it's time i'm

129
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,320
going to go into the dining hall get my plate

130
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:47,920
for those of you who know have been on retreats right it's a buffet i put some on my plate oh this looks

131
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:54,320
good oh i'm gonna put some of this oh look at this this looks good oh i better get some more of that and then put some

132
00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:02,240
more of this on and i hadn't even noticed how this desire was showing up in this

133
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:08,640
different way until i got to the end of the buffet alone and i had mounds of food like all

134
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:14,880
this food on my plate so this feeling like oh i need more i want more this

135
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:20,320
sense of lack had followed me and had just kind of shifted

136
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:26,160
to turn to what i wanted the food so my point here is that it can be

137
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:32,320
really subtle or it can be obvious when it was a little bit more obvious i could work with it and during the meditation

138
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:38,880
but sometimes desire in particular can ever sometimes we use this expression this a

139
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:44,320
long tail that we don't even notice

140
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:51,520
so we might not notice that there's this uh sense of desire that's there but somehow

141
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:57,920
is kind of compelling us forward wants wanting something

142
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:03,280
another type of subtle thought that we might not notice is the inner critic

143
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:11,280
that is this maybe it's almost like a sub personality inside of us that's constantly putting us down

144
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:17,280
belittling us this voice of negativity this self-judgment

145
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:24,720
that we might have blaming ourselves nagging ourselves there's so many different forms it can take

146
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:32,400
this inner critic but it often has an attitude of harshness it's not particularly kind necessarily

147
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,440
but can be harsh and kind of creates this inner climate this inner

148
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:43,359
environment of harshness and when the inner critic is up and

149
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:48,560
running so to speak there can be this feeling of inadequacy

150
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:54,880
i'm not enough and however i am it's not enough and

151
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:02,480
i'm not worthy or i'm inadequate or something like this and there's so much pain and

152
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:08,640
suffering associated with us but for some people it's like so prevalent

153
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,680
they may not even notice it they may just be one of us fall into

154
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:19,040
this category of a subtle thought they might be thinking like oh this is

155
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:24,160
just the way it is this is the way reality is

156
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,359
and it's hard maybe perhaps to imagine that it could be otherwise

157
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:35,440
but this this subtle feelings of lack these subtle feelings of

158
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:42,800
inadequacy these is these are experiences of dukkha

159
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:48,160
we often try to translate as suffering but we can also understand it as

160
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:56,000
something a little more subtle as stress as unsatisfactory

161
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,280
so some of these subtle thoughts are in fact dukkha

162
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:07,920
and we it's the sense of things are not quite right maybe maybe we don't even

163
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,200
have a real word for it for me i was thinking about this that

164
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:19,680
it's a little bit like sometimes um perhaps waking up in the middle of

165
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:25,200
the night but not waking up completely and just having the sense maybe it's too

166
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:30,640
warm and this feeling like oh it's just not quite right in this kind of i'm going

167
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:35,760
like this with my hand thrashing around just feel like oh get these covers off of me it's too hot

168
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:42,960
or something like this this just these gestures get this away from me but we're not quite awake

169
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,079
just this general feeling that things aren't quite right

170
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:54,800
so dukkha can be like that and these subtle gestures where we're not even quite awake can be this

171
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,839
movement this movement of the heart this movement of the mind

172
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:07,200
so of course we want to get rid of dukkha of course we respond we have this reactivity of that

173
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:14,319
we want to get rid of it we've been this is our habit to kind of like push away things that are

174
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:20,720
duca unsatisfactory not quite right we

175
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:26,640
respond out of this reactivity because of the conditions we've learned to do this

176
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:32,319
and of course it's kind of our evolution too right that we have evolved from

177
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:37,520
those individuals who managed to not have the dukkha of dying

178
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:44,000
before they passed on their genes so we have evolved from people who have

179
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:50,000
managed to escape some of the biggest dukkha so

180
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:58,079
so we are conditioned to believe that we have to remove any sense of things aren't quite right that it's not okay

181
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:03,440
have this feeling like i don't accept it this shouldn't be happening

182
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:09,040
of course this is a human response of course we all have this

183
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:16,000
but something that happens when the arises and this reactivity arises and we don't notice it there's some of these

184
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,040
subtle thoughts there can be this sense this attitude of

185
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:27,040
should things should be different this kind of quiet demand

186
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:33,520
that things be a particular way certainly not how they are now but in some other way and

187
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:39,440
this kind of this sense of having a should creates a type of pressure

188
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:46,000
that has this maybe this frantic search for what will satisfy this should or make

189
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,720
this dukkha go away or maybe it's this um

190
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:58,800
just sense of not allowing the experience to unfold but instead to kind

191
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:04,000
of shove the experience into some particular direction

192
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:11,920
so when the sense of dukkha arises there's this reactivity and then this reactivity is which is

193
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:17,280
human but we don't have to have this type of reactivity

194
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:23,359
the kind of activity that's kind of like demanding that things be a certain way or doing things that not to be a certain

195
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:30,480
way and so i described that some of this dukkha is related to the sense of lack

196
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:36,319
like something's missing or maybe a sense of inadequacy like oh yeah i i

197
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:39,359
need something more

198
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:50,880
so we often have this idea that happiness can arise from getting what we want

199
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:58,480
and the same of not getting what we don't want right two sides of the same coin of course

200
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:04,480
and what we don't see is wanting this

201
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:12,160
this craving this wanting itself is also a subtle kind of dukkha

202
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:19,599
so the dukkha arises and there's craving for it to be different but the craving itself is a type of

203
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:24,880
dukkha so there's this way that the and this can be really subtle

204
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:34,240
how the suffering the difficulty the not quite rightness can get perpetuated and can be um

205
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:39,440
a feeling of stuckness of things not being able to move without

206
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,640
this recognition that the craving the wanting itself

207
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:50,400
has a part of duca is this uncomfortable experience

208
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:56,240
but instead what happens very often in our lives that we have this little bit of dukkha

209
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,440
this feeling i want something else and something else arises and we feel a

210
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:09,680
little bit better at that moment and we just naturally assume i feel better because i got something i

211
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:15,520
obtained something there's something new now that's here

212
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:22,480
what we haven't noticed and again this is subtle is that actually the happiness

213
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:28,880
that we're feeling is not because we obtained something it's because the

214
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:36,000
craving has been let go of it's because there's no longer the

215
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,839
this sense of craving that it's the absence of that

216
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:48,400
that has allowed the happiness to arise so this happiness is associated with a letting go

217
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:54,800
but we tend to think that the happiness is associated with it getting so there's a letting go there's kind of

218
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:00,960
a surrendering there's no longer the wanting and

219
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:06,800
we might say well yeah there's no longer the wanting because you got what you wanted

220
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:12,480
but the same feeling of happiness the same feeling of

221
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:18,400
ease can arise when the craving ends

222
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:25,040
just because it ends it's impermanent like everything else

223
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:30,640
maybe the stimulus that was causing us to feel like we needed

224
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:37,040
something went away maybe all those if we're watching tv all those commercials about food and then we

225
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:44,880
feel like oh yeah i'm gonna go into the kitchen and see what's in there maybe we turn off the tv and

226
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:51,200
are no longer seeing all these commercials about food and we no longer have this

227
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:56,640
we feel this lessening i feel a little bit more ease

228
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:03,359
so it's not necessarily because we obtained something but it's because that the

229
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:10,960
craving or the cl the really wanting has been softened that's been let go of

230
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:17,440
and just for us to you know of course we know this but to remind ourselves that this wanting can go away

231
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:22,480
without our having gotten anything

232
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:29,359
that's not the only way in which craving or wanting goes away sometimes it goes away just because the

233
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:36,880
mind is starts becoming busy with something else something maybe there's a settling of

234
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,759
the mind some meditation

235
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:48,720
so this happiness of letting go is different than the then the

236
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:55,440
maybe greater ease that arises with getting something but there's also this letting go of

237
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,640
insisting that things go our way there's also the happiness

238
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:05,359
of aligning with what is

239
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:11,440
yeah so there's this little bit of uncomfortableness here

240
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:18,319
can let go of the idea that it has to be different so there's these deeper kinds of

241
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:23,520
happiness that are not connected with getting what we want but are connected with letting

242
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:31,039
go so suffering

243
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:37,640
many of us know this is of course associated with the first noble truth

244
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:43,599
is suffering and all these noble truths have tasks

245
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:51,960
that are associated with them and the one that's associated with the first noble truth is suffering is to be understood

246
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:58,559
so we often have the misunderstanding that i need to get something in order to

247
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:05,599
be happy in order to make this suffering go away but part of our understanding of the

248
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:10,960
suffering is that the craving is part of the suffering and the craving

249
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:17,280
and the suffering they get intermingled and feed each other and fuel each other and

250
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:22,400
make it difficult for the suffering to diminish and to go away

251
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:28,960
so can we understand this about dukkha

252
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:34,400
that craving is a second noble truth but to understand that craving is part

253
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:42,000
of it it's also the cause of it but also craving itself is dukkha

254
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:49,680
and so then this brings me to the next part of this verse the next part of this verse which

255
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:55,760
i've says not comprehending the thoughts of the heart

256
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:00,880
not comprehending the thoughts of the heart one runs here and there the mind

257
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:06,079
out of control trying to end this dukkha

258
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:14,000
in some way trying this looking there and whatever will help right there sometimes

259
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:22,240
and this can be really subtle i keep on using this word subtle it can be very quiet it can be not in the

260
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:27,520
maybe not what's obvious not what we're paying attention to but sometimes i kind

261
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:32,960
of think of it like peripheral vision it's like these kind of little thoughts

262
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:40,319
that are on the side this sense of searching maybe a little bit of restlessness of trying to find

263
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:46,480
so i spoke about we're trying to find something that's craving and this sense of lack this

264
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:54,240
sense of inadequacy so that can be one way in which the mind and the heart are running all about but

265
00:49:54,240 --> 00:50:01,680
another way is with papancha many of you are familiar with this word papancha it's a polyword

266
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:08,400
often we can translate it as a mental proliferation that is there's this one thought and

267
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:14,240
then it just snowballs into maybe it's a sentence that turns into a paragraph

268
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:20,079
that turns into a chapter that turns into a big novel

269
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:25,680
so andy olinsky he says he describes uh papancha as these narrative loops that

270
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:32,160
play over and over again in the mind and the trains of thought pulling out of

271
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:37,760
the station one after another and taking us for a long ride down the track before

272
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:43,119
we even know that we're on board so i kind of like this idea right that

273
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:48,400
these trains of thought we just jump on and off we go

274
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:55,599
so that's another way that we can think about this second part of the verse not comprehending the

275
00:50:55,599 --> 00:51:02,400
thoughts of the heart one runs here and there the mind out of control

276
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:09,920
so the idea is that papancha is based on thought we

277
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:17,040
in the suit does it says that what one thinks about that one mentally proliferates

278
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:23,839
so it starts with a thought and then turns into papancha but then this verse continues so there

279
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:30,400
is an escape from this the verse continues but comprehending

280
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:36,880
the thoughts of the heart when followed stir up the heart so recognizing that all thoughts whether

281
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:42,160
they are subtle or not have consequences

282
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:47,839
of course they have consequences everything has consequences and sometimes we tend to think that okay if

283
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:55,200
they're subtle they're insignificant but it turns out that actually settle is

284
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:02,400
significant i remember when i first heard shinzen young say this

285
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:08,160
that settle is significant i heard a dharma talk that he gave and i

286
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:14,319
really have that's really has stayed with me i think it's true so often these subtle thoughts for these

287
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:20,160
little subtle things that we aren't paying attention to we tend to be dismissive of them

288
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:25,440
but in fact they have consequences and maybe because they're all are subtle we

289
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:31,440
don't really notice and i appreciate the translation translator here for this

290
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:37,760
is teniserobiku and he's talking about thoughts of the heart

291
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:43,440
you know conventionally in the west we often think about thoughts or in the mind but he's talking about thoughts of

292
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:49,200
the heart so maybe the thoughts of the heart or things maybe

293
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:54,640
they show up in a different way maybe they're inclinations or

294
00:52:54,640 --> 00:53:02,000
they are movements rather than clearly articulated but nevertheless

295
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:09,200
they have consequences and they impact us so then this verse ends with

296
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:14,640
an awakened one ardent restrained and mindful

297
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:20,000
lets them go without a trace so without getting tangled up with the

298
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:26,000
thoughts and awakened one we can interpret an awakened one here as

299
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,440
one who understands one who sees clearly one who isn't sleeping through

300
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:39,359
the subtle things that are happening but one who is paying attention an awakened one ardent restrained and

301
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:46,160
mindful ardent pointing to that it takes a little bit of energy

302
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:53,520
maybe we can't kind of just drift through our meditations but to put some a little bit of effort

303
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:59,280
in there not too much so that we're jumping onto everything

304
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:04,720
and to be restrained that is to not follow where these thoughts are going

305
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:10,559
and to be mindful of course lets them go

306
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:18,800
without a trace maybe this idea feels aspirational be

307
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:26,800
able to let them go without a trace but it's pointing to something important

308
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:34,079
it's pointing to that happiness doesn't lay with getting what we want it doesn't lay with following all our

309
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:41,280
whims and there's a practice to help us discover again and again this potential

310
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:46,318
of letting go of not following

311
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:53,280
so this verse again little thoughts subtle thoughts when

312
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:58,400
followed stir up the heart not comprehending the thoughts of the

313
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:04,960
heart one runs here and there the mind out of control

314
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:10,880
but comprehending the thoughts of the heart when followed

315
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:16,960
stir up the heart an awakened one ardent restrained and

316
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:22,798
mindful lets them go without a trace

317
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:30,720
so this bow to the power perhaps of subtle thoughts quiet

318
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:38,160
thoughts little thoughts and how they might be some forms of dukkha

319
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:44,640
and gil he i read an article recently he based on a dharma talk that he gave i

320
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:50,520
don't remember exactly year 2000 2002 something like this and he called it

321
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:57,280
intolerance of suffering and he was and he kind of was using that

322
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:02,319
word intolerance of suffering as a way to be a little bit provocative

323
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:08,240
but this idea he's pointing to the same thing here how we tolerate

324
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:14,000
some of the dukkha of this little bit of craving this little bit of inner critic

325
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:21,040
feeling inadequate we like tolerate we allow these sufferings

326
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:29,119
that might be subtle maybe familiar but the encouragement is to notice them

327
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:34,640
and not so that we can add more suffering on top and create a big long story about how we're bad

328
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:39,920
meditators because we have them but to notice the impact that they can have on

329
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:46,400
our lives to notice the way that our responding to these might be

330
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:51,839
influencing our moods our attitudes our behavior in

331
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:58,880
ways perhaps we don't notice just an encouragement to

332
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:04,559
pay attention of the thoughts and the heart or maybe even the way the heart gets

333
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:10,559
stirred up by some of these subtle thoughts

334
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:17,440
and may the way that we notice that we get stirred up with some of these subtle quiet

335
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:22,880
thoughts the way that we notice and then we can

336
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:28,799
maybe bring some compassion to the suffering for ourself

337
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:35,920
and to recognize oh the same thing happens in others maybe if some people behave in a way

338
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:40,960
that's unskillful unhelpful maybe we might consider

339
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:47,920
that they perhaps have their heart is stirred up maybe they have some of these thoughts and which they haven't noticed

340
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:52,319
that's causing them to behave in a particular way

341
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:59,760
so in this way noticing that subtle thoughts of the heart can be a benefit for ourselves

342
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:06,559
and for others those who are around us and maybe

343
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:11,599
they're having maybe received compassion or from us or

344
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:17,920
maybe some non-reactivity from us maybe others can spread that along to others

345
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:25,119
and in this way we can have more more ease and peace in the world

346
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:28,359
thank you
