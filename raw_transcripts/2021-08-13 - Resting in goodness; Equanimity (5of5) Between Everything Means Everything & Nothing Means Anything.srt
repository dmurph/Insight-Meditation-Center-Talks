1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,319
so welcome all uh it's sweet to see uh

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,959
the the names uh names streaming through

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,240
so um yeah happy too uh happy to be with you

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,400
and uh that's uh that's it

5
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:28,880
just as you take your your posture

6
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,240
sense of of your body remembering all the practice you've done

7
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,920
all the goodness you've nurtured

8
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:52,960
all the letting go and the patience the equanimity

9
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,798
all the stillness

10
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:09,920
all the determination just getting a little sense of

11
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,000
the wholeness of that karmic stream

12
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,720
and of course we can trace that back further not just our life but we're here

13
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,599
because of the the lineage of

14
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:09,800
of understanding of love of compassion

15
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,879
where beneficiaries and also will be causes

16
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:04,799
for more goodness in this uh stream

17
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,439
of dhamma

18
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:36,599
just feeling into the the blessings of this path

19
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,080
it could have been otherwise we could have lived

20
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,920
a whole life never

21
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,680
listening to

22
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:11,240
the voices of uh of longing within us longing to be free

23
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:54,320
as we we contemplate this kind of blessing gratitude

24
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,320
things get quiet still

25
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,959
perhaps you make the soundscape the field of

26
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,959
sound and silence the

27
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,839
objective attention

28
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,639
there are all the outer sounds sounds from

29
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,120
wherever you are sound of my voice

30
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:07,240
but also the inner sounds that we usually just call thinking

31
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:16,600
let me just make the entire soundscape one field

32
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:29,160
not distinguishing so much inner sounds outer sounds

33
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,079
and also those moments of silence

34
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,919
the heart cannot rest and it's clinging

35
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:37,440
so we relax we surrender to the

36
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,840
imperfection the human condition

37
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:59,440
we find ways of giving the heart some rest

38
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:08,919
because so macha is asked of our heart

39
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,759
it's not indulgent or self-serving

40
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,320
to that at rest

41
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:18,179
[Music]

42
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:17,278
so welcome once again

43
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,240
so the last last

44
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,600
reflection in this series on on equanimity

45
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,840
um

46
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,679
so i saw saw a couple um

47
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:51,919
bumper stickers recently um that i liked a lot uh

48
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:57,519
the first one was on a station wagon and it was uh

49
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:05,039
black background white letters and it just said uh i used to be cool

50
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:13,518
um what does that have to do with equanimity i don't know not not much that doesn't really tie in

51
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:19,279
maybe to yesterday's theme but there's more just i like that bumper sticker and

52
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:25,360
just wanted to share that with you the other one this one is very relevant

53
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:33,840
for today it said um cynicism is obedience

54
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,720
cynicism is obedience

55
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:46,399
one of the most most common misconceptions

56
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:53,039
about equanimity is that it's a a form of indifference or passivity

57
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:59,279
or maybe even cynicism but

58
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:04,480
equanimity is not about the future

59
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:11,120
in a sense it's not even really about the presence it's it's about accepting

60
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:16,320
what has already arisen what has come to pass

61
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:25,679
yeah that that moment of the very recent past that is here

62
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:32,880
can we open to that that this is the fruit of this moment

63
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:39,360
and a moment of deep equanimity

64
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:46,158
now does not imply passivity in the next moment

65
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,240
passivity or action that is really another

66
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:02,399
question it's not actually so closely linked to the question of

67
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:10,360
equanimity the practice of equanimity again shinzon young equanimity involves

68
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:16,080
non-interference with the natural flow of sensory experience apathy

69
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:24,200
implies indifference to the controllable outcome of objective events

70
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:30,880
now this is an important clarification

71
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:36,240
and some of the confusion comes because

72
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:43,840
we extrapolate meditation instructions as instructions for life

73
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,760
right so some meditation instructions some of the

74
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:55,919
things we say during a guided meditation are indeed instructions for living but

75
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:01,919
some aren't yeah so in guided meditations

76
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:09,039
i never say okay now breathe out

77
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:15,280
and at the end of your exhale scratch anything

78
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:22,000
and everything that itches yeah that's not an instruction

79
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:29,599
we tend to give but if i were life if i were doing some life coaching i would tell you yeah most

80
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:34,960
of the time when you have an itch scratch it yeah

81
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:41,200
um meditation instructions are they're a training ground you know

82
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:47,440
and um they're a cultivation of of uh these

83
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:56,320
beautiful qualities of the heart but they can't be not all of them can be easily

84
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:02,640
extrapolated to all conditions the complexities of being human

85
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:09,760
and so we we you know when we're teaching we say we're desperate we'll say whatever we can to

86
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,839
support non-clinging love determination

87
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:20,800
yeah and um and there those instructions they have

88
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,000
uh uh obviously a place an important place we gather here to practice

89
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:35,599
together but they can't be traced out in a linear way to all of life you know

90
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:42,839
so when when it matures when

91
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:50,640
equanimity matures it it enlivens rather than dampens our

92
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,760
commitments to to alleviating suffering

93
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:01,359
and the the poignancy of feeling that i

94
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:09,520
described a couple days ago that that sticks to our bones yeah

95
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:17,599
this way that that equanimity is a kind of um in in the cauldron of experience the

96
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:25,520
equanimity meeting dukkha that um our life becomes much less melodramatic

97
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:30,720
but more and more poignant and

98
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:36,000
it's like there's a lot of feeling the heart moves easily

99
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,560
but it's it's surrounded by the tranquilizing factors yeah

100
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:49,359
the depth of feeling occurs in a kind of ambiance of

101
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:55,640
of years of tranquility of equanimity

102
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:03,119
the the buddha was worried about nihilism

103
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:11,320
you know and there there are experiences there are meditative experiences

104
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:18,160
that can tend towards that way experiences where where everything

105
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:23,359
everything all sensory impressions have one taste

106
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:29,119
and you know it's like

107
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:34,960
the world is like a gust of wind and we're like a gust of wind

108
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:42,559
all phenomena just kind of blowing through a kind of

109
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,240
space blowing through emptiness and

110
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:55,200
one might get the impression amidst that that um

111
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:01,119
it's all the same and in this way nothing matters

112
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:08,079
but the buddha found the middle path between extremes between

113
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:16,079
everything means everything and nothing means anything

114
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:23,440
when uh when everything means everything you

115
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:29,839
you can't stop caring you can't stop worrying you can't stop giving

116
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:35,280
you can't justify even a moment's rest

117
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:44,800
and when nothing means anything love love dissolves and

118
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:50,960
all goodness is at risk so

119
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:57,119
equanimity it really um one way of thinking about it is that it

120
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:04,320
purifies our compassion purifies our compassion

121
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:09,680
it makes it less compulsive it makes it less

122
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:15,119
codependent less grandiose less self-righteous

123
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:20,640
equanimity purifies our compassion our care

124
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:26,400
and we see that that actions arising from equanimity

125
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:33,119
from this non-interference with with what has arisen

126
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:41,760
um those actions arising from liquidity are more potent have greater moral force

127
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,560
than actions arising from clinging

128
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:58,400
our heart it needs to rest

129
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:06,560
it uh can't always be in a state of openness

130
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:15,119
it can't you know like a blossom it cannot stay open for all seasons

131
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:22,839
and when we feel like too much might be asked of our heart we shut

132
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:28,800
down yeah when we feel like uh the demands

133
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:35,839
are too much we actually shut down and so

134
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,400
shown one child who's hungry we humans get very generous

135
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:48,319
shown a thousand we start to shut down

136
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:55,119
and of course i'm here to uh

137
00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:00,960
to tell you there are a thousand a thousand

138
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:08,880
thousand and can we can we open to this

139
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:15,359
can can compassion meet that fully

140
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:20,480
full-heartedly radically their pain

141
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,839
permeating our heart their pain

142
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:31,920
spurring action their pain being moralized being a

143
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:38,560
concern for us even though we might be separated

144
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,560
by space or by time

145
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:53,520
but um we can only open to the depth of need we

146
00:41:53,520 --> 00:42:00,160
can only open with compassion when we also trust

147
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:06,079
that the heart can rest in equanimity too

148
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:12,480
we are less intimidated by the enormity of

149
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:18,000
of dukkha yeah we're more

150
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:26,160
willing to spend our our well-being to spend our love on

151
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:32,319
others because we know there's peace too

152
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:37,359
and we know that peace is the only state that doesn't

153
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:43,119
fatigue the heart peace is the only state that doesn't

154
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:46,799
need its seasons

155
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:56,720
and so we have a place to rest

156
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:04,079
and then we open again we love deeply again we leave

157
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:12,680
it all on the floor and then rest again

158
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:24,560
the philosopher dark parfait

159
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,920
if we are the only rational beings in the universe as some

160
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:35,440
evidence suggests it matters even more whether we shall

161
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,720
have descendants or successors during the billions of years in which that

162
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:46,720
would be possible some of our successors might live lives

163
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:52,839
and create worlds that though failing to justify past

164
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:58,800
suffering would give us all including some of those

165
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:07,720
who have suffered reasons to be glad that the universe exists

166
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:15,520
yeah reasons to be glad that the universe exists

167
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:31,359
