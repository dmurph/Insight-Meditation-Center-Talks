1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:08,879
so good day to everyone and good to be here with you

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:16,240
and the topic uh continues to be for this week samadhi

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:23,600
samadhi meaning usually translated as concentration

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:31,439
and one of the verbs associated with samadhi is abiding

5
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:39,120
to dwell or abide in these different good qualities of samadhi

6
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,239
and learning to abide is uh

7
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:50,960
you know is lingering is due is uh result residing in these states

8
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:58,640
as opposed to being in these states and striving or pushing or trying to have more

9
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:05,439
and the tremendous value of when we get settled have landed here in the present moment

10
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,960
and feel settled here to learn how to abide in those states

11
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:17,680
and the biting is not a passive thing exactly though there's very little doing and

12
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:27,360
it's very consequential which i'll talk about later so to abide also is to be receptive

13
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,400
to abide and allow the goodness of a particular state to nourish us to

14
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,600
penetrate into us so and a lot of samadhi has to do with

15
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,880
letting go and so we could understand it a little bit as

16
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,680
abiding in the goodness of letting go abiding in the nourishment

17
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:59,600
that happens when we let go so we'll start this meditation

18
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,680
and and we'll do this abiding and receiving of

19
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:12,399
this nourishment or goodness of letting go of relaxing

20
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:22,959
so to assume a beneficial meditation posture

21
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:29,760
with some care to take a posture that will allow you

22
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:38,560
kind of a maximum amount of relaxation without falling asleep a balance between

23
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,920
remaining alert but allowing for deep in a sense deep body work to happen

24
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:53,040
as meditation kind of begins penetrating into all the different corners of our muscles

25
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,680
and allowing for deeper and more thorough letting go

26
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:11,040
and to gently close your eyes and without breathing deeply this time

27
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,760
just simply sitting here i'll direct you to relax different parts

28
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:24,000
of your body and as those parts relax linger a bit

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,120
with whatever good feelings are there with having relaxed kind of let yourself

30
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,360
take in even if the good feeling is a real kind of relief a local relief

31
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,680
of not being tense or maybe there's a pleasure

32
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:51,120
allow yourself to abide and receive the good feelings that might come

33
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,760
with relaxing so on the exhale then

34
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,159
relaxing the shoulders

35
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:15,840
releasing the shoulders and

36
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:29,840
perhaps there's a way to also release and relax the arms and the hands

37
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,840
so from the shoulders all the way down to the fingers

38
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:44,560
relaxing releasing and then receiving whatever lingering good feelings are there with

39
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:57,840
that however mild or small

40
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,080
relaxing the muscles of the face

41
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:13,919
and even if there's also uncomfortable sensations for now receive the comfortable ones the

42
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:25,840
pleasant ones as you relax your face

43
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,840
as you exhale relax the belly

44
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:50,160
sometimes harder to feel good feelings with a relaxed belly but maybe there are

45
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,840
some that linger

46
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,880
also in the legs the thighs and the calves all the way

47
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:17,360
down to the feet these are some the muscles there be released

48
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:24,319
and feel some good some nice pleasant feeling of vitality or

49
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:42,560
relief and then bring your attention to your

50
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:53,039
breathing as you breathe as you exhale

51
00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:01,280
see if you can relax your whole body on the exhale and feel whatever

52
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,360
goodness comes from that relaxing

53
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:17,840
an opening a softening a settling

54
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:31,840
perhaps more of a sense of flow and vibration in the body

55
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,840
and the exhale itself is a kind of letting go

56
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,759
allow for the full letting go of the exhale

57
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,639
and not always easy to feel but maybe you can feel some parts of the exhale

58
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,479
the release and letting go

59
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:13,840
as a nourishment as a good feeling

60
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,840
the exhale part of the goodness of the exhale

61
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:41,839
is letting go of thoughts as you exhale

62
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:55,839
letting go of thoughts and letting go into the body breathing

63
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
in whatever openness receptivity there might be there at the end of the

64
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:23,839
exhale receive the inhale

65
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:36,160
let go your thoughts your thinking as you exhale

66
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,399
and allow yourself to feel how that might be good feel good or

67
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:48,240
pleasant to not be caught up in your thoughts and

68
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:54,640
thinking and abide rest in

69
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:05,040
the quiet and openness and receptivity of awareness in your body

70
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,120
that remains when you let go of your

71
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,839
thoughts

72
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:33,200
and then as you inhale in the abiding with the breathing

73
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:47,839
there can be also a receptivity in allowing the inhale to arise

74
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:58,560
the inhale to arise in the vibrating

75
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:06,320
flowing tingling vibration of the body

76
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:29,839
to abide and receive here in this body

77
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:47,040
and whatever letting go or relaxing you do relax in the body relaxing the mind

78
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:56,320
releasing the exhale whatever settling in that happens

79
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,800
feel and sense and abide

80
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,480
in the good feelings that are associated

81
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,399
reside in us in the goodness of it

82
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:25,839
allow it to nourish you to spread through you

83
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,880
staying close to your breathing

84
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:54,639
with a letting go of the exhale and the allowing of the inhale

85
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:05,920
each within the abiding here in the goodness pleasantness

86
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:17,839
that is also here

87
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:51,440
letting go into receptive state receptive with your body to the

88
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:59,360
pulsing vibrating flowing dynamic sensations of the body

89
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:06,720
allowing them receiving them where part of the goodness

90
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:16,000
is the receptive state he is the simple abiding and receiving

91
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:25,600
and to feel the goodness of abiding receiving

92
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:31,920
this body this body breathing

93
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,839
letting the thinking mind become quieter

94
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:51,839
so you can more fully abide and receive

95
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,840
so

96
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:12,240
to abide in whatever goodness

97
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,600
pleasantness enjoyability there is here now

98
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,840
and breathe within that breathe with that

99
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:31,840
quietly receptively

100
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:41,679
with an inner quietude that is sensitive available

101
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:50,720
receptive simply to abide here and now

102
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:01,120
with whatever is here not trying to make anything happen

103
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,399
just abiding in whatever goodness is

104
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,840
available

105
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,840
so

106
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,679
and as we come to the end of this sitting

107
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:45,120
to abide here in the present moment

108
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,480
for these last minutes to abide

109
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:57,760
not to do anything or accomplish anything

110
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:06,000
but to be at rest or at ease in one own one's own skin and body

111
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:19,360
and whether you actually can do this well or not you might just imagine yourself

112
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:30,240
in a circumstance where you can just abide just be rather than do

113
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:36,240
some place where you feel comfortable and safe and settled

114
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:45,840
where you have all the time in the world and no pressure

115
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:52,640
and in this state in the privacy of your own mind and

116
00:28:52,640 --> 00:29:01,039
heart let others the presence of others

117
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,960
abide also here with you

118
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:14,640
so that others are abiding around you or with you without requiring anything of you

119
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,000
needing anything of you

120
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:30,960
and in this way perhaps you can open up a kindness a care

121
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:39,760
maybe even a love good will that it's almost not a doing

122
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:48,399
but more how the heart vibrates when nothing is needed you feel safe

123
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:55,840
and you take in the humanity of another person

124
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:06,840
and without requiring anything that you do or say to the person to

125
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:15,679
people can you gaze upon them kindly

126
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:23,840
gaze upon them with goodwill

127
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:39,679
and may they and all beings be happy

128
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:51,840
may the people you think of and all others be safe and peaceful

129
00:30:53,520 --> 00:31:04,320
may the people that you consider and all others be free

130
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:13,278
and may it be that the benefits of this meditation practice

131
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:19,039
in seeing in unseen ways intentional and unintentional ways

132
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:26,159
may those benefits spread out to benefit the people around you and the

133
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:32,480
world around you may the goodness of your meditation

134
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:40,720
be for the welfare and happiness of all beings yourself and all the rest

135
00:31:41,440 --> 00:32:01,270
may it be their meditation changes the world for the better

136
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:04,760
[Music]

137
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:01,120
uh so the

138
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:08,240
11th step of mindfulness of breathing is breathing in one concentrates

139
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,919
breathing out one concentrates concentrates the mind

140
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:22,840
and so this relates to the whole topic of samadhi in buddhism words often translated as

141
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:29,679
concentration and and we're spending more days on this

142
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:36,799
step because uh the samadhi is such an important foundation for the

143
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:43,200
final steps of mindfulness of breathing and we don't want to rush through this

144
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:49,360
ideally you're kind of coming along a little bit following just enough getting a sense or

145
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:56,080
a feel for what we're what these steps are about that you have some inner reference point for what

146
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:01,120
we're doing as we continue going on even though the next steps are getting to

147
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:06,799
very kind of more classically are describing deeper and deeper states of

148
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:13,118
meditation these 16 steps are also relevant

149
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:18,398
on well short of deep states of meditation you think we kind of can go through them

150
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:23,440
even in relatively ordinary states and recognize kind of little shifts that

151
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:28,720
represent these different states so i'm hoping there's enough by going slow

152
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:36,638
enough that that you know you can follow enough so we're spending more time with samadhi

153
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:43,839
and um so um i've already said some of this that um

154
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:51,200
the the word in this 16 stages for concentrate has also been translated as

155
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:57,200
steady and i like to translate it as unify unific to unify the mind

156
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:02,400
or steady the mind or

157
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:09,200
stabilize the mind the word is uh samahadati and the

158
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:15,920
the verb adati means to um to play something so it's like placing

159
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:21,760
them placing the mind or placing awareness on the object that we're focusing on so

160
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,200
placing it on the breathing i love the expression landing just landing on it

161
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,880
and just kind of gently landing like a like little helicopter held a drone or something or

162
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,240
like a bird that comes in and just kind of i guess it flies in almost stops in in

163
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:44,240
the air inch or so above the ground and then just lands on the ground so we come right in

164
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:50,400
there we land and um and settle place ourselves

165
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:57,280
the i'm very fond of using the word compose composure as this

166
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:03,119
we're composing ourselves on the breathing and that samadhi is an act of composing ourselves

167
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:09,520
because of the word pose also means to place or to stand someplace so we're taking a stand and

168
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:16,320
resting in there and um and um

169
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,760
to settle to study are all these words associated with samadhi

170
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:27,280
and now samadhi itself is often translated as concentration but it

171
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:33,680
more generally means meditation or a state that we're in a state of mind that we're

172
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:40,640
in that can be many different states where we're quite settled and steady and peaceful and and i want i wanted to read

173
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:50,400
you very early uh commentary the from the um a very early commentary

174
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:57,440
where it lists it kind of defines samadhi and it's a wonderful definition

175
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:06,560
a whole series of little definitions samadhi means embracing

176
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:13,440
samadhi means completion samadhi means single pointed

177
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:20,079
samadhi means unconfused samadhi means unscattered

178
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:26,720
samadhi means undisturbed samadhi means unperturbed

179
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:32,720
samadhi means liberation and the next one is particularly nice

180
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:39,040
next series samadhi is seeking harmony

181
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:47,520
samadhi is acquiring harmony samadhi is receiving harmony

182
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:54,640
samadhi is grasping harmony taking hold of it samadhi is

183
00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:02,079
entering harmony samadhi is going along in harmony

184
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:09,359
samadhi is a light lightening up in harmony

185
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:19,200
samadhi is being lit up in harmony samadhi is harmony welfare and happiness

186
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:25,200
so it's like i think it's a wonderful list this idea of harmony

187
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:32,640
or evenness or balance the word is sama s-a-m-a and um

188
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:38,480
and so you get a very different feeling for samadhi from these kinds of descriptions than

189
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:44,800
you would if you just told that samadhi is a one-pointedness of mind and when you talk about when you talk

190
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:51,200
about these absorption states jhana which sometimes the way that they're talked about they have the intensity and

191
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:56,240
a kind of laser idea and people really try hard to get into it not

192
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:01,839
really realizing a big part of this samadhi is letting go relaxing

193
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:09,280
settling deeper and deeper and deeper and then but for these

194
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:16,079
jhanas these absorption absorption states the verbs related to them are entering

195
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:24,320
the states and abiding in them and this idea of entering is a i think is a beautiful image that

196
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:31,680
we're not looking to zero in we're not looking to force ourselves to be a state but rather

197
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,960
we're kind of entering into and i like to think of entering into a sacred uh

198
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,480
area a sacred piece of land or a temple where we enter into with some reverence

199
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,680
and respect and care and how we are how we enter

200
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:53,599
is important part of the entering and then we the two verbs are to enter and to

201
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:59,359
abide it means that we take time just to linger in those states to reside in

202
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:04,800
those states and in whatever kind of samadhi states

203
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,920
or good states or nourishing states there are we abide in them so that we can be

204
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:15,359
conditioned by them there's a reconditioning process that happens through meditation

205
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:22,000
that we're allowing ourselves to um you know life as we go through can

206
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,760
condition us in all kinds of negative ways and meditation is to undo that the

207
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:34,720
conditioning that comes from great hatred and delusion is very different the condition that comes from generosity and love and

208
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:41,119
and wisdom and so uh some people have even said that samadhi is kind of a re-parenting

209
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:47,520
if parenting didn't go so well as for us growing up it has uh the very deep and profound

210
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:55,359
impact on us too if we allow ourselves to be nourished by it which requires abiding abiding in it

211
00:40:55,359 --> 00:41:01,440
dwelling in it so that we really can let the goodness of these states really seep

212
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,720
in and affect us and if we're in a hurry to get more and more concentrated

213
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:13,440
we're not going to get allow the nourishment to really recondition us and open us and soften us in in a way that's

214
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:19,119
useful on the path of liberation and i thought i would also read to you

215
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:24,800
the a list of the things that buddha talks about that people that encourage people

216
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:30,319
to abide in so he's not just saying you know in modern

217
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:37,839
united states there's often discussion about a being rather than doing and meditation is a chance just to be i

218
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:43,599
don't think the buddha would quite say it that way rather than being he talks about abiding

219
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:51,040
maybe very closely related just abide but he's always talking about abiding in something in

220
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:56,880
something that's wholesome and good not just being angry you know or fuming

221
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:02,800
if you just abide in that maybe that maybe has a negative impact if that

222
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:09,599
fuming and resentment and anger just kind of simmering along and in some way

223
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:16,319
so that's a whole different topic about you know how to be wise with things like anger but with the buddha

224
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:21,520
it's abiding so here's these states of abiding the buddha talks about

225
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:28,720
abiding in safety abiding in fearlessness

226
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:36,400
abiding in a mind free from the hindrances abiding in

227
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,920
equanimity abiding in contentment

228
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:50,480
abiding in pleasure inviting in happiness and gladness

229
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:58,880
abiding in happiness without moving the body or uttering a word

230
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:06,400
abiding in loving kindness abiding in compassion

231
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:12,160
abiding in a mind like space

232
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:19,920
abiding in the dharma abiding observing impermanence

233
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:26,400
abiding in stillness devoted to a pleasant abiding here and

234
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:31,839
now samadhi states are buddha often describes as a pleasant

235
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:37,839
abiding here and now and then abiding in the four foundations

236
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:44,319
of mindfulness and it's very significant that the word is abiding in the four foundations

237
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:50,160
it doesn't say practice the four foundations of mindfulness it says abide in them

238
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:58,400
abiding in bliss abiding in emptiness abiding in peaceful

239
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:04,880
liberations abiding in the supreme goal

240
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:13,119
so to abide one has to be patient i think of abiding as being very closely

241
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:19,760
akin to being in a receptive state so we abide we're patient we're not in a hurry

242
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:25,359
and we receptive state to feel the goodness of all these states all these ways of being

243
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:33,920
that can happen and so one of so we're talking here now about the the 11th step of anapanasati

244
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:40,160
so of course when we sit down to meditate there are times when these are not available and we are angry

245
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:46,560
we are agitated and to sit down and say just sit there and abide in these good feelings

246
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:52,880
just simply doesn't work and but uh so we learned to practice with the first

247
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:58,319
steps of unempathy that really support us in the challenging states of being that

248
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:03,920
we can have in daily life in our ex but as we meditation proceeds

249
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:10,079
then at some point that what i'm calling today the goodness the nourishing feelings

250
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:15,839
the beneficial feelings sensations that are here the buddha encourages us to abide in

251
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:24,720
them and then when they come arise in samadhi in these states of harmony subtleness uh steadiness unification

252
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:30,839
that we really kind of now we're really here in the present moment and really feel that in the present there's a kind

253
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:39,440
of harmony and joy and well-being gladness to all these possible

254
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:45,040
different flavors of the goodness that might be there whatever the flavor is of the day

255
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:51,119
there's also a very important place to abide in it to receive it to let it nourish you and

256
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:57,359
fill you and and let it kind of penetrate and permeate yourself in some way

257
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:04,880
and um um so

258
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:10,640
to dwell in these states is not to be thinking about them

259
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:16,720
it's not be seeking and planning and expecting and wanting and holding on to things it's

260
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:23,119
just simply abiding just allowing them to be there and just kind of basking in it or enjoying it and

261
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:28,960
breathing with it breathing through it now this mindfulness of breathing is all

262
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:35,280
reference point is always breathing breathing in and breathing out so we're always kind of using that as a

263
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:41,520
support as a guide as a grounding as a as a pointer as a as a way of staying

264
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:48,560
in these different steps and so now we're staying breathing abiding in these states abiding in in

265
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:55,040
the present moment you know in the pleasant state here and now

266
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:00,720
so uh the word in pali is biharati it comes related to the word vihara

267
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:06,400
meaning a monastery a place where people amongst the nuns reside

268
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:13,200
and so you might for the next rest of the day next 24 hours have this word

269
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:19,920
abide or abiding viharati vihara as a

270
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:25,359
something you keep close by maybe you write it on a sticky note and and have it with you or have it posted

271
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:33,040
some places and uh and see when in the day you it's beneficial for you

272
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:40,400
to pause and abide with what's happening and especially when there's a goodness or

273
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:46,079
something nourishing and you abide and really take it in learn to abide

274
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:51,200
and learn to unbe nourished by your abiding states

275
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:59,040
so thank you and i will continue with this samadhi for a few more days and until we get to the 12th step with is

276
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:04,400
liberating the mind so um and

277
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:14,640
that's you know only the 12-16 so thank you all very much
