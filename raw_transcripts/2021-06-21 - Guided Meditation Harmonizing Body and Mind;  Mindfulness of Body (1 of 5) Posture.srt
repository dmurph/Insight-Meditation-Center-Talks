1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,760
so good morning everyone and good day

2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:22,640
and i marvel at uh what we're doing here in

3
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,840
these mornings our electronic meeting and

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,800
and that we should somehow have this connection over great geographical distances and

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,000
and to be breathing at the same time practicing mindfulness at the same time

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,160
and each of us being here in our own unique place and

7
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,640
being here [Music] in this broad

8
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:02,960
global way as well and to have this dual hereness it seems pretty profound

9
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,400
that we somehow simultaneously are

10
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:15,840
present for our immediate experience and we have this wondrous and

11
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,000
very significant connection to this here which is broad and wide

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:31,600
and encompassing maybe the globe and so thank you

13
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:38,960
so the here of mindfulness practice has a lot to do with being mindful of the body being here in this

14
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,560
body and if all you did was just recognize that you're here in this body

15
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,159
that this is the body this is the experience of the body over and over

16
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,000
again the mindfulness would grow and develop in all kinds of ways that it does not

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,680
doesn't have to be so complicated or sophisticated just just their simple recognition here in

18
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,680
this body and in a sense the task of mindfulness

19
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,879
is to bring the mind into harmony with the body

20
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:19,920
the body is always in the present moment the mind it may be is often not it's thinking

21
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,760
about the past about the future about fantasy not really connected to what's here and

22
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:33,120
now and if we want the body and mind to be in harmony to work together which is really the best way of

23
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,440
operating in this life and then it's the task of inviting

24
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,440
welcoming the mind into the body

25
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:52,160
into accompanying the body allowing the body to accompany the mind

26
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,280
have these two operating in the same place at the same time

27
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:04,480
and the principle seems quite simple the actuality is that

28
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,840
the mind has a mind of its own and has strong things it wants to do

29
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,959
and when that's the case then it's possible to bring the body to the mind

30
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:21,200
which means really feel physically feel the physicality of a distracted

31
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,959
mind of a preoccupied mind of a of a of a psycho

32
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:33,680
emotional system that is fueled by by emotions feel

33
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:41,040
what's happening that keeps you from the body keeps you from being present but feel it in the body welcome it into

34
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:48,080
the body invite it into the body invite the body into what's what you're feeling so it's

35
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,439
constantly coming back and and creating this intimacy between

36
00:03:53,439 --> 00:04:00,000
the mind and the body so the body is really so we really become more and more grounded

37
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,360
in this body so taking a assuming

38
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:16,720
entering into a posture a bodily posture that supports you

39
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:25,440
both in being present but also supports you in entering more fully into mindfulness

40
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:34,479
of the body almost as if you can be aware from your body through your body

41
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:43,840
all the nerve endings that exist throughout the body

42
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,919
is where awareness begins

43
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:55,520
sometimes we think awareness begins in the mind but awareness begins in the nerve

44
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,199
endings and what is it to relax into all the

45
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:11,840
nerve endings throughout the body and allow the awareness to arise there

46
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,919
so then gently closing the eyes

47
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,440
and to make this connection to the body fuller

48
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:32,479
to invite ourselves into the body you might take a few long slow deep breaths

49
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:42,080
feeling the increase of bodily sensations as you breathe in deeply

50
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,919
maybe throughout the torso

51
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:55,919
sometimes a deep inhalations you can feel the lifting of the chest and the shoulders

52
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:07,840
if the belly is relaxed you can also feel the pushing down into the sitting bones

53
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:18,800
and this combination of lifting and settling moving up and moving down

54
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,800
on the inhale and then relaxing and coming back to the

55
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:35,840
center with the exhale

56
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:49,360
letting your breathing return to normal

57
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:56,639
and allowing all your muscles that are not used to hold your up up

58
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:03,520
hold you upright let all the extra muscles

59
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:11,520
fall away from their bones if you are physically sitting upright

60
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:18,960
you can think of your spine as a post from which hang

61
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,639
all the muscles of the torso and whatever is not used to hold the

62
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:31,840
post upright let it hang from that post

63
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,720
the shoulders the muscles of the shoulders

64
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:46,720
no need to hold them up or tight but as you exhale relax the shoulders

65
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:03,440
in the back ribcage as you exhale let the back ribs also

66
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:13,840
relax and fall away relax away from the spine

67
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:27,840
maybe on the exhale there can be a releasing and relaxing in the small of the back

68
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,639
may be subtle

69
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,560
and as you exhale to soften the belly

70
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,440
maybe the belly doesn't have to work during the exhale

71
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,839
letting the diaphragm do all the work

72
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:09,839
which is mostly the work of releasing the diaphragm releases itself and

73
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:27,040
and softening the muscles of the face relaxing the face

74
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:36,560
sometimes if you feel carefully the face you can feel it's tired the muscles are tired from all the work

75
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,080
of expressing ourselves

76
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,160
to release and relax the muscles of the

77
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,839
face

78
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:03,519
and then to release the tensions in your brain

79
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:09,680
the tightness and pressure associated with thinking if it's there

80
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:18,240
on the exhale relaxing the thinking mind

81
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,600
quieting your thoughts

82
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:35,839
and then maybe as the home for the meditation you can drop into your body to wherever

83
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,800
you feel you're breathing as you meditate

84
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:48,480
but wherever it is be aware of it as sensations physical sensations of the

85
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:57,360
body and the task is to let the mind let the

86
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,640
attention the presence of the mind

87
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,920
be connected to this body breathing

88
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:18,800
appreciating the opportunity to have the mind accompany the body

89
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,160
and the body accompany the mind for them to be working together

90
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,839
with the same focus

91
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:37,680
then when you notice you when you notice you've lost that connection to the body because you've drifted off in

92
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,839
thought re-establish this intimacy this connection to body

93
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,120
this is the place to be

94
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,839
one breath at a time

95
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:48,880
if you have even the slightest anxiety about the meditation

96
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,600
maybe it's helpful if you could know that

97
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,279
it's trustable this practice trust it

98
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,279
it'll work itself out find help you find a way

99
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,840
there's no need to try to do it right

100
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:24,080
especially if you allow yourself just to feel it in your body whatever is here

101
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:31,039
let the body be the home for here and now

102
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:43,840
let the body show itself to you nothing you need to search

103
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,480
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

104
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:21,760
perhaps for a few moments can you allow yourself to be even more

105
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,880
fully centered in your body

106
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:33,440
perhaps feeling how your weight is supported by something the

107
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,278
chair your cushion the bed

108
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,840
feeling the stability of that support

109
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:55,760
how that's stable support affirms that your body is

110
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,840
here and now

111
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:13,200
and staying rooted in your body here

112
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,559
without leaning forward or leaning back without getting

113
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,519
pulled into the world of thoughts too

114
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:31,278
far bring into your hearts the world around you

115
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:41,840
the people in their circles around you and your neighborhoods communities

116
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:48,399
places of work towns countrysides

117
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:55,840
countries and continents and the whole globe

118
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:08,399
and you rooted here in this time and place aware and open to this wide world of

119
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:14,559
living beings and you are one of them

120
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,840
and in the awareness of this wide circle of

121
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:28,240
beings to sit here rooted and grounded with an open heart

122
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,279
and for these last minutes

123
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:40,559
to dedicate the benefits of this practice we've done

124
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:48,559
and may be open to the possibility that that dedication can be for

125
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:57,440
all beings for the welfare and happiness of others and that this might be your wish

126
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:04,720
that's in some way or other known or unknown that your meditation and the way you

127
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:10,159
live your life can be such that it leaves the world in

128
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:19,840
a better place may all beings be happy

129
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,360
may all beings be safe

130
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:33,840
may all beings be peaceful

131
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:47,840
and may all beings be free

132
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:56,230
[Music]

133
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:15,840
thank you

134
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:11,840
here we are

135
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:39,840
and yeah

136
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:52,159
no sound thank you everyone saying it so i jumped ahead

137
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,919
before all the buttons were pushed

138
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,840
so um for this week what i'd like to do is to talk about

139
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,919
um mindfulness of the body to make that the theme

140
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:20,560
and maybe as a theme it can be your theme as you go through the week that um you can um

141
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:27,358
so mindfulness of the body is one of the foundational basic

142
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:35,838
practices for mindfulness it um is

143
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:43,200
it's the first exercise in the discourse on the four foundations of mindfulness

144
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:50,638
the most basic teachings from the buddha on mindfulness practice and in that

145
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:58,079
there are six there's seven exercises now there are six exercises associated with mindfulness of the body

146
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:05,680
and uh here in the seven a.m sittings we've done the first one which is the first tetrad

147
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:12,400
of anapanasati so we did that in january and so i won't do it now this week

148
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:19,119
and and we'll do the remaining five and i'd like to think that these

149
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:25,680
remaining five are built on the foundation of the first exercise that those four tetrads of

150
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:31,040
mindfulness of breathing and we kind of have been the focus so much mindfulness of breathing

151
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:38,000
for um in the 7am sittings that we'll take that just is already kind of

152
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,040
established and then we'll go on to the other exercises

153
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:52,000
and now mindfulness of the body is such a wonderful practice it's a

154
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,599
provides so much one of the things important things it does which i'll emphasize today

155
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:04,880
it's a protection it's a way of being protected as you go through your life and because

156
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:11,359
when you're grounded in your body you're much more able to pick up a wider

157
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:16,480
range of what's happening around you the body is kind of like an antenna that

158
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:22,720
picks up through our all the different

159
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:29,680
forms of perception that the body is capable of including the perception inward perception perception to the emotional

160
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,880
reactions responses we have we're able to pick up what's going on

161
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:40,720
and how we're responding and when we feel there's danger when we feel that there's something to be concerned

162
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:46,400
about not only externally but also internally

163
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:53,040
when when we're in danger of losing our ethics

164
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:59,680
when we're in danger of losing our peace when we're in danger of acting on

165
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:04,960
something which would later regret acting on greed or

166
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:10,160
hatred or delusion and the body is a repository of so much

167
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:17,119
uh evidence for what's shifting and changing in us that uh sometimes it's the early warning

168
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:24,800
sign and sometimes it's the body that gives us indication of what's going on before the mind knows because the the

169
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:32,079
body is more attuned to our subconscious and uh in the mind sometimes is not so s

170
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:38,640
to tune to it maybe because we're preoccupied in other things rushing ahead and so many times in my

171
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,920
life so because i have a habit of checking in with my body

172
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:51,119
do i notice that i'm rushing or notice that i'm tense and or pulling back and

173
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:56,480
holding holding myself back from a situation and i don't notice that in the mind

174
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:02,880
because i'm thinking about things or i want things to be a certain way or you know i'm reacting and

175
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:09,920
living in the reactivity but because of the habit of connecting to my body i feel and sense what's going on

176
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:17,359
better and in the subconscious or the early kind of beginnings of things and so it keeps me

177
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:24,079
safe it keeps me from getting lost into that world of things so the body is a great protector for us

178
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:32,240
mindfulness of the body is if we stay connected and so the second exercise of of uh

179
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:39,359
mindfulness of the body in the four foundations of mindfulness is mindfulness of posture and that

180
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:47,280
doesn't take a lot of refined attention to the body to be aware of posture it's um so in terms of people who

181
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,720
they're many people who are not so connected to their body and there's a lot of reasons for that and

182
00:38:52,720 --> 00:39:00,000
maybe we'll talk more about that as we go along here but but maybe at least we

183
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,720
can kind of recognize the posture that we're in and the bar for this posture mindfulness

184
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:12,000
is pretty low and so i'll read you so you can really know

185
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:19,119
believe me that how low the bar is the buddha says again

186
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:26,000
when walking a practitioner knows i am walking

187
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:33,520
when standing one knows i am standing when sitting when one knows i am sitting

188
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:40,720
when lying down one knows i am lying down so that seems like a pretty low bar do

189
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:47,760
you know that's pretty you know pretty obvious i hope that we're standing walking sitting lying down that

190
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:53,920
you know that you're doing that but you have to don't underestimate that tremendous value

191
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:59,119
of knowing this really knowing it so not just knowing it casually and

192
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:04,319
passing but to really kind of recognize have a clear recognition

193
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:11,760
i'm standing now i'm sitting now i'm walking it begins to

194
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:18,079
or laying down it begins to um create space in the mind for more present

195
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:25,520
moment awareness it interrupts the mindstream that were sometimes an automatic pilot

196
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:31,760
thinking and wanting where it interrupts the kind of preoccupation time times with emotions

197
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:38,400
uh rumination around him that's emotionally based that uh we get lost in

198
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:45,040
it's kind of like taking a sacred pause oh this is what i'm doing and then maybe

199
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:50,800
take time to feel this i'm standing here i am it's a chance for

200
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:58,640
the body to regroup to be organized to get connected to get grounded here i'm sitting before i start speaking

201
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:05,280
right away let me get grounded in my seat if you're about to speak at a meeting or

202
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:11,760
someplace maybe take a moment to feel yourself here sitting and in preparation so

203
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:18,400
you're not so completely caught in what has to be said so you're more receptive to the environment as

204
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,839
well because the more we are grounded here in the body the more the body awareness is

205
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:29,520
more available for what's going around as well around us

206
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,720
and um but certainly the mindfulness of the posture can be more refined

207
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:40,960
when we're standing are we leaning forward are we pulled back are we collapsed in

208
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:46,240
some way when we're sitting the same thing are we

209
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:51,760
sagging into the back of the couch removing ourselves from the conversation we have with someone

210
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:57,359
else or are we sitting upright so we're available and present so there's more of us

211
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:02,880
able to meet the person we're talking to or be present for the act of speaking or

212
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:08,240
whatever we're doing sometimes if we're to collapse in a chair

213
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:14,960
it might feel relaxing but there is sometimes a loss of attentiveness and presence and

214
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:21,280
involvement with what we're doing so you know and if we can sit in a

215
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:28,880
pos or sit or stand in a posture that is balanced and upright then um

216
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:34,720
there's we're available to more information what's happening to us like there's a greater range we notice

217
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:40,240
if we lean forward we notice if we're pulling back we're noticing for collapsing

218
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:46,800
but if we're always collapsed there may be less less variation that's possible uh it's kind of like if

219
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:53,440
we're in the midpoint it's like like a we feel the pendulum moving this way in that way but if we're stuck

220
00:42:53,440 --> 00:43:01,839
on one end of the pendulum we don't have that refined sensitivity what's going on when we're walking

221
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:09,040
how are we walking what does it say about our mood our emotional state so all these different places what's

222
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:14,319
happening and when we're sitting when we're walking standing all these as well

223
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:21,520
are we doing so in a way that's physically healthy for us is it the one that is most puts the body

224
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:28,480
most at ease the least amount of tension being held to hold the posture

225
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:35,200
so it's a fascinating world the emphasis on posture and so

226
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:40,960
the buddha emphasized it you can keep it at a very low bar just to know your postures to go through

227
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:46,880
the day or you can be more refined about it and notice the details of posture and how

228
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:53,599
maybe you've lost a balanced posture and what does that tell you about yourself and and how is it that coming back into

229
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:59,839
a balanced posture protects you and keeps you more balanced

230
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:04,400
so you can do what you need to do in a better way

231
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,880
the virtue of this for this exercise is how incredibly simple it is

232
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:17,839
when walking know you're walking when standing know you're standing when sitting know you're sitting and

233
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:23,440
when you're lying down know you're lying down but this knowing is really know it

234
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:29,359
and see if when you if what what space is created with clarity arises

235
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:34,560
what um information then becomes available to you that if you don't just know it in

236
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:40,319
passing but you really in a sense stop and really know it over and over

237
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:46,720
again through the day so if you're inclined for this next 24

238
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:52,400
hours why don't you try to make a practice of mindfulness of posture

239
00:44:52,400 --> 00:45:00,400
study of it study yourself through your posture study mindfulness that arises with

240
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:07,040
posture and how different postures support greater presence and greater mindfulness or lesser of it

241
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:13,920
just make a study and and if you have the occasion you might talk to other people about

242
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:19,599
what their experience of posture and mindfulness awareness of posture is in their lives

243
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:27,680
and you might get some fascinating conversations there are certain professions where posture is you know a key to what they how they

244
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:35,520
manage well and um and may the day be a wonderful day

245
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:46,720
of discovery and appreciation of this body of ours so thank you
