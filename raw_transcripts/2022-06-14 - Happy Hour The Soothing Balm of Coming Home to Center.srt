[Music] i like to

7
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:48,640
to offer a practice of returning to our center returning home

8
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,239
returning home returning to our center with metta

9
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,840
so returning home returning to our center

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,159
to [Music] especially this especially important

11
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,360
when we lose our balance whether

12
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,960
challenges of the day challenges of the environment external

13
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,159
internal whether they're challenges or other events when we feel like we've

14
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,960
lost our balance we've lost our equanimity we've lost our meta we've

15
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,159
lost that our center so the way

16
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,439
i'd like to invite us to practice with the practice of meta loving-kindness

17
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:47,040
today for ourselves and for others is a way of studying is a way of studying nourishing

18
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,119
nurturing the heart um and bringing this aspect of equanimity

19
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,159
it's bringing this aspect of equanimity so

20
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:05,840
so that is the invitation and there is not much more i'll say because whatever you need to know will be offered to you

21
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:13,360
in the guided meditation so whether you're new or experienced

22
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,920
as they say relax and enjoy the ride and whatever

23
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:27,680
arises whatever arises is what needs to arise given all the causes and conditions of

24
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:34,640
our heart of our mind of our life and as long as you have kindness

25
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,720
towards whatever arises even if it's a crowd of sorrows that bring up

26
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:48,080
or distraction or sleepiness as long as you bring kindness

27
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:56,640
to what's arising that helps you cultivate meta cultivate stability

28
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,640
whereas if you get whipped out of shade like oh i'm trying

29
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:10,159
to meditate here and i'm distracted ouch that's that's even makes you even more uh unkiltered

30
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:16,000
um so whatever arises as long as you bring kindness to it it will help you

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,159
find your center find stability and peace right here right now so that we

32
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:30,000
can be of service to the world to others to ourselves this person knows me just be of service it's

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,319
much better place to be in place of stability to serve

34
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:42,319
our life others than a place of reactivity so

35
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:52,000
i think that's all i want to say to set the stage for our practice today so so with that i'd like to invite us all

36
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,519
to to shift into our meditation posture

37
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,680
you need to lie down that's okay you need to sit up straighter

38
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:10,799
or stand up or anything that this body needs in this moment in order to be comfortable for the next

39
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,640
30 minutes or so the guided meditation

40
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,479
so landing landing in this body

41
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:28,900
landing in this body in this moment let's find

42
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:35,918
[Music] let's find the center of our gravity

43
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,639
checking in with the body

44
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,360
let the center of the gravity be lower

45
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,639
not in our head in our thoughts but lower lower lower

46
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,720
maybe in our abdomen ah

47
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,960
in our sit bones

48
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:22,479
and from our sit bones from where we are sitting and let there be a sense of verticality

49
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,199
a sense of uprightness

50
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,759
as if there is this centered

51
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,840
the centered pull that

52
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:47,199
goes through [Music] that touches our sit bones our heart

53
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:53,120
our head connected to the earth

54
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,240
all the way energetically maybe it's just this

55
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,520
brightness the sense of ah

56
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,520
settledness

57
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:18,520
and again let the center of gravity be low releasing relaxing the body

58
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,440
maybe for a few minutes we'll just sit

59
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,680
with the breath that's moving up and down through this axis this vertical

60
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,840
axis connecting our heart

61
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,680
to our head to our gut to the earth

62
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,720
finding our balance finding our center

63
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:33,520
let the breath move on its own along this axis

64
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,440
freely if it needs to be if it needs to hang out in the sit bones

65
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:45,280
area let it relax release the sit bones

66
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,800
your seat maybe it needs to hang out by the heart area

67
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:57,479
to release relax the heart the seed of the emotions

68
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:27,919
or if you're feeling sleepy at this point maybe the breath

69
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:35,518
gives a sense of uplift opening the heart the head the mind

70
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:43,120
through whole body sense of vitality uplift

71
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,560
more wakeful energy

72
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,640
and if there's anxiety present or nervousness then

73
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,600
let there be more attention given

74
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:11,199
the lower part of this axis vertical axis your sit bones your feet the earth

75
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:19,120
grounding grounding settling [Music] finding your center your balance your

78
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:11,440
the body the heart the mind is at ease we naturally

79
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:19,160
naturally fall into our center

80
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,320
stop stirring it up

81
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,000
just being breathed

82
00:11:52,800 --> 00:12:00,639
maybe like the buddha sitting under the bodhi tree

83
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:09,959
when mara distractions doubts challenges

84
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:18,320

173
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:53,599

[Music]

182
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:53,520
thank you all thank you so much for your practice

183
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,800
what a gift what a gift that you show up you show up

184
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:06,800
you show up again and again for yourself and for others what a gift

185
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,480
what a gift

186
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,560
the buddha says that the gift of the dharma is the highest gift

187
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:29,040
and some people think of that as just teaching the dharma or dharma gifts or books and

188
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:34,880
but actually this showing up this practice that you show up this is a gift

189
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:40,160
of the dharma this is the gift of your practice is the highest gift it's the

190
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,599
highest gift that you make of yourselves you offer yourself up

191
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:51,440
so beautiful so beautiful such an expression such a beautiful expression

192
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:57,040
of your humanity so so we have

193
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,800
time for reflections if you like to raise your hand to share your reflections as a gift

194
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,160
to the sangha you can also type in chat if you type it to me privately i will

195
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:15,839

198
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:36,400
i just want to say that tonight's practice i was just so present to

199
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:42,240
this balm for the soul that this practice offers and that you

200
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,440
offer and it was particularly

201
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:53,040
um strong for me because i've had dental surgery

202
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:59,760
and i i went off the pain meds this morning but whenever you finally lie down you

203
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:05,040
realize the pain and so i jumped up at the beginning of the

204
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:11,119
meditation and i grabbed a tile and all because i realized oh it's coming back and then

205
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:16,160
as you were speaking i just like held my my jaw

206
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:21,760
and i hadn't i hadn't gotten down to that level of realizing like

207
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:27,520
i've hurt my body you know this really hurt my body and so i sent all this loving

208
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:33,280
kindness there and yeah

209
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:38,800
just was like a balm thank you so much and i've searched in other places you

210
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,839
know i used to go to green gulch and i always felt like

211
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:50,800
i wanted to find a loving prep a loving buddhist practice and i

212
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:57,359
hadn't experienced this until i started coming to the insight meditation center which

213
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:02,960

216
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:22,800
and when we sit we realize oh this sweet poor body you're traumatized it's just it's not just the jaw or the teeth it

217
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:29,119

jesse please thanks yeah this was a really amazing

220
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:47,599
practice i love the imagery of coming home and uh

221
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:53,040
your you mentioned self-forgiveness and coming back to center

222
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,480
so timely for me um my mom mentioned to me about eight days ago

223
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:03,599
she's bringing up some end-of-life paperwork my mom's 76 years old and in

224
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:11,440
good health i'm really grateful that she's being proactive about it but i just felt um clenching and tightness

225
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:17,200
in my chest and just feelings of overwhelm and grief and uh just this whole idea of coming

226
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:23,440
back to center coming home and self-forgiveness for any duka or suffering

227
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,880
that arises and you know this is why i've been practicing all these ideas about impermanence and recollection of

228
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:36,079
death you know are coming to bear now and i i just also want to share another gift

229
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:41,280
i have right as you said something like you know can you accept yourself as you are

230
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,319
some type of ambulance emergency siren went by which is unusual

231
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:53,280
for my suburban neighborhood and these dogs started howling and it's just there's just this

232
00:40:53,280 --> 00:41:00,560
evocation of impermanence you know it's like yeah this grief and this overwhelm this arises and it passes away just as

233
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:06,640
because you also mentioned sounds you know random sounds at the same time so wonderful practice and thank you for

238
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:39,440
um i was like like um initially um i've been learning how to rest i i've never

239
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:45,200
known how to rest and so tonight when you were talking about resting um

240
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:50,240
and i've been learning how to do that it was like oh my word this is like so perfect for me right now

241
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:56,000
and what i really appreciate it was when you mentioned that about even inviting judgment to rest like all of the the

242
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,880
things that could come up you know to allow it come here let's rest let's just be right here and the kindness of about

243
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:09,760
how we approach it how we we can approach it with kindness and it reminded me something about um tiknon

244
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:15,520
han something i heard this weekend was you don't have to know what it is is treat it with kindness whatever it is

245
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:22,079
that comes up treat it with kindness so i really felt like it um it tied in a lot for me

246
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:27,200
that um i was able to even turn it on myself and my heart just welled up i cried it was

258
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:51,599
so dear ones uh bill has asked uh was this coming home exercise the

259
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,240
same as concentration

260
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:03,440
not necessarily not the same they're not equivalent

261
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:11,680
there is an aspect of coming home keep coming back keep coming back that could be a part of a practice of shamatha

262
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:17,119
samadhi concentration but the way i was leading it today was

263
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:23,280
was more coming home to sense of rest heart ease i was

264
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:29,040
emphasizing that that aspect of it so um so there was a little bit of i think

265
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:35,200
with with practice concentrate there is a sense of coming back resting so there's a little bit of that but they're

266
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:41,680
not the same there was a venn diagram there's some overlap with the practice tonight but

267
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:48,839
but uh not not the same yeah yeah so

268
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:55,280
yeah um so dear ones dear sangha

269
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:02,640
dear happy our family whether you just join for the first time you're part of this family you're here

270
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:09,920
so the invitation we have at this point is is to connect with a couple of other

271
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:15,520
members of this sangha with kindness it's where the rubber meets the road

272
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:21,040
um so just offering kindness to yourself offering kindness to others

273
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:26,560
and um and the soothing balm can we all rest in

274
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:33,599
a soothing ball can we all rest in a soothing balm together and the invitation is in the small

275
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:39,359
groups to offer maybe one thing about yourself how the practice was speaking

276
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:44,480
from the first person experience one nugget then the next person will say

277
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:50,880
one nugget and then the next person will say one nugget and they'll come back to you so not a long monologue but just one

278
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:56,720
nugget knowing they will come back to you and just from your own experience not

279
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:03,359
asking questions or directing or facilitating just offering europe offering your own humanity as a gift to

280
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:10,079
the sangha here i am and also if it comes to your turn you can say pass and just hold silence

281
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:16,480
that's perfectly fine too if you want to offer witnessing and kindness

282
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:23,760

dave hi nicki thanks i was trying to remember

292
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:30,240
there's a phrase you used for the pilot you know

293
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:35,359
so when you make a mistake like i just did in clicking the leave breakout room

294
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:42,160
button when i didn't mean to you you then you start piling on yourself

295
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:49,680
and injuring yourself there's a phrase you've used it's much more succinct of uh how you hurt yourself after

296
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:57,359
hurting yourself ah um self-flagellation i don't know or or a

297
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:03,760
selfie second error yeah that's it thank you oh yeah yeah yeah second error it's not my phrase

298
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:11,200
it's the buddha's teaching so he gets all the credit i'm just repeating it back but actually there's a whole sutta

299
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:16,880
about the second era it's a beautiful teaching it's a beautiful teaching about

300
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:23,119
how we engage and it has to do with the teaching of vedana actually that beautiful set of vedana being the

301
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:29,040
feeling to unpleasant unpleasant neutral when there's something unpleasant we just pile on and we we add the second

302
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:34,880
and third and fourth arrows so yes it's the second era and yes rada
