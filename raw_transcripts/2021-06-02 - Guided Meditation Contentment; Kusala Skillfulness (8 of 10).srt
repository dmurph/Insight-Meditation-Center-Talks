1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,839
so then express my delighted greetings

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:13,759
to be here with all of you and share this time together

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,720
um so

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,480
there's many many approaches to meditation and many many approaches to

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:33,280
being deeply connected to this present moment

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:40,000
and one of the most you know common things that maybe i teach here is you know if the mind wanders off come

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,800
back to the breathing stay with the breathing something like that and

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:56,559
and so then um another another approach which is

9
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:03,680
can be both them can be both a means to being peaceful settled in the present

10
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,520
moment and also uh the result of being here

11
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:16,159
present and in the moment is a contentment and you might

12
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,520
practice contentment as we do the meditation practice just kind of

13
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,799
call on contentment with whatever is happening just or maybe that's too much to say

14
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,840
just being content um at this moment to con

15
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,840
find a contentment uh and that's the direction the meditation is going

16
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:45,840
it's going to a very profound form of contentment a subtleness

17
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,000
a being at rest with what's here and

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,840
not needing it to be any different

19
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,000
so if you have some reference point for

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,280
contentment whenever you need to return to the present moment whenever you need to

21
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,440
adjust how you are to be here in the meditation see if it can you could bring it with a

22
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,680
sense of contentment and see if that can help you be more settled and

23
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:31,920
more present so taking an alert upright posture

24
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,400
and gently closing your eyes

25
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:54,319
and is there a way directly that you can allow yourself to be content here

26
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:04,400
not necessarily looking for something or retaining anything but in some way feeling a contentment to

27
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:12,000
be sitting in meditation to be present here and now

28
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:20,879
even if things are difficult and to rest into some form of

29
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,680
contentment

30
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:35,360
and if that's available to you as if you can breathe with and through

31
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,360
the contentment out of contentment take a few long

32
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,760
slow deep breaths

33
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:56,560
deep breaths that expand the torso the chest the ribcage and a long exhale

34
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:05,360
where things just settle and relax maybe settling into being content here

35
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,920
not concerned about the other times in other places

36
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:29,840
just what's happening here and now

37
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:43,840
deep breath in and out relaxing into your body

38
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:11,840
and letting your your breathing return to normal

39
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:25,840
and as you exhale relax parts of your body

40
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,759
softening in the face

41
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,840
softening the shoulders

42
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:07,840
and relaxing the belly

43
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:52,240
and then once again is there a way you can settle into

44
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:59,440
a deeper contentment content to be here in this body of yours

45
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:07,599
even if there's pain aches if that's what you have to

46
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:17,280
include as part of the meditation even with that to settle in in a content

47
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:26,319
place to be just here breathing content to be alive with a breathing body

48
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:34,240
an aware mind aware of your breathing

49
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,680
aware of the body's experience of

50
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,840
breathing

51
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,400
maybe even content to be

52
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,840
present for each inhale and each exhale

53
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:26,479
and if the mind wanders off in thought

54
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,360
perhaps renewing your contentment

55
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:40,320
content to be with your direct experience

56
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:55,839
one breath at a time

57
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,920
you

58
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:12,798
and then a reminder to find a contentment

59
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:19,199
resting in a contentment that supports you

60
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:26,240
in being with your breathing and being really here

61
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:33,679
at ease and settled in your body and mind

62
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:47,840
hear content

63
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,919
you

64
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,919
you

65
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,960
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

66
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:45,279
perhaps we can think of contentment that contentment is not a complacency

67
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:51,440
or some naive acceptance of things that shouldn't be accepted

68
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:59,600
but rather contentment is being settled in oneself

69
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:06,400
at ease in oneself so that whatever we do

70
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:15,039
is not agitated whatever we do is not anxious

71
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:21,200
or greedy or doesn't come from a place of discontent

72
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:27,919
and unhappiness within ourselves

73
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:39,840
perhaps a deep contentment allows us to be better friends

74
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,640
to offer more care and love

75
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,840
to be generous to those around us

76
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,080
because we're not impatient we're not needing things to be different we're not

77
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:05,600
trying to get away or get someplace or do something different

78
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,640
we can be present here

79
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:21,279
so that the goodness the beauty the support

80
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:26,000
of others can be part of our orientation

81
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:32,640
and what a wonderful thing that our contact to others

82
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:38,159
comes from a deep contentment in our hearts

83
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,559
content with with being alive and being

84
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:53,760
present and perhaps when we're content in

85
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:59,360
ourselves we have more room and space

86
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,840
for well-wishing caring for others

87
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:09,679
that the end of meditation can be expressed with these words

88
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:16,799
may it be that all beings be happy

89
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:23,520
may it be that all beings feel safe

90
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,720
may it be that all beings

91
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:40,960
may be peaceful may it be that all beings may be free

92
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:49,919
and may we contribute to their happiness their safety

93
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:58,880
their peace and their freedom may we contribute to it

94
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:05,919
out of a deep sense of contentment and ease

95
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:13,840
may all beings be happy

96
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:19,018
[Music]

97
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:25,540
[Music]

98
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,919
you

99
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,840
okay

100
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,960
um so

101
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:04,159
to continue our discussion of kusala this week um

102
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,919
this week mostly um

103
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:15,440
um talking about it as a skill

104
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:21,840
and and doing what's skillful and that

105
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:30,320
the buddha uses lots of analogies of crafts people and farmers and animal trainers

106
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:36,720
to uh make similes for metaphors for comparisons to the developing of

107
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:44,240
meditation skills or skills along the path of liberation and so because all these similes have to

108
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:51,679
do with craftspeople and farmers and musicians and

109
00:31:52,880 --> 00:32:00,399
animal trainers elephant trainers like ancient india and the idea of skill

110
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:07,919
seems like a better translation sometimes than wholesome but these two are closely connected

111
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:15,039
and one of the skillful practices or skillful states is mindfulness

112
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:20,880
practice and that mindfulness practice is

113
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:26,799
the simile for it where it is becoming a skilled cook and so i guess you know bringing

114
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:32,960
together all the ingredients bringing ourselves completely here maybe we're the pot or something and we're

115
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:39,600
bringing all these good qualities together so we're really here maybe cooking something really

116
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,000
wonderful

117
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:52,880
and so this idea that mindfulness is a wholesome skillful practice it's a craft we're developing

118
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:59,519
suggests as i said yesterday something developed slowly over time and uh if doing that

119
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:07,200
the buddha had this wonderful quote i was teaching when based on

120
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:14,399
ethical conduct established on ethical conduct

121
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:21,760
you develop the four foundations of mindfulness then

122
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:29,919
whether night or day you may expect only growth in skillful states

123
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:36,240
not decline so here we have this mindfulness self is

124
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,360
considered to be a skillful skill to develop and as we develop this

125
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:47,679
skill of mindfulness it brings with it all

126
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:53,679
it brings with it the development and growth of skillful states and we find another theme from this week

127
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:59,360
is how much the buddha is emphasizing personal growth development in certain qualities that were

128
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,880
helpful and good for us to have

129
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:13,200
now there's lots of lists in the early tradition of these skillful states uh qualities of being

130
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,638
and um and in fact there's many more lists and

131
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:24,000
enumerations of skillful states than there are for unskillful states

132
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:31,760
it's almost as if um there's only a few relatively few unskillful

133
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:37,520
unwholesome movements of mind that we can have and and many many different options for

134
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:43,520
skillful ones and uh and you know unfortunately we spend a lot of time with the ones that

135
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:49,040
are the few a few of and don't explore the range of all the good qualities that we

136
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:55,679
can develop and cultivate and but i'm delight in the fact that

137
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:01,040
this early tradition will list many more positive states and

138
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:07,680
qualities that human beings have than the list of the negative ones and uh in one of

139
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:14,240
these lists in the later tradition in the abidama the kind of buddhist psychology

140
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:21,680
the the unwholesome unskillful ones are called that they're called akusula unskillful but the skillful ones or the

141
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:28,800
wholesome ones are called beautiful and there are more beautiful states of mind or mental factors or

142
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:34,000
mental movements of the mind that are possible for us

143
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,000
then there are unskillful ones so we have this great capacity and maybe to some degree it's

144
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,200
underutilized and part of what we're doing is cultivating this underutilized part from

145
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:50,640
of our mind there's a wonderful list of skillful

146
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,760
states that the buddha taught to his

147
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:02,800
foster mother and she's the one who raised the buddha and she became came to him as and became

148
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:09,680
a student became a nun and and she asked him once to teach the dharma teach to offer his

149
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:15,680
teachings in brief so what are so this always when it's always in the suttas when he's

150
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:22,320
going to say it in brief it's very interesting to see and very interesting to see gather together

151
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:28,079
all the brief statements of what how the buddha kind of encapsulates the dharma

152
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:34,240
and see there's a particular kind of orientation that gets repeated over and over again and

153
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:43,359
that is practice and the immediacy of our experience now that's where it's all the emphasis is

154
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,520
so so she asks him to teach him teach her the dharma in

155
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:56,960
brief so she could go off and practice alone so she wants practice instructions

156
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:04,160
so this is what he told her as for those mental qualities

157
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:10,000
of which you may know these qualities these states lead to

158
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:18,240
dispassion not to passion to being unfettered not to being fettered to shedding

159
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:26,800
not to accumulating to fewness of wishes not too many wishes

160
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:36,079
to contentment not to discontent to solitude not to crowded company

161
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:43,680
to arousing effort not to laziness to being unburdensome not to being

162
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:48,800
burdensome you may definitely definitively hold

163
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,839
this is the dharma this is the teacher's instructions

164
00:37:53,839 --> 00:38:00,640
and now what's interesting about this kind of list is that they're both states or mental activities

165
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:06,079
ways of being that we can practice we can cultivate

166
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:12,079
and they're the result of that cultivation they're the result of practice as well

167
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:18,880
dharma practice leads to these states and so rather than just practicing you know breathing ethics all the different

168
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:25,920
things of practice to reach those states the idea is to practice those states as well

169
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:32,880
and we find this uh this way in which the goal of practice is integrated into

170
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:38,160
the means of the practice the means and the goal are not so separate

171
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:44,480
in the dharma and if the goal is to be peaceful then we practice peace if the goal is to

172
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,599
be compassionate we practice compassion if the goal is to

173
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:56,480
be content we practice contentment if the goal is to not be caught in the grip of many

174
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:03,440
desires then we practice having few desires fewness of wishes

175
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:09,119
and some of these ideas are

176
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:15,520
you know interpersonal like being some don't be a burden for other people

177
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:21,920
if you and that you know we need some some care and how we understand that certainly we don't want people to feel

178
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:29,119
like won't get can't get support who need the support but but to expect too much from people

179
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:35,119
or depend on people when we don't need to is to be a burden and um and this idea

180
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:40,160
of solitude not in crowded company

181
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:48,160
the ability to be alone and be content is uh one of the great things to

182
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:53,920
discover it's really skillful to develop that skill that capacity that wholesomeness

183
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,960
to be at ease with oneself to be be comfortable with oneself

184
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,000
to be able to be uh in a room by oneself and just kind of sit there and be content

185
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:10,319
and and keep one's uh own company be one's own friend

186
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:16,079
it doesn't mean we have to live as a hermit but that ability means that when when we

187
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:21,599
are with people that we don't bring our neediness we don't bring our

188
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,960
grasping and wanting them to provide us with all kinds of benefits

189
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:32,800
and company and support and praise and love or whatever everything because we have a lack

190
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:39,200
ourselves so we want to cultivate a capacity

191
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:45,839
to have comfortable solitude so it's fascinating that

192
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:51,839
to his foster mother these are the skillful states the buddha highlighted as being

193
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:56,880
essential for going off and practicing alone

194
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:03,440
so and i think part of it is that these

195
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:10,640
states as we cultivate them they lead to more and more of the same

196
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:17,520
and or they're the guide these states are the guide this is the direction we're going and if

197
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:23,119
we understand where we're going then we kind of start doing those things

198
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:29,280
those states and practices that lead to that direction so for practicing meditation mindfulness

199
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:35,920
or breathing to have in mind that it's leading us to being content so let's start kind of finding it and

200
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:43,200
seeing it now it's leading us to have fewness of wishes is it as we sit and practice can we tap into

201
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:48,480
this and have that support the very meditation practice itself

202
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:56,000
leading us to capacity to feel at home when we're alone can we can we cultivate meditation with

203
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,079
that in mind to feel the deep deep sense of subtleness with ourselves

204
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:09,680
and and so forth on we go um many of the so-called these

205
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:16,400
these sometimes are called virtues that were being cultivating develop developing um many of them

206
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,839
uh the overarching kind of character of those long many of the lists that buddha

207
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:30,400
emphasized to develop and practice are peaceful states peaceful qualities and um in the

208
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:36,319

209
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:44,640

210
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:50,400
