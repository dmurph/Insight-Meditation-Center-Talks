1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,740
great let's do this uh nice to be with you

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:13,080
since we we are quite literally all around the world good

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,420
morning good evening and good night let's um

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:25,859
let's pick up where we left off with the study of the apartments the Perfections uh my name's kodo

5
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:33,239
very very happy to be here with you we'll be doing a very simple meditation

6
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:39,000
this morning um say more about this in a bit but the two

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,719
parties the two Perfections that we will focus on today are energy Viria

8
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:53,100
and Conti patience energy and patience and we'll look at how they work together

9
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:59,280
what I'd like to do during the meditation is something very very simple

10
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:06,540
uh which is which is a after we after we settle

11
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:12,000
to pay attention to how the in-breath brings just a little bit

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,580
of energy into the system and how the exhale brings just a little

13
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:24,080
bit of relaxation into the system

14
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:32,400
so we'll look at these two look at these two qualities energy and patience

15
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,220
and um see during the meditation how we can sense into them

16
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:46,280
how we can get a feel for them how they're accessible right here a little bit of energy with the inhale a little bit of relaxation

17
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:53,840
with the exhale so let's find our way to our

18
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,060
preferred meditation posture

19
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,260
let's take our time let's take our time arriving

20
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,500
not hurrying to be here

21
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,739
mentally setting aside whatever

22
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:55,640
can be set aside

23
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:05,060
any unnecessary thoughts or preoccupations you can come back to them

24
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,819
after

25
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,000
just here

26
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:44,840
we find our way here through sensing

27
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:07,640
feeling maybe the seat

28
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,200
maybe the flow of breath that now

29
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,120
it's because of temperature on the skin

30
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:43,080
and feeling our stealing our way into alignment

31
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:57,680
long spine relaxed ribs and torso

32
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,940
yes it's helpful

33
00:05:55,139 --> 00:06:03,979
as we did yesterday we could do a quick scan through each of the scent stores

34
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:11,660
it's relaxing each in turn and letting that relief register

35
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:18,560
your eyes years

36
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:26,660
nose tongue in the mouth

37
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:36,259
body and the thinking muscle

38
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:13,620
in each adjustment all the more here

39
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,060
any attention right here

40
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,960
and then our simple practice for this morning foreign

41
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,959
to observe how the breath turns the energy

42
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:51,320
on the inhale and how does that register for you

43
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,880
a little bit of energy coming into the body

44
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:04,760
oxygen into the blood give you a little bit of this

45
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:12,439
maybe a brightening in the Moon could be anything

46
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,260
foreign

47
00:10:54,620 --> 00:11:03,079
now to get familiar with of the exhale turns the energy

48
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,160
in the body even in the mind

49
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,380
maybe it's subtle Sensations that you notice

50
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:27,680
a little bit of relaxation or Slack

51
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,420
a little slowing down

52
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,680
rounding

53
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,379
foreign

54
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:36,740
for the rest of our sitting freely exploring these two

55
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,000
energy coming in with the inhale

56
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:49,940
relaxation settledness with the XM

57
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,660
however seems fit I'm going to be launching them

58
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:04,920
way back and forth or favoring one or the other

59
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,600
as is appropriate for you now

60
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,120
thank you

61
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:12,919
you know something in your mind is a little dumb

62
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:22,980
perhaps living in charge of emphasis to the

63
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:30,380
in-breath the energizing breath

64
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,220
and if the mind is a little Restless

65
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:49,340
after noticing the nature of restlessness

66
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,179
living in terms of emphasis to the exam

67
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,260
the grounding breath

68
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,158
all in the service of Being Human

69
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,519
who seem clearly

70
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:16,460
and for this last minute of our sitting

71
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:24,559
the invitation is to relax any effort

72
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,580
and fully rest

73
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:45,740
letting any of the benefits or goodness of our practice

74
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:51,140
register and nourish

75
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,778
foreign

76
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:58,980
[Music]

77
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,260
foreign

78
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,360
again

79
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:10,620
after our meditation together now turning to the Perfections of energy and

80
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,340
patience

81
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:21,000
so so far we've been practicing these armies the Perfection step by step

82
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,640
uh first first we we had a discussion about Donna giving

83
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:33,260
and uh one who practices Donna learns a a

84
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:39,840
one kind of letting go that initiates this path of the Perfections

85
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:45,659
and then once Sila The Virtue their ethical conduct matures and we grow in

86
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:51,240
this sort of ethical sensitivity sensitive to the ouch and the ah of our

87
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:56,640
actions and then we practice wise renunciation

88
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:03,240
seeing more and more clearly those States and actions and cravings and

89
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:09,539
clingings that no longer serve us and then desire

90
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:15,299
compulsive desire let's go and then one grows wise about

91
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:20,400
distinctions and perspectives that support liberation

92
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:28,080
and in doing so we learn where to direct the effort of our practice our energy

93
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:34,559
and this brings us to urea so these last two days we focused a lot

94
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:41,700
on some of the basic principles of part of me practice and we've reflected on this approach of reflecting on the

95
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:47,340
benefits of of quality of a part of me and reflecting on the drawbacks of the

96
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:53,580
opposites I think this has a basis in the dhamapada one of these well-known

97
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:59,460
teachings doing no evil engaging in what's skillful

98
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:05,960
and purifying one's mind this is the teaching of the Buddhas

99
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:12,919
so today I plan to highlight a little bit um something a little bit different

100
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:19,080
which is how power and these work together and I want to share this from the

101
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:24,740
perspective both of our meditation practice and daily life

102
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:33,539
appropriately the very next line in the dhamapata after this is the teaching of the Buddhas is patient endurance is the

103
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:40,399
Supreme austerity so immediately patience and energy are named

104
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:47,460
so I mostly want to talk about how Viria energy and patients work together and then why is that

105
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:53,460
what I've what I've noticed over over the years of this kind of wild monastic

106
00:29:53,460 --> 00:30:00,659
semi-monastic and lay Dharma life is that for a practice to be nourished

107
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:05,940
and balanced long term this relationship of energy in patients points to some of

108
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:13,500
the central concerns in his essay the joy of effort

109
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:19,500
um Begins the discussion of energy this way he says

110
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:27,360
when explaining meditation the Buddha often driven allergies with the skills of artists Carpenters musicians archers

111
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:32,880
and Cooks finding the right level of efforts he

112
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:38,159
said is like a musician tuning a loot

113
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:43,620
reading the mind's needs in the moment to be gladdened to be studied or inspired

114
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:49,520
is like a palace Cook's ability to read and please the taste of a prince

115
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:57,600
so we may think of energy as something we have something we hold

116
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,880
on to and something we give over like it's a discrete quantity

117
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:10,260
or that it's something we have to muster when there is none when we're depleted

118
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:17,820
but what is it what does it do to reframe the idea of energy as something we tune and we attune both

119
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:23,779
to the appropriate level and to the knees of the moment

120
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:30,659
so in masutas and the anguta and ikaya there's this there's this very well-known uh well-known story that's an

121
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:36,000
Israel gecko is referring to here called Sona the Sona

122
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,480
Sona is an Ardent energetic practitioner who is uh pouring himself into his

123
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:50,159
sitting and walking practice as a monastic and he is discouraged

124
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:55,559
he's been practicing diligently but he's not free he's not free and he is

125
00:31:55,559 --> 00:32:02,760
considering giving up giving up the training so the Buddha goes to question him

126
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,179
oh

127
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:14,399
so the Buddha goes to question him and he says Sona when you were a householder were

128
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:20,580
you skilled in playing the loot yes yes spontaneous I was

129
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:26,279
if you tuned the strings too tightly did the loot tune and play

130
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:33,000
didn't and how about if you turn the strings too Loosely with the loot tune in play

131
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,220
oh no no no it wouldn't and then the Buddha asks him so when you

132
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:43,320
tune the strings neither too tightly nor too Loosely then the loot did the loot

133
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:49,559
tune and play and the Buddha concludes in the same way Sona

134
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:55,919
over aroused persistence leads to restlessness overly slack persistent leads to

135
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:03,659
laziness thus you should determine the right pitch for your persistence

136
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:09,620
and attune the pitch of the other faculties to pick up your theme

137
00:33:09,899 --> 00:33:15,019
something I'd like to highlight this morning is what's the opposite of energy

138
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:22,460
what's the opposite of energy and I'd like to say it's not rest

139
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:28,940
I believe that sometimes the most appropriate Attunement of energy is to rest

140
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:36,620
um maybe to overstate this I could say that the Pyrenees of energy and and patience

141
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:42,419
could be considered the power of these of our times and we can think about this in terms of

142
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:48,240
the maybe incessant demands on on our

143
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:54,659
energy maybe this comes in the form of compulsive activity or overwork

144
00:33:54,659 --> 00:34:00,000
rest is necessary for the path to develop long term

145
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,960
I think here the the cycles of um a fruit tree over the seasons

146
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:13,638
when a season turns cooler and the days get shorter and the tree

147
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:20,820
draws its energy back into the trunk and into the roots in a sense to hibernate

148
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:26,820
before the sap and all of the all the biological processes sort of initiating

149
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:33,320
the energy back outward and then leasing flowering

150
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:40,080
one one Dharma teacher described the intention of a sabbatical as to live fallow

151
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:46,580
they want to add to restore and rejuvenate and replenish so rest is really necessary in

152
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:53,099
supporting our Dharma practice long term this is the part of me of patience in

153
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:58,859
the form of time and non-exertion

154
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:04,560
so this is another way that energy and patients seem to work together and we played with this some during our

155
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:12,540
during our meditation with the inhale the energy coming up the exhale the energy uh settling back down and this is

156
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:18,060
another natural cycle of the parmes energy and patients

157
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:23,760
in meditative terms as the Buddha put it the over application of energy can a

158
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:30,599
client us to restlessness and agitation and then attuned energy

159
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:36,480
and be can be a a condition for the arising of Joy

160
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,640
and Rapture and leaning onward to happiness and concentration

161
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:48,300
and Beyond so sort of skillful tuning of the the energy that I'm emphasizing a lot this

162
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:55,560
morning something that Suzuki Brushy called adjusting the flame adjusting the flame of our energy

163
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:03,180
that's uh adjusting the level of effort just to suit the moment just to suit this mind in this activity

164
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:09,619
the question I hear a lot how much effort should I apply it's almost never a question of

165
00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:16,099
uh one prescription it's a matter of discernment what's appropriate

166
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:22,440
when discussing Viria dhamapala um tends toward the heroic

167
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:28,079
you can imagine him talking about uninterrupted effort for four eons with

168
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:34,740
the compassion for all beings and this can be kind of this can be inspiring if we're um receptive to it or

169
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:41,460
in the right frame of mind or something but it can also be discouraging like venerable Sona that may come across as

170
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:49,200
impossible or not realistic one of these ways that um energy or

171
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:56,280
aspiration can can lose its balance is if our aspirations become demands on the

172
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:01,560
universe uh practicing the parmesan order however

173
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:07,020
sort of hedges hedges this problem where our Donna are giving our ethics

174
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:13,700
our pronunciation and our wisdom support us in knowing how to attune our effort

175
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:19,380
this practice is a marathon not a Sprint

176
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:26,460
so we tune our inspiration so in everyday practice

177
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:33,300
I think it's all the uh I think it's very important to have Energy's partner

178
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:39,900
patience one of the most interesting teachings from dhamapala on this is that the

179
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:45,839
proximate cause of patients isn't what I expected I imagined it to be like on

180
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:52,980
Force endurance it was seeing things as they are

181
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:58,079
the proximate cause of patients is seeing things as they are

182
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:04,920
and in many of the Buddhist teachings seeing things as they are is it's an insight that comes through sustained practice

183
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:10,200
sustained observation we see something in a new way three of

184
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:17,040
our misperceptions wisdom is a cause for patients rather than Force

185
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:24,420
so among other modes of wisdom one of them is noticing that we are not in control of reality

186
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:29,460
doesn't that doesn't that influence our sense of patience or impatience

187
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:34,680
but we're not in control of this reality this body ages

188
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:39,839
Pleasant sound Fades a desire of mind doesn't Manifest this person next to me

189
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:45,780
in traffic you can fill in the blank we're not in control of reality

190
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:53,040
instead our role as practitioners you hear this again and again is to contribute conditions

191
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:59,420
we contribute conditions to a complex system of reality and experience

192
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:07,079
um in one of the most um maybe maybe the most clear examples that

193
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:12,599
comes to mind for me now is the Buddha taught how the when and the where of karmic

194
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:18,839
fruition how our actions have effects in the future the win and the wear of how that will happen it's nearly unknowable

195
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:24,119
by anyone but the Buddha but he strongly emphasized that we be

196
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:31,560
circumspect in our action so we can't we can't know how the effect will necessarily Ripple out for the future

197
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:38,400
but take great care with your action nonetheless so our role is short of omniscience and

198
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:46,560
total control but we contribute we contribute conditions of our intentions our actions our skillful means our

199
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:54,859
compassion and that sort of perspective uh supports the Perfection of patients

200
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:01,800
namapala also characterized patients in a way that was much more powerful than I was used to thinking so he

201
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:07,440
describes it as a strength a supreme source of constancy

202
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:13,578
a sure bounding the great ocean of hatred

203
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:19,740
um an unimpeded instrument in the development of noble qualities

204
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:26,160
and also we we know how patience affects the way people see us we respond to them

205
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:32,160
with patients that that affects the interaction in this way damapala calls

206
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:37,260
patience an adornment the basis of a good reputation

207
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:41,359
and has the function of quelling hatred

208
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:52,140
one part that he teaches that I think is well worth our consideration is that patience has the function

209
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:58,800
it has a realm it's an appropriate response to other people's anger

210
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:04,380
so um based on Doma Paula's emphasis in this and our current social scene I

211
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:11,359
think this is another way that patience and energy could be considered the power needs of our times

212
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:18,119
his counsel is to have a number of wise Reflections available to you to use on the spot when

213
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:25,320
facing others anger and they tend to fall into the categories of making uh making it impersonal

214
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:34,500
Maybe by reflecting on the fact that the sense faculties will necessarily experience Pleasant and unpleasant so uh

215
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:41,640
we can expect to encounter unpleasant and one of my favorites reframing our

216
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:47,160
perspective of the other person then I think of the the I think of the wisdom of parents in this

217
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:54,200
regard because the reflection is to see all beings as my own children

218
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:59,700
and I think of all of the all of the wise restraints and patients that are

219
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:03,440
that a parent sometimes cultivates

220
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:15,500
so in practicing patients with their energy we reclaim some of the power that's lost to impatience

221
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:20,760
we have agency because of a patient perspective and can then employ a

222
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:26,520
skillful attuned response in the moment patience allows us the wise direction of

223
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:33,240
our effort so I think for for today as we're coming

224
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:39,780
to the end of our time you can take and take into your practice for Wednesday

225
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:45,839
uh where is energy showing up where's effort and persistence showing up and

226
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:52,560
where's its opposite showing up maybe sloth torp slackness and then where's patience showing up

227
00:42:52,560 --> 00:43:00,660
where's endurance forbearance uh steadiness that adornment of patience and where's its opposites showing them

228
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:05,700
and then particularly for today how do these two support each other

229
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:10,940
how do energy and patients support each other in your own life

230
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:17,579
thank you for sharing some time in the practice this morning may all beings benefit

231
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:24,440
and we'll pick up the thread tomorrow with the next two Perfections thank you
