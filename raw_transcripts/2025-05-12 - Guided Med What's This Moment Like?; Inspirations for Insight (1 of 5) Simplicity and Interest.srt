1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:09,040
the invitation when you're ready is to settle in

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:16,720
Settle into a posture that allows you to be present with whatever the internal and external

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,439
weather is

4
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:38,760
today Maybe taking a couple of longer slower deeper breaths

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,440
and noticing whatever um emotional tone or mood you're bringing in with

6
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,640
you For me there's a little bit of a flurry from having done a bunch of tech

7
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,680
stuff and watching the mind

8
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:19,600
settle watching the sediment of thought settle into the

9
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,640
body And a tuning attuning to your

10
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:34,880
breath your body Perhaps the sound in the

11
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:40,920
room the sound of my voice

12
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,200
allowing the body to

13
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:08,078
relax and the attention to go

14
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,080
inwards and down

15
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:58,319
Notice Okay If there are thoughts emotions

16
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:07,360
sensations and allowing them to be there with

17
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:16,280
simplicity keeping mindful awareness in the forefront

18
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,360
tuning

19
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:48,360
resting and the flow inward and outward to the breath

20
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:51,960
Noticing appreciating the return or continuation of mindful awareness

21
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:11,520
Acknowledging simply whatever

22
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:21,240
arises noticing it persists changes for a

23
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:28,639
while Perhaps into something

24
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:37,639
else or into moments of soothing silence

25
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:27,560
from time to time

26
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:33,920
Noticing what is in awareness and noticing

27
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:42,639
[Music] how you are with awareness What's this moment

28
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:58,360
like just allowing the system to respond with interest

29
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:00,079
As the attention gathers itself collects itself

30
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:12,880
here relaxing ing into the rhythm of

31
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:22,279

Riding the

33
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:41,519
moment with

34
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,120
simplicity

35
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:04,240
ease Noticing and softening into what's obvious

36
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,039
Noticing and tuning into any

37
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:33,299
softening presence [Music]

38
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,960
relaxation in the body

39
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:49,919
Noticing and tuning into any ease or

40
00:20:50,679 --> 00:21:00,200
contentment Simple awareness in the heart and mind

41
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,559
and appreciating

42
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,880
that Savoring

43
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:38,440
it And from that place turning your gaze outwards

44
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,640
to the others your life touches directly and

45
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:01,440
indirectly with an internal gesture of generosity care

46
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:08,399
kindness offering the wish that they may be safe

47
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,080

and offering the determination the

51
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:49,080
wish that our practice here together may be part of the

52
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:55,760
growth of peace love and liberation in the

53
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,200
world May all beings be free

54
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,420
[Music]

55
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:45,000
Thank you for the sincerity of your practice

56
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,280
So good morning friends Good

57
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:20,200
morning Really appreciate being able to practice together It's a rainy cool morning here in Santa

58
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:27,120
Cruz and um we appreciate the value and value

59
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,720
this sa So um like to introduce the theme for

60
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:41,760
this week which is inspirations for insight So a kind of a series of stories

61
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,960
and anecdotes um some myths from the Buddhist time

62
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:53,200
anecdotes from my own life that are a bit in honor of Vesak a

63
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,880
Buddhist holiday that happened on Sunday the early tradition celebration of the

64
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:06,919
Buddhist birth death and enlightenment Just a moment

65
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:35,600
So these um these stories once I'm able to talk over the um garbage collection

66
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:41,760
these stories are um also that they've been told for

67
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:47,200
centuries millennia to um evoke beneficial qualities of

68
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:55,919
heart and mind to inspire the heart and mind and mindsets attitudes conducive to

69
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:02,440
insight liberation to strengthening practice And one such mindset is

70
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:09,919
interest So as these stories unfold over the week I want to invite you to get

71
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:15,799
interested and allow your own meanings to emerge from them as

72
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:22,080
well So when I talk about insight it can be insight with a little eye which is um

73
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:29,919
an insight to your own conditioning insight into the universal truths that the Buddha taught about

74
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:36,000
human subjective experience just overall

75
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:41,960
And then there is the capital I

76
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:49,320
insight which is a deeper knowing into the commonality of human subjective

77
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:56,559
experience The truth that the Buddha taught as being relating to all

78
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:03,279
people all human experience everywhere And both kinds of insight help to free

79
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:09,679
the mind and heart in different ways They both can be very powerful So that's what where we're

80
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:15,960
going this week And um the first story is one that many of you are familiar

81
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:22,360
with So it is kind of the in a sense the origin story of the Buddha's

82
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:28,960
teachings And I'll give a brief version here The Buddha was raised as a prince

83
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,200
Um his father had determined that he should succeed him in leading their

84
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:41,919
kingdom and um he was offered a life of luxury of opulence of every possible

85
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:49,360
sensual desire and was protected from the suffering of life and groomed to take

86
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:55,679
power And part of this may be because um the Buddha when he was born two very

87
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:03,440
consequential things happened his mother died in childbirth So he was raised by a very loving stepmother And the other

88
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:10,000
thing was that there was a seer who had said he would either become a great king or a great spiritual teacher And his

89
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,559
father had a definite preference for the king

90
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:21,159
So there he was protected from any

91
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:28,559
possible blip in his life Even the beautiful flowers in the garden were deadheaded the the blooms were removed

92
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:36,080
before they could fade But as he got older as a young man curiosity interest

93
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:42,000
motivated him to sneak out of the castle with his friend the charioteer And he

94
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,520
discovered the messengers of old age sickness and death which shook him to

95
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,600
the core He hadn't seen these things

96
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:59,200
and they affected him deeply and he conceived of the idea of wanting to

97
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,720
discover another way wanting a different way to penetrate through and release

98
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:10,000
himself from life suffering And then on one of those trips he saw a wandering

99
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,000
sadua sage peaceful graceful walking through all of

100
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,720
the chaos of the marketplace And he left

101
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:28,240
home And there are many discourses where he talks about this um

102
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:35,080
what he left behind and talks about the

103
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:40,799
benefit the um appeal the virtue of a

104
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:47,200
life of the kind of simplicity that he was leading He let go of all that status

105
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:53,130
and wealth and became a wandering aesthetic It was the beginning of his own hero's journey And it also

106
00:29:53,130 --> 00:30:00,880
[Music] became the inspiration for generations of practitioners to

107
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,320
embrace simplicity So most of you have heard

108
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:12,159
this story I'm sure And um many people over the centuries have found it

109
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:17,360
resonates with them in part because many of us come to the path of practice

110
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:22,880
because of something that's not right a wish for something deeper some kind of

111
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:28,480
suffering or disease In the story the Buddha

112
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:35,840
literally lets go a preoccupation with status wealth sensual pleasure

113
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:41,200
But this could also be considered a metaphor an instruction And he uses it

114
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:47,320
this way in some of his teachings in the kind of simplicity of mind that is

115
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:54,120
helpful to deeper joy freedom helpful to spiritual

116
00:30:54,120 --> 00:31:02,399
cultivation One of those areas of simplicity is letting go letting go of a

117
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:09,039
preoccupation with status or at least not taking it quite so

118
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:14,520
personally Another version of this is not giving energy to comparing mind or

119
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:23,760
FOMO but instead turning towards this this moment as best we can

120
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:30,720
There's also a level of simplicity of releasing concern Releasing concern with what I'm

121
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:36,120
going to get out of this meditation session this retreat this

122
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:42,960
practice this teacher even In other words it's a shift of

123
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:49,760
interest It's a shift of interest

124
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:56,200
in getting interested in how we relate to various forms of

125
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:01,440
insecurities even cravings in our own minds and hearts and

126
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:08,240
relating to them more simply as what's happening now rather than as commands

127
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:17,360
real needs or even um distractions verdicts on

128
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:23,559
me So turning interest to the simplicity of the

129
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:30,919
moment Turning that interest to the simplicity of the moment helps to support

130
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:36,960
contentment which is an underrated and very important quality in deepening

131
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:44,760
practice and in discovering insight So I speak from personal

132
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:51,519
experience As a young person a young adult an adolescent I was very discontented Always reaching out

133
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:57,200
reaching out wanting more wanting wanting wanting Happiness was out there

134
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,559
not in here It's so common Now there's even the

135
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:09,200
simile of monkey mind which is the mind grabbing on to the next thing and the

136
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:15,519
next thing Another practitioner I know called

137
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:21,120
her mind a mongoose mind looking at the shiny next thing to pay attention to to

138
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,519
grab onto to look for

139
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:32,200
happiness instead moments of

140
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:37,679
contentment And there were many in my younger life that I ignored or um forgot

141
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:44,880
about didn't kind of appreciate in this relentless pursuit It wasn't until

142
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:50,240
encountering a major health challenge that I started to learn how to turn

143
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:57,880
towards my own body heart and mind and relax be

144
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:03,559
with find contentment in the simple absence of reaching out in the simple

145
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:11,919
absence of a moment of discomfort a simple moment of being

146
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:16,949
present no matter how [Applause]

147
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:25,560
fleeting So eventually even in the midst of health challenge I started to feel this simple

148
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:31,398
happiness that I'd never felt before It was the happiness of

149
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:39,358
presence of being here now Many of you have experienced this It

150
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:46,960
was humbling for me that that simple presence later got disturbed as I got more into meditation with then the habit

151
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,679
of wanting projecting itself into the

152
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:59,760
practice But that wasn't a mistake Habits of aversion habits of

153
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:08,240
wanting showing up in the practice are these amazing opportunities to discover the habits of our own minds the

154
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:17,079
tendency of our own hearts and start to release them Let them go

155
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:20,880
Cultivate a clearer

156
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:30,760
way a simpler way a more content way

157
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:37,000
One of the ways of doing this is to notice and

158
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:43,440
appreciate savor moments of contentment and ease now rather than setting them

159
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:53,040
aside to look for a greater moment or a contentment later And another is to notice notice

160
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:59,200
the frame of mind whatever it is like the glasses

161
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:05,000
that you're wearing Notice how it filters

162
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:11,599
experience Am I wearing rosecolored glasses or duca colored

163
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:19,320
glasses checking out what is the general mood or

164
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:26,800
attitude internal posture stance of relationship to the moment

165
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:36,559
It's worth appreciating this because then sometimes we can drop into a moment of

166
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:46,839
clarity Notice what's already here Allow it Be content with it Rest in

167
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:52,520
it And it's worth appreciating because contentment supports

168
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:58,920
non-distraction Contentment supports presence Contentment supports the

169
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:07,839
capacity to see clearly without clinging or craving It has a flavor of the peace of

170
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:14,880
the freed liberated mind It's almost like a continuum towards it So it in

171
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,960
itself is onward leading and it's a condition for that

172
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:26,720
simplicity The Buddha praised both likening a

173
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:32,240
practitioner with these qualities as being free with nothing carried except

174
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:41,400
the wings like wings of a bird And that simplicity is supported by

175
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:48,960
contentment and supports contentment simplicity of lifestyle that supports

176
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:55,200
making time for practice The Buddha's going forth his

177
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:01,359
letting go of everything is one example of this as our contemporary and ancient monastics

178
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:09,280
Many people though in the midst of our rich and full and busy lives find a much more harmonious

179
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,800
relationship with the heart by just simplifying

180
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:21,400
activities And there's simplicity in how we relate to our own hearts and

181
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:29,760
minds which supports a wholesome relationship with whatever is there The capacity to simply turn towards to be

182
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:37,040
with Simplicity supports clear seeing clarity

183
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:43,720
and simplicity supports insight

184
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:49,560
So how do you support the inner rising growth of

185
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:55,599
simplicity well to some extent simplicity is an acquired taste

186
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:00,800
Maybe notice how you've acquired it in your own life and where it's not there

187
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:08,359
or complication is there Notice how it

188
00:39:08,359 --> 00:39:16,079
tends to release the most unhelpful proliferation of mind if we just step

189
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:23,359
back with it If we just step back with it allow it to be simply okay It's

190
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:29,160
complicated Just complicated not a

191
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:35,960
problem Can go to your senses Drop into the senses of the

192
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:41,480
moment Sensory gateways to awareness

193
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:50,960
and trusting that each moment of mindful awareness noticed as such invites the

194
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:57,359
next moment of awareness That quality of awareness

195
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:02,720
itself is free of complication It's like a You can

196
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:10,880
ask yourself "What's this moment like what's obvious here

197
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:17,760
it cuts through to something direct a direct

198
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:24,400
simpler way of knowing that is in the direction of ease

199
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:30,359
satisfaction simplicity of freedom

200
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:36,720
So in the next 24 hours should you choose to accept it your homework

201
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:43,760
assignment is to notice what wholesome qualities of heart

202
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:50,240
and mind this talk the story at the beginning may have evoked in you and to

203
00:40:50,240 --> 00:41:00,640
perhaps notice when there are moments of simplicity and ease and when there are not in your life

204
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:06,280
Notice the difference Would love to hear or see in the chat what you

205
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:13,560
discover So thank you for your attention and your practice
