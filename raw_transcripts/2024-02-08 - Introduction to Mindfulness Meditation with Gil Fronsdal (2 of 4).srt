1
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:10,400
so good evening can you hear me okay great sorry to be late

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,840
um by the end of these five week series you'll know that there's no need to wait

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:22,400
for anything because you can just practice but that's what you were doing very

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,679
nicely maybe I Disturbed you once many years ago when I was kind of learning this

5
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:33,800
practice I was with a teacher who said if uh if you're waiting for something to

6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:41,440
happen you miss the boat cuz his idea was you can always just show up for now whatever that is

7
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,840
but I am sorry to be late and um I'm out of habit of teaching in the

8
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:54,000
evening I used to do this all the time before the pandemic and this is the first time since the pandemic that I

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,079
started this class I started teaching the evening so I just out of habit and I

10
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:06,479
was busy when at home with things so

11
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,680
um so here we are the second week of this intern meditation

12
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:19,920
class and uh the second week we talk about mindfulness of the body and uh some people are challenged

13
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,920
with their body right away when they practice meditation as sooner or later most people are challenged in some way

14
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:33,840
with discomfort in the body but even without having to practice with discomfort uh the body is this wonderful

15
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:41,079
arena for practice in fact um uh it's maybe the central kind of Arena so much

16
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:48,960
so that some people will say that the real Temple Buddhist temple or the real Monastery is your own body that uh

17
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,119
learning to kind of live in your body through your body and it was certainly surprise for me when I started

18
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,560
practicing Buddhism how much being in the body being embodied

19
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:07,799
was uh a was emphasized and um over and over again we

20
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:16,040
would uh various ways use our bodies bring attention to our bodies that uh

21
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:23,440
evoked a very strong sense of embodiment and there's even Buddhist texts that say that uh people get

22
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,560
enlightened through the body and the Buddha himself talked about there's no Enlightenment without mindfulness of the

23
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,680
body it's that important so it's not just we have to contend with it and be mindful

24
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:41,640
of it because it's challenging sometimes the body is actually quite a wonderful place to live and uh and what we'll see

25
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:48,080
through meditation practice as it develops the relation not only is the relationship the body changes but also

26
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,599
our inner sense of what the body is changes and it turns out that the if you

27
00:02:53,599 --> 00:03:00,480
close your eyes and feel your body that whatever feeling you have of your body the experience you have of your body is

28
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,080
not just the physical body what the the experience of the body

29
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:13,720
you have is always a uh mediated by the thoughts you

30
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,799
have the Mind states you have the level of concentration you have the level of

31
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:24,720
distraction you have the level of neurosis you have the the body is very

32
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,959
amenable to the Mind States and what's going on in the mind and it's dramatic

33
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,519
how thoroughly this our experience of the body can change when the ordinary

34
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:41,840
thinking mind quiets down and um there was a time in my early

35
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,080
years where I I had something I called my caric body which was the body of

36
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:54,360
tension that I carry around all the time and a lot of what my sense of my body was the body was tense and held and all

37
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:01,879
that and then when I got into meditation at some point or other it was kind of like I left the car kic body behind and

38
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:08,560
my sense of body became much more harmonious radiant soft expansive

39
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,959
sometimes like there there was no sense of any boundaries in a way that felt really really

40
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:21,440
delicious so I say all this to you with the idea that whatever you think your body is and your experience of your body

41
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:28,400
is it probably isn't what you think um or say it differently it is

42
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,320
exactly what you think let's think differently and your body

43
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,759
experience of your body will become different as well so that was all kind of

44
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,600
introductory for basic uh mindfulness practice uh we are learning to bring

45
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:52,280
mindfulness to the body a form of attention where it is um we can be

46
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,520
present for our body and respectful caring way without being reactive to it

47
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:04,280
without shutting down or resisting what's Happ happening but learning how to bring a kind of balanced open

48
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,759
awareness to the to experiences in the body so that rather than Contracting or

49
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,840
reacting we actually are softening and relaxing with whatever is happening in

50
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,520
the body and um so I think what may be nice

51
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:27,520
to do is to start with an exercise that maybe will give you some feeling kind of for what mindfulness of

52
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,680
the body can be about before we apply it in a different way to how we do it in

53
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,759
meditation and that would be to first um just as you are you don't have to change

54
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:45,240
your posture if you don't want but just close your eyes in being in a comfortable

55
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:57,440
way and with your eyes closed become aware of uh your dominant

56
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:08,400
hand and feel the sensations you have in that

57
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:18,800
hand on the surface of the hand the back of the

58
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,039
hand the palm of the

59
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,400
hand and the fingers

60
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:47,759
and and it isn't so much that you're up in the control tower looking down at the

61
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,599
hand it's more like what is the hand's experience of

62
00:06:53,639 --> 00:07:01,240
itself feeling the hand

63
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:09,720
and the sensations of your hand do they radiate or pulse

64
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:18,400
or are they warm or cold tingling

65
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:26,280
or any feelings of pleasant or unpleasant Sensations in

66
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,319
the hand

67
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:46,919
and if your attention is on the hand but relaxed does your awareness kind of roam

68
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:53,599
around kind of float between the different sensations of your

69
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
hand

70
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,800
so the hands experience of

71
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:18,720
itself so just very simple very relaxed allowing the hand to be itself allowing

72
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:26,879
the sensations to be there in a simple way and then with your eyes

73
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:34,200
closed what did you think about your hand you probably looked at your hand over your many times in your lifetime

74
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:42,440
and and maybe you've thought about the things that are wrong with your hand and maybe your fingers are too long or too

75
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:48,399
stubby too large too small maybe your have your hand maybe

76
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:54,800
has too many wrinkles or too many lines or maybe the color of the is not quite

77
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:01,720
right sure certainly you can start figuring out how something's kind of not right with your hand or maybe it's not

78
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:09,399
right now that I'm talking about it wow the

79
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:14,000
hand how' you get into with that kind of

80
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:24,040
hand so this is in this is bringing in here now thoughts and ideas judgments

81
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:29,200
about the hand some of you maybe was a bit painful I'm sorry to through it

82
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:35,279
provoke that for you but now put aside all those

83
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:41,560
thoughts and go back to feeling the Hand by

84
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,279
itself the hand's experience of

85
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,680
itself where it has no the hand itself has no idea of how a hand should

86
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:03,839
be doesn't compare itself with other hands it just it's just there sensations of the

87
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,560
hand and for about a minute or two to maybe accompany Your Hand by breathing

88
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:26,200
through it breathing with it allowing it to be

89
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:32,640
itself allowing it to be felt as you breathe along with

90
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,399
it and then you can take a few long slow deep breaths and when you're ready you

91
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,079
can open your

92
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:15,079
eyes so two different ways of experiencing

93
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:22,839
your hand one was the hand's experience of itself and one was through the filter of

94
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:30,040
these stories ideas I sorry I brought along about your hand that's kind of

95
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:36,839
comparative thinking and judgments of what's a good hand and what isn't a good hand or what finger should be or all

96
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:42,839
that so two different ways of experiencing the hand what did you notice about the difference between

97
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:51,079
those two were they pretty much the same you'll take it or leave them or was one how are they

98
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
different

99
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:09,800
nothing yes please when when you're asking us to the

100
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:16,800
hands experience the hands experience of itself I was mostly thinking about how

101
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:23,680
it feels how what how it feels yeah and then when you are talking

102
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:30,880
about um our judgment or comparison I'm thinking of how it looks

103
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:38,680
and was it and how did what was the what was it like for you the two different ways you prefer one over the other well

104
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:45,240
how it looks was more a negative for me uhhuh like I was thinking about the dry

105
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:52,440
spots and the whatnot you know so it wasn't a positive but the other was more

106
00:12:52,440 --> 00:13:00,839
neutral uhhuh yeah great someone else

107
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:11,000
for me um one was less busy a less busy experience than the other and other was

108
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,160
more um involved let's say so you're more

109
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,440
involved with a hand and mentally involved yes

110
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:28,320
and the lad is is how I want to be that the latter is how I want to be and feel

111
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:35,040
always the latter being just feeling the hand receptive and and coexisting with

112
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:41,920
the hand as opposed to being busy and and thinking about it selecting yeah I wouldn't say it's positive or

113
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,480
negative um they're different uh but I prefer one feeling to the other why why

114
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:53,040
prefer one over the other well less busy and um from what I'm beginning to learn

115
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:59,680
about Buddhism is um it's a way of feeling uh Freer

116
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:06,800
great that's very nice thank you I saw another yes hi sorry I'm over here um

117
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:14,320
yeah I felt the same way that you did and that you did um I noticed uh uh it

118
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:22,040
was hard to it I had I kept toggling back to my thoughts and then to the hand and it was hard to like stay on the hand

119
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:28,759
yeah right that's what I found wasall was it even harder after I told you to think about your hand yeah well then I

120
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:36,839
was starting to judge my hand and think about what it looks like exactly rather than how it feels or well and which

121
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:44,920
which way did you prefer to be I prefer the way the way that's not judging my hand and and why would you prefer

122
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:53,240
that um because it seems much less

123
00:14:53,240 --> 00:15:01,160
um yeah like busy and critical and thought oriented it's it's just being

124
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:06,920
but given how much human beings judge isn't that like what PE isn't that normal and shouldn't we be spend more

125
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:12,880
time doing that judging yeah given how much people do it already I know well it

126
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,959
just means it's hard I see why it's hard to to practice to do the practice

127
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:23,440
because of that mind exactly yeah thank

128
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:30,600
you so yeah one more here

129
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:38,920
um with the feeling of the hand I I felt um life in me I

130
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:44,519
felt alive CU it was full of Sensations and

131
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:50,839
energy and I guess the other one I I forget that I'm alive cuz I'm so busy

132
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:57,560
thinking about the spots and so forth great very nice yeah forget you're alive

133
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:03,560
and um some sometimes in spiritual circles they say some people are dead before they die

134
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,880
because they're so disconnected from themselves they don't feel their aliveness they're lost in their

135
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:15,759
thoughts so that exercise was meant to offer you um a contrast that maybe you

136
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:22,399
can find useful as you do this mindfulness practice that as we're doing mindfulness of the body we're being

137
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,440
mindful of what's happening in the body the way we felt the just felt the hand

138
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:33,680
the hand's feeling of it self very simple and there not a time to

139
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:40,399
judge or make comparisons or react or um we do that plenty but that often is not

140
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,759
really so connected to reality or it's not so useful and and it's often painful

141
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,800
and often when it gets accumulated or gets more important things in the hand

142
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:57,560
it can be really really painful that to do that and we don't only do it to ourselves unfortunately we do it towards

143
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:05,360
others as well we we judge them for their hands or their thing or whatever and um and uh and then because we do

144
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:11,400
that as Society we do it to each other it reinforces us doing it to ourselves and feeling bad about ourselves

145
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,480
identifying ourselves you know I'm this kind of person and if we get busy in the

146
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:22,199
mind and thinking and it can be very debilitating to spend a lot of time in

147
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:27,480
those thoughts spinning mindfulness of the body is to

148
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:33,520
uh is to drop out of that mind and allow ourselves to feel the body on its own

149
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,880
terms From the Inside Out free of the concepts free of the judgments that we

150
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:46,320
might normally have in everyday life and then in a few weeks we'll talk about mindfulness of thinking that will

151
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:53,440
show a different way of how to be mindful of those kinds of thoughts without being caught by them but for now

152
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:59,760
mindfulness of the body this is closer to what mindfulness of the body is the hand for most of you probably was a

153
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,880
relatively neutral place to feel some of you might have arthritis or your it

154
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,960
might hurt but sometimes in meditation what we're feeling doesn't feel Pleasant

155
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:16,960
or neutral it might actually be unpleasant might be painful even and when we do mindfulness

156
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,120
meditation you're always welcome to change your posture if you're you feel

157
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,799
your posture is uncomfortable and you're better off changing but if all you do is

158
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:34,039
change every time that you're uncomfortable you're short changing the power of the and learning what the

159
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:42,039
meditation is about when you feel like you your morale is good feel like it's appropriate the idea is to within reason

160
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:49,720
to uh also practice with the discomfort of the body and and and uh and the way to feel

161
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:57,960
the discomfort of the body is in the same way that you felt the hand and uh and so that's hard to do

162
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:04,440
because when it's uncomfortable then the thinking mind kicks up and oh no I need to go to the doctor and probably need to

163
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:09,960
have the my toes amputated and and then how am I going to play you know you know

164
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:16,480
soccer and things will be hard and you know I should probably I'm getting stressed now and I should probably do

165
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,280
I've heard the meditation can help me calm down and then you realize you're meditating you know the Mind spins out

166
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:29,440
right so easily but uh but uh the idea is to learn how not to give in that

167
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:35,559
thinking mind and being able to feel the body on its own terms and I like to

168
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:42,360
believe that that's a very respectful thing to do for your body that your body is not just I said like I said before

169
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:49,240
just a hunk of Flesh it's not just a physical thing the body is an integral part of who you are it's part of your

170
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:55,760
intelligence your creativity your the body is an antenna that picks up the environment picks up what's going on

171
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,440
inside of you you need your body your body body is dynamic and engaged in life

172
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,880
and the process of living in a very important way and to leave the body

173
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,240
behind by going up into judgments and thinking and fantasy uh comparative

174
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:19,840
thinking uh is kind of to disconnect and it's actually a little bit disrespectful for the innateness or

175
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:26,559
the the the intercol aspect of this body so to drop down and feel the body

176
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:32,120
and even if it's uncomfortable the art of it is to how to discover okay my knee

177
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:39,840
aches now how can I just let the attention just be there as if it's not a problem it's just something to be

178
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:46,679
felt if you do feel it's a problem and feel like you're getting antsy or feel like something is wrong or you're afraid

179
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:51,799
by all means move your move your posture change what you're doing but sooner or

180
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:58,880
later what happens with people meditate they realize that they're better off not moving so much they real realize that

181
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,159
some of the reason they move is because of impatience restlessness because they

182
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:10,200
feel like they have to call 911 because their their foot is falling asleep and

183
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,960
there's all this excitement um but to just begin to relax and Trust the body

184
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:21,520
and let the body feel itself um all kinds of things open up that are really

185
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,720
really useful so the way that we practice uh

186
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:33,200
mindfulness is that here at IMC the way I teach is that the the default the

187
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:39,159
center center of the meditation practice is the breathing breathing doesn't work

188
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:45,240
for everyone so it doesn't have to be the center some people let the whole body be the center they just feel their

189
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:51,120
whole body like you felt the hand and that's the grounding that's how they Center themselves mindfully in the

190
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:57,120
present moment there's other ways but for now I'll leave those two but here we might emphasize the breathing if it

191
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:03,480
works and so breathing is a wonderful object for many people it's the the the

192
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:09,919
rhythm of breathing is kind of soothing if you if you settle into breathing and your breathing gets starts getting a

193
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:17,000
little bit longer because you're just kind of relaxing with it the longer the exhale um the more it seems to relax

194
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,880
much of our nervous system and in fact some people who are OV excited or panic

195
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:29,320
attack people will say just breathe deeply and sometimes that can make a big difference to Cal people

196
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:34,600
down and um and there's something about the rhythm of breathing that for some

197
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:40,520
people makes it easier to stay present something which doesn't move a lot in the Rhythm it's harder for the mind to

198
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:47,200
stay focused on and so to ride the waves of the breath coming and going it's almost like your maybe attention is like

199
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:55,159
a ball floating on the waves in the ocean and just kind of resting with it and following it and then as we practice

200
00:22:55,159 --> 00:23:00,279
more and more that uh we start being able to kind of get um more more settled

201
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:06,240
on the breathing and the mind wanders off less and that has a lot of benefits because then the mind's not thinking so

202
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:12,559
much it's not spinning out in these crazy thoughts that I can have that are often

203
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:18,000
debilitating however in our so some places in some meditation uh Traditions

204
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,279
uh like in Zen that I practiced first uh the all we were told to do was to be

205
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:28,400
with a breath that was like the be all and end all and so every time the Mind wandered off we came back to the breath

206
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:34,720
Wonder off came back try to stay there with the breathing when I learn mindfulness I learn a different way and

207
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,159
that is uh when there's something that's compelling something stronger than the

208
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:46,760
breathing we learn to make that the object of attention and so whatever it might be

209
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:53,400
and we'll talk more about this as we go through these weeks but for now it' be the body so if the experience some

210
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:59,320
experience in the body is more compelling than the breathing and compelling means that it's tugging at

211
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:05,720
attention pay attention to me you know it's and sometimes it's just a lot of energy in the body sometimes it's

212
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:14,720
something very pleasant sometimes it's unpleasant but something in the body the the then what we do is we stop

213
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:21,919
focusing on the breathing and let the attention go to this place in the body where that compelling sensation

214
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:30,399
is and then you would feel it the way you would feel that hand get to know it explore it let the

215
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:37,440
attention as if your awareness is a kind of kind of very relaxed thing that kind of floats around in that area where that

216
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:44,360
is you just feel it feel how it's How the body experiences that as you do that

217
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:50,840
you might notice that uh you're reacting to it or you're judging it or you have ideas

218
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:56,679
about it this shouldn't be there or this is great and um those are different

219
00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:03,320
those are the ideas so that's how the mind gets busy um and that's extra so the of

220
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:09,960
course the mind will do that it's not like you can just turn that the thinking switch off but what we're trying to do

221
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:16,880
is not to live in those thoughts let them recede to the background and live in the lived

222
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:25,760
experience of the body of the area you're feeling until you feel more or less

223
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,799
that maybe it's just three breaths that's enough just feel it with three breaths four breaths feel it for a while

224
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:42,320
sometimes you might want to feel something for five minutes if it's really compelling if you find hard to stay like

225
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:50,679
say your knee aches and it's hard to stay there some people find it helpful to imagine their breathing with or

226
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:57,039
breathing through that place in the body and so the rhythm of breathing kind of gets

227
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:02,240
related to that that part of the body and it's easy to stay there to feel it be with it sense

228
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,720
it after it's been acknowledged well enough or no longer compelling then the

229
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:14,679
practice is to come back to your breathing and continue with the breathing relax with the breathing relax

230
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:20,159
on the exhale let go of your thinking mind on the exhale and then um and then

231
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:25,679
uh until something else arises and um and so it's kind of like

232
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:33,559
uh the the breathing's at the center something happens you go out and visit it and then you come back to the

233
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:39,039
center something else happens you go out to it and you come back to the center

234
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:45,200
without any protests without any complaining without just there just one more thing to pay attention to it has

235
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:52,240
just as much value to feel um you know a warm tingling in your chest as it is to

236
00:26:52,240 --> 00:27:00,559
feel the breathing it's just the next thing to be aware of and and um and to learn how to be

237
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:05,720
present in a non-reactive non-judgmental way for your body is a

238
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:12,799
foundation for how we're going to be mindful of emotions how we're going to be mindful of thinking how we bring a

239
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:18,840
kind of very different kind of meditative or wise attention to the

240
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:27,720
present moment experience that is not being where attention is not being mediated or filtered through our stories

241
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:33,840
ideas our memories our judgments all kinds of things that we often get in the way and make things much more

242
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,960
complicated than need to be so that makes sense somewhat do you have any

243
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:45,120
questions about that or anything you want to before we do a

244
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:57,279
meditation is that okay you ready so we've been sitting now for a while um

245
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:03,240
well meditate for a little while so you probably a good idea to stand up and stretch and just kind of uh get

246
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,360
refreshed in your body for a minute or

247
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,440
so

248
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,399
for

249
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,559
this way of including the body as part of the meditation by when it speaks when the

250
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:23,960
body speaks up and it's more compelling the sensations in your body you turn to it and take that in in

251
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:30,480
this meditative way over time uh over months and years uh sooner or later your

252
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:36,159
whole body gets met your whole body gets filled with awareness and attention and

253
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:43,360
slowly the body wakes up more and more and I think I was very disconnected to my body when I started meditating and

254
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:48,799
slowly this practice kind of brought my body More Alive more sensitive and so it

255
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:57,360
became this marvelous field of attention and information and and uh refuge for me

256
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:03,039
so um so you might also find this way that there a slow process of waking up

257
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:10,039
maybe most of you feel you're already in your body just fine but uh probably if you do this for a while you'll you the

258
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:15,120
contrast will be quite strong and just wow this is like really now it's I was

259
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:22,360
alive before two-dimensionally now it's three-dimensionally or something

260
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:29,240
so assuming a meditation posture and

261
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:34,360
and gently closing your

262
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:44,159
eyes it's good to take a few minutes at the beginning to prepare yourself for

263
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:51,240
meditation and one way to do that is to take few long slow deep

264
00:30:54,559 --> 00:31:03,080
breaths and as you exhale make a long exhale where you relax in your

265
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:33,039
body and then letting your breathing return to

266
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:40,039
normal and continue preparing for the meditation by with a normal

267
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:46,440
breath with each exhale for a while relaxing the holding in your body

268
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:54,080
tension in your body some people like to do it systematically starting at maybe the

269
00:31:54,080 --> 00:32:00,440
forehead and the eyes feel feeling what's there on the

270
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:07,480
inhale and softening the forehead and eyes as you

271
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:25,639
exhale on the exhale letting the muscles of the face Fall Away From The

272
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,080
Bone

273
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,559
on the inhale feeling your

274
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:55,679
shoulders on the exhale relaxing the shoulders

275
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:59,039
softening

276
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:28,960
on the inhale feeling your

277
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:35,760
belly and the exhale softening the

278
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,960
belly

279
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:08,960
on the inhale feeling some Global sense of your whole

280
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:15,560
body whatever way is easy and on the

281
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:20,079
exhale releasing the

282
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:28,878
body relaxing any way in which you brace yourself against life

283
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:59,880
and now become aware of the part of your body where you usually experience your

284
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:07,280
breathing some people feel it more in the belly moving some people the

285
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:13,440
chest some people the air going in and out through the

286
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:22,520
nostrils some people will feel all of them together in some Global

287
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:29,119
way but whatever way that you whatever way where you feel the body's experience

288
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:34,599
of breathing in that

289
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:42,440
area let it be like the exercise with a

290
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:48,480
hand to allow the body to have its own experience of

291
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:54,078
breathing without any shoulds or the way it's supposed to

292
00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:02,240
be doesn't matter if it's comfortable or uncomfortable for the purposes of the

293
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:28,040
meditation when we Mak room for the body to experience itself breathing

294
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:33,160
it's kind of like a gift we give the body the gift of it getting to know

295
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:40,520
itself to know it to feel itself to make room to be

296
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:48,440
itself make room for the body to feel it feel itself

297
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:58,680
breathing and you floating on that experience

298
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:28,359
then I'm going to ask you to shift your attention someplace else and see if you can do it in a calm

299
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:36,480
way gentle slow so move your attention to some

300
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:42,319
place in your body that's not your breathing that's a little bit

301
00:37:42,319 --> 00:37:47,800
compelling maybe not the most compelling but a little bit some other

302
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:55,280
sensation in your body place in your body and like we did with a

303
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,359
hand let's let that part of the body know

304
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:04,599
itself take time to know

305
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,359
it to feel

306
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,520
it

307
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:37,800
and then letting go of that place and returning to

308
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,200
breathing feeling the physical sensations of your

309
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,400
body as you your body

310
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,520
breathes

311
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:10,319
if there's a lot of thinking on the

312
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:18,040
exhale Relax The Thinking mind any tension or tightness associated

313
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:24,920
with thinking let it

314
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:29,040
soften and then turn to

315
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:59,680
breathing and now move your attention attention to what might be the strongest

316
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,640
sensation in your

317
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:12,680
body and for a few moments even if it's painful let it be let it be

318
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:17,960
itself and let the body experience it from the

319
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:24,520
inside if it helps you can breathe with it or breathe through

320
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:28,359
it

321
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:38,960
giving the body the gift of feeling itself without the filter of your

322
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,680
reactions and thoughts

323
00:40:55,319 --> 00:41:00,599
judgments it's an exercise of seeing how simple

324
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:07,599
you can be to Simply feel the body in its own

325
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,240
terms

326
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,240
for

327
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:21,839
and then returning to your breathing letting that sensation reced

328
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:29,400
to the background as you enter into the body body's experience of

329
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:41,400
breathing knowing the rhythm of breathing in and breathing

330
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:02,119
out if the mind is thinking a lot maybe every

331
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,838
exhale letting go of your

332
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,800
thoughts letting the thinking mind be

333
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:28,079
quieter

334
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,838
maybe the place in your body is slightly

335
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:50,920
different where you feel the inhale and where you feel the

336
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:58,079
exhale

337
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:25,000
and if you find yourself easily distracted from doing

338
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,440
this there's nothing wrong with

339
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:36,599
that we're doing mindfulness practice it's all about just knowing

340
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:45,680
what's happening so knowing oh lot of

341
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:54,480
thinking and then when you're ready Begin Again with your

342
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,960
breathing

343
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,880
for

344
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:59,800
and then to end this meditation you can take a few long slow deep breaths

345
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:05,440
again and feel your body more fully more

346
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:15,119
widely feel the contact of your body against your cushion and chair and

347
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,280
floor and when you're

348
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:27,800
ready you can open your eyes

349
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:39,559
[Music]

350
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:02,680
so there's a very strong almost addictive force that exists in many

351
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:10,119
people's minds to be thinking about all kinds of things and sometimes our thinking has Us

352
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:16,520
by the nose and leads us around and directs us what we do and think and makes us Restless or want things to be

353
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:24,599
different or whatever it can take a while for the thinking mind to discover that it's okay

354
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:31,640
it's safe to be present to be relaxed it doesn't have to be always busy and doing and spinning things and that's a

355
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:37,160
wonderful thing gift to give to the thinking mind that it can finally trust

356
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:43,680
doesn't have to figure out doesn't have to plan all the time it doesn't have to defend it doesn't have to review and

357
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:48,920
figure out what went wrong or something it's okay to just be here present in a

358
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:54,200
very simple way and um and one of the AIDS to this

359
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:59,400
kind of Simplicity of being is this mindfulness of the body so it's

360
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:05,680
a wonderful area to practice in and what we're learning also is this

361
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:13,400
um way to actually whatever is happening in the moment to bring attention to

362
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:18,839
it and um and so right now we're keeping it simple just breathing and the

363
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:26,720
body with next week we'll talk about now including emotions in it and then thinking and then the whole world in it

364
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:33,200
and it so that there's a kind of a different quality of attention that goes to being present in this world to

365
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:39,160
meeting this world than it's possible if we're always living in our thoughts our

366
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:44,240
judgments our reactivity to it there's a whole almost like we're tapping into a

367
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:50,240
different capacity of intelligence different capacity of creativity of

368
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:56,200
Freedom uh by not being so glued to the reactive mind

369
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:02,480
the thinking mind that's spinning out and that's a slow process and that's one of the reasons why you want to stay slow

370
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,680
in this course just breathing the first week now just the body keep it that

371
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:14,559
simple we know you're thinking a lot we know there's a lot of emotions and stuff going on and um and that so that's

372
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:21,599
coming but right now I want to keep it simple just to get a sense develop the capacity to be in your body more and

373
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:27,960
more so um do you have any I was that like was that interesting for any of you

374
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:34,880
or revealing anything for you or challenging in any way or how was

375
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:44,720
it sorry I'm talking a lot because I'm new to this process but um can you hear

376
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:50,119
it okay um I started feeling sad because

377
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:55,760
my stomach hurts a lot and um and I'm even kind of CR cying

378
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:02,640
a little bit right now and I think um I am not comfortable sitting with

379
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:10,680
like I just cuz I there's nothing I can do about it like I've tried different things and it still hurts so being like

380
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:17,200
sitting here and being with it kind of made me angry a little bit and then I

381
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:24,440
felt yeah I wanted to just get up and start walking around or do something or lay down or do something to because I

382
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:30,799
know there's nothing I can do about it so it's been going on for so long yeah yeah well certainly you're welcome to

383
00:50:30,799 --> 00:50:36,720
get up and walk around you if you feel that's better for you um and the uh but

384
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:42,400
there might be an interesting to discover a different way to be with discomfort right when you can't do

385
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:48,480
anything about it um uh even though you can't do anything about it you are doing

386
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,599
something in relationship to it you were not liking it I was not liking it yeah

387
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:59,520
and and probably a serious of other things hating it afraid of it um

388
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:05,960
something so you doing something anyway and some of those things are the way

389
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:11,760
gentleman talked about being busy some of those things are the reactivity of the mind which is

390
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:17,680
extra and it's a marvelous thing that can happen for the body for the pain

391
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:24,119
when we can be with pain without any reactivity it's just pain and what it

392
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:30,400
actually when when then the mind fence gets really strong around something we call pain it's actually starts stops

393
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:38,280
being pain and how does that happen uh uh pain is uh not a singular thing it's

394
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:44,799
not like a it's a composite pain is a composite that's made up of many

395
00:51:44,799 --> 00:51:50,400
factors and um and those can can shift very very quickly as some of the

396
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:56,960
multiple factors get diminished or shift and change so just spend time with

397
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:04,920
non-reactive attention to pain like in their belly is a gift to the belly because it stops it's it start it

398
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:11,480
start becomes very different but it's a it's a challenging thing to learn because of how strong The Habit is of

399
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:17,000
reacting right and then I I like kind of wince because it hurts so much so yeah well I don't yeah I don't know how bad

400
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:23,799
it actually is I mean it's not it's just it's not that bad it's just it's chronic and it's sort of uncomfortable yeah yes

401
00:52:23,799 --> 00:52:28,920
so but um so I don't know I can't tell you for your condition you know so it

402
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:36,000
might be it might be laying down I don't know what it is you're always welcome to stand stand up but I think ve I very

403
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,280
very often people who learn mindfulness learn how useful it is to be present

404
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:46,760
with acute pain with nonreactivity and in meditation you have a choice to get

405
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:55,240
up and leave always a day will come where you don't have that choice so meditation is the laboratory

406
00:52:55,240 --> 00:53:04,160
you're discovering how to be with challenging situations very challenging life situations in a new way and so the

407
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:10,559
idea is to when you feel ready to learn to ride the edge of where you're where

408
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:17,599
you're comfortable to be with things like this and see if you can find a different way and um and not a few times

409
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:24,520
people discover like with pain it's not just a pain there but because we're reacting there's tension we build up

410
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:30,079
around it and that tension begins to dissipate and lo and behold the pain hasn't changed

411
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:36,760
but it's more manageable there's something about the tension that created some of that reactivity so to just hold it and be

412
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:42,720
with it so I get migraine sometimes and uh and uh I'm kind of

413
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:49,200
miserable until I go to bed and I put the the sheets over my head lay on my

414
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:55,440
side and I can then I and then I'm home and I'm happy because then what I do is

415
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:02,680
I I've learned to bring my attention right into the middle of the P most intense pain and if I put my attention

416
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:09,799
right into intense pain it stops being pain and then I can my breathing relaxes and I'm just there with it and and I'm

417
00:54:09,799 --> 00:54:17,480
comfortable but I have to keep doing it because if I get distracted and start thinking again and leave that spot oh it

418
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:24,119
starts hurting again it's fascinating and for me I feel so lucky to have this capacity to just go there and be with it

419
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:29,920
and hold it and this kind of way so it's not easy to do what I'm saying but that's kind of the direction we're

420
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,880
pointing to here thank

421
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:44,760
you behind you MRA and then this gentleman here first and then right behind you in in the chair there oh yeah

422
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:49,920
so I have a um thank you for that that helped address a lot of what was what my

423
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:55,520
experience was but I'm curious about a different situation which is more than

424
00:54:55,520 --> 00:55:02,240
actual posture of sitting um because it's not chronic and it will go away if I move yeah uh and

425
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:08,960
I'm just curious some of what you described I experienced which was kind of like the hand exercise some if I'm

426
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:14,319
thinking about it as pain and uncomfortable and I just want to move it just gets

427
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:19,680
worse but if I can pay attention to the details of what it feels like there feels like there's some stretching or

428
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:25,160
some pressure or you know it it has a little bit more physical characteristic

429
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:32,760
rather than the interpretation of pain but I'm just curious about when it's about sitting I mean like you said I can

430
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:38,839
get up and walk away um so how do I how do I how do I sit with that do I just

431
00:55:38,839 --> 00:55:44,280
continue to sit and let it kind of practice the tolerance of the discomfort

432
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:49,440
or the shifting of the way I'm being with the discomfort well two things uh

433
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:55,400
it's good to have a good meditation posture so to get some really good instructions from a yoga teacher and

434
00:55:55,400 --> 00:56:01,440
sometimes I give much more instructions on posture I love to do that and um and

435
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:06,680
uh so you're aligned and so you're not you're not uncomfortable because of the posture I mean a little bit you have to

436
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:12,079
because the money muscles are stretching and getting tired and some of it's just part of a yoga posture you're getting

437
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:18,119
used to but um um so it's good to kind of find a

438
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:25,079
good posture and and people who meditate regularly slowly slowly slowly they find their posture and it's really wonderful

439
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:32,640
to as a teacher to watch people come as a new newbie and you watch over a course of a year their body changes and they

440
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:37,960
get sometimes you see oh now they have a yogic body just from sitting some ever

441
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:45,640
in in in uh you know perceptible shifts begin happening and they kind of find

442
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:51,720
okay like this like this like this and then after a year like wow now the person's really there you can and you

443
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:58,960
feel the whole posture is like I'm they're here in a nice way so it's it's slowly people tend to learn it and

444
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:04,839
develop it and then um and then

445
00:57:04,839 --> 00:57:11,799
uh um um so the idea is as I said before

446
00:57:11,799 --> 00:57:16,960
that it is useful within reason to practice with

447
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:22,440
discomfort and um but you you only should do it when you feel like you want

448
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:29,440
to do it you know you you know I see you it's been I've been meditating now for a few

449
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:36,799
months and every time I have you know uh a little kind of ache I move and I move

450
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:42,160
and I move and I seem like moving every two minutes but you know I don't think I need to move as much you know I'm

451
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:48,960
interested in this thing Gil says that maybe you should learn a different way to be with discomfort now today the discomfort is

452
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:54,160
not so bad so today I have this morale now today I slept well I Hade a good

453
00:57:54,160 --> 00:58:00,720
meal I'm a little enthusiastic I want to explore this okay let's let's try to explore it

454
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:08,359
and then you okay that's enough and then next day a little bit longer and slowly you learn about it so

455
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:14,799
I'm kind of making this so it's up to you so when you feel you're ready for the learning for the practicing and

456
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:22,280
training with the discomfort do it but you don't have to it's not like and see and Zen you you could weren't allowed to

457
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:28,359
move so I know about don't move just sit with the pain and

458
00:58:28,359 --> 00:58:34,760
there sometimes we had literally had to sit for hours I think the longest was like three or four hours so it's a

459
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:40,160
little bit masochistic and um so we that's not

460
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:46,440
that's not our our school but this so this is may be a surprise for some of you that I'm talking about this because

461
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:52,799
meditation is associated with just relax get some calm relax feel good float in a

462
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:59,359
cloud that's good that's that's great but we're doing something much more important in addition something much

463
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:07,359
more useful here and that is we're learning how to meet whatever challenges life brings us and find a way to be with

464
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:13,200
it so we're not reactive so we have a wise way and underscore the word wise a

465
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:19,520
wise way to stay with it learn from it find out what's going on and maybe hold

466
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:25,880
it with compassion hold it with Equanimity hold it calmly and that's a

467
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:31,000
phenomenal life skill to learn because you might have a situation where the

468
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:39,000
doctors have no pain medication for you it's okay I know what I've I've done this before and I I you know I'm I'll

469
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:47,280
practice now with this or it's not physical pain but maybe it's emotional pain and so what what I like to say is

470
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:52,520
that you know Buddhism is a lot about learning to be free but if you're only free when you're

471
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:58,440
comfortable you're not really free so you have to learn at sooner or later

472
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:04,119
how to work with discomfort and I'm saying it's up to you when that point

473
01:00:04,119 --> 01:00:09,680
is make sense does that give you enough does that answer your question okay it

474
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:15,319
does okay thank you um so just want to express some

475
01:00:15,319 --> 01:00:21,039
appreciation for the the teaching tonight and the chance to kind of practice can you lift it a little louder

476
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:27,599
for me you know I can also talk louder I just have a very quiet voice yeah yeah yeah I um if I put in my hearings AIDS

477
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:33,079
in in then I even speak softer because I hear my voice and so I S I have such a

478
01:00:33,079 --> 01:00:39,319
soft voice to begin with so I apologize if some of you are straining we could turn my voice up my things up too but is

479
01:00:39,319 --> 01:00:46,599
is this okay you okay um so yeah I appreciated the instruction to kind of

480
01:00:46,599 --> 01:00:54,880
stay with the breath and then go off and visit different Sensations that were compelling yeah and I noticed um and

481
01:00:54,880 --> 01:01:00,160
this tends to happen when I sit I all of a sudden like an itch arises right it's

482
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:05,680
that wasn't there a second ago and I've noticed too like if I kind of let myself

483
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:11,440
attend to that and I kind of scratch it then another one will pop up somewhere else right so it's this like funny thing

484
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:16,599
that happens and so I just kind of did that practice stayed with it and it

485
01:01:16,599 --> 01:01:23,000
began to kind of transform and it actually became this like really marvelous thing and it was

486
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:28,400
like it's kind of odd experience but it felt almost like a like a constellation

487
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:34,599
of stars or something like this Sensation that was just arising and it was able to kind of hold it and very

488
01:01:34,599 --> 01:01:40,760
different relationship to it which I hadn't really experienced before so just wanted to share that and say thank you

489
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:46,960
yeah that wonderful that's very nice that's a that's a way that this can unfold in meditation stars and

490
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:52,920
constellations and sparkles and lots of space and openness and it's like you've entered into a new universe around the

491
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:58,079
body so what I said in the beginning we have you know the the body shifts and

492
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:04,520
changes depending on the state of the mind that's what happened to you your sense of the body changed I mean your

493
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:12,599
your raw physical body didn't change probably much except maybe stress hormones disappeared in that state but

494
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:18,839
um but the way we experience the body changes dramatically and that's what you had was one example of that so that was

495
01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:26,960
great it was lovely to hear that report you anything else I questions

496
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:37,920
or so if I'll tell you a

497
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:44,079
story that um you might know this is a famous Buddhist kind of par uh kind of

498
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:50,960
simile so there was um the Buddha was sitting with a group people like you

499
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:56,240
and and he asked them the question he said if an Archer comes along with bow

500
01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:02,920
and arrow and um strikes you you know shoots you with an arrow will that hurt

501
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:09,079
you and they said yeah and uh and he said well if he comes

502
01:03:09,079 --> 01:03:15,559
along and shoots you with a second Arrow will that hurt even more oh yeah getting two arrows hurts more than having

503
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:22,440
one and then the Buddha said well uh life brings you the first

504
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:30,559
Arrow you shoot the second an arrow so for example if I'm walking down

505
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:37,039
the sidewalk here and I trip and maybe fall and scrape my knee that's just life

506
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:43,760
that happens that's the first Arrow but it's right in front of IMC and you all see me and I'm a mindfulness teacher

507
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:49,359
who's supposed to pay attention be present this is like an embarrassment I'm just like a mess and this is I'm

508
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:55,440
afraid I'm angry angry that I got seen angry at you for seeing me

509
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:00,920
I'm just shooting arrows left and right the fir sometimes you just leave

510
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:07,559
let it be the first Arrow oh I tripped I scraped my knee it hurts I don't have to

511
01:04:07,559 --> 01:04:13,640
add anything to it anymore we add a lot of second arrows so

512
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:19,000
when there's sitting in meditation sometimes you can see it there's something happens a meditation that's

513
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:24,400
uncomfortable maybe pain in the body and then you might see the second arrows

514
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:30,359
maybe you're upset with yourself maybe you're upset with the teacher giving

515
01:04:30,359 --> 01:04:38,119
those instructions maybe you um tighten up maybe you you know shut down maybe

516
01:04:38,119 --> 01:04:45,640
you spin out or something or criticize yourself I must be doing it wrong there's all these second arrows we give

517
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:53,400
and part of what we're doing here is learning to be present in a very simple way the simpler we can have the presence

518
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:59,760
the more we start noticing what we do that's extra the second arrows the

519
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:06,319
reactivity and for now it's very important that you don't

520
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:11,720
see that there's it's best not to ever think that you're meditating wrong I

521
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:19,720
want to just like this is like the meditation free zone you can't do it

522
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:25,559
wrong so if you have a second Arrow

523
01:05:25,559 --> 01:05:31,279
smile I saw that I'm learning the tricks of the mind I'm learning what my mind

524
01:05:31,279 --> 01:05:37,039
does this is really important to see you notice you see what's happening

525
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:42,640
then you're doing the practice this I've said before last week too if you get distracted a lot in

526
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:50,240
thought during meditation um that's not wrong what you do then is you see that's

527
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:57,240
the case look I'm thinking a lot oh no but but you're not supposed to think in meditation wait a minute I think that's

528
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:05,119
a second Arrow let's just start again and one of the SK one of the

529
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:11,680
little tricks of doing this kind of meditation practice when in doubt just start

530
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:18,359
over start fresh just in a moment's notice just okay that did I don't know what to do that's lost I boy I had a lot

531
01:06:18,359 --> 01:06:24,799
of second arrows there and where do I find my way back okay just take a deep breath and just start over again let if

532
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:32,279
from just beginning so try not to think that you're doing it wrong if you have

533
01:06:32,279 --> 01:06:38,640
thoughts that you're doing it wrong you're still not wrong it's just one more thing to see oh

534
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:44,720
look at that I'm thinking those thoughts I'm thinking those thoughts and having that kind of

535
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:49,920
attitude just let it be it's good to see it it's important to see it that's the

536
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:56,440
path to Freedom start seeing what goes on in the mind in the heart and the body and then learning to come back and be

537
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:04,200
really simple with everything and right now the idea is to be really simple with breathing which is a bodily experience

538
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:10,440
it's just not just one embodied experience among others uh and very simple with other

539
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:17,960
sensations of your of your in your body and um and maybe in for this next

540
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:23,079
week if there's some uncomfortable Body Sensations that you

541
01:07:23,079 --> 01:07:29,960
might have and you feel some curiosity about practicing with it you might discover

542
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:37,480
that um interesting to bring attention and feel it really really simple the discomfort see what see if you can just

543
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:43,720
hold the discomfort as if it has permission to be there

544
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:48,920
forever as if do hopefully it doesn't stay forever but but you kind of that

545
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:54,319
attitude and then just be with it breathe with it a little bit maybe go back to your breathing and then if

546
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:59,960
becomes back go back to it and just be and see and see how simple you can be

547
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:06,760
and see what shifts and changes see what second arrows you don't add see what extra layers of maybe tension or

548
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:13,000
contraction you stop doing that maybe you didn't even know you're doing until you started to learn to this radical

549
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:20,838
Simplicity of just being with it it's a life skill which will serve you really really well in many many

550
01:08:20,839 --> 01:08:27,199
situations and um and sometimes someday it's not just because uh it's

551
01:08:27,199 --> 01:08:32,440
for your sake but some someday it might be because it's time to help someone

552
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:38,278
else but you have your own challenge with your own pain and difficulty but now you know how to hold it so it

553
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:46,239
doesn't get in way of being able to be of help in the world it's it's a radical thing we're learning to do

554
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:54,480
here so um mindfulness of the body if you want to EXP explore this

555
01:08:54,480 --> 01:09:00,560
topic more over the course of this week I mean certainly just make your body be the book some people ask me sometimes

556
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:06,040
and maybe I irritate them but by my answer they asked me uh do you have a

557
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:12,080
book to recommend on Buddhism or book to I should read and I said yeah um the

558
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:19,120
book of your body everything you need to know about Buddhism is found by attention to the body it's that profound

559
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:24,960
and I have a little bit of maybe credibility in saying that

560
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:31,600
because I have a PhD in Buddhism so I should know that this is

561
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:38,600
where you find it not there in those books and so uh this is the

562
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:46,080
place and um and the um so you know and uh and also it might

563
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:53,480
shift your relationship to your body I think you all know that uh in this country of ours maybe much of the world

564
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:58,960
but certainly in this country the amount of suffering people feel have experienc

565
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:05,719
about their body you know their body is too much this not enough that so I mean the

566
01:10:05,719 --> 01:10:12,880
amount of suffering goes on around is huge huge a lot of it has to do with

567
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:19,640
comparative thinking reactive thinking judgments uh acquired ideas that we take

568
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:26,760
in from outside internalize them it's it's and then people make a fortune on

569
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:33,080
our on our you know you know on these crazy ideas we have about the body that were sometimes told it's supposed to be

570
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:40,600
this way and the more they can get you upset about your body the more they can sell you or

571
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:49,760
something there is maybe none of you are doing this but it's a lot going on so this shift from the thinking comparing

572
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:56,080
judging mind to just feeling allowing your body life allowing it to be

573
01:10:56,080 --> 01:11:01,520
itself your body is your body is probably a lot happier usually than you

574
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:06,600
are and your body is probably a lot happier with itself than you

575
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:13,440
are give your body the gift of letting it be itself without the burden of all

576
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:20,280
these heavy judgments that people have it's a radical thing and in some

577
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:26,520
ways it's may be a political thing to do that in this country because of so

578
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:32,840
much you know the society is so complicated around it the the good good

579
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:37,880
politics to just trust your body and feel it and be with it in a simple way

580
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:43,560
learn that and you might save a lot of

581
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:50,199
money and a lot of anxiety or something angst your body will love you the bodies

582
01:11:50,199 --> 01:11:55,560
are great and it's one of the I think people who do this practice really come

583
01:11:55,560 --> 01:12:02,760
to to uh generally come to treasure their body love their body treated with a lot of respect and care and and

584
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:09,040
becomes a really good partnership though with any partnership sometimes there's

585
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:18,960
challenges so um thank you for being here and and um sorry to being late I'll try

586
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:24,040
not to do it again uh next week I'll be here but I'm coming up from Santa Cruz

587
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:30,560
to next week because I'm teaching a retreat next week down there so you know we know Highway 17 is notorious with

588
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:37,000
problems so I'll call someone here if I'm stuck in traffic but I'm planning to come over the hill early enough to be

589
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:42,199
here in time and um or if I really can't make it then maybe Tom Tom teaches this
