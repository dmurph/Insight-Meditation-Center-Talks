1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:08,519
so uh so welcome folks yeah nice to see your uh your

2
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:15,679
names um when I logged into this Zoom account

3
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:24,279
I did not know that the default setting was for my face to be touched

4
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:32,200
up so I've shut down that function and if I look more grizzled

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:38,520
today than yesterday uh that's the explanation it

6
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,399
wasn't a rough day yesterday you weren't hard on me

7
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,480
um so with that critical

8
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,039
announcement complete can meditate

9
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:03,719
uh but um before uh before we do uh line

10
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:12,640
from uh Simone V she said um attention attention taken

11
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,200
to its highest degree is the same thing as

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,640
prayer attention taken to its highest degree is the same thing as

13
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,240
prayer taken to its highest you know

14
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:40,759
classically attention is said to be a kind of neutral Factor you know wholesome or UNH

15
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:47,159
wholesome but uh I what I believe she's pointing to is um yeah the

16
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,640
the the more deeply intimate we

17
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,479
get uh with experience the more profoundly a sense of the meditator

18
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,360
falls away the meditator becomes the meditated

19
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:10,840
and the attention that normally feels like well I'm operating the spotlight of

20
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,959
attention behind behind the scenes in some

21
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:22,800
way that falls away and the kind of effortlessness of awareness The

22
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,200
Emptiness of awareness the enchanted devotional Inseparable from a

23
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,760
certain kind of nonviolence

24
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:41,040
uh attention becomes uh prayer becomes

25
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:50,400
prayer and the the sense of of the view wise view wise view isn't

26
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,760
something that gets added to the attention it's like the attention and

27
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,760
view converge and and

28
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:09,519
uh we know what the Buddha was talking about

29
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:20,080
and there is something uh very deeply devotional heartfelt becomes

30
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,239
prayer so may uh yeah may

31
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:31,760
we pray together

32
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:41,360
so letting your uh body find its

33
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,720
posture

34
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720
e

35
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,599
we uh maybe start practice with

36
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:57,800
a more dualistic sense sense of uh the

37
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:03,960
willfulness of some instruction ctions relax your body

38
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:11,320
release tension allow whatever tension remains

39
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,800
to

40
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,639
remain

41
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,120
direct your attention

42
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,960
to your body or your

43
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:55,680
breath to the soundscape to some attentional

44
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,639
anchor

45
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:15,840
we begin to uh to Kindle kind of uh fires of

46
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,840
devotion prayer

47
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
reverence

48
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
e

49
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:35,560
e we we offer our heartfelt

50
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,800
forgiveness for

51
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:54,960
imperfection our heartfelt forgiveness for Sam S this kind of Realm

52
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,440
cyclical suffering

53
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:07,479
How Deeply can you

54
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,159
forgive and of course whatever you think you

55
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,840
are the that is fully

56
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,760
included in the

57
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
forgiveness

58
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
e

59
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
e

60
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

61
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:39,959
sometimes our our love and our attention

62
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:45,240
uh migrates out to other objects or love

63
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:51,880
of safety of pleasure of knowing

64
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:01,240
Security even our worry testifies to a certain kind of love

65
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,240
protectiveness and we are

66
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:41,160
recommit to this this kindling of uh the sacred it begins even

67
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:50,639
when it feels like we're in uh low gear something feels

68
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:55,560
clunky we keep offering our

69
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,040
attention until until it becomes

70
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:15,800
prayer until the effortlessness of awareness that which

71
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,639
is not

72
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:31,160
me as a parent

73
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:40,199
and it no longer feels like uh the meditator behind the control

74
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:46,759
panel directing the attentional spotlight to the breath or the body or

75
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
whatever

76
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:31,600
the clunkiness of me directing my attention towards the

77
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,519
breath becomes

78
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,079
the grace of uh

79
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,600
awareness

80
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
emptiness

81
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

82
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
e

83
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

84
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

85
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

86
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

87
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,120
that kind of clunkiness of I amness the clunkiness

88
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:41,559
of self of feeling like the meditation is all up to

89
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:47,600
us sort of uh

90
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,919
yields to that which uh it doesn't feel

91
00:17:53,919 --> 00:18:00,840
like we own control Direct

92
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:14,919
almost like we uh relax all the mechanisms of doing and

93
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:24,240
selfing and let awareness find

94
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
us

95
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

96
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

97
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

98
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

99
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

100
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

101
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

102
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

103
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

104
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

105
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

106
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

107
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

108
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:05,559
e the sense of self manifest

109
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:10,200
as agenda

110
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:24,080
tension sense of uh

111
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:35,360
responsibility responsibility to

112
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:42,080
uh work out our redemption in the Rag and Bone

113
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,278
shop the

114
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,679
heart but the meditator becomes the

115
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
meditated

116
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:21,559
a certain kind of uh Faith In Love

117
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:33,278
awareness then we can let

118
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:44,039
go be groundless and something will catch

119
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,120
us

120
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,120
e

121
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,039
e

122
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,039
e

123
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,039
e

124
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,960
for

125
00:30:56,919 --> 00:30:59,919
e

126
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,320
okay folks so uh it's good to uh good to say

127
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:18,120
with you

128
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,880
um this is um Louise uh

129
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:31,159
cook uh my body now that we will not be

130
00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:37,000
traveling together much longer I begin to feel a new tenderness

131
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:44,799
toward you very raw and unfamiliar like what I remember of love

132
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:51,360
when I was young love that was so often foolish in its

133
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:56,840
objectives but never in its choices its

134
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:04,760
intensities so the theme uh has

135
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:14,000
been uh faith faith and uh the manifestations of uh of Doubt faith and

136
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:21,600
the manifestations of doubt and said um yesterday that that

137
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:28,679
information information is the reduction of uncertainty and

138
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:35,480
doubt can't take in information it's all noise no

139
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:43,200
signal and today uh wanted to to speak about another aspect of faith that

140
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:50,840
that's been important to me and what I was um alluding to in the sit and it's

141
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:56,159
the faith we we develop in in love Faith in

142
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:04,360
love love is said to be uh excuse me said to be the

143
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:09,519
glue of the universe that which prevents things

144
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:15,039
from disintegrating

145
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:20,399
and we know this aversion hatred

146
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:28,919
aggression this runs so deep in us this is with us until we're very very very

147
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:34,519
free and to actually manage

148
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:42,960
our aversion to manage our hate we uh develop something akin to a faith

149
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:50,880
in love in our in our evolutionary history

150
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:56,279
you know across millions millions of years of our animal ancestors like

151
00:33:56,279 --> 00:34:02,960
aggression appeared before affiliation you know maybe we

152
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:10,480
say doesn't sound great but hate hate predated love something like

153
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:17,679
this uh and so it's this very potent force in

154
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:29,440
us it's been conserved over forever you know and hatred breaths its own kind of

155
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:35,320
fundamentalism there's so much certainty in a mind that's mired in

156
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:43,799
hate it admits of no uh

157
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:51,320
nuance and um it's very it's a very seductive force

158
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:57,160
in the mind it's like well there what's the point there's hate everywhere I want I want in you know it feels like the

159
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:03,160
only way to respond and

160
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:09,240
uh yeah but if there's a point of our life

161
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:14,280
if there's a point of our life if there's a point of anything it it'll

162
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:21,720
involve love and

163
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:29,400
so here Faith inserts a measure of doubt doubt in the The View doubt in the view

164
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:35,560
forged by aversion we cultivate uh a faith

165
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:41,839
in love a faith in love a kind of trust

166
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:49,000
in its uh Redemptive power you know like where where else are

167
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,880
we going to look to redeem suffering and changing this and

168
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,920
finitude death like where else like where

169
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:07,400
else where else should we pray and so there's a kind of trust that

170
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:13,160
develops over time over the the months and years of practice that deep

171
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:18,359
happiness is utterly dependent

172
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:24,800
on on uh on love they're inextricably bound like

173
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:31,599
there there is there is no um closee hearted

174
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:36,800
happiness there's for sure Cloe hearted

175
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:43,359
pleasure there's closee hearted excitement but like deep

176
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:48,039
happiness that that that entails

177
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:56,359
open-heartedness and so uh maybe we say something like oh yeah

178
00:36:56,359 --> 00:37:04,520
love love love is somehow aligned with the architecture of our nervous

179
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:11,760
system uh yeah if we're to to be at peace it

180
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:20,640
will involve open-heartedness and so we have these like very Vivid repeated conscious

181
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:28,560
experiences of the dead end of anger the dead end of it

182
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:36,359
and of course of course like I acknowledge uh that anger sometimes has

183
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:41,480
uh something vitally important to tell us that some boundar has been crossed or

184
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:47,599
something can't be condoned some no the know of Love must be

185
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:54,920
issued I don't dispute that at all and for some people uh coming into anger

186
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:04,359
embodying that knowing it permitting it uh finding ways of expressing it this is

187
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:13,079
a critical kind of developmental milestone uh but whatever wisdom is

188
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:20,240
there in our anger in our aversion there's always a kernel of delusion

189
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:28,359
too and so how many times do do I need to feel regret about

190
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:37,359
my aversion to learn that it can't end well how many more times will I

191
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:42,720
need we become devoted faithful in

192
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:49,680
love we see the kind of confusion that must be nurtured to like stay fully

193
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:57,760
mired in Anger the the Buddha said that uh to see

194
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:03,319
causality conditionality is to see the dhma paa

195
00:39:03,319 --> 00:39:12,040
Samu uh the kind of conditionality uh of life everything

196
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:22,079
depending on everything else and to see this Patia Samu like

197
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:28,000
Patia samua is is [Music] incompatible

198
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:37,520
with hatred there's no no place to paint the

199
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:45,119
hate but paa is fully compatible with

200
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:53,160
love it's important to see in our anger we sort of like fail to

201
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:59,480
follow the the chain of like cause and effect

202
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:05,560
far enough we stop when it's convenient we like look and

203
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:11,079
yeah then we stop because we have the sense of like if we keep going if we

204
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:17,000
keep following causality if we keep investigating conditionality I'm going

205
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:25,000
to have to give up this anger and as practitioners we keep going

206
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:31,040
we keep going we we

207
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:39,040
don't get off the kind of train of Investigation where that maintains our

208
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:45,440
hate we keep going we develop a kind of faith in

209
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:51,280
love that some emotion emotion held with

210
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:59,240
wisdom terminates in love

211
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:06,160
emotion held with wisdom terminates in love we follow the thread of our emotional longing this happened that

212
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:13,000
happened I felt this sense that we follow we follow that thread and there's

213
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:19,280
a certain kind of trust that it terminates in

214
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:28,720
love Martha um npam said uh said our emotion life maps

215
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:35,079
are in completeness emotional life maps are in completeness and what she says like yeah

216
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:41,880
all of our emotion testifies to need all of our emotional life

217
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:49,040
announces human need and need in its own way is

218
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:57,280
innocent and so we we we develop this faith in love and we follow the kind of

219
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:06,160
emotional thread to its root we follow it to

220
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:14,960
innocence we practice in ourselves

221
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:22,160
consciously um sensing the dissipation of emotion the

222
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:28,319
end of a feeling the the sensation of of a

223
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:33,880
feeling and what what is left you know

224
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:39,440
what's left when feeling

225
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:44,760
dissolves the the lesson of that following

226
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:52,040
following the intensity the dissipation the ending of feeling the

227
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:58,200
the the following uh

228
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:04,160
never leads us to the conclusion of hate but

229
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:15,720
non-hate and a certain kind of Genius of the um the the brah of V Horas of of um

230
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:21,920
of kindness and compassion Joy equinity

231
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:27,640
um it's like we follow the thread of our

232
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:33,040
emotional intensity and it's like

233
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:42,720
uh our emotion terminates in one of the four Brahma voras terminates in one of

234
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:50,599
those and so we follow the thread we keep looking and

235
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:58,920
we uh have this trust have this trust if we look fearlessly

236
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:06,920
deeply this kind of profound attention if we look deeply

237
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:15,800
enough uh we don't land in hate we find ourself in in kindness compassion and

238
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:24,839
joy equinity and uh this Faith

239
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:33,119
um deepens and deep and begins to kind of cast a shadow over our

240
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:41,079
hate it's the thing we can remember even as we forget so much in the grips of

241
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:50,079
aversion of resentment of hatred uh the kind of shadow of uh of

242
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:56,040
Love is is there a faith we develop in love is

243
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:01,680
