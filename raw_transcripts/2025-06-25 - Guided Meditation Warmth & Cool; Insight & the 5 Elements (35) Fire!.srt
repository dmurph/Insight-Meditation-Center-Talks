1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,960
and welcome welcome everyone to

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,519
the series on the five elements and insight

3
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:21,439
very happy to be sharing these teachings with you this week and um I'd love to

4
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:28,320
have you either share with a friend now or later or in your heart what you've

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:36,160
noticed about practicing with fluidity water water element motion

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,280
in the last 24 hours

7
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,719
And as we're getting started

8
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,480
the invitation is to tune in again to your body

9
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,399
Perhaps taking a couple of longer slower breaths

10
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:15,640
Noticing the weight of your body on the cushion or chair

11
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,560
Feeling a sense of being grounded

12
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,079
Then allowing the breathing to be natural

13
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:52,039
and feeling into moisture on the skin

14
00:01:52,240 --> 00:02:00,200
perhaps in your mouth in your breath moisture or dryness

15
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:10,959
And inviting the mind the heart to bring awareness of this

16
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,480
moment to the forefront

17
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,400
Feeling

18
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,239
into a sense of warmth or cool

19
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,920
Heat in the body Maybe coolness of the air on your skin

20
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,680
Maybe warmth of the sun or coolness of a cloudy day

21
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:05,560
Just checking in and in general

22
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,280
feeling into the change the shift

23
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,319
the flowing nature of all of these sensations

24
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,599
attuning more closely perhaps to the motion movement

25
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:51,480
of the breath If that's your anchor

26
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,200
or the overall flow of sensation

27
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:07,640
coming and going throughout the whole body

28
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:22,120
inviting the heart to rest the mind to settle

29
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,000
in this embodied moment

30
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,479
tuning in also to any resonance of warmth

31
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,479
or coolness in the mind and heart

32
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,800
Noticing without judgment any agitation

33
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:31,639
Meeting that with the warmth of kindness and compassion

34
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:43,879
Allowing mental activity to cool to calm

35
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:54,199
As you allow awareness to move inward and downward

36
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,080
settling into the body

37
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,120
feeling into the warmth vitality

38
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,039
of this body

39
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,560
One breath at a time

40
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,360
Almost practice in silence for a while

41
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,000
From time to time reconnecting

42
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,240
with the felt sensations of aliveness

43
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,000
The warmness or the cool

44
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,040
the weight or lightness

45
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,200
fluidity or stillness

46
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:53,960
In the last remaining moments of this formal meditation together

47
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:02,039
Imitation is to open up the aperture of awareness

48
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:13,080
Allowing all of present moment experience

49
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,200
to be included within it

50
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,559
Just moving through

51
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:42,120
And as we bring this meditation to a close

52
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:49,679
considering for yourself any

53
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:55,159
moments of goodness connection

54
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,679
presence or peace in In this meditation

55
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:15,640
letting them nourish your heart and practice

56
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:24,200
And then turning your attention and intentions

57
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:31,480
outwards towards all the others your life touches directly and indirectly

58
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:41,158
Cultivating the wish that they may benefit

59
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:48,400
That the benefits of our practice here together ripple out

60
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:54,559
to all of the lives we touch and all of the lives they touch outwards

61
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,880
and outwards

62
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:09,440
May all beings be safe happy

63
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,480
peaceful and free And may our practice here together be a

64
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:20,080
cause and condition for greater love liberation and peace in

65
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,240
the world

66
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:36,599
[Music]

67
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:45,239
[Music]

68
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,360
Thank you for your practice

69
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:51,600
So today we are picking up on the third in a five-part series on

70
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:58,399
practicing with the elements in support of insight The five elements

71
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:07,120
those are earth water fire air and space And today we are on fire

72
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:12,159
So um and continue this exploration both in

73
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:19,679
terms of contemplation that's intentional consideration of these um

74
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:26,720
qualities of experience and how um the Buddha framed them talked

75
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:34,000
about them in the ancient teachings and direct experience of the quality of fire

76
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,480
element which I'll talk about in a moment in our own practice And then I'll drop in a little bit about um some of

77
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:49,000
the inspirations that he offered um both for fire and for fire going out

78
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:56,559
So that's where we're going And first to say the direct experience

79
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:03,520
of fire element it's very simple Sensations of warmth or cool or even hot

80
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:09,360
or cold And the function whether it's in our

81
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:17,919
core of our bodies or the earth's molten core or in a campfire is to heat

82
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:24,720
Simple right So noticing shifting and changing

83
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:31,679
sensations like we went over in the meditation of hot or cold warmth or cool

84
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:37,760
can be one more set of embodied experiences

85
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:44,840
that can highlight the sense of nature and constancy change

86
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:52,640
And it can be interesting to notice other conditions including external humidity or dryness or our

87
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:58,240
internal emotional and mental perceptions and filters impact even

88
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:04,720
something as basic as how we perceive heat or cool

89
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:12,399
I was just camping on a retreat and um it was really interesting to notice that

90
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:20,159
over the course of the week my tolerance for cool because there were some quite cold nights We were at altitude went up

91
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:28,000
and um that would have felt what would have felt uncomfortably cool here in Santa Cruz felt just fine there And the

92
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,440
perception of heat also shifted over the course of the retreat

93
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:40,240
And in part that's true because not just of acclimatization in our bodies but how

94
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:48,240
our minds relate So if one is agitated for example

95
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:55,519
much more likely to feel warmer perhaps even more bothered There's that term of course hot

96
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:00,960
and bothered right this is duka

97
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:08,320
However if one is very calm can be likely to feel cooler even in the

98
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:15,360
exact same external temperature Equinimity

99
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:24,000
not agitated either way There's a kind of an internal coolness that's more of a a mental quality that allows for shifts

100
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:31,559
and changes without getting caught up bothered or overly attached

101
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:37,279
In terms of contemplation the ancient teachings have a number of

102
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:43,200
simileies and idioms about fire both in terms of helpful qualities and unhelpful

103
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,799
qualities There are far too many to unpack in a

104
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:57,760
short little talk like this but I'll just touch on a few of the more important ones in sense of the tradition

105
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:05,360
So many many of the Buddha's simileies and metaphors associate fire with unhelpful qualities

106
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:10,720
The Buddha likened holding resentment towards others like picking up a hot

107
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:17,440
coal and holding it on holding on to it hoping that they will get burned

108
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:25,118
Doesn't work does it Also in his famous fire sermon

109
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:32,800
the Buddha said "All is burning." All is burning And in that he was referring to

110
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:41,839
all of our senses burning with greed or lust hatred and delusion

111
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:48,480
As I mentioned Monday this picks up on the Buddha was a

112
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:55,839
brilliant reframer and um repurposer of the cultural soup within which he lived

113
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:01,280
in ancient India and the um upanishads which emerged before the Buddhist time

114
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,960
and continued to be spoken recorded perhaps during his time We're not sure

115
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:14,880
because all of this was ancient and quite oral oral history But in the upanishads natural elements

116
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:23,119
like fire were considered qualities or potentialities imbued with life

117
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:28,960
So especially for example when fire was provoked

118
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:36,720
agitated it ignited And these same exact words for anger

119
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:42,320
that were used in the upupanachads were used in the Buddha's teachings And

120
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:48,000
they didn't just talk about the physical igniting

121
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:55,040
They spoke to the emotional resonances emotional processes

122
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:01,599
Today we use similar expressions burning with rage right

123
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:07,359
A mature practitioner an awakened person

124
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:14,000
they are released from this kind of burning by a cooling an inner cooling of

125
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:22,400
disenchantment Disenchantment with being drawn into the stories the myasma of reactivity

126
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,720
based on greed hatred and delusion based on

127
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:36,480
senses and ideas The ideas that come from what comes

128
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:43,200
through our senses The Buddha taught that letting go of

129
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:51,440
clinging also releases the fires of greed or hatred or delusion

130
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:57,280
And I personally think it's fascinating that the word for clinging and the word

131
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:05,240
for fuel for a fire are the same ancient word Upana

132
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:17,119
So what that means letting go and check it out for yourself Letting go of some obsessive want or grudge

133
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:24,320
releases dissolves reactivity And when someone completely frees their

134
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:31,280
mind the fires of greed hatred and delusion are released

135
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:37,400
blown out nibban or nirvana

136
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:46,000
There was an illusion to this in the poem that I read at the end of the first talk in this series and I'll just read

137
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,599
the very end of it This is from Patachara and it's based on

138
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:56,800
the terriata the awakening songs of the first women who practiced with the

139
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:02,640
Buddha I let my mind go and it flowed downhill

140
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:10,079
with the water toward my little hut I went inside sat on the bed and lowered

141
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:19,560
the wick of the lamp all by itself The flame went out

142
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:31,359
So fire released or as Tanisro calls it fire unbound

143
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:38,320
is one of the most important simileies for fully waking up for not burning with

144
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:47,599
reactivity And at times the Buddha's teachings he

145
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:57,839
used simileies to help communicate helpful qualities too simileies about fire that communicated helpful qualities

146
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:05,920
In fact the ancient tradition likens the eye remember we're back in the Bronze Age here the eye to a fire stick And

147
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:12,800
there's actually kind of a detailed anatomy that isn't that far off if you think of what they had available to them

148
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:22,880
about how fire and the eye are linked to sight to vision to light to clarity

149
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:30,400
And this gets picked up on in the later traditions because fires after all they don't just

150
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:36,079
emit heat they also radiate light

151
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:43,280
So this is my fanciful riff on fire element combined with water element

152
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:52,240
that heat plus water brings steam capacity and power

153
00:39:52,240 --> 00:40:00,000
Light plus water can bring the beauty of shimmering waves or the breathtaking

154
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:09,359
moment of a rainbow on a metaphorical emotional level

155
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:17,240
We can connect with the warmth of care the heat of determination

156
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:26,160
And the Buddha advised his son Rahula to make his meditation like fire Anything

157
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:32,880
bad or disgusting thrown into fire is simply used as fuel burned up

158
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:39,760
You said if you make your meditation like fire agreeable and disagreeable things will

159
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,680
not invade the mind and remain

160
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:52,720
For me this teaching demonstrates that even the most unwanted experiences

161
00:40:52,720 --> 00:41:00,560
can be fuel for awakening and that one kind of fire meditative fire can contain

162
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:08,760
the damage of the other of reactivity Kind of like a controlled burn

163
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:16,800
So to recap practicing with meditating on the sensations of hot and cold heat and

164
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,839
warmth and our relationship to those sensations

165
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:27,040
can help open us up to the perception of an constancy

166
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:32,560
and how our minds and hearts can shift

167
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:39,200
our relationship to experience including our relationship

168
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:44,720
to reactivity and to inconstancy itself

169
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:50,960
Noticing any clinging for or against coming through our senses is a first

170
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:57,760
step towards shifting from burning reactivity to coolness

171
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:05,200
and eventually to freedom So thank you for your kind attention And

172
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:11,119
your assignment should you choose to accept it over the next 24 hours is to

173
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:16,240
notice heat and coolness in your own direct experience and how you're

174
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:23,040
relating to it based on your own state in that moment

175
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:28,160
And for extra credit notice moments of clinging and reactivity

176
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:35,440
and moments where the clarity of light awareness emerges

177
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:43,000
Thank you so much for your attention Look forward to being back with you tomorrow
