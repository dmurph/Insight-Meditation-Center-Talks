1
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:13,360
so now does it seem to be seen the videos working and

2
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,320
takes a moment for you to reply to the sound being here

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,279
i found a setting where i could increase the bit rate which seems to be what

4
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:31,439
youtube's saying was not strong enough i doubled it so

5
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,680
hopefully now it says the stream is strong so

6
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,239
so here we are

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,000
so we'll sit mostly quietly today but i do want to emphasize the role

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
of recognition and imagine that you're maybe that

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,600
you're sitting in your usual way and but that imagine that it's

10
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,119
um as if you're in an easy chair or in leaning against an oak tree

11
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:24,320
looking at a river or pastoral scene and you're at ease and content and happy settling back

12
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:32,159
and in the subtle back you're observing you're just allowing what's happening to appear for you

13
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,200
no reaching out no trying to figure anything out no trying to make anything happen

14
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:44,000
just settling back and letting everything just resp come to you and show itself to you

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,560
and your awareness your is open your eyesight is receptive your hearing is receptive

16
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,759
all the perceptions all doors are open to receive

17
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:02,000
and then in the most easy way possible relax almost as if it's from the

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,679
deep inner place of relaxation of ease but with a little bit of

19
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,720
clarity use a single word

20
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,640
to recognize what it is that's arising in awareness

21
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:29,599
no hurry but just an irregular kind of stream for recognition a thought

22
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:37,280
body sensation sound inhale just very simple in this kind of

23
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:47,040
relate back way and the recognition is a little bit the the the tether to the present moment

24
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:54,300
so you don't wander off just you stay there you stay there [Music]

25
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:05,840
so let's um sit that way quietly and we'll find our way

26
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,200
and then as we come to the end of this

27
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:51,679
sitting one way or another

28
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,679
we have a

29
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:04,400
connection a relationship to other beings other living beings other

30
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:12,159
people some people we know

31
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:20,480
we know of but there are plenty of people who are important for our lives and our

32
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,799
lives are cared for who we don't know and will never know

33
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:35,679
but the circles of people who do things that support our lives the circle of

34
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,919
living life on this planet that keeps us

35
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:46,880
alive is in some kind of way

36
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:54,720
part of us inseparable and one of the ways to

37
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:02,400
care for ourselves is to care for all these people all these beings

38
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:10,240
and one of the ways to care for all these beings is to care for ourselves

39
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:19,360
and a way to do both simultaneously is to sit quietly

40
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:28,720
with good will in all directions good will towards oneself good wills to

41
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:35,280
the world simply a radiance of goodwill circles

42
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,840
of goodwill that spread from us

43
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,760
turns out that having good will is one of the best

44
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,919
nourishments we can offer ourselves

45
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:58,879
and may each of us start our day or continue our day end our day wherever you are

46
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:10,720
remembering that you have a capacity for goodwill for well-wishing for kindness

47
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:18,720
and as we go forth from this meditation may we go forth with a wish that all

48
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:25,600
beings be happy that all beings be safe

49
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:35,840
that all beings be peaceful and that all beings be free

50
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:49,840
may we benefit from this wish as much as others do

51
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,710
[Music]

52
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:06,720
so to continue these thoughts on these talks on some pagana clear

53
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:15,360
comprehension or clear recognition and um i love this particular word

54
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:23,840
because of how it overlaps with the simplicity of mindfulness practice just simple recognize how things are

55
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,080
and the richness of a contemplative life a life that's lived

56
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:36,720
reflectively and both have a role and a place in our lives

57
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:42,720
there are times where i thought that the way that buddhist meditation has been taught in

58
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,880
the west especially in vipassana sometimes in the zen world i have the sense that

59
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,400
there's such a strong emphasis on non-discursive awareness

60
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:01,679
simply being aware the simplest possible way and letting go of thoughts and that

61
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:07,520
there's a as people get that message that they're not supposed to be thinking at all

62
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,720
and certainly in meditation it's helpful to quiet the thinking mind and have

63
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,400
become really quiet maybe still but for a wider life

64
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,880
there is a time for a quiet mind a still mind and there's a time for

65
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,240
reflection and contemplation and i think of a reflective life is one

66
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,520
that it can become when i use the word contemplative as a

67
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,559
life of reflection deep reflection i associate very much with calm

68
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:47,279
calm reflection uh considering thinking about our lives and pondering and in a way

69
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:54,559
that uh is just it's intimate and and cozy and nice just to do to be

70
00:23:54,559 --> 00:24:00,320
engaged and reflect contemplation the nature of our life what we're up to

71
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:06,159
and so this clear comprehension uh both these areas quiet kind of

72
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:14,080
non-discursive awareness and then also this contemplative life in a sense

73
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:20,080
and so the first yesterday was of the four kinds of uh clear

74
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:26,480
comprehension is clear comprehension of purpose why we're doing something and the second

75
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:32,640
is a clear comprehension of of

76
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:38,480
suitability of what's appropriate how to engage in something what actions

77
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:46,000
what behavior what ways of thinking perhaps that are suitable for the purpose we have

78
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,120
and uh it's um you know there's this analogy that if

79
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:57,520
you try to squeeze oil out of gravel uh you won't

80
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:03,679
it won't work if you want oil you have to take you know olives or sesame seeds or

81
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:10,159
something and really squeeze them to get the oil out and so in the same way so we have to kind of

82
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:16,960
know what's suitable for the purposes we have so if you're trying to

83
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,080
become kinder and you do it through

84
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:30,159
aggressive straining it's kind of like trying to squeeze oil out of the gravel we have to kind of

85
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:35,279
find the suitable way to be or what the right approach for something

86
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:40,480
and i think this reflection on suitability what's right for me

87
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:47,440
what's the way that i can do whatever i've set my mind on uh given my weaknesses and my strengths

88
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:54,640
given my interest giving given what uh nourishes me and benefits me and given what the situation

89
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,240
requires what's needed in the situation what's suitable what's the right thing to do

90
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:07,279
and and so it's a life of reflection and questioning suitability

91
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:13,279
as opposed to looking for a policy looking for what is the right way to do

92
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:18,320
something maybe if i just get the manual and just follow it like you know meditation by

93
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:26,559
the numbers or buddhism by the numbers you know one two three four five and just um but uh but it's uh

94
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:31,919
it's not something wrote it's not something there's a fixed way that we should do things

95
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:38,799
but rather if we do things as is appropriate for the circumstance of who we are and the situation and so

96
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:46,480
being reflected about suitability what's the right way to do this so if the uh one's purpose

97
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:52,559
is to follow the buddhist path to greater and greater

98
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:58,559
forms of liberation freedom to follow the buddhist path to really kind of clarify and

99
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:05,360
and and and bring it to an end our suffering we can ask

100
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:13,600
that that's a great purpose now what's suitable for this um if it's uh if we spend a lot of time

101
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:19,520
uh watching movies on our computer uh and we justify i need to relax i need

102
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,559
to relax so that i can you know get on with buddhist practice

103
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:31,440
but if we spend an inordinate amount of time doing this relaxing watching watching movies

104
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:37,919
it probably is not suitable for the purposes of becoming free of suffering it might give relief from some of the

105
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:43,919
suffering but it doesn't really get to the bottom of it and really penetrate it and so what do you do in your daily life

106
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:49,039
what are the activities you're involved in which are suitable for the purpose you

107
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:54,480
have and which are not if your purpose you have uh is you know

108
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:02,399
one of many things you're doing and you've slide it in here and there and then the idea of suitability

109
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:07,520
varies but if your idea of what your purpose of life is is

110
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,960
really like this is what central orientation the central thing i want my life to be about

111
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:19,360
nothing else matters or say it differently everything matters but everything has to

112
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:24,880
matter through the lens of my dedication to living a life of freedom

113
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:32,080
my dedication to living a life of compassion and care and that that's the purpose of my life

114
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:38,880
and so what's suitable is to you know what would be suited what's a suitable way to express that and live that in my

115
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:46,320
life and do i infuse everything i do with those qualities or do i limit what i do and only do

116
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:53,360
those things that are really for that purpose and and it's possible to live a life

117
00:28:53,360 --> 00:29:00,559
that everything we do is organized around the principle of compassion or care for self and others everything's

118
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:06,080
organized around the principle or the purpose of to becoming free of suffering and

119
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:13,279
and to have the flourishing of wholesome states within not in a selfish way a hedonistic way

120
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:18,559
but because this is really beneficial for self and other it's better than the alternative

121
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:26,000
to keep suffering and being contracted and stressed and and if we're really clear about

122
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,960
having a central purpose like that then um uh and then what's suitable to support

123
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:39,679
that what's it what do we what can we how can we live our life then in a way that we clearly see and reflect that this is

124
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:45,440
the way that supports what i'm trying to do in my life and leads me to further and further along this path

125
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,880
like this and and perhaps there are things you we in

126
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:57,200
that kind of contemplation we realize well this is not suitable this is not helping me this is kind of a waste of

127
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:03,840
time and this life of ours is quite precious and we don't have that much time to be alive

128
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,960
and and time goes by quickly so i might as well do the things that are

129
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:15,520
most meaningful most purposeful uh including uh if we

130
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:21,919
understand the path of liberation is um to enter into like meditation where we

131
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:28,000
let go of the preoccupation with meaning the preoccupation with purpose

132
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,840
because we have it and it's there to really sit and be present for our experience in a deep intimate

133
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:42,240
way so suitability uh what is suitable

134
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:48,480
and and that also involves in our work life our social life

135
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:55,679
and there's a way that uh in zen practice sometimes they um ask a question that's i'd relate to

136
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,880
the suitability um and it's i think it's a beautiful question

137
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:08,640
to a way to go through one's life and that is um what's their request here what are we

138
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:16,960
being asked so if um i mean even in inanimate objects things

139
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:23,760
there's a feeling in zen what is being asked for here what's the request so rather than coming from our desires

140
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:31,039
our wishes our um what we want uh and asserting ourselves on others and

141
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:38,000
in the world it's rather what is the what is suitable in this situation what's the appropriate

142
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:47,679
response in this situation what is the request of this situation and so as uh i remember a very uh

143
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:55,200
tiny little event that happened you know 45 years ago or so um

144
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:03,440
i was kind of a just getting interested in zen and i went to the los angeles zen center

145
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:09,519
i was in l.a and i just went there for an evening i think there was maybe a some meditation and a dharma talk and so

146
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:15,279
there were two sessions of meditation and then in between we did the slow kinhean the slow walking meditation

147
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:22,320
around this small kind of a living room where everyone was meditating and people

148
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:28,320
are meditating on these black meditation um

149
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:35,279
futons these little uh it's called zabutans these mats and um

150
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:40,840
and the person in front of me uh was walking slowly in front of me and i was walking slowly

151
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:46,640
behind and and i saw the person bend down to

152
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:52,880
straighten out one of those black meditation mats it was slightly gotten crooked and you know they're all kind of

153
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:58,240
lined up kind of nicely and i thought that was bizarre why would one care enough to

154
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:04,880
you know straighten out the mat you know and and uh it made a big impression on me that that kind of attention to detail

155
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:10,159
and and i imagine that uh if if you ask what's the request

156
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:16,080
here uh what's being asked in this situation uh what's being asked is to straighten

157
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,279
the mat slightly so exactly where the request is coming from uh

158
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:27,200
you know it's probably somewhat from our own inner sensibilities understanding the

159
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,480
situation and projected onto the scene of our what what how it is to be a human

160
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,600
being there but it's still coming from someplace deeper than just me myself and mine what

161
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:44,480
i want and and so what is being asked of me in this situation

162
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:51,760
and and finding a way forward so suitability having a sense of purpose

163
00:33:51,760 --> 00:34:00,480
and knowing what's suitable for that purpose is part of this uh clear comprehension

164
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,600
a reflective life and so one of the things you might try doing

165
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,638
for the next uh 24 hours is to reflect a little bit about not

166
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,679
only your purpose uh in the things that you do but also uh

167
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:21,118
the suitability this is it uh appropriateness or the

168
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:26,398
uh the um

169
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:33,599
how supportive it is the things that you do through the day are they suitable for your purpose are

170
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:40,878
they supportive of some bigger purpose and value that you have and uh and in this kind of reflection do

171
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:48,560
you benefit as a result is it nice for you is it supportive for you is it suitable um

172
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:58,960
so thank you very much and continue here tomorrow
