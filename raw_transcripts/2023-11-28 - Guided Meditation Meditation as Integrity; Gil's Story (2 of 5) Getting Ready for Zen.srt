1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:10,679
Welcome to our meditation together

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:18,480
and I'd like this uh meditation to be about something that I've in the past

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,680
have called Integrity but not necessarily the modern

4
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:30,880
understanding of that of uh of maybe ethical Integrity but doesn't exclude it

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,760
but Integrity kind of like uh being whole everything coming together into a

6
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:44,879
one and we have the uh possibility of each of us of sitting

7
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,399
quietly and relaxing all the ways that we live

8
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,760
divided fragmented and having an experience of ourselves as being

9
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:05,600
whole and uh and and being whole comes with maybe a feeling of being at home of

10
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,799
a deep belonging here belonging here in this universe there's nothing that

11
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,560
undermines our sense of place and sense of of

12
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:23,040
um you know um nothing undermines

13
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:30,400
Us and how this wholeness can be found is not by convincing our elves

14
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:39,360
that we're whole or that argue the point it's uh it's easy enough to use logic to

15
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,240
come to all kinds of different conclusions in this regard but rather uh to discover what

16
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,360
happens when we are no longer seeing our

17
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,439
life seeing ourselves through the lens of our Concepts and

18
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,520
ideas when the thinking mind quiets when the thinking mind is no

19
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:11,280
longer the dominant filter through which we know experience

20
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,480
ourselves the thinking mind is uh often

21
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,640
fragmented uh if we're caught up in preoccupations then that itself is a

22
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,760
fragmentation because it leaves so much of ourselves out if we're hyperfocused

23
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,599
on one particular thing and if what the the preoccupation has to do is about

24
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:40,760
ourselves that there's something wrong with us or with our problems not to diminish the fact that

25
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:47,239
we have challenges in our life but to be preoccupied with it um limits the full

26
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:53,159
scope of what we take in the full scope of all that we

27
00:02:53,159 --> 00:03:00,599
are and so there we're fragmented we're divided and so as we meditate uh to

28
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:06,239
begin quieting relaxing

29
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,640
settling so that we can appreciate how we

30
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:19,040
are when we don't have words ideas

31
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:27,599
images that in any kind of way limits us any kind of way undermines

32
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:35,959
Us in any kind of way uh puts us uh in conflict with part of who we

33
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:43,280
are there's the good part and the bad part and

34
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:51,799
um and so conceit self- preoccupation are all ways of being

35
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:57,599
fragmented of being divided so with that as an introduction

36
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:06,920
we'll meditate and assuming a relaxed alert

37
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:14,000
posture that's the right posture for you and so the idea is to enter

38
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,079
into your body and feel it from the inside out and make the

39
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:26,360
adjustments that allow your body to relax the

40
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:33,759
most but it also allows the body to have a certain degree of

41
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:37,759
Vitality

42
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:50,680
alertness if we have a posture that only expresses

43
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:59,240
relaxation we might be missing out on the deeper kind of relaxation that

44
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:06,280
can only only happen if we also have a degree of

45
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:12,680
alertness alert clear

46
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:23,160
present lowering your gaze and perhaps closing your

47
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:33,919
eyes many of the tensions We Carry in our body are a

48
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,240
byproduct of the ways that we

49
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:44,280
think the force that's behind how we

50
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:56,039
think and to gently relax the

51
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,479
body without

52
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:10,080
ambition without any ill

53
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,880
will gently

54
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:23,639
lovingly feel your body and as you exhale

55
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:36,000
relax relaxing into

56
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,919
the pull of the pull of

57
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:07,000
gravity and is there any way that your force of your

58
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:14,560
thinking is impacting your physical experience in your

59
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
body

60
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,879
maybe there's pressure or tension in the head in the forehead or the

61
00:07:53,879 --> 00:08:00,280
eyes in the area of the brain as you exhale

62
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:05,560
exhale let that soften

63
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:20,159
relax perhaps a g gentling of whatever force is behind

64
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
thinking

65
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:53,200
and if it's easy enough to do as you

66
00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:01,680
exhale let go of your thinking let whatever

67
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:09,560
topic theme that you're thinking about it let it Drift Away fade

68
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:17,440
away so that the end of the exhale there's a moment or so of where

69
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,920
you can tune in to the absence of

70
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:30,040
thinking and in that absence of thinking

71
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:37,680
take in the whole of your experience Here and

72
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
Now

73
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
for

74
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
for

75
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
for

76
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,639
beyond the edges of your thinking

77
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:39,320
is an experience of wholeness an experience where there's no

78
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:43,759
divisions no

79
00:12:52,240 --> 00:13:00,839
fragmentation a wholeness that includes thinking

80
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:13,639
but doesn't believe that thinking this is the whole story it's just

81
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,519
thoughts in the

82
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:34,079
vastness of the wholeness we experience by opening

83
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,720
up all our

84
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
senses

85
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
for

86
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
for

87
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
for

88
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
for

89
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
for

90
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:34,320
for you might try

91
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,159
feeling the pull into the world of

92
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,720
thinking the glue or the

93
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:51,000
gravitational pull into it the stickiness of

94
00:17:53,480 --> 00:18:00,120
thinking and then feel your way beyond that edges of that pull

95
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:07,360
a wider sense of how awareness doesn't have to be collapsed into

96
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:17,679
thoughts but the awareness that is beyond the edges of thoughts

97
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:24,480
ideas impulses that

98
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:30,320
includes it all within its sphere

99
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
for

100
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
for

101
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
e

102
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
e

103
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
e

104
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
e

105
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
for

106
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,760
any thought you have any idea

107
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:24,760
that sees you in any way less than whole any way less than

108
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:33,400
beautiful finish that thought thought and end it with not

109
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,919
so not

110
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
so

111
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
e

112
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
for

113
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
e

114
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
for

115
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
e

116
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,600
for

117
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,000
and then as we come to the end of this

118
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:36,399
sitting to relax as you exhale to settle into your body more

119
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,399
fully and feel any of the ways that you might be a

120
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:49,039
little bit more settled or calm in your

121
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:57,679
body and if not in your body may be in your heart if you're not in your heart

122
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,760
perhaps the in the

123
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:17,000
mind and when we are relaxed in the mind the heart the

124
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,320
body then we belong to

125
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:29,240
ourselves we're here in a way that

126
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:35,240
is inclusive and allowing and

127
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,440
friendly when we're at ease it's easier to

128
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:56,399
avoid believing the thoughts that undermine

129
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:02,519
us that limit

130
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:10,519
us and as we come to the end of the sitting we could also consider

131
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:17,600
how we might be with others in a relaxed way as

132
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:25,200
well so that our thoughts about them do not limit

133
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,320
them

134
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,799
do not diminish them or undermine them in any

135
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:56,320
way let us meet other people so we can see their

136
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:03,480
wholeness even if they can't if we can see

137
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:12,120
them as part of the whole of this life is if they too belong

138
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:17,440
here and are respected as

139
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:26,240
such May our relaxed gaze look upon

140
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:33,360
everyone as whole human beings and as such we offer them our

141
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:41,080
Good Will May all beings be

142
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:47,559
happy may all beings be

143
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:52,240
safe may all beings be

144
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:58,880
peaceful may all beings be free

145
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:08,000
and may all beings experience their wholeness no parts left

146
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:22,719
[Music]

147
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,200
out thank

148
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,159
you

149
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:19,880
so hello to the second talk about my Dharma

150
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,919
life and how I came into it and

151
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:33,159
began so my interest in Buddhism began in college but it was more I would say

152
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:41,039
an intellectual interest at least the extent of which I engaged in it but a few things happened then at the

153
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:46,960
end of college I did take got interested in meditation not the end of college end

154
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:54,000
of my second year and I took a class on um a class I took I was initiated into TM

155
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,240
Transcendental Meditation and received received the Mantra and began meditating 20 minutes a

156
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:06,960
day and um I did that for 2 or 3 months and I felt quite calm with it it was

157
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:14,159
really nice um and then um come the end of

158
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:20,399
the the school year I decided to drop out of college I was happy enough being

159
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:27,519
there but I didn't find after two years of being there a passion for any particular subject to to study and I

160
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:33,880
thought well this is too important uh to get a college degree to go to study in college should I should only do it if I

161
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:39,679
had a passion for something and since I didn't I dropped out of college and um

162
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:47,600
and that was relatively common back then dropping out was a kind of expression dropping out of society

163
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:55,320
and and uh so I dropped out of college and um that summer I had the opportunity to

164
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:01,159
crew on a sale boat across the Atlantic and I spent probably six weeks or seven

165
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:10,320
weeks on the boat and um it was uh amazing experience to be away from um

166
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:16,480
Society away from the business and doings of school and college and all

167
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:25,200
everything and to spend long hours on uh at the Helm of the boat the um um my my

168
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:32,398
favorite was doing it in the middle of the night to be in the middle of the Atlantic um with all the amazing stars

169
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:38,320
and um kind of a certain peacefulness and being far away from everything and

170
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:44,240
feeling kind of the danger of just a few feet away if I fell in the water no one

171
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:49,679
would ever find me and the boat would just kind of sail

172
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:56,520
along and um and I uh something settled in me in the course of that sail trip

173
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:03,240
and I I felt kind of uh I decided at the beginning of that trip that um there was

174
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:09,760
nothing wrong with having a fantasy life and uh I was disinclined to censor

175
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:16,280
myself in any way and the fascinating thing that happened was that uh at the

176
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:21,839
helm we we didn't have um Auto ster back then so we had to kind of be at the

177
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:26,960
wheel of the boat um uh all the time and

178
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:33,160
and um and so every few seconds you know constantly you're checking it's like driving a car in the freeway but a

179
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:40,599
little bit more D dramatic uh you're constantly kind of checking the sails checking the waves checking the compass

180
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:45,920
to see if the boat's off course a little bit and then uh adjusting and constantly

181
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:52,160
adjusting and and you can't take your attention off very long and um there

182
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:58,359
were big waves coming from behind on the sailboat so if you weren't paying attention those w waves could would uh

183
00:35:58,359 --> 00:36:05,480
cause major problems for the boat and um and uh but at the same time I let my

184
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:11,880
thoughts be free my fantasy Go Go free and the combination of giving my mind

185
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:18,800
freedom to do whatever at once and coming back every second every couple of seconds to the present moment proved to

186
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,920
be a wonderful recipe for getting settled and peaceful and by the end of

187
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:30,280
this trip across the Atlantic I was actually quite exca and uh but this combination of this

188
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:37,400
inner freedom and staying present became a guide when I eventually started doing Zen practice for how to

189
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:45,720
practice um so I did I was quite ecstatic and I even had the thought I'll never de never be depressed again and

190
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:51,960
then uh I dropped out of college I moved to Berkeley and try to find my way in life and figure out what to do and find

191
00:36:51,960 --> 00:37:01,480
work and uh things proved difficult during that time I couldn't find work I had no skills and um I didn't know how

192
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:08,440
and and um and I got more depressed and that ever been in my life before but

193
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:13,560
what happened there in that uh there's a book a bookstore called Cody book store

194
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:21,319
Telegraph Avenue and I found a magazine or kind of a magazine like

195
00:37:21,319 --> 00:37:28,599
booklet about a very large Comm excuse me

196
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:36,440
about a very about a very large commune hippie commune in Tennessee it

197
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:44,280
was the largest hippie commun in the United States at the time this was 1974 uh it had 700 people living there

198
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:52,520
and um it had its Genesis in hat Ashbury and LSD and psychedelics and the teacher

199
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:58,480
of it his main um one of his teachers was Alti and the other was the Zen

200
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:05,119
master Suzuki rushi and um so I saw this place and I thought well that's interesting I'd

201
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:13,920
interested maybe stopping by and coincidentally what happened for that uh in the January of that year I

202
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:19,760
had the occasion to take a Greyhound bus across the country and I stopped in I

203
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:28,560
think it was Memphis and took a local bus down to the this called the farm and um and what I encountered there

204
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:35,000
and some changed my life two things I encountered one was um

205
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:43,480
you know this community had been based on you know LSD that was that was a spiritual practice was taking LSD and um

206
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:48,640
and they had a lot of Integrity in doing it and but they had gotten arrested in

207
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:54,640
Tennessee because that Tennessee you couldn't do that uh and so the founder and a few of the leaders of the

208
00:38:54,640 --> 00:39:00,440
community were in jail when I got there and they had looked for another practice

209
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:07,200
uh what could they do that was legal in Tennessee that as as valuable as LSD for

210
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:14,119
the spiritual connection is a profound way of being and what they had found was

211
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:20,760
honesty and I'd never been in a community of people who were so honest and who had the capacity to stop

212
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:26,839
whenever there was any social tension any kind of tension at all their practice was to stop and have a

213
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:33,839
conversation about that tension and what was going on until there was real honesty and someone really understood

214
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:39,640
deeply about themselves and what they were doing and I could watch these conversations and the honesty in which

215
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:45,200
people practiced and it was so inspired and um and was inspired by how

216
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:52,000
they got really good at it and they got skilled at having these conversations so after a while some people could do them

217
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,720
very quickly uh initially it would take a long time to have these conversations but they always stopped that was our

218
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:04,200
practice this inspired me to no end uh this idea that people can be practice

219
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:10,359
this kind of honesty and the second thing that happened there was um the kind of the

220
00:40:10,359 --> 00:40:16,240
Bible of this large commune was the book Zen my beginners mind that had only come

221
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:22,079
out a couple years before it was the Zen teachings of this Zen Masters shrio

222
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:29,440
Suzuki rushi the founder of San Francisco Zen Center and that blew me away because as I read this book I had

223
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:35,000
this distinct feeling that um he was saying things that I knew but didn't

224
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,040
really know consciously like was this recognition oh yes oh yes oh yes as I

225
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:48,920
read this book and it seemed to me the book talked a lot about zazen meditation Zen

226
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:54,119
meditation and um so I was but we didn't do much meditation at on the farm we did

227
00:40:54,119 --> 00:41:00,839
a lot of work had a lot of truth telling and um and the other thing it

228
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:08,599
was a a large community of kind of overall uh middle class uh White

229
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:15,920
American hippies and um I was one of them more or less and so in some ways I felt very

230
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,040
comfortable there but because I grew up quite a bit in Europe I had a

231
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:26,800
Cosmopolitan upbringing I changed schools 12 times in the first 12 years of

232
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:32,400
growing up sometimes going back to the same school but um uh you know Europe I

233
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:38,640
lived in Italy and Switzerland and Norway and United States um uh I think

234
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:45,760
because of that experience I felt very cautious about homogeneity and I felt that uh being

235
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:53,119
around a whole bunch of people who are just like me was not a safe thing to do that I would kind of be we all be caught

236
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:59,119
up in the same delusions the same kind of way of thinking so because of that I

237
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:05,640
left and um and uh the

238
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:12,200
um I left and went to um and when I left uh soon thereafter I went to check out

239
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:18,720
to San Francisco Zen Center and I showed up there and was kind of impressed and

240
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:25,800
wanted to come back and then I came back to be there for two weeks as a guest student and uh something in me kind of

241
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:33,920
felt that home this is the practice I want to do and um and uh and there was a kind of

242
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:41,960
clarity around it but you know I was I think I was 20 maybe

243
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:48,880
21 21 and I felt it's too early for me to

244
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:55,119
um make this kind of decision and I have to go up back to Norway where I was

245
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:02,119
still a Norwegian citizen that was my home country and I had to go back to Norway to uh figure out my relationship

246
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:08,160
to my this home country and what I was going to do in relationship to it and and so I felt like I had some things to

247
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,920
take care of first before I can decide to kind of really give myself over to

248
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:22,480
Zen and um so that's what I did as I um

249
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:28,480
I I think I caught a ride some kind of ride service the ride bulletin board

250
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:33,839
back then in colleges they had bulletin boards people looking for Riders and I I

251
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:41,960
got a ride to the east coast and then I worked my way across the Atlantic on a freighter and um and

252
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:48,040
then took me to Spain and then I hitchhiked from Spain to U no I think I

253
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:55,680
took a bus uh to to uh Holland and in Holland I uh got passage again in

254
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:03,920
another small kind of cargo boat back to my home country and now I was interested in

255
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:09,599
Zen and uh I also had an interest in Sufism mostly from reading about it and

256
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:15,240
I went to back to my home country with this question you know do I want to go and study Zen or do I want to kind of

257
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:20,760
somehow study uh Sufism and um and there to kind of

258
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:27,800
explore my roots and uh figure out what to do and um

259
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:34,440
and uh by now I had this uh these two strong influences on me that uh the Zen

260
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:41,880
the Zen meditation the focus on honesty that I learned at the farm and um and so

261
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:49,079
now I was going to find my way um back there in in Norway so that's running out

262
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:57,040
of time and I'll continue um um tomorrow and thank you for

263
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,000
listening and

264
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,960
uh
