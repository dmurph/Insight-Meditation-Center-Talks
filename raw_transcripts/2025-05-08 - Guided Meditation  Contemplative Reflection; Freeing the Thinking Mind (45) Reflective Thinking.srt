1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:07,520
good morning everyone good day good evening um it's lovely to see all your

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,559
warm greetings and um uh little loving

3
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:18,640
emojis um so this morning um I'm going to talk

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:25,199
a little bit about um reflective thinking and um in our meditation we'll

5
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:31,679
do a contemplative reflection um contemplative reflection

6
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:38,800
is a complimentary practice to the mindfulness practice we do uh where we

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,719
you know pay attention to the present moment just as it is it uses the

8
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,879
thinking mind to consider something specific a dharma aspect or something in

9
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:57,239
our personal lives of course in in meditation you know we'll do something

10
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:04,040
um uh more related to uh to our spiritual

11
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,280
life um but um but to direct the

12
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,720
thinking um with a meditative mind it's different

13
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:22,159
than thinking about it it's allowing the responses to the uh contemplation to

14
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,240
arise from a deeper part of ourselves

15
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,560
um so um in this meditation um I'll

16
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,840
offer a contemplative reflection uh we'll begin with getting settled spend a

17
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:45,159
little time in silence and then I'll drop in a couple of questions you know more silence and then another

18
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:50,640
question and um we'll see how you respond to that what comes out of that

19
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,000
um uh I hope that it's fruitful for you

20
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:04,630
um so take a comfortable but alert [Music]

21
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:13,920
posture finding your seat gently closing the

22
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:23,319
eyes you might take a moment to consciously put aside any thoughts or

23
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:31,120
concerns set them aside for later put it Put them on a

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,560
shelf taking a few deep breaths and with each

25
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:49,120
exhale relaxing a little bit more deeply it's relaxing into your cushion

26
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:56,879
or [Music] chair into the earth that supports you

27
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,640
and now allowing the breath to return to

28
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:51,080
normal getting a sense of the whole body

29
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:03,080
and allowing the attention to travel freely throughout the body relaxing any obvious

30
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,040
tensions anything that can be

31
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:16,680
relaxed if anything doesn't relax easily just soften around it it's okay

32
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:58,880
and now finding the breath within your body allowing your attention to rest on

33
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:05,520
the breathing breathing in and breathing

34
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:11,600
out like waves in the ocean searching and

35
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,638
receding breathing in breathing

36
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,638
out resting in this body in this breath

37
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,840
now allow for a reflection as you consider it allow a

38
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,080
response to arise you might just feel or

39
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:28,360
sense or you might think a response allow it to

40
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,000
arise however it

41
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:43,120
is where does your spirituality live inside of

42
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:51,319
you where does your spirituality live inside of you

43
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,560
maybe an area that feels more connected more

44
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,800
intimate more enlivened

45
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:59,000
you might imagine that you're breathing through that area

46
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:50,600
whenever you're ready feel free to return to mindfulness of breathing okay

47
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,959
now I'll offer a contemplative

48
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:17,000
question here the question you don't have to think of an

49
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,399
answer it doesn't have to be a verbal answer but it might

50
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:28,600
be allowing something inside to respond or be

51
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,680
evoked eventually coming up with a

52
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:42,199
sentence the question is what is your deepest

53
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:49,440
intention what's the intention that you most want to base your life on

54
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,959
you may have various intentions that feel deeper important to you but which

55
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:28,680
are you gravitating to the most right now at this

56
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:35,360
moment what is your deepest intention the intention that you most

57
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,639
want to base your life on

58
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:38,640
if the attention has drifted just gently escorted back to the

59
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:46,840
breath to this body welcome home

60
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:13,158
we'll end with a quote allow it to resonate in you

61
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:21,159
just as the great ocean has one taste the taste of

62
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:28,159
salt so also this teaching as one taste the taste of

63
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,159
liberation

64
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:44,129
[Music]

65
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:05,840
so um I'll talk a little bit about some reflective thinking um uh in my own

66
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:11,760
practice mostly uh at different times in my practice

67
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:17,840
uh maybe once to twice a year I've taken a formal time to reflect on my deepest

68
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:25,080
intentions and inspirations and practice at different times um I'd ask

69
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:30,600
myself uh what was the edge of my practice what felt the most

70
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:37,840
challenging or what felt the most nourishing an area of growth it helped keep the practice at

71
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:44,880
the center of my life um the method I I was taught uh was

72
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,960
I'd go for a long walk or just sit somewhere peaceful and

73
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:55,200
reflect i'd take a little time for the mind to settle and then I'd ask the

74
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:01,720
question what is my deepest intention i'd allow my mind to answer

75
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:08,559
freely and then after a while after all the superficial answers that showed up

76
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:17,120
uh kind of died down a little bit I'd ask it again at first um you know by the third

77
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:22,840
or fourth time I asked it begin to be a little deeper and arise from deep

78
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:28,960
within um for myself I chose not to do it on my meditation cushion because I

79
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,600
wanted to keep it separate i was concerned that it might make me begin to think more in my

80
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:43,039
sittings um and then it just became the way that I did it um then after I did that I would keep

81
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:48,279
that intention close to me i would make it a point to connect with it daily and

82
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:55,760
often many many times a day my deepest intention was usually

83
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:02,799
some version of wanting to be free of suffering but at different times it would point to

84
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:09,000
different aspects of freeing the heart for instance

85
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:16,799
um um at one point I connected with the intention to develop unconditional

86
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:23,039
love at another time to prioritize equinimity in my

87
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:31,279
life so I'd come up with a one-s sentence way of phrasing it um then I'd reflect at some point

88
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:38,480
during my days what is it like to have my deepest intention at the forefront of

89
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:47,720
every communication I had every conversation every email every phone

90
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:53,279
call what's it like to wash dishes with equinimity without rushing forward

91
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:59,840
trying to finish them what's it like to sit in gridlock with the intention to incline towards

92
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,640
unconditional

93
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:10,398
love um when I worked with one edge of my practice that was particularly

94
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:15,960
impactful for me um was when I was struggling with

95
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:21,679
impatience um it seemed that I was impatient a lot

96
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:27,560
and uh the reflection inspired me to steep myself in Dharma teachings about

97
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:33,200
impatience and to just generally attune myself to the many ways that impatience

98
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:39,919
showed up in both my daily life and my meditation for instance um I you know

99
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:46,720
the impatience I felt listening to someone at a meeting I thought was long winded and boring

100
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:53,320
and how that impatience actually developed into strong aversion and dislike for the

101
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:59,400
person or the impatience I felt when a friend was late for a planned

102
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:05,400
lunch and of course the regular visitor I had in meditation how much

103
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:10,480
longer and as I kept attuning my attention to this I was just so

104
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,760
surprised how often during the day I felt it waiting for the shower water to

105
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:22,880
warm up waiting waiting and I slowly developed the habit

106
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:28,400
of mindfulness of waiting until waiting transformed for me into great more time

107
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,720
to practice

108
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:43,800
so a contemplative reflection is taking time to think on purpose about something

109
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:50,400
specific but to think about it from a deeper place than the discursive mind

110
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:59,359
from a place in us that feels connected one of the ways that um many um

111
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:04,800
teachings recommend is to do contemplative reflection to deepen our

112
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:12,240
understanding of the dharma of particular teachings for instance one might ask

113
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:18,160
"How do I understand karma at this time how does this understanding affect

114
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:25,359
my life personally?" Or at other times it's been appropriate to reflect on impermanence

115
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:33,440
or dooka or not self but we can also reflect about

116
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:41,240
something mundane something in our lives we want to clarify or decision we need to

117
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:49,359
make um with decisions I've spent lots of time going over pros and cons pros

118
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:55,160
and cons many many lists multiple times and still getting

119
00:36:55,160 --> 00:37:01,880
stuck the rational mind could not come up with a decision so I would go meditate for a

120
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:08,880
while get settled and then I'd bring up the decision to be made and I'd allow

121
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:14,640
whatever came up to arise it was open-ended though i purposely

122
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:20,480
didn't insist on deciding that day but just opening to making a decision from

123
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,960
something deeper and something would usually shift in me and and when I finally made the

124
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:34,440
decision the decision seemed to flow there's a sense of harmony to it

125
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:48,319
sometimes a simpler form of reflective thinking can be helpful during

126
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,240
meditation for instance I was in a retreat once and even though my mind

127
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:59,960
seemed relatively calm I found myself bored and I kept wondering how much

128
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:06,160
longer i kept trying different methods i distract myself with them uh some body

129
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:13,119
scan which worked for a little while some meta worked for a little while but still bored

130
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:20,400
and then finally a teaching by Tnatan came to my mind if we're suffering something is being

131
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,760
left out of our attention and it finally dawned on me

132
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:33,359
that boredom was unpleasant that I did not want to be bored and that aversion

133
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:41,480
had shown up and I had not noticed because it looks so much different than all my other juicier

134
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:50,200
aversions like anger and fear and um sleepiness i just didn't recognize

135
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:58,400
it so I finally turned to the boredom itself what is it I don't want to feel

136
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:05,040
and so I explored the felt sense of the boredom the flavor in the mind the

137
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:11,000
feelings in the body the strong desire for my mind to be

138
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:18,119
stimulated i became interested in boredom for the first time

139
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:31,119
um my first introduction to the power of reflective practice before I even have

140
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:37,760
had heard of insight meditation um you know somewhere where in yoga

141
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:44,839
class somebody told me about this 3-day retreat that they took that was fantastic so I went and sat at 3-day

142
00:39:44,839 --> 00:39:51,440
retreat and the instructions were to live with the question who am I every

143
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:58,160
waking moment including when eating you know and you know when we're

144
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:03,520
walking we're eating when we're sitting um and at first the mind would come up

145
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:09,920
with all sorts of verbal responses but the idea was to keep going

146
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:15,480
keeping the questions open-ended challenging the conceptual

147
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:21,000
answers that the conceptual mind gave

148
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:27,920
the mind would get quieter new things would arise and then at one point I saw myself

149
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:34,480
I'm the observer but then the I had the observer ask who am I and it was a little bit

150
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:41,040
like nesting dogs oh the observer is observing the observer and on and on and

151
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:47,520
on until logic gave up the conceptual mind stopped for a while

152
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,760
and a deeper wordless insight

153
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:01,880
arose and um lastly I want to tell you about someone who was an inspiration for

154
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:07,040
me um her name was Peace Pilgrim

155
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:12,319
some of you probably have heard of her but she um she was a woman who in the

156
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:18,240
early 50s became a renunciate when she was 45 she gave up

157
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:25,079
her name and possessions to do a walking pilgrimage a walking pilgrimage for

158
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:31,920
peace and for 28 years she walked across the US and Canada living on handouts

159
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:39,040
from strangers and spread her message for peace her only possessions were a

160
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:45,720
toothbrush a comb a pen and small leaflets with her message of

161
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:52,640
peace if someone offered her a place to stay for food she accepted if not she'd sleep on the

162
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:59,520
ground somewhere though she wasn't a Buddhist her message that people could find peace

163
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:05,119
within themselves by cultivating love and compassion

164
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:12,520
that message was universal when she first became a

165
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:20,960
renunciate she spent 50 days fasting on water and her goal during the fast was

166
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:26,079
to see if she could keep her prayer to God

167
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:33,440
constant and her prayer was a prayer of gratitude it wasn't asking for anything

168
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,560
it was a prayer of

169
00:42:39,319 --> 00:42:45,480
gratitude so maybe that's um that's what I had this morning may May your
