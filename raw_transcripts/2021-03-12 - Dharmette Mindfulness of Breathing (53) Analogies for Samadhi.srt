1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,240
so

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,200
breathing in one

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,320
concentrates breathing out

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,920
one concentrates the mind

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,680
breathing in one steadys the mind

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,840
breathing out one steadys the mind

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,760
breathing in one unifies the mind

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,440
breathing out one unifies the mind

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,040
so all these words concentrate steady

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,160
unify are all kind of

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,239
uh facets of

12
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,559
the same thing of developing and

13
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,440
deepening meditation practice

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,760
and it can be helpful in the deepening

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,039
of practice

16
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,399
to have some landmarks so have some

17
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,680
signposts some some kind of sense of

18
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,600
where we're going or what we're looking

19
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,000
for what we're valuing

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,960
as we develop meditation practice

21
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,760
because

22
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,600
the um

23
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,400
you know subconsciously unconsciously

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,360
the mind is valuing all kinds of things

25
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,799
and um and that's why the mind

26
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,640
the thoughts go off thinking about the

27
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,320
past future fantasy

28
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,560
what we're worrying about what we want

29
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,200
because we

30
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,720
value we have we we prioritize or we

31
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,479
put value into those concerns

32
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,000
but if we have value in the process of

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,920
meditation and the signposts the

34
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,920
experiences of meditation

35
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,320
and enough to recognize them then we

36
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,840
make space for them to grow

37
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,240
we they we make space for them to

38
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,960
nourish us

39
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,119
and support us and provide more

40
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,040
confidence more reassurance oh this is

41
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,439
good

42
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,680
this is the right thing to do so it's

43
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,600
easier to put down our preoccupations

44
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,759
and so with this deepening of the

45
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:04,960
practice

46
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,759
there's uh things like the mind becomes

47
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:08,560
stiller

48
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,959
quieter the mind the body becomes softer

49
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,800
more malleable there becomes a sense of

50
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,840
well-being of different kinds joy and

51
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,879
happiness

52
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,920
subtleness the

53
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,920
the there can be a

54
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,400
sense of joy and happiness there can be

55
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,080
equanimity

56
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,080
there can be a sense of being really

57
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,519
embodied

58
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,360
could not really feel the vitality of

59
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,800
our life coursing through us

60
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,200
and really feeling present and whole or

61
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,920
settled

62
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,560
ah it feels so good to be at home in

63
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,080
this body

64
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,440
and the same thing with the mind the

65
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,239
mind can feel have assurance to it be

66
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:51,200
peaceful

67
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,840
the mind can start feeling expansive as

68
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,200
if the mind has a room

69
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,680
for all the little details all the

70
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,440
dramas of our life all the

71
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,519
concerns we have all the little

72
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:02,720
experiences

73
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,000
the details anything that's a detail

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,319
can be held now in your mind that's

75
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,159
really broad and wide

76
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,200
like a very large large room that can

77
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,599
hold

78
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,840
all the everyone everything everybody

79
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,959
inside in a

80
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,800
peaceful spacious way so this expansive

81
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,640
mind open mind

82
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,400
there can be for some people a sense of

83
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,239
brightness even light

84
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,480
that comes on that feels really good

85
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,120
but i wanted to provide you with the

86
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,760
three

87
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,239
similes analogies that the buddha uses

88
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,000
for this deepening of meditation

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,200
practice

90
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,480
and the advantage of of similes

91
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,159
or analogies is that each person kind of

92
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,040
uh interpreted or find themselves in it

93
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,799
more easily than with a

94
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,040
clear kind of technical description of

95
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,720
what might supposed to be happening in

96
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,239
meditation

97
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,319
uh similarly analogies are a little

98
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,400
black poetry they're evocative

99
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,200
they touch our kind of imagination maybe

100
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,120
even our emotions a little bit

101
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,760
um they these things also have a little

102
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,720
bit kinesthetic or somatic sometimes the

103
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,400
these images so that our somatic

104
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,680
uh involvement with associations come

105
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,600
into play as well

106
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,560
and um and uh and there's a lot of room

107
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,759
for

108
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,160
personal uniqueness so our own way of

109
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,680
finding ourselves

110
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,120
in these analogies so i want to offer

111
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,919
three of them

112
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,840
and they're kind of three progressive

113
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,440
and now uh deepening stages of

114
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,199
meditation

115
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,360
and the first uh and they all have to

116
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,520
use the they all have

117
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,040
they all use water in the analogies

118
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,160
and it's never been explained to me

119
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,960
why water keeps being used in these

120
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,600
similes analogies what it represents

121
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,160
but i take it to represent the mind or

122
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,000
awareness itself

123
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and that's the medium in which we're

124
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,840
operating right now or the mind the

125
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,039
awareness

126
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:07,520
and and so this awareness begins

127
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,240
takes different shapes different forms

128
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,960
as it practice deepens

129
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,280
so the first uh simile is

130
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,320
water being sprinkled into

131
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,720
in our modern equivalent into flour

132
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,960
and as the water gets sprinkled in the

133
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,000
water gets

134
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,199
folded in kneaded in

135
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,400
stirred into the flour until the flour

136
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,840
becomes dough

137
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,960
you know to make bread and so what's

138
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,919
important is that

139
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,759
all the all the water that's being

140
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,840
sprinkled in gets kneaded in

141
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,840
and spread out evenly throughout the

142
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,280
dough

143
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,400
and so part of the kneading of the bread

144
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,960
is kneading of the flour the dough is to

145
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,520
get that

146
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,400
uh spread out the the you know equally

147
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,199
around

148
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,039
so that the dough kind of could hold the

149
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,479
flour can hold together into one hole

150
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,479
so that's the analogy and uh

151
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,840
and um in a sense the

152
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,039
the flower is the body and the

153
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,120
and the water is the awareness or the

154
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,600
mind and we want to bring these together

155
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,280
so the awareness

156
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,520
is immersed in or penetrates throughout

157
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,000
the body so the body and mind are to be

158
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,479
in the same place at the same time

159
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,000
if the mind is thinking about other

160
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,680
times in other places

161
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,360
then the body and mind are separated

162
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,199
but if the mind starts focusing

163
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,720
awareness starts entering into the

164
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,800
bodiness present for the body like for

165
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,080
the breathing

166
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,840
then the mind is kind of in the same

167
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,240
place in the same time

168
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,280
as the body and uh and

169
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,759
by doing that uh what we're looking for

170
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,360
is the body and mind to end up

171
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,080
in in a kind of harmony with each other

172
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,080
um a kind of unification and

173
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,560
harmonious working together where there

174
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,599
can be real

175
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,360
experience feelings of health and

176
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,280
healthfulness healthiness and

177
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,639
wholesomeness that can't be felt

178
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,039
if there's a real dichotomy real

179
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,880
separation between these two

180
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,000
parts of ourselves and

181
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,360
um and so we take awareness and uh

182
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,280
we bring it into our breathing and

183
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,720
and we're working it's kind of nice the

184
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,479
breathing itself is kind of a massage a

185
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,840
kind of a kneading

186
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,720
but we bring our awareness and we place

187
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,000
it we sprinkle it into

188
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,479
something like our breathing and then we

189
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,400
want to knead it we want to stay there

190
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,599
with the breathing

191
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,039
and those are two different movements

192
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,880
that i talked about yesterday

193
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,440
the contact the placing of attention

194
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,280
somewhere like with the breathing

195
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,759
and then keeping it there and keeping it

196
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,599
there is not holding it necessarily

197
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,479
steady but a gentle kind of working it

198
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:53,520
and staying there

199
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,160
staying there be there and then we have

200
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,759
to do it again because the mind wanders

201
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:58,080
off

202
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,400
we come back and connect and stay there

203
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,840
and stay there

204
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,960
and and that's a sprinkling of awareness

205
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,080
into our breathing into our body and

206
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,919
we're kneading it in we're kneading it

207
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,080
in and so there's a massage there's a

208
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,000
rhythm of coming back and applying

209
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,840
yourself staying there

210
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,039
um reconnecting and so for every

211
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,479
beginning of the inhale and begin the

212
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,319
exhale there's a kind of gentle

213
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,400
reconnecting that goes on there

214
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,240
and then it's staying there stay there

215
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,759
be there to the massage

216
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,760
and so slowly um we're beginning to

217
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,800
uh penetrate awareness into the whole

218
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,080
experience of breathing so it's

219
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,599
continuous and

220
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,279
and fills the experience of breathing

221
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,480
wherever that might be in the body

222
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,519
and then and then there's a kind of as

223
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,360
we get a hang and we're doing this hang

224
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,640
of doing this and

225
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,360
feel like this is going well there can

226
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,720
be a rising

227
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,880
gladness certainly the gladness and

228
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,760
happiness

229
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,640
of relief of not being lost and

230
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,560
preoccupied in some of these thoughts

231
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,040
that

232
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,839
thinking that we have that maybe not for

233
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,440
some of you but for

234
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,519
many of us you know is not so much fun

235
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,120
it's not a great thing sometimes to

236
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,800
spend a lot of time

237
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,279
caught up in thoughts and ruminations

238
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,080
and stuff

239
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,320
and what a relief it is to have the

240
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,080
thoughts received enough and

241
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,120
not be pulled into their orbit and be

242
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,600
settled in here

243
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,360
so there's a there's work involved

244
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,600
there's this kneading the sprinkling in

245
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,959
coming here

246
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,760
the next analogy is that what i used in

247
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,880
meditation

248
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,040
is that now the is the mountains

249
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,480
mountain lake

250
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,480
with the underwater spring that flows

251
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,680
through it

252
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,200
and now in a sense awareness has become

253
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,000
very stable and expansive and big

254
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,600
and kind of penetrates or is resting or

255
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,720
is maybe coterminous with the body

256
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,600
that somehow now awareness in the body

257
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,279
are not so distinct

258
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,320
but we really feel the

259
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,399
fullness the vitality the aliveness of

260
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,519
the body

261
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,079
where the sensing the sensory apparatus

262
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:10,640
of the body

263
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,440
sense endings of the body are part of

264
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,160
the awareness system

265
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,279
and so awareness is not just cognitive

266
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,839
mental observing or knowing but there's

267
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:22,480
a

268
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,440
broader feeling of sensing and aliveness

269
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,120
that's part of awareness

270
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,680
and so the body and mind now are are

271
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,079
there together as partners

272
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,600
and then within that the

273
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,079
the concentration the steadiness the

274
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,360
real kind of

275
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,959
intimacy with just breathing

276
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,480
is um if he has this inner goodness and

277
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,920
nourishment to it

278
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,640
that there's a welding up of a kind of

279
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,120
joy or well-being or delight

280
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,880
that's not evaluative it's not like we

281
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,120
have to think ourselves into being happy

282
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,079
it's almost like some people say that

283
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,079
their

284
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,640
joy hormones or serotonin and endorphins

285
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,839
they get released

286
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,680
in this steady massaging staying with

287
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,160
a focus of concentration a sense of

288
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,680
well-being wells up

289
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,079
and there's a flow of vitality that

290
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,079
feels like it comes from the inside out

291
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,760
the joy that comes from the inside like

292
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,480
a spring going forth

293
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,680
the last analogy is now

294
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,959
the deeper meditation the sense of flow

295
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,880
and vitality and joy

296
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,320
settles away into a very deep satisfying

297
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,519
peacefulness

298
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,640
and the analogy is that of a of

299
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,200
a the lake has now become or lake has

300
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,079
become really

301
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,519
still unmoving and there's lotus is

302
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,399
growing in it

303
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,320
meaning it's not a cold mountain lake or

304
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,399
something but now it's a very

305
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,639
nice temperature lake that's very

306
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,399
comfortable to be in

307
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,360
and this beautiful uh lotus many

308
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,200
different colored lotus flowers

309
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,880
submerged in the lake floating on the

310
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,880
lake and

311
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,120
and the sense of everything is very

312
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,240
peaceful

313
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,519
everything is calm very still

314
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,440
and everything that's known within that

315
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,279
calmness

316
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,800
even though conventionally it might be

317
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,880
something that's not

318
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,480
maybe a little bit of i don't know

319
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,120
something not not so nice maybe

320
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,120
but everything that is touched by

321
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,519
awareness now touched by the water

322
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,760
is like beautiful lotus flowers floating

323
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,200
there peacefully in space

324
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,320
in the in the water so

325
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,440
additionally there's work in the

326
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,360
with the kneading of the dough and then

327
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,800
there's no more work

328
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,560
and it's just a flow that's happening

329
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,959
we're being carried by the flow

330
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,000
and then the flow comes down

331
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,920
and we're just kind of in this very

332
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,639
peaceful place very still place

333
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,440
where everything just feels beautiful

334
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,160
and there's

335
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,040
and it's in that and in these states

336
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,880
where there's a lot of reassurance a lot

337
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,440
of confidence a lot of equanimity

338
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,399
um and it's a beautiful thing to tap

339
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,320
into this capacity for deep

340
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,720
confidence deep serenity deep

341
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,079
reassurance

342
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,920
it does the heart a tremendous amount of

343
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,920
good to have it

344
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,120
and it does not depend

345
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,399
on the things in the world around us

346
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,760
being just right being fixed um

347
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,480
it's uh this very private inner place

348
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,680
inside

349
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,720
that uh becomes a resource for which we

350
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,720
can kind of enter into the world

351
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,839
in a wonderful way

352
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,839
so maybe those analogies are

353
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,360
interesting for you to play with and

354
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,959
work with and

355
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,760
maybe this topic of inner reassurance

356
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,519
assurance and confidence

357
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,639
is something that you can

358
