1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:12,160
so hello and welcome to the beginning of

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:19,439
this week in this week's series meditation and dharma talk

3
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,439
and

4
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,360
i remember last monday coming here after the retreat and

5
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,199
not quite finding my words or

6
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:50,239
or kind of feeling quiet inside

7
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,960
so to start this meditation

8
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,880
i'd like to ask you maybe a little unusual question for

9
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,400
setting the stage for meditation and that is

10
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,679
for you for each of you individually

11
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,840
what comes to mind as you hear this question there's many possible answers but what

12
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,079
gets evoked in you as a response to this question

13
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:36,400
or what does this question point to in you

14
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,200
so for you what is the opposite

15
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,798
of hostility

16
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,799
within you your body your heart your mind your emotions

17
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:04,799
what what do you see at this moment is the opposite of hostility

18
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,560
it could be love it could be generosity it could be peace peacefulness

19
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:20,160
it could be kindness friendliness it could be care caring

20
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,160
compassion

21
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,599
it could be a calm a stillness

22
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,440
it could be confidence

23
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,160
stability is a wide range of things that it might

24
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:51,120
be and if you close your eyes

25
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,519
and if something come up came up as the opposite either something specific or just a

26
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,840
vague sense is there any place in your

27
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,560
body that that opposite lives any place in your body that you

28
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,800
associate with that opposite opposite

29
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:26,319
it could be anywhere at all and if there is such an association such

30
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:33,280
a place or you can maybe just choose a place

31
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,200
to to hold the opposite

32
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,120
take a few long slow breaths breathing through that place

33
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,879
almost like it's a balloon that you're blowing up on the inhale and

34
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:56,319
letting it peacefully relax on the exhale

35
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:08,120
or like a gentle wind that flows over the surface of it refreshing it

36
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,519
taking deep breaths and as you exhale relax

37
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:25,360
your body and as you relax relax into that place

38
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,719
like you're settling into it

39
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:47,520
letting your breathing return to normal and continue relaxing your body

40
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:56,759
but maybe it's possible to relax into the opposite this opposite of hostility

41
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,639
to this place where that

42
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,120
lives for you even if it's not present now

43
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,320
if there's a particular state that is for you that is the opposite of

44
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:44,479
hostility very quietly in your mind for maybe three or four times gently slowly

45
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,400
repeat the word for this state

46
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,918
drop the word into your body and let it

47
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,759
spread outward like ripples

48
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,000
in a pond

49
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,319
and then to let your thinking mind become a bit

50
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:52,800
quieter as if you're approaching this place of

51
00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:00,080
the opposite of hostility you're approaching it with respect and care

52
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,880
attentiveness to feel and sense make

53
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,599
room for it

54
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:37,599
and then to continue now with a quiet meditation

55
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,319
perhaps

56
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:50,000
breathing with this opposite or letting your mindfulness your

57
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,919
awareness somehow be informed

58
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,400
by this quality

59
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,960
letting the opposite of hostility

60
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:20,919
be what nourishes your practice during this meditation

61
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,159
so

62
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:53,919
and then to bring this meditation to an end

63
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,158
to consider the opposite of hostility

64
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:07,600
and to offer that sentiment

65
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:13,279
out into the world to consider how you could

66
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:18,519
meet other people today with this opposite

67
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:24,399
consider how they can be the attitude which you think about people

68
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:31,519
consider people especially if you end up feeling hostile

69
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:39,919
remember this opposite and perhaps you can live the day

70
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:46,240
with part of you oriented towards benefiting this world leaving

71
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,919
the world a little better place by the end of the day by the friendliness the kindness

72
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:57,760
the smiles the generosity that you offer

73
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:04,240
may all beings be happy

74
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:12,480
may all beings be safe may all beings

75
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:20,518
be peaceful and may all beings be free

76
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:26,840
[Music]

77
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:38,519
[Music]

78
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:31,120
so hello again and on this monday morning

79
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:37,919
and um for those of us those of us in united

80
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:42,960
states it's a holiday juneteenth day holiday

81
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,640
um the second of the two or the first of the year of the two

82
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:54,960
um independence holidays here in the united states and i gave a talk about this

83
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:01,760
holiday yesterday so

84
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:12,079
so last week we i talked about emotions and offering five different perspectives

85
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:18,878
on emotions for support and practicing with them and this week i wanted to take some

86
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:24,000
specific emotions and like case studies and go through them

87
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:31,040
and i decided that that would start with anger and when i considered anger i considered

88
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,960
that um there's actually a lot to say and maybe it's more useful to

89
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:44,078
spend the five days on this topic rather than just doing one day and be done with it

90
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:50,000
so that's what we'll do and maybe this the title of this week can be respecting

91
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,118
anger anger of course is a very important

92
00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:00,880
emotion attitude motivating force in our society

93
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:07,040
and uh tremendous amount of harm gets caused through anger

94
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:13,839
and one of the i don't know if it's fair to say that any one particular harm of anger is

95
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:18,960
worse than others but what comes to mind in the moment is the

96
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:25,200
tremendous influence it can have on young children if they grow up with anger

97
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:30,960
or they grow up afraid of unexpected anger coming

98
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,640
at them and also uh

99
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:42,839
anger is a protective device anger also some people motivated by

100
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:48,960
anger will protect other people protect their children protect society

101
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:54,640
some people with their anger protect themselves and set up strong

102
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:01,520
boundaries and strong no and can be ferocious sometimes in in

103
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:07,010
in that protective movement some people by their anger can

104
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:12,400
[Music] put a tremendous amount of energy into a cause a good cause because of the

105
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:18,079
energies is forcing them so anger has many different expressions

106
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:23,280
in our society and um

107
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:29,599
and um but in um one of the it then it can be confusing

108
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:34,880
because sometimes anger is treated as something that's wrong or bad

109
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:41,599
painful and sometimes it's treated as something that's necessary and important and justified

110
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:46,640
and in buddhism

111
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:56,000
whenever there's a discussion about anger in buddhist english the discussion is

112
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,880
implies that anger has hostility as part of it

113
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:08,320
so if that's how we see it then we have to come up with another

114
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:15,280
word for something like anger or anger which has no hostility in it

115
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,839
there might be a very strong expression of displeasure

116
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:26,480
that will look like anger but there's no hostility in it

117
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:33,119
there can be very strong movement ferocious movement of protection of a strong no

118
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:39,680
but there's no hostility there's no desire to harm anyone it's just setting up a very strong

119
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:45,920
statement of asserting a certain ferocious uh ferocity of

120
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:51,839
purpose ferocity of of negation something

121
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:58,160
and and so a very useful way of looking at our

122
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:03,520
anger is to look and see is there any hostility in it

123
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,640
and if there is be careful the hostility

124
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,920
i would like to suggest is never necessary never appropriate

125
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:19,680
ferocious boundary setting ferocious

126
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:26,320
standing in front saying stop ferocious sense of displeasure at this is not

127
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:33,680
right that i think can be very healthy for ourselves and for others

128
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:39,119
and the first time i saw that was when i was working in the kitchen i was a kitchen manager at the monastery of the

129
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:46,480
zen monastery and i don't remember the details of how what led up to this what i did but i was

130
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,760
of kind of the the manager managing other people in the kitchen and the kitchen was kind of a

131
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:57,520
pressure cooker and an older man who was in the kitchen were standing next to each other on the

132
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:04,000
big table and and he just stood up straight and turned

133
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:11,920
to me and with ferocity said to me don't ever say that to me again

134
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:17,280
and so it was quite ferocious but what uh was amazing to me

135
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:24,320
was uh the moment as he said it i could uh he's he turned

136
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,760
it off he it was he was then he was back to being kind of clean and clear just

137
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:35,520
present doing his work and uh i i i then i was so surprised

138
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:42,320
because i only experienced before that people stayed angry people were upset that they

139
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:47,359
would stay and there'd be a kind of a conflict and a fight and he had this

140
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:54,160
clean anger it was completely clean it was just like don't do this again and he said what had to be said and he

141
00:39:54,160 --> 00:40:00,320
wasn't carrying it he wasn't being continuing with it it wasn't like i was forgiven

142
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:07,599
but i didn't need to be forgiven uh it was just like i got the message and he wasn't holding on to it he wasn't

143
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:14,960
carrying anything with it he just made his ex said what had to be done and and i was so amazed by this that you can

144
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:23,040
take care of yourself this way but regardless if anger is as

145
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:29,119
is only defined by as having hostility or it's anger that's a kind of ferocious

146
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:35,920
ferocious uh boundary setting or displeasure uh it's helpful to see anger always as a

147
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:41,920
messenger always is something to study and get to know better

148
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:48,640
that anger is a tip of an iceberg of something deeper inside of us

149
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:54,240
that uh probably be useful to get to know well well to understand well

150
00:40:54,240 --> 00:41:00,560
part of the challenge of any kind of anger is that it tends to be directed towards something it's with

151
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:06,480
such uh strength of directionality even if it's in towards something inside

152
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:13,280
of ourselves that we don't see the bigger picture and we don't see where the the

153
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:19,040
anger is coming from it's directed outwards and we don't look backwards to see what is happening there

154
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:27,200
what's going on there and and that's what the practice is about

155
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:34,000
very broadly in broad strokes kind of there are four stages that buddhists can can be point

156
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,400
to around anger one is unrestrained anger

157
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:46,720
you see it sometimes in a young child where they're just completely consumed by their anger and

158
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:52,800
i've had it with my child my child when was a toddler and

159
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:58,079
i was carrying him through the supermarket aisles and

160
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:05,119
having a temper tantrum about something and probably i just assumed that people at the store thought that i was just a

161
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:10,640
horrific father and i know that other parents have had this experience too where the child

162
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:16,319
you know just unrepressed pure volcanic anger at

163
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:21,359
something that maybe it was that they saw a toy that they wanted but it

164
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:27,040
wasn't really the time to give them a toy in the store buy it for them

165
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:33,040
and the um um

166
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:39,119
so the first there's un unrestrained anger where it's explosive uh freely

167
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:45,040
given uh you know felt like every anger is justified and

168
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:50,240
and then very broadly then the next kind of stage is um

169
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:56,319
holding anger in check sometimes repressing it

170
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:02,720
denying it hiding it and because it's dangerous to express the

171
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:08,240
anger or something and some people as they grow up and they

172
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:14,400
learn they learn that growing up sometimes they learn it on with that about the violence done to them

173
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:19,760
that they express anger and they're hit or attacked or something and so they learn

174
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:25,280
that they can't they can't express any anger and they bottle it up or turn it off somehow

175
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:32,240
the third is what we do in this practice we respect it we attend to it

176
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:37,680
we study it we get to know it better and we get to know it without shame

177
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:44,000
without further anger towards the anger we get to know it because

178
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,839
it is an expression of our life force it is an expression of what it means to be a lie alive

179
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:55,760
and it arises out of some it's not just anger that's happening it's the

180
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:02,079
something deeper and fuller about who we are that's in that anger our values our

181
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:10,400
emotions our fears our desires our loves um our past sufferings and pains and

182
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:15,440
wounds a whole bunch of consolation of things come together

183
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:21,760
some of them which is part of our beauty and wonderfulness and some of it is that which is what we're trying to let go of

184
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:28,800
in practice to let go um to let go um

185
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:34,319
of conceit the self-centeredness

186
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:40,319
intense self-centeredness is often a recipe for intense anger and hostility

187
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:47,359
and so that kind of anger we don't want to allow give free reign to but we don't repress it either

188
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:52,800
what we want to do is turn around and really look deeply what's going on here

189
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:58,880
and meditation is one of the best places for this in meditation you're committed to being

190
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:05,760
still not moving your body you're not going to punch anyone out or screaming anyone and to give

191
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:11,359
when you so you might even try it when you find yourself having anger

192
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:19,119
go sit down to meditate and let the anger be a volcano let the anger course through you and just feel

193
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:24,400
it make room for it let go keep letting go of the thoughts the stories

194
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:30,560
and let the body compost the anger let the body hold and process the anger and

195
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:36,560
sit there allowing it but being present for it feeling in the body

196
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:43,119
and see what happens this is very respectful of anger it allows it to be there but we're not fueling it and

197
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:50,400
feeding it with more and more activity and stories but this is a place to really get to know it

198
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:56,400
and then the fourth stage of buddhist practice at least with anger

199
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:02,079
is that anger doesn't get triggered partly because we've learned

200
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:08,720
other ways of responding other ways of boundary setting or protecting other motivations that get

201
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:14,640
what needs to be done done and partly because the attachments that we have the

202
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:20,880
clinging the conceits that are part of the triggers for anger

203
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:27,280
are no longer there and there might be strong displeasure but no

204
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:32,640
hostility at all so that's kind of an introduction for

205
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:38,960
this week we'll spend the week looking at anger and

206
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:46,880
and as a little homework assignment for this next day or for as you go forward here

207
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:54,800
see if you can learn to be comfortable or to be

208
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:02,880
empty or to be non-reactive to other people angry at you

209
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:10,400
it doesn't mean that they're justified in the anger or they should be angry or or hopefully you know it's a safe context

210
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:16,960
for this to happen don't do anything unsafe but if you can learn to be present

211
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:22,480
and stay relaxed and breathe when other people are angry this will go a long way

212
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,839
to your ability to do that for yourself so whether you're angry or you're a

213
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:35,680
recipient of anger see if you can practice mindfulness in the middle of it it's invaluable

214
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:43,359
so um so this is what we'll do this week and

215
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:50,880
uh it's a difficult topic and hopefully i'll do it in a way that is respectful for all the different ways

216
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:57,200
that people have experienced anger been angry been harmed by anger

217
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:03,440
and that that each of you will maybe hopefully find

218
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:10,760
some usefulness in what said this week thank you
