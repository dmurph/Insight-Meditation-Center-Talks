00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:07,520
so hello and welcome to happy hour everyone

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:14,920
lovely to be with you to share the space with you to practice together

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:21,840
so so for today's practice i want to invite us to um

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,800
explore the practice of of gratitude it's nice to explore

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:36,079
gratitude on on a friday or for some of you it's saturday already um

6
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:42,000
like mario christina in australia and maybe others will be listening to this on audiodharma later

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,920
but the practice of gratitude just to brighten the heart and uh

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:55,840
as you know as always we take different um approaches to practices um

9
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,399
there's so many different ways to practice meta gratitude each of these practices

10
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,479
there's so many ways in so we'll find our way in in a different

11
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:15,439
way tonight in the way of of appreciating having gratitude

12
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:22,080
for not just what's what's good and easy and wonderful and things that we're

13
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:29,200
typically grateful for but also for challenges gratitude for challenges

14
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,960
um [Music] i'll share with you that i've been contemplating this

15
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,400
as [Music] and as as

16
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,399
quizzical and as paradoxical as it seems um [Music]

17
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:53,119
although illness is hard sickness is hard and i've been down with a bad cold for many

18
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,799
many days over a week and yet

19
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:05,439
and yet what i found in my heart is and of course not that i like being sick

20
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:12,720
i don't like being sick i don't wish it upon myself you know so this is not a masochistic way of being in the world in

21
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,080
the head when when it is when things are the way they are when

22
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,840
sickness when lack of health lack of energy is there can i be grateful for

23
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,959
this too can i be grateful for this too what are the gifts

24
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,840
that this thing that i don't like i don't wish it upon myself but yet it's

25
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,000
here and it's not pleasant it has unpleasant faith enough

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
can i be grateful for it are there things are there gifts are they gifts in this darkness

27
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,599
and that's something that i'll lead you in tonight but just to share for me i am

28
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,720
grateful i have been grateful for my illness because even though there are

29
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,840
many things that was on my to-do list and i didn't get to do and accomplish or

30
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,280
come and be with sangha and teach happy hour but it forced me to slow down which

31
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,599
is a gift it forced me to be in bed it forced me to spend all those hours

32
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:26,480
being with this body that wasn't feeling well at all um to meditate to to be aware of things as

33
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,799
they arise and pass when the mind doesn't have the energy or the the

34
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:41,120
the uh uplift to even read to even do to even watch a movie but just enough

35
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:48,720
energy to just be aware just be aware that is a gift that's

36
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:56,799
that's a tremendous gift so illness in that way is a gift becomes a gift

37
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:04,080
hence having gratitude for illness or anything that seems to be difficult or undesirable so

38
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:10,480
it's a nuanced practice and yet with a little bit of creativity

39
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:18,079
i trust i know that it can be available to all of us

40
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,360
so that's the setting that's the way i would like to set up

41
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,840
our practice the inspiration the framing so

42
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:38,479
so let's explore together friends so let's explore together so like to invite you

43
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:44,160
this time this moment to turn to change to shift

44
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,840
into your meditation posture

45
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,360
you may need to move from the cushion to a chair or from a

46
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:02,000
chair to a cushion lie down stand up see what this body needs

47
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,599
to be comfortable as comfortable as possible

48
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:17,520
but yet alert and awake and landing arriving

49
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,880
arriving in this body in this moment

50
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,680
letting the breath be received in the abdomen

51
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,600
ah by the entire body not the head

52
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:06,360
but the sensations of the breath be sensed by the body itself

53
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:48,840
let there be awareness let awareness pervade the entire body

54
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,319
parts that are tired achy

55
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:01,880
heavy parts that are comfortable

56
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,039
pleasant

57
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,039
warm

58
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
the parts that are energetic energized

59
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:40,360
are there parts in the body that are all of these and more at the same time

60
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:58,520
can we rest let go release

61
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:35,399
release release release more holding more tension

62
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,320
aware of this moment whatever is arising in this moment

63
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,480
in this body with curiosity and interest oh yes look

64
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:03,360
at that there's achiness there hello achiness you're welcome

65
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,640
to be just as you are

66
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,560
or hello [Music] lightness

67
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:22,000
comfort coziness in some other parts of the body

68
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,169
hmm you too are welcome [Music]

69
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,440
to be appreciated and relished

70
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:04,320
what's present in the body not thinking about it but letting it be

71
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,320
felt

72
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,920
all these sensations all these sensations

73
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,399
even if some are unpleasant can we have

74
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:03,040
gratitude for the unpleasantness for the pain in the body

75
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:12,640
because after all [Music] sensing pain means that our

76
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,839
pain receptors are working

77
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,120
that our spine is not cut off

78
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,440
it's actually the system is working it's sending the signals we may not like

79
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,839
the signals but can we be grateful that they exist

80
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:56,880
what if we refrain the unpleasantness in the body

81
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:05,160
the fact that we have a body that has sensations

82
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:48,040
can we appreciate and enjoy the breath

83
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,639
the opera

84
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:42,480
can we enjoy and appreciate this moment of quiet

85
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:50,880
sitting and practicing simply being aware

86
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:58,240
so much gratitude for the simplicity of this moment

87
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:05,399
of being able to sit just be

88
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:11,920
expanding expanding and knowing from our heart

89
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:19,279
middle of our chest sense of presence connection with

90
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:26,560
ourselves can we be grateful for this moment

91
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,880
simply being and here being aware

92
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,759
here i'm here

93
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,440
can i love be grateful for this moment just as it is

94
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,920
not needing wanting it to be any different

95
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,720
appreciating relishing the normalcy

96
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,798
in some ways and maybe in some ways it's not normal

97
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:19,839
of this moment just as it is unfolding even if there are many thoughts arising

98
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:27,360
or aches in the body or distracted or sleepy doesn't matter

99
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:38,600
it doesn't have to be perfect can we appreciate love it just as it is

100
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,080
just this

101
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,760
what we consider to be normal boring

102
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:12,080
[Music] not good enough not exciting

103
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:20,640
someday we will look back someday when the present moment

104
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:26,160
is the long it belongs to the long past

105
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:33,440
history by god this moment would be part of the good

106
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:40,159
old times ah when life was like that

107
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,960
which i took for granted

108
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:56,559
can we not take it for granted look at this moment from the perspective

109
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:02,240
of the future looking at this moment

110
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:08,080
in the rear view mirror ah the good old times

111
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:16,160
when so-and-so was alive when i was at that age when that was

112
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:23,280
happening which maybe was challenging but oh looking at it looking back at it all

113
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:30,320
wistfully visually can we appreciate it now

114

137
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,320
this piece of art

138
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:52,880
is there a recent challenge maybe you had earlier today or this past week

139
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,919
that you can include

140
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,158
see the goodness of it

141
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,159
maybe how it helps you grow

142
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:28,120
in compassion and care and wisdom in ways you wouldn't otherwise

143
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,000

144
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:32,480

the gifts

146
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,559
within the challenge

147
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:25,679
maybe life isn't all about getting what you want but growing through

148
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:33,799
getting what you don't at times

149
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:37,760
grateful for it all let the body be relaxed

150
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,760

153
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,880
one breath at a time

154
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:24,000
looking at this moment from the perspective of a future

155
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:30,159
the same way you would look at the moment from your past from this perspective oh

156
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:38,159
yes i remember oh then oh yes oh the good old times

157
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:44,799
when i was at this age oh so-and-so was in my life

158
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:50,720
what those are my challenges ah the sense of perhaps bittersweet

159
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:57,600
tenderness looking at this moment

160
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,278
of your life with the same perspective

161
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:32,398
and for the last minutes of this practice period

162
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:39,840
holding yourself with kindness for whatever arose or did not arise

163
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:51,279
can i appreciate love whatever happened

164
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:58,000
in this practice period even if i was it was sleepiness or distract

165

180
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,960
you can if you type them to everyone i'll read your name if you type them just to me

181
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:09,119
i will read the reflection but not your name so you'll be private you can also raise

182
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:18,000
your hand invited to share for the benefit of all beings what did you discover

183
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:24,680
what was interesting what was challenging any aha moments

184
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:45,119
claire says have been told that gratitude is wanting what you have yes

185
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:50,560
exactly exactly not having what you want

186
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:57,440
which actually can put us on a hedonic

187
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:03,040
treadmill keep wanting keep keep wanting

188
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:09,119
keep keep having what we want keep going after what we want whereas it's the other way around

189
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:16,640
exactly gratitude is is wanting what you have yay this is what i have yay so

190
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:22,680
actually wanting it appreciating it yes thank you claire

191
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:30,240
david on youtube says what if we refrain the signal in quotes i'm hearing the hiss of

192
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:39,040
mindfulness loud and clear thanks to you and the dharma deep house thank you david yes it's reframing

193
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:44,160
so much about reframing in the other insights

194
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,039
and the other aha moments

195
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:57,440
um one person says having joy for surviving my injury yeah

196
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:04,160
yeah [Music] and what gifts there can be in the

197
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:10,800
injury actually none besides surviving it but actually the ways that

198
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:17,680
maybe maybe it slowed you down maybe it gave you more time to be with

199
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:24,400
yourself with others or whatever else what other gifts there might have been

200
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:30,160
i'll take another pause for any reflections that might have come up

201
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:36,640
the aha moments anything you noticed when you looked at your life from the perspective of the

202
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,720
future your challenges

203
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:50,319
hugging your life how was that with eye with arms wide

204
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:04,400
open merry christine says grateful for the awareness this practice brings me

205
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:11,040
yes indeed can't run nice in your hand please

206
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:19,119
yeah um is it this kind of exercise has always been really hard for me because i

207
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:24,720
try and understand it with my mind and then and then i just feel guilty that i haven't

208
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:31,040
been appreciating my life and and i can't quite grasp it um and the same with chat like

209
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:37,359
appreciating challenge it's like i i've i've done this like unconscious

210
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:43,440
exceptionalism where i'm like okay other people can get that but not me and i just kind of listen and like

211
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:50,160
keep it at arm's length but lately because of loving-kindness practice and and

212
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:56,960
deep embodiment practices um i have i have recognized like oh my my body

213
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:05,440
understands this like or this like unified wisdom that is my whole being

214
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:13,119
understands things like this about like how i can appreciate my life now imagining the future or how i can feel

215
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:19,200
um grateful for challenge and it's just like this the shift of like

216
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:24,560
letting my mind take a little bit like of the back seat and

217
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:32,720
open to like this greater wisdom that understands all this and that i am deeply grateful for

218
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:39,920
yay catherine i'm celebrating this i'm getting chills as you say this beautiful

219
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:46,079
thank you so much for sharing your insight your wisdom for the sake of

220
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:52,400
others is so beautiful to go from this place so that's beautifully described

221
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:58,640
trying so hard understanding and then feeling guilty like ah it's like oh the sense of trust

222
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:06,800
the body the embodiment with kindness there's there is opening to wisdom of the body

223
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:13,680
and the mind the embodied mind that gets it and deep deep gratitude for that as

224
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:20,880
you said beautiful i so appreciate you sharing that brightens my heart thank you

225
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,078
oh sweet sarah please

226
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:33,680
hi thank you first of all and kind of to piggyback off of that i feel

227
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:38,720
like well i was experiencing during the meditation

228
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:45,760
just this experimentation with moving the locus of how i understand me

229
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:52,319
from my head into my heart and like as if i had eyes like in my

230
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:57,359
heart because i think that's a lot of where vision

231
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:04,560
like i see out of here so i'm located here but trying to drop that down into

232
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:11,680
my chest and i it's the first time i've ever tried that like living from an awareness here

233
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:16,800
instead of here it's just it was interesting for me awesome

234
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:22,480
yay thanks for sharing that that's beautiful i love that and and

235
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,920
actually i'm going to ask you if it's okay for you to have mute again oh lost you where did you go raise your hand

236
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:33,680
again oh oh i wanted to ask you to yes there you are thanks to uh and was there

237
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:40,160
a was there something that arose and then just and again if there are no words for it

238
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:47,119
don't feel like you're on the spot but if there's anything else i'd love to invite you to

239
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:52,400
um reflect on it out loud yeah i think

240
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:58,240
it got less judgmental immediately

241
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:04,160
and it felt really challenging too i will have to say because i it's so

242
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:09,839
habitual to live from my eyeballs and my brain um

243
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:16,640
and in some ways i'm like can i like re like plastic surgery this these days is

244
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:23,760
it good enough to bring my eyeballs down here i don't know yeah yeah yeah that's beautiful thank

245
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:30,240
you for saying that that's lovely yeah so so that both it is challenging because habitually like yeah we

246
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:35,280
associate ourselves our our perspective with our head

247
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:41,599
not from our heart and yet as you said judgments drop there's a sense of oh

248
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:46,640
heartfulness so one thing that i would so so you've discovered this yay

249
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:53,200
beautiful keep exploring keep experimenting and also if others wanted to experiment

250
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:58,319
with that i would invite actually this is an improv

251
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:03,920
exercise or practice i've done when i've done mindfulness and improv day longs which i

252
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:09,440
haven't done for a while thanks to the pandemic but anyway um you can imagine

253
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:15,040
that there is an orb there is an orb of light there's just an orb of light which

254
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:20,560
is compassionate and loving and and and imagine that's in your chest and i

255
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:25,920
was like oh yeah you're bleeding with that you're leading with your chest into the world not with your head not with

256
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:31,440
your hips actually you can try all of those ways of walking in the world but you're leading with your heart you're

257
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:39,200
leading with this orb in your heart and you're just you're looking around look at this orb this light is looking around

258
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:44,880
uh in the world so so i invite you to to check that out

259
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:51,280
so so it's time to turn towards small groups i want to make sure we have enough time

260
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:59,119
for them claire i do see your hand we're going to come back to you at the end so so i'd like to invite us to

261
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:04,880
to practice in small groups to take these insights

262
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:11,680
to take this way of being together um to the way of we have been alone

263
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:16,960
uh with and actually let's practice with this orb of light in our chest actually

264
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:22,480
let's let's let's take this um let's take the show on the road so as

265
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:30,160
you enter the small groups try this on for signs and it might be clunky might be challenging as just reported by sarah

266
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:36,160
or might actually drop the judgments like oh yeah there's this sense of brightness my heart there's the

267
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:42,240
brightness in my heart i trust there is this brightness in my heart this goodness this

268
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:49,440
meditates it's there it's just there and that's what's shining when i'm talking just i'm shining i'm talking from the

269
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:55,680
center of my heart so and then practically speaking

270
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:01,359
we'll be in roughly groups of three and each person will have

271
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:09,280
a nugget they'll share about a nugget and then the next person will share a nugget and the third person round and round

272
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:16,000
so it's not not a long monologue but just one nugget you're sharing from your own experience not

273
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:23,119
managing asking others about their experience but just staying close to your orb to your orb of

274
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:28,720
light of goodness shining and receiving others receiving others with care with

275
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:35,200
love see what that feels like i'd love to hear your report when you come back to see what this this

276
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:43,838
improv so we're doing this improv experiment right um see what this improv improv experiment

277
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,839
is like so so with that i'm going to open the rooms

278
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:57,520
take care of yourselves take care of each other and here we go okay

279
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:04,720
the rooms are closed everyone's back welcome back everyone so um

280
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:10,960
even though we're at time i'd love to hear maybe one person perhaps maybe they would share quickly what was it like

281
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:16,720
experimenting with this orb of goodness of light in the chest

282
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:23,040
which was inspired by sarah's report anybody would like to share that please raise your hand don't

283
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:29,520
be shy did you experiment with it what was it like

284
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:39,839
going once you can also type in chat if you're shy

285
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:46,480
any experimenters i don't see any

286
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:52,559
okay i see sarah again all right sarah you get the last word

287
00:47:52,559 --> 00:48:00,240
i actually was gonna defer to vicky had wanted to raise her hand oh there's vicky okay vicky

288
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,000
oh you're muted still vicky

289
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:12,960
okay i had an experience because i was so in the middle of this i think you just

290
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:18,079
opened your eyes as my cat knocked off something that came crashing to the floor

291
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:24,400
and so after and i grabbed the cat got the cat off and and didn't have time to see what it

292
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:32,640
was but spent the rest of time trying to forgive myself for being reactive and then in the end it was a light bulb

293
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:38,240
and so i i had a lot of experience to say well coming back to this it really

294
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:43,680
didn't matter it was the cat was playing cat

295
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:50,480
yeah yeah the cat was playing cat

296
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:56,000
just the fact that it was a light bulb when we were talking about bringing light to something and

297
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:02,319
oh my gosh nikki's gonna think i'm the most reactive person in the world in the middle of meditation completely involved

298
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:10,480
with what you were saying and then reacting and then just that's hilarious i didn't even notice

299
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:17,839
all this story all this papancha this story of what will nikki think of mean i'm a terrible meditator

300
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:24,319
i didn't even know that i didn't even see anything oh my god but i was compassionate for the cat

301
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:30,480
because in the middle of my meditation it's gonna hurt its paw so i have to get out of my

302
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:38,079
presence here so it was an interesting meditation [Laughter]

303
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:44,559
i appreciate that i appreciate actually you know what i'm going to say one last thing and then to wrap it up the fact

304
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:50,720
that it was a challenging meditation and then it actually the there's so many

305
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:56,480
lessons in the quote-unquote the challenges of the that the mind was creating right there were so many chunks

306
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:01,839
like what what what is she gonna think like oh i'm real it's like oh it's just

307
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:07,200
the cat was doing its thing it's just like it's okay it's all okay and it's

308
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:12,880
much to do about nothing right and that is the point right that's that's

309
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:20,240
so gift for this the gift of this challenging meditation that's just beautiful thank you vicky that's great

310
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:26,319
lovely and kitten says the light often shines way ahead and not in proximity

311
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:32,319
