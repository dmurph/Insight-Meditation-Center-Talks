00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,480
foreign

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:16,020
it's a a treat for me to be here with you all in in this role and uh

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,300
many of you know how much I love this Sangha

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:28,380
and so I have this nice feeling of being surrounded by friends

5
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:35,880
and I'm very grateful to you for that so I'd like to let you know that I'm

6
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,340
speaking to you from a very remote part of the south of France

7
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:47,100
where the internet is iffy at best I think the sound is going to be okay uh

8
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:53,039
is it okay so far um but the the video might be a bit

9
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,739
choppy so

10
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,780
um let's begin this meditation by

11
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:10,979
formulating Our intention what is it that motivates you to

12
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:19,020
practice meditation so take a moment now to articulate

13
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,780
your heartfelt wish for this meditation

14
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:43,740
and now assuming a meditation posture whether you're sitting or lying down

15
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:49,860
find a position that allows you to have some stability

16
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,420
and also ease

17
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:04,979
and as we get settled feeling the support of the Earth

18
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:08,360
which is holding all of us

19
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:19,200
aligning the spine relaxing softening the face

20
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:26,840
the shoulders arms the belly the legs

21
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:35,700
and this week we'll be beginning with um a little bit of meta meditation as a

22
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:43,379
preparation for insight so the invitation is to bring to mind

23
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:50,360
a benefactor somebody who's always been a positive force for you

24
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:57,480
it could be a little child a dear friend maybe a pet

25
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:04,620
or a teacher maybe even a teacher you've never met and when you see this being you feel

26
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,720
nourished and glad

27
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:19,640
a smile may come to the corners of your mouth or to the corners of your eyes

28
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:26,099
now invite this being to come and sit in front of you

29
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:30,319
and you look into each other's eyes

30
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:36,540
and a little flame begins to warm your heart

31
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:43,940
as you enjoy being together it's a warm two-way connection

32
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:50,239
and you open your heart and you wish them well

33
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:57,019
may you be safe and protect it

34
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:05,599
may be happy peaceful and free

35
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:13,159
and naturally they are simultaneously wishing you the same thing

36
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,959
and so together you can take that warmth that exists in your relationship

37
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:29,699
and experiment with radiating out that kindness that you have for each other

38
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:33,080
in all directions

39
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,380
may we and all beings be safe and protected

40
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,840
happy peaceful

41
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,740
and free

42
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,880
and you've created this warm safe space with this benefactor and if you like

43
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:09,800
now you can invite them to come and sit beside you for the rest of the meditation

44
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:16,259
and now keeping this little flame of kindness alive

45
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:23,039
we bring in some wisdom namely consciously putting all our

46
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,320
worries grievances fears wanting

47
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:35,180
outside our meditation space no need for them here

48
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:45,080
perhaps close in the eyes that's comfortable

49
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,240
and connecting with this body breathing

50
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:01,940
and the connection itself may have a flavor of warmth and friendliness

51
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:12,860
breathing in silently welcoming the present moment

52
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:22,400
breathing out thrusting present moment

53
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:34,199
resting the mind to take refuge in just being here

54
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,800
breathing

55
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:51,960
being here breathing in and breathing out

56
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:58,699
with a little flame of friendliness in our hearts

57
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:27,560
we receive the sensations of the breath

58
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,960
and trusting that for this short time it's wholesome

59
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:39,020
to let the thinking mind take a rest

60
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:44,360
that it's enough just to be here

61
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:50,160
in the protective presence of this beautiful

62
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,020
far flung Sangha

63
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,060
knowing the whole in-breath

64
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,478
knowing the pause after the in-breath

65
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:27,680
knowing the whole out breath and then the pause after the out breath

66
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:45,360
and this tender knowing of the cycle of the breath

67
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:53,160
takes place in the context of a warm heart where a little candle of benevolence

68
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,300
keeps radiating

69
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:16,760
breathing in silently welcoming the present moment

70
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:23,600
breathing out trusting

71
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,860
what arises in the present moment

72
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:10,140
as we breathe in welcoming as we breathe out

73
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,040
trusting

74
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:26,399
and if the Mind should wander all right here we go again

75
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:33,500
and with a smile and smile is very important we come back

76
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:39,379
back to this body breathing

77
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:46,980
and back to the warmth of breathing while radiating kindness

78
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,600
as far as it wants to go

79
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:20,480
breathing in welcoming breathing out

80
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:24,259
radiating kindness

81
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:57,660
and if the corners of the mouth want to turn up in a smile

82
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:01,940
you can welcome that on the in-breath

83
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:10,740
radiating kindness from the heart

84
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,940

foreign

87
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:07,260
and breathing out dwelling in the ecosystem

88
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:15,240
of benevolence and inviting receptivity

89
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,140
it's a joint project that we're doing together here

90
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:38,240
creating this ecosystem of benevolence

91
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:54,200
which may help us to become more receptive

92
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,039
and at ease

93
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:09,900
and as we come to the end of the sitting through the goodness of our practiced

94
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:17,720
may we from our Center of kindness and receptivity

95
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:23,399
now radiate our heartfelt wish

96
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:29,120
that all beings everywhere be safe

97
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:38,898
obviously this world is not safe for everyone

98
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:45,179
but it can still be our sincere wish

99
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:49,220
that we can pour energy into

100
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,700
may all beings be happy

101
00:29:57,779 --> 00:30:01,940
may all beings be peaceful

102
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:10,220
and may all beings everywhere be free

103

104

109
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:03,240
delighted uh to be here with you all uh

110
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:11,220
the theme for this week will be on opening what I'm calling uh the

111
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:17,099
Dharma heart and as many of you know I'm a big fan of

112
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:23,280
Gil franstal's teachings and so um in the

113
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:29,099
last series that he gave last year at the end of December was called ready to change

114
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:34,878
he introduced us to five qualities from the brahmaio

115
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:41,940
which is Maji manikaya 91. and just to give you a little background

116
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:47,580
and put it up as you may know was born into a culture that was dominated by

117
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:52,858
brahmanic religion rules caste distinctions

118
00:34:52,859 --> 00:35:00,060
and in teaching something different the Buddha was proposing something quite revolutionary

119
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:05,339
so often when you see uh discourses where there's a conversation

120
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:11,520
with a brahmanas often a a contest of who's the better debater and who's got

121
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:20,820
the the angle on the truth but in this one um the brahmana ramayu who was 120 years

122
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:27,300
old and at the end of his life he was the oldest the wealthiest and the most

123
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:35,660
respected brahmana in the land and he became convinced that the Buddha was fully enlightened and was as he said

124
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:41,359
the incomparable teacher of gods and humans

125
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:49,440
so when the Buddha came to his uh part of the land the Brahman brahmau came with his great

126
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:55,320
retinue of uh disciples and bowed down to the Buddha

127
00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:03,000
and kissed his feet and he asked the Buddha how does one become an aura hunt

128
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,780
how does one Attain completeness

129
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:18,140
I was one a silent Sage and how is one called a Buddha

130
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,119
so the Buddha

131
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:31,560
gave ramayu um what we call Progressive instruction

132
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:36,960
starting with the importance of virtue and pronunciation

133
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,140
and then when the Buddha saw that romayu's mind had the five qualities

134
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:47,940
that ensured that he was ready for enlightenment the Buddha transmitted his deepest

135
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:53,880
teachings and

136
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:59,720
remind you became enlightened on the spot and he exclaimed at the end

137
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:06,420
magnificent master gotama you have made the dhamma clear

138
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:13,440
ing upright what had been overthrown revealing what was hidden

139
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:21,020
showing the way to one who was lost holding up a lamp in the dark

140
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:27,240
and then everybody was amazed at this you know famous Raman

141
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:33,440
went forth then as a lay disciple of the Buddha

142
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:40,320
so this week I'd like to further explore these five wholesome qualities that

143
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:48,799
prepare the mind for insight for awakening so that we can cultivate them

144
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:54,839
and the verse of these qualities uh is in poly called Kala

145
00:37:54,839 --> 00:38:00,240
and it has many different um nuances in poly

146
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:05,339
Gil translated it as being ready receptive

147
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:10,560
and available but the root of the word actually means

148
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:16,320
accomplish and the commentary on this uh discourse

149
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:22,760
speaks of Carla referring to someone with a sound mind

150
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:29,040
so it looks like um having this quality of a mind that is

151
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:38,160
color means that one has done a sort of mental Fitness training and is prepared to wake

152
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:44,579
up so earlier we began our meditation by

153
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:53,040
articulating our deepest intention for what brings us to the meditation

154
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:58,500
and if we want to cultivate mental Fitness then intention is very

155
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:04,920
important because knowing what we're aiming for helps us keep our Focus as we walk the

156
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:11,000
path so uh if you permit I'll share with you

157
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,800
my own intention um which I come back to when I meditate and

158
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:23,420
and sometimes when challenges come up during the day I say to myself

159
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:30,119
may I be a safe haven of kindness and emptiness

160
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:33,319
for all beings

161
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:40,680
that's my aspiration so sitting and attention will be

162
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:48,619
different for each of us depending on how we got to where we're at today

163
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:57,000
uh in my case having lived through an abusive childhood marked by

164
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,520
violence from my father and a mother who did not protect me

165
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:09,900
it's been a long path including being incarcerated in a mental

166
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:15,800
hospital for almost two years when I was a teenager

167
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:23,040
so for me this sense of safety is Paramount if I'm going to relax and let

168
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:30,260
go on meditation instead of dwelling in the past or going off into the future

169
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:38,160
so I aspire to be a safe haven for everyone I come into contact with

170
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:45,000
and then the kindness and emptiness um play the most important roles for me

171
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:52,020
in becoming this Safe Haven kindness because there's no situation

172
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:59,540
where kindness towards others or towards oneself is not beneficial

173
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:08,339
and I guess it's maybe kind of hard to under to imagine emptiness as a foundation

174
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:13,859
but I do believe that its emptiness and perhaps this is ironic

175
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:21,599
um it provides me the foundation that allows for being benevolent with

176
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:29,099
others and with myself empty of Me Myself and mine

177
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:37,578
empty of fixed ideas and wanted to be right or to be seen as accomplished

178
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:43,440
because when the mind wanders away from the pristine Simplicity of the present

179
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:48,540
moment and Spins off and thinking who's at the center of all

180
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:54,540
that well it's the little me

181
00:41:54,540 --> 00:42:02,779
the little girl who wants to be liked who wants to be protected maybe even loved

182
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:08,760
and there were people who hated the Buddha but that didn't bother him in the

183
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:15,740
slightest the jealousy the hatred that was their problem

184
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:23,720
so how about if we had a mind that was empty of needing approval

185
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:31,400
sound like a good deal it would be a good deal for me

186
00:42:32,339 --> 00:42:39,480
because the mind is if it's not full of all these self-referencing

187
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:46,980
and fix the ideas wonderful a mind that like the Buddha can dwell in

188
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:52,140
emptiness allows us to greet everyone as a friend

189
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:59,599
including ourselves to greet each moment as a friend

190
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:06,300
so I think mental Fitness is being ready to receive

191
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:12,180
and if we're already full with lots of ideas opinions and a needy ego there's

192
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:19,020
not a lot of space to receive so walking this path

193
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:24,660
can be seen as a process of emptying little by little emptying the mind of

194
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:33,359
everything that's unwholesome the early text talk uh about opening the

195
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:38,599
Dharma eye and this is what happened to ramayan

196
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:44,940
so what I'd like to suggest to you for this week is that we can prepare

197
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:54,180
for the Insight that is opening the Dharma eye by beginning to progressively open

198
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,200
the Dharma heart

199
00:43:59,339 --> 00:44:05,160
daring to open our hearts and to let the Dharma

200
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,420
take us where it will

201
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:21,500
thank you so much for being here today and I look forward to being with you again tomorrow

202
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,599
thank you
