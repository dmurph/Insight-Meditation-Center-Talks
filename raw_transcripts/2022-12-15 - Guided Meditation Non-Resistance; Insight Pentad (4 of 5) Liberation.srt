1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:04,580
so hello everyone and welcome back

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:12,840
continuing this theme on the Insight pentad theme of the week

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,840
and um and one of the

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,600
powers of insight is to see things in a new way

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:31,740
and I'd like to suggest a new way as we start the this meditation

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,260
we often start with relaxation and that's still I think a very good

7
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:44,219
thing to do and that kind of goes along with the Buddhist teachings too to relax the body relax the mind

8
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:53,420
it's kind of his beginning instructions for meditation and um but um

9
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:00,660
another similar movement at the beginning and throughout meditation

10
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,900
that's also very powerful is rather than relaxing

11
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,840
uh directly is to um

12
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:19,280
stop resisting stop resisting

13
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:27,180
whatever it is you're bracing yourself against holding yourself against or protecting yourself against

14
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,340
in the context of meditation so um

15
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:38,220
to take a part of the significance of taking a

16
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:44,400
a careful posture up upright dignified posture

17
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:51,299
or other postures but the idea says really take a posture that works well for you and then to hold it

18
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:59,340
stay in it don't don't collapse don't give in to the emotions the feelings the

19
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:06,000
beliefs the desires to do something else

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,200
and um with your body so it's quite significant to feel all

21
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:20,640
the movements in the body to move to to shift to collapse to pull back

22
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,280
but more subtly there is all kinds of ways in which the tension

23
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,680
we hold in our body it can be a resistance resistance from feeling fully

24
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:40,220
resistance from resistance holding ourselves against having to feel what's really happening

25
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:47,580
sometimes it's uh what motivates us with our desires might not might not be the

26
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:54,480
desires themselves but the discomfort that can come with strong desire and we're trying to resist

27
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,420
that discomfort by by maybe acting out or doing something

28
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:09,300
or pulling back a lot of the resistance is a kind of attention but uh relaxing the body is different

29
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:15,239
than releasing the resistance um and because even things which are

30
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:21,780
maybe things you're protecting yourselves in the moment the feelings the sensations the beliefs to release

31
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:27,599
them to free them while we're sitting still and upright so we're not giving

32
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:35,459
expression to them we're not acting on them speaking them but we are not holding them in check

33
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:40,560
and we're allowing some kind of full relaxation of the body that comes from

34
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,780
releasing all the resistance we have so if this is relevant for you or

35
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:52,560
understandable for you and how you are maybe at this meditation we can begin or

36
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,260
focus on releasing resistance

37
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:03,720
and this is one of the characteristics of Freedom that The Liberation that

38
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:11,159
Buddhism is looking for is Liberation from all tension including that of resistance

39
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:17,519
and then how to live wisely without this embodied physical emotional mental

40
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:24,500
resistance that lives in US that is the great art

41
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:31,080
so assuming a upright dignified posture

42
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,638
or the alternative for you

43
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:45,320
and gently closing your eyes

44
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:53,699
and feeling into your body

45
00:04:53,699 --> 00:05:01,320
feeling the tensions the Holdings in your body and see if any of it might qualify as

46
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:06,720
resistance pulling back from life

47
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,460
protecting ourselves from something

48
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:22,979
and as you exhale release resistance

49
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:31,680
release the way that we're physically bracing ourselves or

50
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,780
holding ourselves pulled back

51
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:45,080
fending off for avoiding

52
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:53,880
any resistance release it and let what's behind the resistance

53
00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:00,319
have breathing room have space just to be

54
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:07,220
in the Simplicity of sitting upright

55
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,660
and might there be any resistance to be found in your breathing

56
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:34,020
in any part of the inhale maybe the second half do you feel anything holding the

57
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,800
breathing back

58
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:52,500
and if so if it's easy enough let go of that

59
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,680
holding back let go of resistance

60
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,439
and if it's not easy to let go of

61
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:09,680
content yourself with feeling inhale

62
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,660
stretching against that resistance

63
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,740
any resistance in the exhale

64
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:53,120
and he holding back maybe at the end of the exhale not allowing it to release fully

65
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,779
foreign

66
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,200
foreign

67
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:35,299
thank you

68
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:32,820
if you sit quietly and still but let go of resistance

69
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:40,820
in the body the heart the mind what releases

70
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:47,179
what becomes larger or more evident

71
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:56,480
make room for it breathe with it Let It Be Free

72
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:04,400
while you're free from acting on it

73
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,299
thank you

74
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,280
foreign

75
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,320
here

76
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:20,059
foreign

77
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,700
foreign

78
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:51,960
x three exhales let go release

79
00:27:53,640 --> 00:28:01,700
give up resistance to what's here for you make room for everything

80
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:10,760
and then imagine that the room of awareness expands outward

81
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:18,120
out into the world nothing's required of you

82
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:24,360
but you're able to include people in your awareness

83
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:31,320
remember people those you know and don't know those you

84
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:39,080
will encounter and work and communities and stores

85
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:50,220
and to let go of any resistance to being present

86
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:55,260
taking people in taking them into account

87
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:58,700
and caring for them

88
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:09,740
may we carry with us to stay enough

89
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:15,960
free time in our minds where our mind isn't not so preoccupied

90
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:23,360
we don't have time to register or take in the presence of other people

91
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:30,360
and may we gaze upon them with appreciation and respect

92
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,820
with love care

93
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:45,080
may we imagine them happy safe and peaceful and free

94
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:51,659
and maybe this be our wish that they have a wonderful life

95
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:55,039
happy and safe

96
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:03,539
may all beings have the Good Fortune to experience

97
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:10,380
great happiness may all beings

98
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:14,899
had the Good Fortune of being saved

99
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:20,820
may all beings have all the benefits that come with

100
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:29,779
peace and may all beings be free of affliction

101
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:36,919
tensions attachments suffering

102
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:45,980
and may our freedom our lack of resistance

103
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:52,580
be the source of our care for the world

104
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:27,600
so my friends we come to the fourth talk on the insight pentad

105
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:33,799
and uh it's the five

106
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:41,880
kind of uh movements Evolution's growth in the practice that flow from having insight

107
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:49,260
and the word flow suggests that it's not something we do or construct or make happen but something that as we see

108
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:56,820
clearly more we see clearly what we're doing what's happening in our minds our beliefs or our attachments our desires

109
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:02,520
our aversions our resistance as we see it more clearly really clearly

110
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:10,799
and we see deeply into its nature its impermanent changing constructed nature

111
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:18,419
that we begin to let go we begin to be disinterested or we start

112
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:25,500
changing our relationship to it where we're not so wedded to it or invested in it and there's a disinvestment process

113
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:31,260
that goes on and a fading away of the desires the

114
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:40,440
attachments that keep us caught that keep us from being free and the consequence of this is greater

115
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:47,279
and greater calmness peacefulness ease and so the reward is that there is a

116
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:53,760
reward it isn't just simply being left somehow

117
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,880
in some undesirable state of destitution

118
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,440
as as with this fading away of attachment fading away of clinging happens

119
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:10,380
it leaves us Freer and Freer and uh and the freedom The Liberation

120
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:15,960
that comes is uh why it's significant why it's part of this Evolution this

121
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:22,980
growth this flow is it's not something we do it's not a letting go it's not something we find the key that we turn

122
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:28,620
it releases something the lock and we the combination and we finally free

123
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:34,860
but rather it's a the uh the result of

124
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:42,360
this fading away calming relaxing not resisting not asserting not tense

125
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:50,220
wanting a real radical trust to really just be here fully fully fully present

126
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:55,620
in a calm relaxed way allowing things to fade away

127
00:33:55,620 --> 00:34:03,179
and that at some point something inside of us releases it's uh there's a something that we're

128
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:08,520
not doing let's go stops ceases

129
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:15,599
and sometimes it can be a moment shift like a like a quantum

130
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:22,740
flip in the mind where something in the mind just stops and uh and now it's just everything is

131
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:28,560
so clear and open and free it could be in the heart finally settles

132
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,839
in his openness at home in itself and the Heart finally has lots of breathing room

133
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:39,060
and the heart just feels like it's it can sing and it's so free and so light

134
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:45,300
and so easy but the operating thing here is not something we do and we can't exactly

135
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:52,919
take responsibility for it in terms of making it happen we take responsibility for setting up the conditions for that

136
00:34:52,919 --> 00:35:01,020
freedom and a huge part of this Dharma practice is creating the right conditions for

137
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:08,099
allowing something the Dharma to move through US allowing release opening development to move through us

138
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:13,680
and and that begins right at the beginning of the gladness pentad that

139
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:19,020
what precedes the insight pentate that we have it begins with enough trust and

140
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:25,260
inspiration to start being present for our experience in a non-reactive way

141
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:32,339
and finding that this presence it feels good there's joy and happiness that comes calmness that comes

142
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:39,720
until we see more clearly and we can start kind of get calm enough still enough to see deep enough

143
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:45,240
and then this process is fading away process that a lot of the we look sometimes

144
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:51,720
we're looking for I used to look for sitted meditation kind of like a like a

145
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:57,119
cat that a mouse door waiting to see if I can see the Letting Go happen the

146
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:03,119
releasing happening finding out where the magic was the magic point was where I could finally kind of penetrate

147
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:08,760
something and everything would let go and I found out over and over again that

148
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:15,839
there was this process of fading away and ceasing and things disappearing but I didn't always see when that moment

149
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:21,780
happened and if sometimes the meditation practice set the conditions for it to happen and

150
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:27,780
then after meditation is when the releasing happened and I didn't see it happen but at some point I recognized oh

151
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:34,440
it's gone the resistance the desires the clinging the conceit the things I was caught up

152
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:42,780
with wow they're gone isn't that that's phenomenal and um and so this uh setting up the

153
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:50,160
conditions for the fading away for the calming down for the centering for the settling

154
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:57,500
uh not for its own sake but so that uh that which is uh

155
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:04,680
the suffering inside of us that comes from that comes from some tight clinging or holding or resisting

156
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:11,579
has a chance to melt away to thaw into this process of fading away that I

157
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:18,240
talked about yesterday sometimes I think of it like thawing or being really cold and just kind of

158
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:25,440
slowly warming up melting dissolving it's a process of slow change

159
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:32,220
that we allow for and so if we're in meditation we have to sit in meditation

160
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:40,020
long enough still enough regularly enough that we allow for this deeper process to

161
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:46,380
happen it's a meditative process where some deeper deeper kind of fading

162
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:52,320
settling releasing can happen for most people much better in Daily than in

163
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:57,420
daily life and any other kind of circumstance um

164
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:02,520
and it grows the more we sit the more we meditate and just learn to sit still

165
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:07,920
letting go of resistance letting go of clinging letting go of tension

166
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:14,520
and trusting how things are fading away fading away settling quieting quieting

167
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:20,940
letting go of our thoughts coming back letting go of our thoughts coming back letting go over thoughts coming back in

168
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:28,079
a gentle quieting way setting up the conditions that allows something to feel at ease to feel peaceful to feel

169
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:34,400
comfortable and um and so it becomes uh invaluable

170
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:41,940
to learn to have a mindfulness awareness that's non-reactive an awareness which

171
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:47,880
is not for or against anything that's not despairing or upset or

172
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:53,160
resisting anything that's not critical of when the mind wanders off

173
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:59,820
and keep going back to this non-resistance awareness that is kind of gives the space

174
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:05,099
for things to release to settle to calm to open

175
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:11,339
and at some point you'll uh recognize

176
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:19,020
that what encumbered you with the inner movements of tightness and fear and resistance and

177
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:26,460
holding on and expecting wanting projecting that you do you'll find wow

178
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:32,700
it's not there and that is the kind of liberation

179
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:37,920
in the teachings of the Buddha he describes a whole list of the I think

180
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,320
the 17 18 things that he lists a number of times things a very particular things

181
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:49,020
that people discovered now it's gone wow and uh it's interesting things like

182
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:54,900
greed and hatred but Envy avariciousness um conceit

183
00:39:54,900 --> 00:40:01,800
um disrespect disrespecting people

184
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:11,000
um it goes on all these different things but what I'm emphasizing here is he's very he names particular mental States

185
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:18,060
that fall away that stop so it's not a generalized kind of like

186
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:23,099
some general vague idea of what Liberation is he specifies different

187
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:30,420
states of Mind different emotions and things so it's very particular psychologically particular oh look at

188
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:38,880
that my Envy is gone look at that my resentment is gone look at that my remorse my desires my

189
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,240
greed my lust my um

190
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:50,880
my self-criticism is gone so it's these particular psychological states that he

191
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:57,920
says oh liberated liberated liberated and then that Liberation can grow

192
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,320
into more and more and more complete and

193
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:09,960
to be but to recognize it ah look there it's gone and I was struck when I learned about

194
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:17,400
this part of the Buddhist teachings many names particular psychological States that um

195
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:24,780
that was kind of eye-opening for me because I I kind of had just I realized only then that I had some vague idea

196
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:30,839
that there was some great experience of Enlightenment out there that I didn't know what it was but it certainly must

197
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:39,300
be good and certainly desirable and certainly going to free me from all my suffering and um and I don't even then when I

198
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:44,339
spread there's like 17 different mental States psychological states that the Buddha

199
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:50,700
each one talked about seeing how it's gone I said oh let's appreciate the

200
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:57,359
specificity of what is what Liberation I have what are the things that I and let's not

201
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:02,460
be held kind of captivated with the idea of some Grand

202
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:07,980
Big Bang Theory of Enlightenment that somehow is vague what actually happens

203
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:14,040
there uh begin appreciating the liberations of

204
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:20,040
particular things that have bothered us memories Stories We Hold On To

205
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:25,500
relationships we hold on to and to see although I'm free of that I'm

206
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:32,040
free of that and so this process of fading away and then discovering oh it's not there

207
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:39,180
anymore wow uh appreciate the not theirness

208
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:45,000
of suffering of painful psychological states that were there

209
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:54,140
but when they're you're free of them that is a nourishing that's really important to see ah now it's gone

210
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:59,700
so having insights seeing clearly enough

211
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:05,119
to start becoming disenchanted

212
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:12,180
to then have the fading away of the psychological drives that

213
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:18,540
kept us Enchanted and then having that fade away enough that we feel free of it

214
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:24,000
it's a wonderful thing and that this is a natural process to do this

215
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,180
it's not something we have to make happen it's kind of like natural means it's kind of built into who we are it's

216
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:36,720
almost a consequence of uh ending doing the unnatural things

217
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:42,000
and what I mean by the unnatural things the things that are the artifices of our

218
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,760
own mind that we create that make and and construct

219
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:54,859
and the interstates that are not the artifices like that freedom

220
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:02,220
so thank you and one more day on this insight pentad

221
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:10,140
and um so you might go through the day today with some homework and that is to notice

222
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:16,680
the times through the day notice the absence

223
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:21,960
of difficult psychological States suffering clingings desires resistance

224
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:27,839
that you have had at some point in the past earlier in the day yesterday last week

225
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:34,380
but notice the absence of them and take in how good that is

226
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:41,460
that something was difficult before is not here now you might have other difficulties now

227
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:47,040
but appreciate the ones that are no longer here and see what happens to you when you

228
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:52,079
kind of feel that absence so

229
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:55,400
thank you very much
