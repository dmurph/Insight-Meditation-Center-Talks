1
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:11,519
foreign welcome it's lovely to be here with you

2
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,059
and I I really do appreciate your being here with me

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,820
so here we are today

4
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:33,379
in a community where we're creating together uh opening the Dharma heart

5
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:39,120
cultivating wholesome qualities in our arts and Minds

6
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,840
Monday it was focusing on receptivity

7
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,899
yesterday cultivating a softness of mind

8
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:58,739
and today is perhaps uh an ambitious one of cultivating a mind that is

9
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:05,518
unobstructed so I'm sure many of you are familiar with the five hindrances

10
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,520
those unwholesome states of mind sensual desire

11
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:18,360
wanting not wanting aversion ill will

12
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,438
Loth and torpor or feeling rigid and stuck

13
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:32,659
the agitation of restlessness and worry and the hindrance of doubt

14
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:39,360
so to make this a doable project for a 30-minute meditation

15
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,880
we'll try to create the conditions where we can notice if one of these unskillful

16
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,780
tendencies starts to arise and see how we might let go of it

17
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,720
so let's begin by vowing to be gentle with ourselves

18
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:04,398
kind with that mind that may be spinning off in thoughts

19
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:10,380
and if we see that the mind has been spinning for a while it's no problem

20
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:18,180
we can Rejoice that we've seen it and we come back to being present

21
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,959
here in this body breathing

22
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,500
and then comes the important part appreciating what it's like

23
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:38,660
when that negative tendency subsides even if only temporarily

24
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:47,160
so as we have been doing and will continue to do this week we begin

25
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:54,780
with each of us setting Our intention or this period of meditation

26
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,180
what motivates us to practice

27
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:23,060
and now taking your meditation posture sitting or lying down

28
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,760
connecting with the Earth

29
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,640
and aligning the spine

30
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,099
so feeling your seat or

31
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:47,360
your body on the bed and the Earth supporting you

32
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:56,099
and feeling your spine as in a live space where the energy can flow through

33
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:02,879
you up from the earth and out to the heavens

34
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,980
and you could also appreciate the energy that comes down

35
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:13,340
from the sky through you and into the Earth

36
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:26,280
it's important to try to Center the head a little bit on the spine so that it's not

37
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:35,000
logging forward or looking out for being off to the one side or the other

38
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:50,340
so with our alignment as balanced as comfortable as we can

39
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:58,080
make it you do a scan from the head down to the

40
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,419
toes relaxing the shoulders

41
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:07,880
foreign s and hands

42
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:15,740
the heart area the belly the hips

43
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,320
the legs and the feet

44
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:32,639
and if you can settle down into the stability of being here

45
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:41,100
it's really invaluable if you can refrain from moving while you meditate

46
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:48,440
just be here in this body the way it is without trying to change

47
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,698
what your circumstances are

48
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:06,180
and now we'll continue with some short meta meditation

49
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,400
the last two days we did it with a inviting a benefactor to come and

50
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:19,080
join us sitting in front of us and looking into their eyes and sharing okay

51
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,220
the well-wishing

52
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:30,440
I just heard somebody maybe there's a participant who's not muted

53
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:39,840
so if today you um are comfortable being your own benefactor you can try it that way or if

54
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,600
it's helpful for you to do that in the company of someone that

55
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:53,479
you yearly love and always feel good with that's that's fine as well

56
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:59,699
and what we're doing with this little bit of meta is warming up our

57
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:04,919
mindfulness meditation by lighting a little flame

58
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:11,880
in our hearts of kind friendliness towards ourselves

59
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:18,020
and towards whatever arises moment after moment

60
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:27,300
we're creating a safe space where we're protected by this feeling of warm

61
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:34,880
-hearted well-wishing towards ourselves and all beings

62
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,860
may I be safe and protected

63
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,520
may I be happy

64
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,840
may I be peaceful

65
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:05,180
may I be free

66
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:16,580
may all beings be safe may all beings be happy

67
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:24,440
may all beings be peaceful

68
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,680
and may all beings everywhere be free

69
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:40,219
and with this well-wishing we light a little candle in our hearts

70
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:48,899
bringing warmth receptivity softness

71
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:54,680
and openness to our mindfulness

72
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:03,360
and now we bring in the wisdom

73
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,480
The Vow that for this period of meditation

74
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,880
we'll do our best to help the body and the mind

75
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:22,440
to settle down it's the wisdom to know that we and our

76
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:30,019
community here are better off if each of us can leave our preoccupations

77
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:35,040
responsibilities worries concerns

78
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:41,839
outside of our meditation space no need for them now

79
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:54,420
so connecting with the breath and letting that little flame of wishing

80
00:09:54,420 --> 00:10:00,600
ourselves well in view our mindfulness

81
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,920
with a feeling of benevolence

82
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,500
enacting with the cycle of the breath

83
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:35,760
breathing in well-wishing

84
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,420
breathing out well wishing

85
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:53,000
breathing in safety breathing out happiness

86
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:04,220
breathing in peace breathing out of freedom

87
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:18,500
and just staying with a quiet

88
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:24,680
of the mind that is happy to be here just breathing

89
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,980
together with our like my dear friends from all over the world

90
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:18,680
breathing in [Music]

91
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,720
I'm sorry [Music]

92
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,540
sorry about that I must have forgotten to turn something off

93
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:35,839
so let's go back to the breathing

94
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:06,620
breathing in with a warm heart

95
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:16,040
and breathing out with a peaceful heart

96
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:34,040
feeling the beginning the middle and the end of the in-breath

97
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:47,000
the beginning the middle and the pause after the out breath

98
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:10,519
the quality of friendliness towards whatever arises

99
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:41,220
and letting ourselves be nourished by the quality of warm-heartedness

100
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:48,079
as we breathe in as we breathe out

101
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:00,779
and happy to open the windows and the doors

102
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:03,740
of the Mind

103
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,800
not shutting anything out

104
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:22,740
and not spinning off in useless thoughts foreign

105
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:06,920
heart radiate inwards as we breathe in

106
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:15,120
and letting it radiate outwards as far as it wants to go

107
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,320
as we breathe out

108
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:33,620
and if you should find yourself on a thought train

109
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:42,000
you could say I see you Mara so if you don't know who Mara is he was

110
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,100
the tempter who was Furious that the Buddha had so

111
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:54,059
many devoted followers and was so highly respected and Mara's job in life as far as he was

112
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:59,640
concerned was to knock the Buddha off of his

113
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:05,720
pedestal of Enlightenment and to knock all of his followers off as well

114
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:14,240
so uh I find this a very helpful image if

115
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,440
I I just give her oops you know that thought green for a while

116
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:27,960
and I just say I see you Mara and tomorrow when he's seen he's

117
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,360
defeated and he slunks away

118
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:40,980
so if we find ourselves thinking again

119
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:47,299
just coming back gently no judgments at all

120
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:55,020
and just with his simplicity of being here in this body

121
00:20:55,020 --> 00:21:01,740
in this breath and tasting

122
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:09,140
the goodness of even a second of just uh

123
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:04,020
if another thought starts to arise ah I see you

124
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:10,679
no thank you and with a smile you come back

125
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:19,640
being here in this body with the ebb on the flow of the breath

126
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:26,960
and gently daring to open the windows and doors

127
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:35,279
breathing in enjoying the spaciousness

128
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:41,640
of a moment of freedom letting in the warm sunlight

129
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:49,399
and the fresh air enjoying

130
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:55,278
these moments when the mind is unobstructed

131
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:05,840
breathing in radiating warm openness

132
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:12,720
breathing out radiating spaciousness

133
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,980
for all beings

134
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:42,299
breathing in openness breathing out spaciousness

135
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:29,820
and as we come to the end of this sitting with a mind that has benefited from

136
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:36,240
fresh air by opening some windows and doors

137
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:44,960
through the goodness of our practice may we from our Center of openness

138
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,840
now radiate our heartfelt wish

139
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:57,200
that all beings everywhere be safe

140
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:09,679
may all beings be happy may all beings be peaceful

141
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:16,100
and may all beings everywhere be free

142
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,099
[Music]

143
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,278
foreign

144
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:24,120
I do uh appreciate your presence

145
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:30,380
I appreciate your practice and I'm happy to be here with you

146
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:36,299
today's the third talk on opening the Dharma heart

147
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:43,679
and we're looking at five qualities of mind that the Buddha used himself to

148
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,840
see if someone was ready to become awakened

149
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:56,760
in Bali the word for mind is chitan and the qualities we're looking at this

150
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,720
week are

151
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:14,360
[Music] and someone yesterday asked

152
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:19,620
where this came from in Nepali Canon and um

153
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:26,720
although they're not one of the many Dharma lists that you often see in the early texts I looked it up and they do

154
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:33,779
occur as a group together uh nine times in the early teachings and

155
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:39,299
the text that I'm referring to is near the end of the Ramaya sutta which is

156
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:45,000
Maji manikaya 91. on Monday we talked about being

157
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:51,240
receptive available and ready to change

158
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:58,559
yesterday we evoked the quality of having a soft and malleable mind

159
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:04,200
and Gil talked about this process of suffering the mind with the idea that

160
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:10,260
we're each a work of art and in working to progressively become

161
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:18,360
more and more beneficial to ourselves and others having a mind that's stuck or rigid or

162
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:25,700
hard makes it difficult to change ourselves in a beneficial way

163
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:32,340
we need a mind that's receptive and also soft

164
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:39,080
so that we can shape the mind to become more and more beautiful

165
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:45,559
and today we come to the third quality which is

166
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:52,440
and probably V is a prefix meaning away from or not

167
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:57,379
and nevarana are the five hindrances

168
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:06,980
those powerful forces that we as humans all experience

169
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:14,760
the root word in poly for these hindrances is which is to block

170
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:22,880
so the hindrances are obstacles obstructions and barriers to Awakening

171
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:28,919
and it's important that we look at freeing ourselves from the hindrances as

172
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:34,740
a progressive task these five hindrances exist in each of

173
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:42,139
us on a spectrum from being completely caught to being completely free

174
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:50,220
as you may know the first hindrance is sensual desire wanting greed

175
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:57,440
the second is not wanting a version hatred ill will

176
00:33:57,539 --> 00:34:02,760
the third usually call it sloth and torper refers to resistance stiffness

177
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:08,658
shutting down the fourth includes restlessness

178
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:15,839
agitation worry regrets and the faith is doubt

179
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:22,858
doubt about the value of the Buddha's teachings or God about our own ability to walk

180
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:29,158
this path of freedom so one of our first jobs as a

181
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:34,460
practitioner is to get to know these forces in ourselves

182
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:41,638
to study what causes them to arise and to see the unskillfulness when we're

183
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:48,540
caught and reactive and then finding ways

184
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:56,780
to see them start to arise and having the wisdom to know this is not how I want to be

185
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:03,839
so in the process of getting to know our own unskillful qualities it's important

186
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:11,599
as a voice to remember to be kind to ourselves because we're Human After All

187
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:22,380
you might think of training the mind the way you would brain a sweet little puppy

188
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:28,920
but if you yell at the puppy and kick it every time it makes a mistake I'm going to end up with an angry

189
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:37,320
aggressive dog and if you want your puppy to grow up to be a happy relaxed loving dog

190
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:42,480
then you drain it with caresses and with treats

191
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:48,440
giving the puppy positive feedback every time it does something right

192
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:54,420
so in the same way without setting expectations too high

193
00:35:54,420 --> 00:36:01,800
we can give ourselves positive feedback by noticing the moments when the hindrances are in

194
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:09,480
advance and appreciating what it's like to be free of him these

195
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:17,460
obstructions if it if it's just for a second ah it's like we've opened the windows

196
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:23,339
and doors of the Mind and we can enjoy the healthy pleasure of

197
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:29,940
the sunlight and the fresh air what a relief

198
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:34,920
not to be spinning around in preoccupations

199
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:41,839
and the more often we notice the goodness of these moments of freedom

200
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:47,579
however short-lived they are the more we build the neural Pathways so

201
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:56,760
that letting these obstructive forces in the mind subside can happen more easily and more often

202
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:02,339
so take these moments of freedom in and Savor them

203
00:37:02,339 --> 00:37:08,940
without of course clinging or getting attached

204
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:17,900
it's enough just to say ah right now the mind is unobstructed

205
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:24,060
and I mind that instead of being caught up in Me Myself and mine

206
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:30,660
is open to the sunlight fresh air and spaciousness of the Dharma

207
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:38,700
that's beautiful so let yourself consciously receive and enjoy these

208
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:44,579
moments when the mind is unobstructed open

209
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:51,000
beautiful you can enjoy the taste of well-being

210
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:57,300
and gladness they come with letting in the light and the fresh air

211
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:04,380
of open awareness my first Buddhist teacher was the Zen

212
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:11,160
master Suzuki roshi and I began studying with him at what

213
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:17,280
was for me the tender age of 21 only two years after I had gotten out of

214
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:23,960
the mental hospital and I still had a lot of work to do with myself

215
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:29,220
and that struck me so deeply right away was

216
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:35,280
that the end of every period of meditation he would bow to each of us

217
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:42,720
as we came out of the meditation Hall and when he bowed to me he communicated

218
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:50,660
that there was something worth bowing to in the same way he would bow to a Buddha

219
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:57,480
no matter how screwed up we were he saw the beautiful potential

220
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:03,839
that each of us had and he treated everyone like a Buddha

221
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:08,880
and I had the Good Fortune to become his disciple and to be

222
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:14,059
on the receiving end of his unconditional love

223
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:20,359
and it wasn't uh because I was someone special

224
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:29,220
but it was it was amazing to just be with someone where

225
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:34,500
was convinced that there was nothing unworthy about me

226
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:40,740
I didn't have to worry about being worthy or unworthy it was enough

227
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:44,960
just to want to practice sincerely

228
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:54,599
and this is something we can do for ourselves we may have been taught that we were

229
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:59,940
inadequate unworthy or unlovable

230
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:07,520
but being inadequate or worse is a harmful Mirage that we can let go of

231
00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:15,900
and the beauty of this path is that even those of us who struggle with scars from

232
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:21,780
having been deeply traumatized are perfectly welcomed

233
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:30,660
this seed of the Buddha the beautiful Buddha is Alive and Well in each one of us

234
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:38,059
I hope you believe me it's alive and well in your own

235
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:45,960
so this path is about little by little learning not to cling to the unskillful

236
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:51,780
coverings that we thought were necessary to survive

237
00:40:51,780 --> 00:41:00,119
and in to enjoy the aliveness and taste the freedom we can experience

238
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:06,320
in moments when the doors and windows are unobstructed

239
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:16,320
so if you're for a little homework for the next 24 hours

240
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:22,440
see if you can slow down enough so that whenever possible

241
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:30,320
the mind can take a break from its reactivity from spinning off in thoughts

242
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:39,300
notice how beautiful it is to Simply abide even temporarily

243
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:46,940
in the moments when you're unobstructed in the absence of the hindrances

244
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:53,820
this moment of touching the doorknob the aliveness of being right there with

245
00:41:53,820 --> 00:42:00,060
the doorknob or mindfully cleaning the sink

246
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:05,160
and it's lovely to just be cleaning the sink or though

247
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:10,338
out all the commentary of the Mind

248
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,300
listening attentively to a loved one

249
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:22,740
without jumping ahead on how we want to reply

250
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:30,800
just being receptive soft and and without barriers for them

251
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:38,880
so the homework is to really touch into the joy and gladness

252
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:45,260
of those moments when you are fully present with your experience

253
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:55,020
so thank you for being here and know that I appreciate

254
00:42:55,020 --> 00:43:02,300
and am very much encouraged by your practice thank you
