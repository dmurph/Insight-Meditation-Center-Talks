1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:08,600
good evening good evening maybe we'll start the recording oh you did

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,879
already nice to see you all so tonight I'm going to continue on

3
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:19,960
this series of talks that I'm doing on like how how much effort do we need to

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:27,960
apply to our practice like how do we not only our practice but to everything that we're doing in our lives how do we like

5
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:35,520
choose a direction and have this sustained effort many different uh elements

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:44,039
there two weeks ago I talked about these um these five factors of endeavoring

7
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:51,239
these five factors of that contribute to like doing stuff and the Buddha talked about this

8
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:59,719
and um these five factors are confidence Vitality Integrity energy and wisdom and

9
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:05,040
we we can cultivate these and bring them to support us in our whatever it is that

10
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,200
we're wishing to do and then last week I talked a little

11
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,240
bit about um or I gave this story of about Prince bod was somebody who didn't

12
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:23,280
want to make effort in practice he just wanted to have all the fruits of practice but didn't want to make any

13
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,759
effort didn't want to apply himself maybe partly because he thought it would be nothing but painful you I have to say

14
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:36,759
if I had that idea I wouldn't want to do it either but then um the Buddha gave him

15
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:43,920
some teachings that were about this idea of resolve like you have to have a certain amount of resolve

16
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,920
Adana and then I un to that a little bit what does that mean and then today I'd

17
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,759
like to like build on that and it's perfectly fine if you weren't there for the earlier talks but what are some of

18
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,880
the things that get in the way we might hear these talks like okay sounds great

19
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,440
but uh how do I I just how do I do it I can't quite get myself to do

20
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,840
it so I want to this might be another series I'm not sure we'll start with a

21
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,920
little bit here and we'll we'll see how it goes but uh but there's so many things

22
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,319
that like why don't we accomplish the things that we want to accomplish why

23
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:28,480
don't we achieve the things that we want to achieve why don't we get to where we

24
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:35,239
want to go there's a lot of things there and I'm just going to like touch

25
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:41,400
the surface on I'm not going to be able to answer everything of course not but um I want to talk a little bit about

26
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:48,000
something that the Buddha talked about as supports for this type of

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,280
thing and so what are some of the reasons why one is it's

28
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:05,879
hard and there's this thing about you know trying to do something that's difficult just of course by definition

29
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:11,319
requires that we get out of our comfort zone that we do something we can like

30
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:18,120
stretch our sense of capacity our sense of capabilities our sense of what we can

31
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:24,720
do it's you know to make a shift in this direction or to go further than we've

32
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:31,959
gone before it takes some effort and it's not easy and so it's not it's it's

33
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:38,080
often a habit that when we realize that uh or maybe it's not

34
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,360
even we realized when we encounter some difficulties then we just like maybe

35
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,120
turn towards distraction just go do something else that's uh not as

36
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:56,959
difficult or not as uh demanding or maybe we'll just try to comfort ourselves maybe if it feels like

37
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,920
oh uncomfortable to feel like oh this is is hard I'm going to go eat some bon

38
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,200
bons or Doritos or whatever it might be or I'm going to you know just watch

39
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:15,720
another YouTube video or turn on Netflix or whatever it might be so this distraction or comforting ourselves is

40
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:21,919
you know something that maybe even without really understanding why we're doing it it's so easy to just slip right

41
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:28,639
into that you might have even say and I've I know I've said this a number of times but you know our society really

42
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,960
promotes this here you'll feel better watch this click

43
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:40,360
here you know buy that you know it's all about

44
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,720
this but there's this thing about maybe you've heard about it the first Noble

45
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:55,120
Truth right Buddhist teachings there are

46
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:01,680
difficulties that's the it's just the way the human EXP experience is it

47
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,560
doesn't have to mean we're a bad person it doesn't have to mean that we're terribly failing it doesn't have to mean

48
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,800
that we shouldn't do that it doesn't have to mean anything when we encounter

49
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,120
difficulties it's just difficult and this is the first Noble

50
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,800
truth the truth of Dua and many of you know right Dua we

51
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,960
has this wide range that we can translate it as as not just mildly

52
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:36,759
irritating seem just you know a little bit annoying to just awful beyond

53
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:42,280
belief and there's this way in which we might sometimes

54
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:49,000
think well I shouldn't ever get sick I shouldn't ever have injuries I shouldn't

55
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,280
ever feel disappointed I shouldn't have obstacles to the things that I want I

56
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,919
shouldn't have to confront death my own death or the people those that I love

57
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:07,120
and care about so often we can slip into this thinking that uh I wish there weren't

58
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,720
any DOA I hope there won't be any dooka this also is part of the human

59
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:21,319
experience and we might even say it's a biological like a maybe a

60
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:26,680
Evolution supported this idea that we're not always thinking about everything that's going to go wrong instead we have

61
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:33,599
this certain optimism that allows us to not always be focusing on

62
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:40,520
that but this way in which we often have this idea that I shouldn't have

63
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:47,680
Dua there shouldn't be Dua at all then there's a way in that we become

64
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,840
disillusioned or maybe just kind of run out of steam

65
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:59,080
when what it is that we're aspiring for when it is some something that we

66
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:05,319
want a direction we want to go and it turns out to be tough and maybe it's not even tough

67
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:11,919
maybe it's just uncomfortable and then what just kind of

68
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,360
dissipates right our energy or our

69
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,440
enthusiasm but I think all of us have this uh recognition too that if we're

70
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:29,080
not facing or accepting in some kind of way that

71
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:34,759
there are difficulties and the difficulties just increase they don't go

72
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:40,400
away exclusively or only just because that we're ignoring them or burying our

73
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,960
head in the sand or or something like this there's this way that this uh Dua

74
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,039
increases unless we have this way that we can turn towards it and acknowledge

75
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:59,800
yes this is hard yes this is uncomfortable yes this is Dua yes this

76
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,159
is awful it might be awful and there's something that happens

77
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:11,120
when we turn towards it not because it's exactly what we want

78
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,599
maybe it's exactly what we don't want but there's this way to kind of like stop the denying to stop the turning

79
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:25,599
away and just to turn towards like Yep this I want to say

80
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:34,360
sucks because right that's sometimes how it is but there is this way in which we can

81
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:41,039
turn towards these things with a certain amount of courage or a certain amount of like thoughtfulness and some awareness

82
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:48,399
and attention and the budha talked about this the poly word is

83
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:56,600
kti I'm going to translate it here as this tolerance this willing to stand when

84
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:03,360
there's discomfort able to with withand discomfort withstand

85
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:10,360
Dua and so this way like through the dooka the difficulty the

86
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,560
uncomfortableness is not just trying to fix everything out there like we are

87
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:22,399
always trying to fix everything out there and doesn't work so well right we can't just do this never ending fixing

88
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,120
manufacturing manipulating creating trying to get everything just right it doesn't

89
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:34,680
work so instead the focus is on our

90
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:42,680
relationship to the Dua we can't make all Dua go away this is part of life no

91
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:50,079
escaping but we can affect our relationship to it I think this is a big part of what

92
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:56,880
the Buddha is pointing to when he talks about this first Noble Truth there is Dua let's not

93
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,079
pretend let's not uh you know wish that it were different and

94
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:07,200
let's not blame ourselves when for every single difficulty I'm not saying that we

95
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,839
don't have a role but there's a way we often can slip into this inner critic that gets really loud whenever there's

96
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:19,519
some difficulties like I must be doing something wrong if I'm

97
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,720
uncomfortable difficulties are just difficulties and so this CTI this

98
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:31,640
tolerance is this tolerance of it's like adjusting our attitude towards suffering

99
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:39,680
this willing to have some tolerance to be able to withstand when there's some

100
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:48,480
difficulty because the alternatives are to when we have this uh Dua is that we

101
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,760
might respond with a this uh I think there's this expression like the nashing

102
00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:00,000
of the teeth kind of like the Wailing you're like no not me I don't want it

103
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,600
that happens but the trick here is maybe like not to get stuck

104
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:12,200
there because then you're stuck so in rather than this lamentation

105
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,399
or this wailing or rather than um just getting caught and maybe there's some

106
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:23,760
terrible Injustice there and sometimes we can get stuck there and just with the

107
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:29,480
uh with the Dua I'm not saying that there aren't injustices

108
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:35,880
I'm saying that the can we not get stuck there can we say yes this is an

109
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:41,160
injustice and being able to step away and being able to have a relationship

110
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:48,399
with it as opposed to just being completely subsumed with it as opposed to feelings of dejection or Gloom or

111
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:56,560
misery or some of these things that humans we like to do kind of like collapse into some of the

112
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:04,639
difficulties and so so kti this tolerance tolerance of difficulty is

113
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:10,760
this way that we can cultivate and develop or our capacity to be with

114
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:16,440
difficulties develop our capacity to be with hard

115
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:23,800
stuff and it turns out we can train this up we can intentionally and sometimes it

116
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:30,880
happens unintentionally just because lots of uncomfortable things me come our way

117
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:37,760
but you might even say that there's this way in which uh meditation

118
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:46,639
practice helps support uh being with Dua because meditation is not always you

119
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:52,240
know perfect or fun or Blissful but there's a way which like

120
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:59,040
okay I wish that Ding timer would go off I wish that Bell would go off or whatever it might be just to notice like

121
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,160
H I don't want to be here it's like oh yeah this is this is

122
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:10,959
uncomfortableness maybe feel into it what is it feel like feels like there's energy in the

123
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:19,880
legs like I want to bolt or maybe there's a lot of spinning in the mind like oh my gosh this is never going to

124
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:26,920
end but just to be able to notice like okay this is uncomfortable and I'm just

125
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:35,079
going to sit here until the bell rings I'm not going to sneak a look at my watch I'm just going

126
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:41,839
to sit until the Bell Rings this is a minor hopefully it's minor in the grand

127
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:48,199
scheme of things but don't underestimate how powerful this can be to just

128
00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:54,680
practice here like okay this is uncomfortable can I just be here with

129
00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:02,240
the uncomfort without slipping into the all the things that we can slip

130
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:08,320
into it's quite something it's how something that we do

131
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:16,279
maybe that's not the greatest difficulty but we do it again and again really can have a big

132
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:23,199
impact I know I've given this uh story a number of times but uh this is uh was so

133
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:29,279
clear for me before I started meditating I was doing some yoga

134
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:37,279
and um a style of yoga I did all kinds of styles but this one in particular was Yin Yoga where you take a pose and you

135
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:44,160
hold it for a long time in the beginning the pose is comfortable and you're like this is nice yeah great look at me I'm

136
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:52,440
doing yoga and then one minute two minutes five minutes seven and just the

137
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,839
body does not like it and uh a yoga teacher she I didn't know it at the time

138
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:03,399
but she also was a a meditation teacher and she was uh here in the Buddha Dharma as well and she'd

139
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:12,480
be giving little mini Dharma talks while we're like sitting there in agony it was great it just helped me so

140
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,920
much to realize okay that was uncomfortable and I survived it and I

141
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,759
could stretch afterwards and you know shake it off and it was okay just like after meditation you can stand up and

142
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:29,720
open your eyes and it's okay just that little bit of confidence

143
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,800
so that the next time when I was uh having a difficult conversation with one

144
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:42,079
of my co-workers I kind of recognized like oh yeah this is uncomfortable but I've done this before

145
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:47,199
I can do this again and the same way this meditation

146
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:53,680
practice sometimes we if we're sitting at home we might have the habit of like oh I'm done I want to be done I'm just

147
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,720
going to get up and do whatever I want to do but to just stay and to recognize

148
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:06,639
izee yeah this is uncomfortable and stay anyways stay anyways or just get to the

149
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:14,880
cushion maybe you don't even want to you know sit maybe it's the last thing you want to do but like okay this is

150
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:22,160
difficult not what I want to do but I'm going to do it anyway it's easy to be dismissive of

151
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,199
these small minor things yeah yeah yeah okay we're supposed to meditate all the

152
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:34,680
time but this is exactly how we kind of gain confidence and stretch our capacity

153
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:40,199
with difficulties is by being with

154
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:46,079
difficulties and so there's this way with meditation that we can like tune in

155
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:54,639
and allow ourselves not to fall into overwhelm that we can kind like be with the experience and realize oh it's not

156
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:00,000
what I chose but it's okay it's okay

157
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:07,839
kti this idea of Tolerance this tolerance of a some of

158
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:14,038
difficulties so I want to say something about what tolerance is

159
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:19,280
not because there's a way in which we might slip into or think that it's a way

160
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:25,120
in which we have this uh this passive acquiescence like kind of like this

161
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,440
collap like okay you know instead of like kind

162
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:37,720
of sitting up with it and being like this is difficult and I'm going to be with it so K is not this passive kind of

163
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:45,320
like just disconnection it's not like just acquiescing instead it's like no this is

164
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:51,640
difficult and I'm going to be here as best I can it's also not like cowardice it's

165
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:59,240
not the wayway of uh running away or pretending it's not there

166
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:05,200
and nor is it a typee of a denial that it's difficult we're not trying to

167
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:12,120
pretend that it's different we're not saying ah it's not so bad it's like no this actually is

168
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:17,880
uncomfortable and that's okay and that's

169
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:26,880
okay so there's this um poem that talks about this a little

170
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,320
bit and um I love this poem because has a little bit of Whimsy has a little bit

171
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,720
of biochemistry in it right I love biochemistry of course and uh it also

172
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:43,159
has truth in it right of course so here's this poem it's

173
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:49,770
called I mean how can you go wrong with a title like this self-portrait as root

174
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:56,919
[Laughter] vegetable self-portrait as root vegetable by Rosemary traumer she's a

175
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:02,200
lovely poet she's uh a practitioner and a lot of her poems have to do with

176
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:10,080
practice it's a very short poem and it goes like this it's science of course how the

177
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:16,080
sugars in beets will caramelize when heated a process that includes

178
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:23,000
conversion condensation dehydration collisions and the formation of thousands of volatile

179
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:31,159
compounds and though it's not simple and though this process of sweetening is not

180
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:39,440
fully understood sweetening happens every

181
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:46,400
time is it wrong this gives me hope for other hard and bitter

182
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:53,480
things just asking the question already I feel myself begin to

183
00:19:53,480 --> 00:20:00,280
soften I'll read it again self-portrait is root vegetable by Rosemary

184
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:06,120
trummer it's science of course how the sugars and beets will caramelize when

185
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:11,240
heated a process that includes conversion condensation dehydration

186
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:18,919
collisions and the formation of thousands of volle compounds and though it's not simple and

187
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:26,320
though this process of sweetening is not fully understood sweetening

188
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:34,120
happens every time time is it wrong this gives me hope for

189
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:40,679
other hard and bitter things just asking the question already

190
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:46,559
I feel myself begin to soften you can see how she has like this

191
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:52,240
shift in this relationship to hard and bitter things she's saying okay beats

192
00:20:52,240 --> 00:21:00,039
when you cook them you apply some warmth to them you give them some attention

193
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:05,320
then they shift they change just like keeping this in mind and they shift and

194
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:11,840
change towards some sweetening What's happen if we apply some warmth and some attention to other

195
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:19,120
things in our lives that are difficult maybe they're a little bit like beets maybe they'll sweeten maybe they

196
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:25,279
won't be delicious but they will shift and something that I also

197
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:30,919
appreciate about this uh poem is that Rosemary Traer or the poet the person in

198
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:37,120
this poem the protagonist is H keeps in mind that

199
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:43,520
things change this is a key Insight right that things change there's this inconstancy

200
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:50,240
there's impermanence things are changing she saiding oh yeah beats change they used to be hard and bitter

201
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,520
and they become sweeter maybe other things can and then this way of like

202
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,640
just asking the question is a way of of no longer being lost in the difficulty

203
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,760
of what's happening but remembering oh yeah things change and there can be a

204
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:14,320
different relationship here it can sweeten so Rosemary traumas with love

205
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:20,679
the self-portrait as a root vegetable so I think that part of like

206
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:26,200
so tolerance is this uh kti is this um

207
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:33,000
recognition that there is suffering the first Noble Truth and of course the third Noble Truth is there is not

208
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:40,559
suffering there's an there's the absence of suffering and then the fourth is there's a path leading to this sensation

209
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:48,880
of suffering many of you will know that the first step and the eight-fold path is

210
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:56,799
Right View and Right View includes the four noble truths so the beginning of this

211
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:02,080
path this beginning of the this uh path towards Awakening includes Right

212
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:07,919
View we could say it's the beginning or we could also say that maybe Right View is the most important that's why it's

213
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:14,720
first just to have this recognition that there are things that lead towards suffering and there's things that don't

214
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:23,000
lead towards suffering and this is like a primary differentiation in our practice that we can work

215
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,799
with so why is it that sometimes it's hard to do things because it's hard

216
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:35,000
hard and hard is hard difficulties are

217
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,360
difficult but there's another reason well there's lots of reasons but one other thing I'd like to talk about and

218
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,720
this also is the same poly word kti is that like if we have an

219
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:53,880
aspiration and we have this direction in which we want to go it takes

220
00:23:53,880 --> 00:24:00,840
time these things take time of course we want instant gratification a of course we want things to be the way that we

221
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:08,000
want them to be as soon as they can be and so this word kti also can be

222
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,400
translated as patience because there's this way in

223
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:19,360
which we are impatient impatience arises when when

224
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:26,000
let's say we're standing in line wherever it might be and then this

225
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:33,559
imagination out of nothing creates complete imagination a different scenario in

226
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:40,159
which we're not standing in that line just creates something an idea maybe we're sitting at a beach maybe we're

227
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:46,679
driving our car maybe we're doing whatever and super imposes it onto what's actually

228
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:51,919
happening and we get irritated this is

229
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:58,919
impatience and patience is this sense that things have to be different they should be different

230
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:05,799
this wanting things to be different but it's usually just based out of something we imagined and then we compare it to

231
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:10,919
what our experience is and we don't like the comparison so we kind of like have this

232
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:18,640
wish or maybe even insistence that uh it be different somehow but there's this way in which we

233
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:25,000
are impatient and I've noticed this myself I was kind of like watching myself when I was impatient in a very

234
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,799
long line not too long ago actually the line was wasn't so long it was like you know one person there was one person in

235
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:37,760
front of me and then the person FR of them was spending a long time with the person that the

236
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:44,960
clerk and I was watching myself have a little bit of impatience and there's this way I

237
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:51,880
noticed there's a feeling of um intolerance right the opposite of kti

238
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:57,520
like this shouldn't be happening there's also a little bit of

239
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:04,440
like resentment kind of like slips in there too a little bit of anger a little bit of ill will like why are you making

240
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:10,360
me wait don't you realize I have to do X Y and Z still or you know

241
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:16,279
something so impatience gets in the

242
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:23,360
way gets in this way of being a this more sweetening that we

243
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:29,480
might say about this relationship we could have with the difficulty that's happening

244
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:36,200
and instead like when there's a certain amount of impatience there's this this

245
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:42,200
uh um contraction and there isn't a sense of openness there's like we can't

246
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,520
really be open to other ideas or other views we're just kind of collapsed into

247
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:54,240
this rigidness of uh intolerance and within is this little insinuation that you know somehow we're

248
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:00,080
Superior or something this isn't the direction towards more

249
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:07,399
freedom but instead patience this way to stick with

250
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:12,039
things even when they take a long time to show

251
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:20,320
results I think patience is one of these unsung qualities for everything

252
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:26,760
especially in Buddhist practice we don't talk about it so much it's not in that many lists it's it's a

253
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:33,200
parmy and um as one of the parmes this means we could translate the word parmy as

254
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:41,440
Perfection and it means that it's connected with Liberation It's associated with Liberation and with

255
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:50,559
compassion and so patience is a way in which we are open to what's actually

256
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:57,120
happening and we are having the willingness to do what needs to be done

257
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:03,039
however long long it takes to be done and this is what leads to

258
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:09,880
freedom freedom from anything really freedom from whatever it is that

259
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:15,640
we're trying to get away from that we feel Shackled by takes

260
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:23,200
time everything takes time learning new things takes time doing things differently changing

261
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:29,440
kind of like the way that we often our default thinking takes time of course it is

262
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:36,720
so when we have this sense of patience there's a way that we are just focusing

263
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:42,279
on what we're doing in this moment we're letting the next moments take care of

264
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:48,039
themselves but instead we're working on this moment here maybe not working on

265
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:55,159
we're allowing it to be we're being present for what's happening right now

266
00:28:55,159 --> 00:29:03,320
it's just part of patience you can see or this is part of Tolerance too the same word canti we're just like

267
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:10,039
okay this is this experience I'm standing here thinking that my maybe

268
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:17,200
that this shouldn't take so long just to do this simple thing that that I'm standing in line for but it seems like

269
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:23,799
it's taking an awfully long time and just like oh I can have patience I don't have to whip out my

270
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:31,559
phone and entertain myself I can just be here it's

271
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:36,720
okay it's not my favorite thing it's not so

272
00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:42,559
bad have some of this tolerance of the present

273
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,120
moment otherwise we right we have the mind is Think Like when is this going to end and if this weren't happening then I

274
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:55,840
could do this right there's this way in which that we can get in spinning of the mind but just to kind of stand with our

275
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:02,919
bodies and with our minds Sy to be there there's also a way that patience

276
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:08,159
also F has this focus on consistency just showing up again we

277
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:14,240
didn't get the results we wanted we're not finished yet well we'll do it

278
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:20,640
again we'll do it again whatever needs to be done we'll just do it

279
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,720
again and again and

280
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:31,880
again but this recognition right that all these again aren't exactly the

281
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:38,519
same there's some parts of them that may seem similar but we all know this that

282
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:43,799
uh probably you take showers regularly but not every single shower is exactly

283
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:51,799
the same maybe the water temperature is different the duration is different how long you stand there rinsing your hair

284
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:58,799
or whatever it might be something that we do over and over and over again it's not always exact exactly the

285
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:03,840
same in the same way for some consistency with our meditation practice

286
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:11,600
or whatever practice it is that we're doing is a way in which um we can

287
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:20,240
understand or interpret this what it means to be patient and then maybe something else

288
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:27,799
that I will talk about uh patience is there's a way in which uh p

289
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:34,639
patience and not being angry kind of like go together I like this uh one

290
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:44,200
author Dale write he writes um impatience and anger are not the same

291
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,960
but they live in the same neighborhood idea right impatience and

292
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:55,840
anger right they have that simmering quality to them and one way in which

293
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,919
they are related is that that they're not opposite so

294
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:07,639
much but when we're angry we can't be patient and when we're impatient We

295
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:14,760
Can't Be Without Anger like when there's an impatient we're creating the conditions for

296
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,360
anger and so there's a way in which to as a support for patience may kind like

297
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:28,120
just notice our anger notice like what is it that uh gets us irrit ated even if

298
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:34,360
we're not completely angry but that you know like gets under our skin and is there a way that we can

299
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:39,799
learn to tolerate things getting under our

300
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:46,080
skin it won't lead to anger if we practice kti it also like supports some

301
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:52,559
patience and some perseverance and doing things again and again and this helps

302
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:57,639
lead us towards our aspirations whatever it is that we want to do with our lives

303
00:32:57,639 --> 00:33:02,158
what's important for us what's meaningful for

304
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:11,440
us of course I could say that mindfulness is a is a support for this

305
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:17,399
too just being aware of what's happening in our

306
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:24,080
experience so what is it that kind like gets in the way when we have this we set

307
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:30,720
out we want to do something we have a goal a direction we want to go and we don't do it one of the reasons is maybe

308
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:36,679
there's not quite enough Cy tolerance and patience these are

309
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:42,120
things that often we don't think about we think about like oh I just have to be better organized or I don't know there's

310
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:47,960
all these you know obvious things that uh we think we should do but I think that some of these qualities are really

311
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:54,360
the unsung heroes of practice the and the the beautiful thing

312
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:59,519
about them is that they can be increased it's not like we arrive with factory

313
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:04,919
settings that can't be changed instead right we can stretch our

314
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:11,118
capacity so kti this uh one of the parames that the Buddha talked about can

315
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:17,720
help us with Adana with resolve and it can help us with this

316
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:23,720
um exertion or striving or working towards something that we it's important

317
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:31,960
to us and with that I'll open it up to see if there's some questions or

318
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:59,200
comments beautiful talk very clear and helpful um one of my achilles heal I

319
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:05,839
have more than one is being impatient and I just wanted to share a comment or

320
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:13,520
guidance that Gil gave me once and because I talked to him I'm like I'm so impatient and he said uh be impatient

321
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:19,800
with impatience and it works it works fantastic because as soon as I start on

322
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:26,880
the cycle it seems like somehow that energy of being impatient with it stop

323
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:32,560
DRS it it's really interesting so I thought I'd share that little I love it
