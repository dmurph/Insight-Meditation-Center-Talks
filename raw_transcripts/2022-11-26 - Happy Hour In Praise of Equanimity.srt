5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,439
made the they're both stressful and and they have

6
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,640
lovely aspects they're lovely and they're stressful both you know we can focus on one or the other but it's both

7
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,800
and in some ways it's not so different from the rest of life it's lovely and

8
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,940
it's stressful right both of those we can say about life thank you so so what

9
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:57,480
I wanted to to reflect on tonight um and invited us to practice with is

10
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:05,158
the fourth Rama vihara the Brahma viharas again as a reminder are the practices of

11
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:11,100
the heart meter loving kindness being the first one Compassion or karuna the

12
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:17,220
second one third one is mutita vicarious Joy the fourth one is equanimity or

13
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:25,560
opecas this beautiful expansion of the heart to be with whatever is with with

14
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,500
stability with care it's not aloofness it's not oh I don't care you know listen

15
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,380
you know talk to the hand I'm not listening it that's not Equanimity we know that already but I always want to

16
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:43,200
remind us um Equanimity can be more nuanced can be

17
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:51,960
more nuanced compared to the other Brahma viharas and yet it is the Brahma

18
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:59,939
vihara is the faculty where the other Brahma vihara's rest on it's

19
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:05,700
um loving kindness compassion and vicarious Joy rest on Equanimity because

20
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,920
if they don't rest on the stability on the open-heartedness

21
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:17,220
and the spaciousness of equanimity they can rear into the

22
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:25,800
opposite meta loving kindness can become clinginess or compassion can become a

23
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,500
grief or or or distress or say

24
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:37,920
um would detail vicarious Joy can Veer into either Pride or it's opposite into Envy

25
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,519
if it doesn't have this open-heartedness this open-heartedness of equanimity just

26
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,780
open-hearted spacious stable it's just such a beautiful

27
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:56,220
quality to have and it's not cold it's not aloof at all otherwise it wouldn't

28
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:03,000
be part of the Brahma of the hearts right all the Brahma viewers we have metal right we have love there so wait

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,340
how are these in the same family oh okay so Equanimity isn't cool after all it

30
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:13,440
has care in it of course it has care in it has care enough in it to be stable to

31
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:21,239
be present to be with what is so I'd like to invite us to consider to

32
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:28,700
relate to Equanimity tonight as we practice um a spaciousness of the heart just

33
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:35,760
complete spaciousness of the heart spaciousness of the Mind for our own sake

34
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:42,000
um especially say if if challenging emotions if difficulties arise

35
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,280
there is a sense of equanimity there's a sense of peace and ease

36
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:54,720
um which which again can Veer into meta can Veer into for others can Veer into a

37
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,260
vicarious joy we can Veer into gratitude for ourselves it can Veer into

38
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:06,840
compassion if there are challenges so so Equanimity is responsive Equanimity can

39
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,540
be quite responsive so we start with Equanimity and under different flavors

40
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:19,979
different places we can go whereas again the loofness is oh you're not paying attention it's like whatever uh whereas

41
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:25,860
Equanimity really faces it's open opens the heart and faces

42
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,919
one last thing I want to say before we start practicing is that

43
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:38,940
it's such a beautiful quality of the heart and the more we expand our heart

44
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:46,139
and the more we make our hearts our minds spacious through Equanimity the more we can

45
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:51,660
contain the more we actually surprise ourselves

46
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:57,419
as to what we're made of right what we're made of we can just surprise

47
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:04,979
ourselves wow this I can be with this too this too I'm not losing neither my

48
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:13,500
confidence nor my temper I have a sense of spaciousness to meet to meet what's happening to meet what's

49
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:21,419

53
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:48,300
um to cultivate a spaciousness of the heart it's very

54
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:54,240
generous Equanimity also is the ground

55
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:01,020
for generosity just being with all there is so all right I can talk a lot more

56
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:07,320
about the joys and the Perfection this this beautiful quality which is actually

57

one of the Perfections um as called one of the jewels and um

58
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:21,120

59
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,880
for ourselves and if if there are areas when tonight Equanimity does not arise

60
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:34,759
or the opposite of it arise clinging or aversion not a problem not a problem

61
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:43,259
use the opposite of equanimity which is aversion or clinging as a pointer oh

62
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:49,139
there's Equanimity lacking here oh it's oh can I be with the lack of equanimity

63
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:54,360
present here because then you can bring in Equanimity to lack of equanimity and

64
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:00,120
that's like an Aikido move in practice so all right let's do it let's practice

[Music]

199
00:38:54,430 --> 00:39:01,560
[Music] way for us to explore this practice of equanimity we had never done it this way

200
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:07,020
on this at happy hour with this kind of a guided meditation with

201
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:13,079
with waves just a different way to explore it and maybe there is a nugget of something

202
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:18,540
in this in this visualization and the way that we related to it that worked

203
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:26,579
for you great keep it keep that inside keep that weight worked and maybe it didn't no

204
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:31,859
problem you tried it on for size you can let it go it's all good

205
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:37,280
so so [Music] um

206
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:43,440
yeah questions comments Reflections what did you notice

207
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:48,660
um what was it like for you what happened

208
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:55,020
it was also a little uh invitation there with with anata and

209
00:39:55,020 --> 00:40:02,000
insight and there if you caught it but anyway Jerry I see your Zoom hand please

210
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:12,599
oops you got muted again that's on Mewtwo please oh you're still me

211
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:21,180
what happened still muted um there we go there good thank you uh

212
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:26,460
I guess um I know in Buddhism intention is very

213
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:34,320
important um and certainly I I don't question your intentions Nikki but I guess

214
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:39,839
um when uh you know there's uh in the

215
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:45,720
lay presses I would call it um gaslighting is a popular topic

216
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:51,660
nowadays and uh one of the things that you mentioned was

217
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:58,380
don't take it so seriously which is often a term used by people who may not

218
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:04,859
have good intentions to try to undermine another person just don't take it so seriously like in other words that

219
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:10,200
you're not in touch with reality and uh it can be a form of bullying

220
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:17,640
and I know that wasn't your intention but and I didn't take it that way but when I heard that word don't take it so

221
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:22,980
seriously I wondered um how that fit and I understood the

222
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:28,500
intent was to have yourself maybe look at what's happening and what's coming up

223
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:35,099
and is it yeah actually I want to pause you for a moment Jerry because I I remember saying don't take it so

224
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:40,200
personally don't take it but I didn't say seriously

225
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:46,140
so that's different that's very different in the dharmic so I want to pause you here because

226
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:52,200
not taking it seriously that's different I can appreciate how that might bring alarms but not taking it personally

227
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:57,900
that's dharmic language and I'm using that very specifically

228
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:04,339
thank you do you hear the difference yeah I I hear the difference uh

229
00:42:04,339 --> 00:42:09,839
and uh I get it it's coming from the die I knew your intentions were good but it

230
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:15,780
just it's just sort of twigged a bit where if someone else is using IF

231
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:22,200
yourself is using it like the person and asking them to question it uh that's but

232
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:28,079
that's very different Jerry so I want to pause you because I I do hear that there's something happening here uh with

233
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:33,960
with with both the language and also the you know there's something that has happened you know with gaslighting Etc

234
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:39,660
but I just want to be very very clear with the intention and with the distinction here so pause so stay with

235
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:46,920
me for a moment Jerry okay thanks so so with with not taking it seriously that's

236
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:52,740
different that's like that's uh not going there but not taking it personally

237
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:58,460
is the concept that we're working with here and the concept of anata

238
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:07,619
impersonality impersonal and governable not self not me myself nor mine and

239
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:14,460
there is a sense of impersonality which is really a deep deep wisdom teaching in

240
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:21,060
in Buddhism and I trust that you're having practice as long as you have you

241
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:26,940
have had insights into the impersonality of the body of the thought process that

242
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:31,980
there's there's so much impersonality so taking your thoughts personally for

243
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:37,319
example you're taking your body aches personally it's not personal it's or or

244
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:43,859
things that happen rise and like oh pers just we take so much to be so much

245
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:50,720
personal and we suffer because we take things so personally so so that's a

246
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:58,380
that's an invitation not to take things personal because they aren't personal and and there's a lot of loyal and right

247
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:04,680
now I'm talking about the kind of the shallow level of this inside but they're very very deep deep levels that even

248
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:10,740
this being who is me is is born of causes and conditions it's not personal

249
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:18,000
it's really not so that's what the teaching is and it's a deep teaching

250
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:25,740
um and the invitation is not to take things personally yes oh you got muted again you're

251
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:32,160
welcome to say anything or just let it be uh it's very helpful thank you thanks

252
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,980
thanks Jerry yeah okay Steph please

253
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:43,619
so I just want to say I was pretty distracted but I think it was because I

254
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:49,920
didn't meditate this morning like I usually do I usually meditate on my own and or in a group and I've had a bit of

255
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:55,260
a stressful day but you know the practice was really useful but um I had

256
00:44:55,260 --> 00:45:03,359
to keep returning trying to return my mind to it try to return my mind to it so if I really always appreciate it when

257
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:09,180
you lead a practice so much so thank you beautiful thank you Steph thank you for

258
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:15,540
saying that and and as you know well that's what I would say is that's perfectly fine distracted Buddha just

259
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:22,260
say oh yeah distracted Buddha just need to bring back and come back and come to the center and that's perfectly fine

260
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:28,079
it causes the conditions of the Mind are not always the same and that is impersonal because of what's happened

261
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:35,460
through the day or didn't sit like oh yeah it's impersonal it's like of course it's it's it's busy right now oh

262
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:42,240
terrible me I'm a bad person it's like no just like this is what happens like it's impersonal it's born of causes and

263
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:49,740
conditions this busyness of the mind and then you you and then you work with it with wisdom you work with it with wisdom

264
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:57,740
beautiful thank you thanks Steph lovely and Claire I see your hand

265
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:05,220
thank you um I raised my hand for two reasons one is that I loved your metaphor of the

266
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:12,900
boat on the water I thought it was absolutely spot on for me all right

267
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:21,140
the other thing though was a question that came up I have for a couple of years now use the concept of acceptance

268
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:29,460
to deal with complex situations um and is that similar to Equanimity do

269
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:35,640
you think slightly different slightly different so so so the idea the the

270
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:42,300
concept of acceptance is is when we accept what is instead of resisting what

271
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:49,380
is so it's not um again uh about acceptance It's not acquiescing

272
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:55,680
and it's not giving up so that those are important things that you already know but heard the benefit of everyone so

273
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:03,300
with acceptance your sense of accepting yeah it's for example my back is hurting right now by hating it by by being upset

274
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:10,859
about is like accepting the truth of the moment is acceptance there's an opening of not resisting it whereas Equanimity

275
00:47:10,859 --> 00:47:17,400
is more about um so so Equanimity includes acceptance

276
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:23,640
but it goes beyond acceptance it includes the opening and not denying what's happening but then there's this

277
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:29,819
ah attitude of neither attaching nor resisting

278
00:47:29,819 --> 00:47:37,560
so it goes beyond it does that make sense yeah there's a more equipoise great thanks thanks for that and Gene

279
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:44,280
you're the last reflection please thanks Nikki I actually just had a

280
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:51,180
question um I I I did really appreciate the guided meditation and the um the way you

281
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:59,280
defined Equanimity is open-heartedness I never understood it that way and it was really lovely and the wave metaphor

282
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:06,300
um but I wonder repeating yourself if you could just if there's anything else to say about why

283
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:12,300
it is we suffer so much when we take things personally um I find myself you know sometimes

284
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:20,520
saying why me like why did that happen to me and I I can kind of understand that that makes it worse but I I don't

285
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:26,839
know if there's any other dots you could connect there thank you yeah yeah thank you um

286
00:48:26,839 --> 00:48:33,480
so so there are a lot of reasons why we suffer when we things take things personally like it's a longer Dharma

287
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:39,119
talk but I want to come to specifically what you just referred to which is why me and then let me just say something

288
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:46,980
about that because it's it's a particular example of the bigger bigger case like why me that that if if that

289
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:52,859
arises and you know and it arises for many of us in many different times so so

290
00:48:52,859 --> 00:48:59,280
not to have judgment because that's why me arises that's number one but but if it if it arises

291
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:05,880
um the there is a sense of of excuse me

292
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:11,160
it's it's um as if I've done something wrong so it's

293
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:18,480
it's belittling I'm separate like everybody else is okay everybody else has it figured out but but I'm less than

294
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:24,240
I'm worse than I there's something special but especially in the negative

295
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:32,119
way and that is the delusion of separateness it's the Deluge it's denying our similarity in humanity

296
00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:39,079
everybody you know everybody has challenges in in this life it's the

297
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:45,420
unsatisfaction is is a characteristic of being alive we just don't see it our

298
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:52,020
minds are are often focused on me me me me me right and my life my body my this

299
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:58,079
like that's just that's how we operate evolutionarily yes oh sweet sweet dear human being you know this is how we

300
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:04,619
operate and yet when that happens why me try to open that up try to open from the

301
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:12,119
country constructions of of me and what happened to him to like oh just like others

302
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:18,960
instead of why me just like others just like other human beings I'm having a difficult day right now just like other

303
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:28,039
people just like others just to to to take away that that separateness yeah

304
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:36,960
so okay I spoke a lot and looks like we have less time today it was gonna be a

305
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:42,839
short um uh short groups so so let's um let's

306
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:48,420
turn to them it's always sweet to to have to be in small groups so so here's

307
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:55,260
the invitation I have today um or the group so the invitation is um

308
00:50:55,260 --> 00:51:00,980
as we get together in small groups of three is and since the topic is

309
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:06,359
equanimity is that the The Prompt is what supports your Equanimity what

310
00:51:06,359 --> 00:51:13,619
supports the sense of being with um the waves that arise what supports it
