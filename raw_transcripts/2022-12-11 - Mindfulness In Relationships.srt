1
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:09,599
so good morning everyone can you hear me

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,540
all right great it's nice to see you not in your heads

3
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:23,180
and uh good morning to those of you who are on line on watching on YouTube and

4
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:30,960
appreciate all the ways in which people attend these Sunday morning sittings

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:39,000
and I appreciate all of you being here um walking down here today I

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,399
reflect a little bit on how special it is to have a group of

7
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:51,680
people arrive together to meditate together and have some kind of shared interest

8
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,059
in meditating perhaps and then

9
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:02,760
interested in the kind of space the kind of ambiance or Mutual support that comes

10
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:09,420
when meditating together in a group some people find it hard to meditate alone and being

11
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:16,380
in a group is really inspiring some people some of you might be here because of the shared values there might

12
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:22,979
be some kind of values that are shared here that are very different than what you'd find if you go to the mall

13
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:29,159
you might feel a different set of values that are being operate operating there

14
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,280
maybe someplace and um

15
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:41,220
and some of you are here because you're interested in hearing some teachings and maybe because they're something

16
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,560
important going on for you in your life you're suffering in some way or a challenge in some way and

17
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,520
you want to address it and you hope that the teachings will somehow touch something that you're trying to you're

18
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,979
struggling with or working with so this is you know kind of in the room

19
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:04,320
here a lot of different things that I'm reflecting on and many different backgrounds here that

20
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,860
people you all be coming here and and maybe some of you bring particular

21
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,260
things with your background and maybe some of you feel particularly safe

22
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:22,440
coming into an environment like this different than many other places some people maybe don't feel so safe in

23
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,840
coming here and looking around wondering you know is this okay for me to be here maybe first

24
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:35,099
time or I'm a little different than what I think other people are like and and you know it's okay and

25
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:41,400
many years ago there was a woman who came and she was really concerned about coming here

26
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,800
and didn't quite feel like this okay and am I on the right track if I'm here

27
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,340
because so many of the women here have gray gray here Maybe not maybe not today but there's

28
00:02:53,340 --> 00:03:00,239
there's some and uh in her culture you you didn't let your hair go gray and so that was that

29
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,640
was like a big deal for her and uh you know it's just do I have to

30
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:11,580
be like that and um

31
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:18,540
so what is here in the room and uh the question for me is speaking

32
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:26,099
to all of you Dharma teachers I could just kind of read an encyclopedia entry on some

33
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:31,200
Buddhist topic and then there that's the teaching you got it

34
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:38,220
but you're not here just to me to read and it's like repeated Gentry on what mindfulness is

35
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:43,620
um you know there's also things like uh the way we're attuned to each other we

36
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:50,040
attuned to this did the meditation do something with the Attunement that we share and they're quiet the peacefulness

37
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:56,280
what's here you've sat being mindful for a period of time and

38
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,980
and so what is the connection that you feel now to the room and the people that was different than when you came in here

39
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:08,340
and maybe some of you never been in this community before has it changed at all

40
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:14,280
when I you know when I teach on YouTube and I usually today I don't have a laptop in front of me but I usually have

41
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,340
the screen in front of me and it made such a big difference for me when I started teaching on YouTube I

42
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:26,580
first time I was gonna like I thought this was weird you know you know before the pandemic I

43
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:32,340
would have said no way no way that can't be done but it immediately changed because there

44
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:37,860
were all these chats and not everyone chats but there was a representative those chats and they were

45
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:44,100
so friendly and so appreciative and and something was conveyed of a connection

46
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:50,280
to people through those chats that they came alive for me and there was much more than just providing information now

47
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:56,160
there was an exchange there was a sense of feeling of of a community and a connection

48
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,160
and maybe some of you are doing on YouTube today are already chatting I've chatted to each other and

49
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,580
or you will saying hello for example

50
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:14,460
and um so to be attuned what is here what are you here for and all the different ways

51
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:22,560
and sure you hear some people if some of you have heavy things on your hearts some of you have uh you know

52
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,139
incurable diseases that are some people have but we sent losses and griefs some

53
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:33,240
of you are really troubled by current events of different kinds

54
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,280
the anti-Semitism in this country that's growing seemingly

55
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:44,039
the the racism in this country which is maybe not growing but becoming more

56
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:50,100
public and prominent in Sea and the violence that's becoming stronger and stronger and

57
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:56,280
seemingly the mass shootings of black people and lgbtq and cholera Springs

58
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:03,120
black people in Buffalo New York and synagogues

59
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,600
so so you know is this in the room at all is this you know kind of in the background or you came here for a

60
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:16,500
respite from all that you didn't want to have these things named here because like finally this is a place where we don't do that then we can put it all

61
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:22,139
down so how do I as a Dharma teacher take all this into account

62
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:27,539
should I take it into account or should I just read this encyclopedia entry of mindfulness

63
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:34,199
and then you know close the book and we can go home that's that's been done with there's much more going on here than

64
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:42,600
just the bear teaching there's a connection that we have and um and part of that connection for

65
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:48,960
me is that I'm conveying something that I find incredibly valuable and I'm delighted and grateful that I have this

66
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:55,860
opportunity to share it with a group of people and um and I'd like to support you I'd

67
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:01,860
like to I value you and feel like don't take it for granted that you've chosen to come here you're doing

68
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:08,100
this practice so I think it's quite a beautiful thing you're doing and have a lot of respect for what you've what

69
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:14,039
brought you here and all the different ways so thank you and I hope to

70
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:19,560
that this what I do today here will have some bearing and

71
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:26,880
and what I want to do today is um partly inspired taking this time the

72
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:33,660
beginning to establish or to explain all to say all this and that is that um

73
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:38,880
uh what does it mean to be mindful practice mindfulness

74
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:45,720
in our relationship with other people and what what is is mindfulness enough

75
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,819
is it enough just to show up and be with people mindfully

76
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:57,479
it depends that the answer to that depends a lot on what you mean by mindfulness what you think it is

77
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:02,960
lately I've been thinking the heart of mindfulness practice is non a

78
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:09,300
non-reactive awareness we might react but the awareness that is

79
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,720
not caught in our own reactivity and so we can bring a kind of attention

80
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:21,539
that is not being influenced by our reactivity so that we can bring a kind of presence

81
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:26,580
attention to whatever's happening to ourselves and the challenges we have internally

82
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:33,599
and the challenges we have externally where we can be present see it clearly but the seeing is non-reactive the

83
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:39,539
seeing stays clear balanced maybe centered maybe available to see clearly

84
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:45,180
and say this is what's happening and if that kind of is a one definition

85
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:51,360
of mindfulness non-reactive awareness some people with or slightly different

86
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,480
definitions some people get the idea and impression that that's enough

87
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:03,500
it's enough just to be you know just be mindful but it's a little bit passive

88
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:10,580
non-reactive awareness and uh and in being passive

89
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:18,139
um what um [Music]

90
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,820
you know is it is it enough just to be passively aware non-reactively and you

91
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:29,760
know look at someone and be silent just just being mindful with

92
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,040
you once many years ago I many years ago

93
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:41,519
maybe when I was more foolish as a teacher but I wanted to I wanted to give a good

94
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:48,420
people the weekend I was teaching on mindful speaking and so I wanted to give them the uh

95
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:53,459
experience of what it's like all the different communication that goes on between us

96
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:58,680
that is not words so I asked them to go into dyads and

97
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:04,860
talk to it and one person talk about something really important in their life I forget what it was

98
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,959
and the other person to just listen and look without any Expressions on their

99
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:16,560
face without any nodding just kind of be fully present but not you know not and

100
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,680
for anything and and uh you could imagine that how that went you know it was you know it was

101
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:29,700
kind of it felt pretty strange and so the group got very clear sense very quickly that there's much more going on

102
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,740
in being present than just being non-reactively

103
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:40,380
aware there's other factors happening in it and what are those other things that

104
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:46,920
are useful that are important so one of the things is um

105
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:53,820
uh could be is Attunement to be attuned to the other person

106
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:59,339
and Attunement means that we have a sense an understanding of who the person

107
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:07,920
is what's going on with the individual or the group that we're here and um and uh and that how do we become

108
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,500
attuned how do we have a bigger sense a richer sense of who this is person is

109
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:19,019
and what they're saying what they're feeling what they're expressing what they're hoping for what their life is

110
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:24,720
about um so that they feel seen not just heard and seeing just kind of

111
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,959
this non-reactive awareness where we don't not but so they really feel like we're with them in some ways

112
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:37,920
and that takes uh take a little bit of time willing to learn about them find out about them take time to take

113
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:44,279
them in and understand how they are maybe with if you're just meeting someone maybe with their posture or

114
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:49,800
maybe with their emotional tone maybe with their demeanor

115
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:56,700
that we take in and really feel and feel connected to and somehow attune to What's Happening Here with this person

116
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:02,399
and um many years ago I mean something I was kind of a little turning point in my

117
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:09,060
social life and and caring being attentive to people was uh I was working at a restaurant and

118
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:14,579
I was in the changing room and there was a changing of shifts and um and I was

119
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:21,120
getting ready to leave and a friend of mine walked in and I just uh

120
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:27,060
um I blurted out something very quick and fun and you know maybe funny or just

121
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:32,459
kind of made a joke or made a kind of something out of remark that I think was innocent and find enough in and of

122
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:38,640
itself it was a way of making a connection but what I hadn't done is taken the time

123
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,980
to attune myself to know and recognize what was going on for my friend where where are they at

124
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:50,880
because I was so spontaneous as soon as I saw my friend and it turned out my friend uh another

125
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:58,440
friend of his had just died and he was just coming to work just with caring with that with him and I had

126
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:04,079
missed that and so in some ways I caused distress and harm because I hadn't taken

127
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:09,480
the time to get a tune to be to understand and see and I probably could

128
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:15,000
have picked it up quickly if I just kind of taken two seconds to wonder what was going on here for

129
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,380
this person and um so

130
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:27,420
so to be attuned with someone and so it takes it means an

131
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:34,860
interest in the person and one of the things I think that is really helpful for a proper Attunement

132
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:40,100
is to respect others to respect their value their importance

133
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:45,240
to respect their Humanity to really kind of be attuned to pay attention to listen

134
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:51,060
to learn I want to find out who this person is with respect your your

135
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:57,300
important respect means you're valuable I see you as being important enough to get to know

136
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:02,459
and how many times did we not do that just like me with my friends blurting out

137
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:10,800
um you know I've been in situations where I was kind of caught up in some concern and I just really wanted to get

138
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,380
my you know my latest opinion out

139
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:21,779
and um and uh not really finding out whether the person wanted my opinion

140
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:27,120
about something or wanted to hear it hear a five-minute story about something

141
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:34,139
that had happened to me you know that day um and so you know I've I've talked to

142
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:39,240
people sometimes you know just kind of caught up in my own thing and then eventually halfway through or something

143
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:47,160
kind of noticing the person's eyes have glazed over uh-oh and

144
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:53,839
um and uh why didn't I notice this earlier did they just glaze over or how long

145
00:14:53,839 --> 00:15:00,180
how long were they glazed over so so you know to talk as if the other person

146
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:06,959
is not there and I've been on the receiving end of this where people have talked to me they're like a few times

147
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:13,199
not a lot of times but a few times over the many years I've had people talk to me

148
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:20,160
um and uh I kind of felt there must be somehow high on something

149
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:26,279
you know I don't think they were you know any drugs but they were like they were like like I could have gone like

150
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:33,480
this in front of their eyes and they wouldn't they wouldn't have seen me their eyes were kind of locked into their concern and it was quite so it's

151
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:40,079
kind of a little bit I don't know possessed it's the right word or but uh you know really kind of in their thing

152
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:46,320
in such an intensity that I kind of felt like I didn't exist in you know listening to them

153
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,139
so to be attuned to be interested in being attuned so mindfulness in

154
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:57,720
relationship to other people I like to Repose is more than non-reactive awareness

155
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:03,300
it's an awareness that searches for an Attunement what is here what's going on

156
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:09,600
here and that's also true for ourselves the non-reactive awareness that we bring

157
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,940
to ourselves is also an awareness that's doing something deeper to ourselves and

158
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:22,260
just kind of matter of fact seeing things as they are but it's a vehicle for a deeper Attunement to ourselves to

159
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:28,800
get to know ourselves in a deeper and Fuller way and then there's

160
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:34,440
um uh and then with Attunement then there's

161
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:41,339
also a connection the Rapport that we have with someone what is that connection what is going on

162
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:49,100
between us is there friendliness is there is there resistance there's a hostility is there

163
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:54,959
disinterest is there is a person why is this person keep looking at the door

164
00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:02,519
you know you know not looking at me you know there's something going on here What's Happening Here in the connection

165
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:08,339
but I think I would like to adjust when we when we bring the mindfulness practice if we really want to be mindful

166
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:15,360
and really use them get the most out of mindfulness that it means we're also being attuned

167
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:22,040
to how we're connected and being careful with that and perhaps being conscious

168
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:28,140
conscientious about a connection which is healthy

169
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:36,059
that is nourishing that's supportive that helps us feel more connected to each other rather than more separate

170
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:42,780
and one of the one of the reflections that I've I often do uh during and also

171
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:48,419
after being with someone was did what I say and how we were together do I not

172
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:55,280
feel more connected with them or do I feel more disconnected and I've said things certainly that uh

173
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,480
at the moment or sometimes afterwards oh I think I could feel that the person

174
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:06,440
kind of pulled back a little bit or shut down a little bit or that made everyone quiet

175
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:12,600
and uh and uh and so there was a disconnect so for example some emotional

176
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:18,240
expressions like anger uh will will sever a connection I mean

177
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:24,780
some people have been angry very quickly in short notice and the connection to someone has been severed for decades it

178
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:29,820
doesn't take much sometimes to a real dramatic severing of connections to

179
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:36,120
happen um but you know you can feel is that is that what you want do you want to kind

180
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:42,960
of really have that cutting people off or pulling back or do you want to kind of create a

181
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:49,039
possibility for deeper connection what's a value what what's important for you

182
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:54,900
is in your Attunement to it all do you recognize in yourself that you're afraid

183
00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:00,720
what happens if your anxiety is there with uh in the relationship and maybe

184
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:07,740
there's good reason for it but how do you then establish connection or how do you care for that connection with your

185
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:13,559
anxiety do you tell someone you know I feel anxious right now but I still want to go

186
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:21,840
for a walk with you and maybe we'll just talk just know that I'm feel anxious that's how how I am or do you somehow adjust the

187
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:27,480
just the situation so you can feel is more at ease with your anxiety

188
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:34,380
maybe it's better if you go for a walk maybe it's better if you say let's go get some tea just something to break you

189
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,780
know because it seems a little bit too intense otherwise just having a cup of tea between you that can be a great

190
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:44,960
protection you know you don't have to because you don't have to be completely connected

191
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:52,080
you know because you're drinking so this is a little I don't know private thing I'll tell you

192
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,419
that um I don't know how far I wanted to go [Laughter]

193
00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:03,179
on YouTube the world is um so I teach Retreats a lot

194
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:10,140
and um and you know and I love teaching these Retreats they're wonderful and but the most difficult part of the

195
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:16,020
retreat for me is when it's finally over we're in this big room at our retreat

196
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:21,600
center and we're sitting in a circle and it's finally over everyone gets up and they can talk to

197
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:28,620
each other and everything and that's the hardest part for me because for good reasons you know people

198
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:34,799
feel grateful or feel like they've really shared something deep during the retreat and I'm the teacher for the retreat some kind of the point person

199
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:40,260
for what happened maybe and so people come up to me with certain kind of like

200
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:45,480
it's really important that it has important things they want to say they say it with all this week-long we treat

201
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:51,240
energy and and I'm you know kind of you know how I am with them I have some a little

202
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:56,700
bit more value in that context than you know just someone they met at the mall

203
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:02,460
and so um you know so so if we're standing I learned

204
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:09,480
I feel like I have to offer a lot of attention to really be there and receive them and acknowledge it and so that's

205
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:16,799
fine in and of itself but there's a series of people like that and so if I end I'm exhausted

206
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:23,039
so that's the most tiring part of the whole retreat so what I've learned to do

207
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:29,520
is um uh you know with the closing Circle I'm sitting in a chair

208
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,880
and uh and everyone gets up and talks what I've learned to do is I don't leave the chair

209
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,700
and by not leaving the chair there's there's a very different way that people like what they expect from me if I'm

210
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:47,840
sitting in a chair and they come up to me they kind of don't expect me to be fully there

211
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:53,220
I'm cutting I can be I can be kind of casually there from sitting in a chair

212
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:59,760
and then um so and so then that's it works really well for me and I appreciate talking to them it's nice you

213
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:06,299
know and I can be there and and um and it's it's somehow easier the whole thing's more relaxed

214
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:12,000
and um so so here's you know a connection that didn't work for me

215
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,100
I recognized it and I found another way to be with people in a way that worked

216
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:24,840
so what is the connection how do we establish the connection what are we doing with that connection are we or how

217
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:30,600
we're being with it are we losing connection are we severing connection are we

218
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:36,480
Healing Connection are we making connection are we finding a way to be together that's nice

219
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:43,799
that's all part of the the art of Being mindful in relationship

220
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:49,080
so Attunement connection and then there's also a connection where

221
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:54,720
we do this to something that's other different than just who we are together

222
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:02,400
as a group uh you know individual one-on-one for example there's also the what else is

223
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,940
here so for example here at the IMC for this today

224
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:14,820
we're not just meeting at the cafeteria at the mall

225
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:20,340
and to talk we're here at a meditation center after having meditated together

226
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:25,380
as a group and there's something about this room with a high ceiling that place people to

227
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:30,780
be meditating now here for 20 years before those 20 years there was

228
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:37,320
about almost maybe 40 years where people there

229
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:45,059
were Christians who were here because there was a Christian church and they were Christian Mystics and they sat in silence here in this

230
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:51,720
room and part of the reason they wanted us to have it was this church was because we sat and sat in silence they

231
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:57,299
wanted to have that continue so we have this you know this now you hear this history right of the place and

232
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:03,240
so there's something here that we're sitting in there's a Dharma we have the Buddha

233
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:09,179
statue you know so they dar Muslims what does that mean for you what are the associations we have the values the

234
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:15,419
background some of you might have been born into a Buddhist family and so there's a deep family connection

235
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:21,000
family history and associations and that with uh with being here and Buddhism

236
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,700
some people it's um other things that you associate with it that maybe maybe

237
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:34,020
it even touches into onto the sacred coming in a place like this or something maybe some something spiritual here that

238
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:39,120
you feel and sense what's what's going on here

239
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:45,179
so what is that that's part of this picture too so what else is going on when you're mindful of being with

240
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:53,220
another person mindful of being with a group of people is there an Ambiance is there an environment is there a wider

241
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:59,780
kind of Association of feeling of what's here and how do we take that into account

242
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,659
um the um how do we care for that and so

243
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:14,460
um what else is present here so uh this question what is present

244
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:20,700
is kind of the core one of the one way of saying the core question of mindfulness

245
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:26,640
what is present here but if you ask the question what is present here

246
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,860
opening yourself up to discover something take the time to feel and send

247
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:37,140
said no what is present here and if you only ask the question once if

248
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:43,740
you you probably only get one answer if you ask the question 12 times you've got 12 different answers there's so much

249
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:51,360
here so in any situation but not so much that you have to ask this all the time but mindfulness is

250
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:59,159
also entering into situations kind of available ready to Let's let yourself be

251
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:05,000
informed a kind of a way of paying attention that you're available

252
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,880
to feel and discover and learn what else is here what's here in the fullness of things

253
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:18,240
that you can't if you're completely preoccupied in your concern

254
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,700
and whatever it might be and you know but there's a kind of a dropping of

255
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:31,740
self-concern enough that you can uh what is present here

256
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:38,700
and everything I'm talking about how to do this with other people is something we do to ourselves as well

257
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:45,539
what is present here in me if you're caught up in the thoughts of self-concern Me Myself and mine

258
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:50,940
ruminating about you know something about yourself it's difficult to be have this kind of

259
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:56,039
what is present here question what's really here to be attuned to yourself to

260
00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:01,500
discover same thing if you ask yourself that 12 questions in meditation

261
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:07,080
you might get 12 different answers but you might be living in only one of them

262
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:12,299
what happens if you open and keep opening what self is here what else is here

263
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:19,500
so um so one way that in the wider outside the

264
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:24,960
Buddhist inside world that some people refer to what I'm talking about to hear

265
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,200
is not mindfulness they talk use the word presence

266
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:36,419
practicing presence practicing presence to the present moment

267
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:43,919
and so practicing presence means mindful but you're being mindful more than just with the cognitive mind that knows

268
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:50,640
you're being present with all your faculties you know in your body hearing listening

269
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:57,840
smelling feeling emoting kind of the resonance all the ways in which we resonate and feel what's going on

270
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:04,159
presence means so much more than just mindfully you know

271
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:10,860
non-reactive awareness I think or it feels it fills it it puts you know fullness into what non-reactive

272
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:18,960
awareness might be but what's fascinating for me about this word presence it can be something we do

273
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:25,440
but it's also uh what's the what's present here and some people say what's present here is

274
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:31,799
many things and so there's a presence here of calm there's a present here of

275
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:37,100
attentiveness there's a presence here of maybe of

276
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:43,400
certain values many people when they come into a Buddhist Community

277
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:50,039
have a heightened value in kindness friendliness compassion

278
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:55,500
and and so you know there's other what's that what's the presence of a Kind

279
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:02,820
Community or a presence of a space where people there's an openness and attentiveness awareness

280
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:08,480
so and so you know in some circles you know again you know non-buda circles

281
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,159
people are also practicing mindfulness but they call it the presence of God

282
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:20,940
or the presence of the Divine or the presence of the sacred

283
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:26,220
or the presence of in Buddhism people might say the presence of emptiness

284
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:31,740
or the presence of compassion you know what is it is there something here

285
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:37,260
some of you might not would prefer not to use these languages this way of talking

286
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:43,320
but uh in if you want to kind of understand a little bit our practice of mindfulness

287
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:50,580
to how it overlaps with so many different practices in other religions and other ways you need to kind of

288
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:56,580
appreciate that they have other language than we have and one of them is presence

289
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:03,240
and so when you show up what's the presence you bring not just what what awareness do you

290
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:12,960
bring but what more do you bring to the table to the situation and sometimes I go home and and I feel

291
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,299
you know I bring exhaustion you know after a seven day Retreat sometimes and

292
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:24,120
after that closing Circle you know I bring exhaustion sometimes I

293
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:30,240
can come home from Retreat and I bring in a lot of calmness I feel very quiet sometimes I bring all kinds of different

294
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:37,140
things home sometimes I bring grumpiness home you know and um and you know so what's

295
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:44,460
that what what kind of presence do we bring in this situation and how do we how do we bring awareness

296
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:50,820
to how we are and what we're bringing to it where we hold it with this non-reactive

297
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:56,279
awareness the bottom line for mindfulness practitioners I would like to suggest

298
00:30:56,279 --> 00:31:03,320
suggest were the kind of the first the first

299
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:14,700
first approach is to really learn well what non-reactive awareness is

300
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:21,500
that's really key to everything else because without the non-reactive awareness

301
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:27,840
self-awareness can be bad news for a few of us

302
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:34,260
you know people discover all kinds of things about themselves which are not necessarily you don't necessarily have it projected onto the walls everyone to

303
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:40,500
see what's going on in your mind and um or you know where we have we're

304
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:46,620
grumpy or something you know it's like oh no no not again and and

305
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:52,860
um or other people are being grumpy and not again you feel like that last time I was this person they were grumpy and I

306
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:58,500
think I'm gonna recede into the background or shut down a little bit because this is

307
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:04,080
too much for me or I don't know um you know what exactly I'm saying here

308
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:10,679
what I'm trying to get across is if we can learn to practice non-reactive awareness if that can be

309
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:17,279
the bottom line that the kind of fundamental thing we're doing then all the other things we pay

310
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:24,000
attention to it's a little bit safer it's a little bit wiser a little bit more it kind of works better

311
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,039
because then we don't get caught in our reactivity in the way that we're present

312
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:35,460
and aware so I might be grumpy but I'm not then afraid or angry with

313
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:40,799
myself or self-conscious or embarrassed oh I'm just grumpy

314
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:47,100
that's how it is now and um and uh you know and so

315
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:52,580
it's very different than if I'm embarrassed or upset with myself and the same thing with other people

316
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:58,140
occasionally people in the world don't behave very well and it might happen

317
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:03,659
and um and then if we can have non-reactive awareness of it then maybe

318
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:10,020
there's a whole different way in which the situation could unfold for example what if the person is

319
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:15,659
misbehaving and what if you say what else is present here

320
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:21,659
how what what is it what can I be I attuned to in this person

321
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:26,760
this person's certainly angry but as I take the time to attune myself to the

322
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:32,519
person I see the person is also very afraid that seems to be the background for this

323
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:39,240
anger is their fear and insecurity does that make a difference how you relate to them and then how you connect

324
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:44,460
then because of it or your nose so this non-reactive awareness

325
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:51,840
is the foundation so but non-reactive awareness maybe is

326
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:59,880
not enough maybe the fullness of mindfulness practice has all these different dimensions to it that does

327
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:05,220
involved is not passive does involve intentionality of some time

328
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:10,260
for free from you some sense of purpose

329
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:15,898
let's let's practice non-reactive awareness to become better attuned

330
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:21,000
better connected better aware of the context and the

331
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:28,260
atmosphere and the what else is present here let's enter into this world more fully

332
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:34,138
so that we can be wise and caring for this world in a way that we can't

333
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:39,780
if we are not really aware or too and connected and

334
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:48,060
respectful of everyone so mindfulness bring mindfulness into

335
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:53,158
your life at the end of Retreats people often ask the

336
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:59,220
this mindfulness is fine how do I bring it into my life and some of you maybe got more than you

337
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:05,099
wanted to today wow that's a lot of work that's a lot to do

338
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:11,700
so um maybe we can take a couple of minutes if some of you have a comment or a question

339
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:16,700
you'd like to make about any of this or what's anything else

340
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:24,380
we have a few minutes here a little bit like a rock star thank you

341
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:28,820
hi thank you so much um

342
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:39,060
with the non-reactive awareness and just being aware of sort of this where other people are at where you're at

343
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:44,820
I've had situations and I've heard a lot of teachers say the way people behave towards you has more to do with them

344
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:52,200
than you so I try to bring that into my awareness but sometimes if there's like so much of

345
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:57,480
someone's anger coming towards you I I just don't know I can't always be

346
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:04,020
present with that and work with it and it's very upsetting in relationships

347
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:09,540
because I feel like there's been situations where I I didn't feel like I did anything but I'm bringing up

348
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:15,119
something in someone else and then it just it wasn't savable even with the

349
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:21,060
awareness of what's going on in that other person so um I guess in that situation I can only

350
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:27,000
work with my reactions to it and it's just really it can be very painful yeah

351
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,240
yeah so so there's it's huge the topic but you're raised there's so many variables so many different ways that

352
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:39,780
this plays itself out so I'll say a few words um one is that um

353
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:45,780
there is something to be said about being prepared for those those events not to kind of just show up and think

354
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:52,500
you're supposed to take care of it then and there but if it's a regular thing enough prepare yourself and one of the ways is to meditate

355
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:58,859
uh meant necessarily just before the event but just a regular practice because it gives you the presence of

356
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:04,680
mind the calmness the attentiveness so that you're not reactive excessively

357
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:11,040
that someone's angry with you and then you can kind of be a little bit calm enough to then find your bearings and

358
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:16,920
know what you should do um that's one the other is in preparing if

359
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:24,119
it's someone you know well and this happens you know regularly enough wait for a time when it's not happening

360
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:30,540
and everything is cool and nice and say can we can we have a little conversation it would be helpful for me you know I

361
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:36,960
get really afraid when or challenging for me when you're angry and it's probably going to happen again

362
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:42,900
um could we have some understanding of how we navigate that next time it happens like can I just raise my hand

363
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:48,300
and and wait to pause and breathe deeply for three breaths would that be okay

364
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:55,020
with you or something you know you know see if you can make some kind of arrangement ahead of time might might

365
00:37:55,020 --> 00:38:01,680
work might not and some sometimes it's helpful in terms of uh I mean in certain certain

366
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:06,900
circumstances it's helpful to let people know the impact their anger has on you

367
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:13,500
and um and there are some people if you tell them boy when you're I feel really

368
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:19,020
afraid right now people can some people are surprised by that and it kind of change in the

369
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:26,400
context like you know like well what do I do now with my anger if they're afraid do I just keep going or held back and

370
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,560
and so some people that's a powerful thing to say boy I'm really afraid right now

371
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:36,780
and then it might change the context of the conversation it happened here in this building for me

372
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:41,820
once where we were doing renovation on the building and there was a lot of noise

373
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:47,880
and one of the neighbors who had a tendency to complain about any noise that came out of this building I mean

374
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:54,480
imagine this is what do we do here but occasionally you know you know

375
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:01,740
there's noise coming out and uh there was a renovation to work and the person came over and was Furious

376
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:07,320
and and it was I was the recipient of this Fury and I just stood there

377
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:12,900
receiving all this Fury it was quite something and the person finally paused and I said

378
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:18,900
this I said oh you know I feel really afraid right now

379
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:24,660
the person immediately calmed down it was dramatic and and I don't think the

380
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:31,260
person wanted to have that impact and realizing how big the impact had been then it the person backed down

381
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:36,780
dramatically from it and the whole thing kind of you know de-escalated or whatever

382
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:42,720
so I don't know that doesn't always work but it's a whole art I mean this I don't want to suggested it's a simple and easy

383
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:48,420
thing to do and sometimes certain situations the best thing to do is get out of there

384
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:55,020
stand behind someone else you know so so it's so many different

385
00:39:55,020 --> 00:40:02,099
you know scenarios that where this plays out but but the study of preparing yourself thinking this you know by just

386
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:07,740
practicing and developing capacity for mindfulness and calm awareness so that the best

387
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:14,660
you have maybe maybe the best chance to figure out what to do thank you

388
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:22,819
so maybe one more all the way in the back if you don't mind taking it there and then we'll stop here

389
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:31,859
all the way well I noticed in myself that

390
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:40,160
um I became reactive when I heard that this was being broadcast on YouTube

391
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:47,599
um and I'm just wondering uh what your thoughts are on how we can mindfully

392
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:53,640
relate with YouTube and social media because YouTube is uh

393
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:59,400
you know the the the the the politics the economics the

394
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:04,680
capitalism the there's so many so many problems with uh YouTube and social

395
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:12,119
media and all these reasons right things like that yeah I was just wondering what your thoughts were on that

396
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:17,640
yeah that's a big topic and uh I think it's reasonable to have your concern

397
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:23,040
and I wish I was as well informed maybe as you are about how all this works so I I

398
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:32,579
I'm remiss in not being fully educated about the impact and how it all works but um uh what I what I understand is

399
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:37,700
that we're using the social media or the YouTube that's what it's called YouTube

400
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:43,079
uh for for a greater good and we're taking something and we're putting a

401
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:50,339
positive spin in it so it's being used in a good healthy way and one of the evidences that maybe it's

402
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:57,660
a healthy place on YouTube was at some point someone joined us for the first time on YouTube and they put in the chat

403
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:02,960
this is the friendliest place I've ever seen on YouTube and

404
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:10,020
so I you know I don't know if that's true I don't I'm not on YouTube otherwise but but I'm hoping that with

405
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:16,320
the goodness of what we're doing here is doing greater good for the world and

406
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:23,300
harm okay thank you thank you

407
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:30,599
so uh there's a t now let's just say hello to each other some of you are here for

408
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:37,140
the first time are new what I'd like to ask you if you're willing and you don't have to but uh if you could just uh turn

409
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:43,040
to someone next to you and say hello and even if it's your first time here welcome them

410
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:50,099
welcome welcome each other and if you want to say a little bit more you can say it was anything about this talk that

411
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:56,280
was uh you know it'd be useful for you to hear or interesting that you want to kind of think about more or something

412
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:03,960
and then it can just be two minutes or so if you'd like it just is just to be friendly and um and then

413
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:10,319
if those of you want to stay we'll have the tea time and stand outside we can take off The Masks outside and it's blue

414
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:17,180
skies so it should be good for a few minutes for a little while thank you
