1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:07,120
so i want to begin this morning with a fable that i think is uh

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,799
as a good fable uh is a is a

3
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:18,720
great story to kind of kind of interpret in all kinds of ways

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,599
interesting ways but yeah start with the fable

5
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:32,160
so there were these two people who were going to be sentenced to the dungeon

6
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:39,120
and they were sent down to the dungeon and put in the room and before the door was closed

7
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,840
the guard executioner said

8
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:52,079
you have 24 hours to figure out how to get out of this dungeon

9
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,280
if you don't if you figure it out you can go free but if you don't figure out

10
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,399
its death for both of you so with that

11
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:09,920
he handed a little rusty nail to one of them and slammed the door shut

12
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,360
and they were like wow 24 hours to figure out how to get out of here so they looked at the door

13
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,479
and there was an amazing array of locks on this door

14
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:27,280
some of them were combination locks some of them were like big padlocks maybe that was what nail was for to get

15
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,840
in their padlock and try to figure it out some of them were elaborate kind of puzzle-like

16
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:41,840
bars that closed the door so then stakes were high death

17
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:48,880
and so one of them immediately got to work the other one just sat down against the

18
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,000
wall quietly just looking at the door

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,799
and the one who was working on the door worked away sweated away hard and at some point turned over

20
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:08,319
and said to the ones sitting around why aren't you doing something this is

21
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:14,480
like um you you're not that you're not going to do anything is

22
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:21,280
the death going to be the death of us and the guy on the wall said personal dewall said

23
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:28,560
maybe but maybe you're trying to do something it will be the death of us it's kind of a strong statement

24
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,640
so the person on the door kind of through went you know

25
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:41,440
got completely absorbed and trying to figure out the locks and as the 24 hours started to come to

26
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:49,280
the end it was got more and more frantic and was speeding between the locks trying to figure out what the way out was

27
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,480
sweat was pouring down and the person sitting against the wall

28
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,000
just sitting there peacefully quietly and then about five minutes before the

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,760
24 hours was over the person in the wall just got up

30
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:13,840
walked to the door and pushed it it had never been locked

31
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:20,239
the one who was searching and trying to fix that you know was was you know thrown off by all the locks they never

32
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,480
bothered to see if the door was actually locked

33
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,760
so what dungeons are you living in and what

34
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:38,000
locks are you trying to undo to get out

35
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,760
that maybe don't need to be solved

36
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,120
maybe what's needed is to sit down and do nothing for a while just sit there

37
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,360
and so the one who was sitting against the wall that person's

38
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,360
wonderful spiritual principle was the principle

39
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:10,799
just don't do it don't do it so why is that a significant principle

40
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:18,560
just don't do it some people in america the united states have heard the principle just do it

41
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:27,199
it's like i think of it a little bit like a carpe diem there's latin thing that

42
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,560
sees the day you know like what you're supposed to go out and do and

43
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,960
claim and assert yourself and you know don't have anything stand in the way and

44
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,400
so this idea just don't do it it's phenomenal but it turns out in our practice of

45
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,400
meditation and caring for our minds and our hearts in that domain

46
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:57,520
just don't do it is actually a very significant teaching very significant practice to do

47
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,680
so what are some of the dungeons we can live in one of them some of them have to do with

48
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,360
are how we see ourselves how we define ourselves and how we try to get out of that

49
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,680
dungeon so just a very kind of abstract kind of vague kind of way

50
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,280
someone might think that they're a bad person

51
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:28,880
and that's the dungeon that they have to get out of and so then they try to be a good person

52
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,160
and being a good person is kind of a lot of work there was a time in my life where i

53
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,240
wanted everyone to like me and i had a job that was almost impossible for everyone to like me

54
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,520
because i was kind of like the one who had to tell people you can't do it that way

55
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:52,160
and um so i got to see this strong desire to be liked and all that i tried amazing

56
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:59,120
amount of social gymnastics to try to make it work and it was just got was really stressful

57
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:06,319
it was a monastic job and it was like in the kitchen i was a kitchen manager and kitchens are pressure cooker places if

58
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:12,000
you haven't even have any of you ever worked in a kitchen a commercial kitchen or something

59
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,840
and the legends of that kitchen monastery kitchen was that in the 1960s there was

60
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:25,039
a uh ed brown who was the um wrote this famous tussahara cookbook some of you

61
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:31,280
know he was working in the kitchen then and at some point he threw a knife at someone

62
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:38,240
you're laughing but you can only laugh because it didn't hit anyone

63
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,600
and it's a pressure quicker place right so there i was trying to make everyone like me

64
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,440
and so so sometimes we you know or to have the

65
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,880
idea that you're a wrong person and then you have to be the right person

66
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,800
and then we try hard and sometimes just trying hard to do the opposite

67
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,840
it's just a lot of work and sometimes it doesn't work someone

68
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:12,560
who may be is very insecure will overcompensate

69
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,840
in such a way that people pull away like if you're really needy and trying to get

70
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:24,400
everyone to like you for example then actually maybe fewer people will like you because you're trying so hard

71
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:31,039
and it just makes people uncomfortable and um

72
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:38,000
so uh if when i was uh we were raising our first

73
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,720
son i know he was you know when he could start understanding words sometimes he

74
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,639
would be doing something really fun and nice and i would say oh i'm good boy

75
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,960
and my wife explained to me one point you know you shouldn't say that that way because that's reinforcing an identity

76
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:04,000
that he's supposed to be a good boy and then he has to do things to live up to that his father's idea of a good boy

77
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,400
and that's just the recipe for challenges as he grows up

78
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,000
so what i would say instead was wow you're having so much fun doing that

79
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,440
and you know that that probably is a problem too but

80
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,840
because you know you can't really be a parent without causing problems

81
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:37,360
but hopefully it was much less of a problem just oh that's fun

82
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,360
enthusiastically and so

83
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,959
when we sit and meditate and we see that our mind is doing funny things

84
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:54,800
a few of us have funny minds and and so doing funny things

85
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,320
and then think oh i'm not i'm kind of mean i'm kind of mean in there and angry

86
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,880
or harsh i need to be kind and then we kind of bring out the start

87
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,720
cranking up the kind gears and like i got to get the going you know kind gears and kind of

88
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,640
you know and you know trying and pumping them out pumping them out and until we're exhausted from the

89
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:26,560
you know doing those gears and and then we're even more irritated and harsh about everything

90
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:33,279
so instead of so it's true that we might be harsh or mean in our minds

91
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:40,080
but to swing the pendulum to the other side and think because of that i'm supposed to be a kind person

92
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:48,000
if we're a bad person supposed to be a good person if i'm a wrong person supposed to be the right kind of person

93
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:54,480
that sometimes is going that just staying in the same game

94
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,839
being caught in the same complex instead

95
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:06,240
what we can do in this practice again the domain of our practice our mind and our hearts there

96
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,959
is just simply stop doing the unhealthy thing

97
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:19,600
but don't try to do the healthy thing it's enough just to stop

98
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:26,640
you don't have to compensate or swing to the other side as if that's how you're going to be a good person

99
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,680
and why this works in the mind and heart with meditation

100
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,279
is that when you don't do something there's some settling that happens

101
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,880
we're no longer asserting effort to do something and accomplish

102
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,880
something we're no longer preoccupied in something and something begins to open

103
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,480
settle relax and then we have access to some other

104
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,519
way of being some other source like if they feel like you're

105
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:05,360
you're just really a mean person all the time you're not supposed to be kind just stop being mean

106
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,480
that's radical maybe that's enough some people just think oh it's so nice

107
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,720
to be with you you're not trying to do anything i just like i can relax and just be myself and

108
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:23,279
i know these people who are trying so hard to be kind i remember the first time i tried to be kind to someone when i was

109
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:29,839
18 i think she must have gotten sick of me

110
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:35,839
i was the member talk standing there in college talking to her and like being so saccharine and sweet and just like over

111
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:42,480
the top and later i walked like that was that was weird

112
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:48,320
i didn't ever never occurred to me how to be kind or friendly or nice or something and so it looks like i never

113
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,000
talked to her again or she never talked to me again

114
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,480
and so um but just to do nothing maybe i'll make

115
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,920
space there's a very famous uh quote from

116
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:13,519
henry now and a kind of a christian theologian united states that talks about

117
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:20,480
creating a friendly empty space for the stranger

118
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,760
so someone who you don't know stranger someone you don't know but to receive them in a friendly empty

119
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:31,839
space as opposed to crowded well you know trying to do things and being something

120
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:38,880
it allows people to be who they are and just let something evolve and develop

121
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:46,079
and this idea that there's something deeper in us a deeper place of wisdom of motivation

122
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:51,279
is integral to this dharma practice deeper than the kind of surface

123
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:56,560
preoccupation surface reactivity the surface pendulum that swings from

124
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:02,480
one end to the other because you know if we think we're supposed to be you know we're mean so we think we're

125
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:08,800
supposed to be kind but it's a lot of work to be kind so we get exhausted in that exhaustion we're back into the mean

126
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,639
and and so then we try again and it just kind of becomes a lot of work and a lot of kind

127
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,959
of gets stuck in the in the polarity and the duality of it all

128
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:27,600
if that's what we think is supposed to be there but if we can just stop

129
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,920
then something deeper can happen and the example i'd like to offer you is maybe some of you had this experience

130
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:40,320
i've had it certainly of being engaged and trying to figure out some problem

131
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:46,800
and um thinking about it a lot trying to figure it out and probably that part was needed

132
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:53,120
but then going away going on a bike trip or going going on a hike taking a shower or doing

133
00:13:53,120 --> 00:14:00,800
something completely different where the mind is no longer thinking about it and then suddenly wells up inside the

134
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:08,160
solution the answer where did that come from it came from no longer being engaged in

135
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:14,880
it so as we stop and maybe the earlier thinking had to create the momentum inside

136
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:21,120
but still there was something some deeper place that's processing our life that's not that conscious place in the

137
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:27,199
mind where reactivity can occur so in dharma practice we're trusting

138
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:32,639
this deeper place of what wells up and what comes and

139
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,680
in another way of saying it we're trusting a peaceful place the more

140
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:44,720
we don't do the more peaceful it is now this can be challenging of course

141
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,880
but one of the other thing that buddhist psychology teaches which i think is fascinating for this whole

142
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:58,240
enterprise is that certain states of emotional states that we have states of

143
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:04,560
mind it's very easy to assume are fixed this is how it is this is how

144
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:11,040
the universe is and in buddhism we see them all

145
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:18,880
as processes of the mind activities of the mind so to give you one example

146
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,560
boredom people will say this is such a boring situation

147
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:31,759
this party is boring or this you know this person is boring it's a horrible thing to say right

148
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:37,680
and uh and so it's you know blaming the situation for being boring

149
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:44,240
there is no situation whatsoever in this universe that is boring

150
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:50,000
boring is an evaluation of the human mind your mind or maybe not your mind but

151
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,120
people's minds and in an evaluation of the mind or a reaction mind activity of the mind a

152
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:04,000
process of the mind as soon as you realize it's an activity of the mind and action of the mind

153
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,519
it's possible to calm it down it's possible to settle it

154
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:15,600
these activities of the mind are not inherent they're not required

155
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:22,160
we don't have to be involved in this reactivity as i have one teacher who says that

156
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:28,959
boredom is a sign of being separated from your experience so you're holding yourself apart so

157
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:34,639
that's work to hold yourself apart and then you know some kind of evaluation judgment

158
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:41,040
so when we people who meditate can learn can notice over and over again repeatedly as they meditate how things

159
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,240
states of mind and activities judgments that were seen to be

160
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:52,720
inherent melt away in meditation

161
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,639
and i've certainly sat in meditation and thought this is boring this meditation boy is this ever boring when is it going

162
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,680
to end they should ring the bell and then i said wait my gail you know

163
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,798
maybe you should try just maybe counting your breath and getting a little more concentrated

164
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:14,319
and so i do and then as i get more concentrated that level of activity in the mind

165
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:20,240
that's evaluating boredom quiets and lo and behold

166
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,678
without that activity it's actually quite i'm quite content and happy to be here

167
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,799
there's nothing boring right now because i'm not evaluating as boring does that

168
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:36,799
make sense so it turns out there's a lot of things like that and i don't want to go through

169
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:42,240
too many examples of it but

170
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:48,400
certain forms of sadness even depression might be

171
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,240
part of this evaluative active mind sometimes because things are confusing

172
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,280
distressing there's been great loss all kinds of things can happen and i don't want to

173
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:06,480
just diminish the sadness of loss for example but we have to appreciate what the mind is doing

174
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:13,360
and sometimes there's a way in of drop of quieting the mind stealing the mind just don't do it

175
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:19,679
that's very respectful of our inner life because we're not overlaying

176
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:27,760
so much stuff on top of it and we allow the heart to just show itself in some deeper way

177
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:34,480
and if there is sadness that sadness that needs to be processed sadness can be very healthy and healing

178
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:41,200
things to feel if we get out of its way and when the mind is busy and thinking

179
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,840
and reacting to all of it judging it or clinging to it then it doesn't allow for this deeper thing to

180
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:54,080
happen so um so so one of the little

181
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,440
quotes you know quotes that i hope you'll carry with you and use it at the right time

182
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:06,160
a little saying is um just don't do it

183
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:13,919
that simply stopping as opposed to having the pendulum swing to the other side

184
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:20,880
rather than compensating and like not to do it but just stop trust yourself trust it's

185
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,480
okay simply not to do it you don't have to prove yourself you don't have to be a good boy or whatever

186
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:33,760
that um you know all you have to do is stop and then make space and let something show itself and get to

187
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:40,960
know yourself and and with time learning to trust

188
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:47,039
a certain way of not doing not always reacting fixing

189
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:54,400
running away but saying okay okay here i am this is an un uncomfortable situation

190
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:01,679
just don't do anything with it just be with it and see what happens

191
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:09,919
and with time what we learn is to trust the peaceful place and what arises from that peaceful place

192
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:16,000
and this is a very challenging thing sometimes to trust there's a lot of messages are from from

193
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,840
our society that we're supposed to be a certain way we're obligated to be a certain way

194
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:30,880
and if you're not probably angry properly distressed probably properly something

195
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:39,200
then you're a bad person you're wrong you're somehow aloof or indifferent or

196
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:45,120
or somehow you know part of the problem

197
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:53,679
maybe you are but but um but if you can trust this peaceful place

198
00:20:53,679 --> 00:21:00,080
maybe there's a very different way to respond a healthy way an appropriate way

199
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:07,120
that doesn't involve anger and distress fear

200
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:12,640
you know all these kinds of things that i i propose that oftentimes maybe

201
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:19,280
people expect from each other that's the vehicle in which we kind of prove that we're right if we're angry at

202
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:26,080
something then we understand there's a problem and we're it's kind of then i'm you know then at least i'm not

203
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:33,120
you know you know the more i can be angry the more i know that i'm just kind of made a claim that i'm i

204
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:39,520
know what's right you know and i'm on the right side because that surely is the problem

205
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:47,039
and i don't know if it's that that division that anger anger makes i don't know if that's healthy

206
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:53,600
so i'll venture into dangerous territory maybe in in

207
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,799
making some more examples of this the um

208
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:04,000
so there is a teaching in buddhism um

209
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,640
that there are three kinds of conceit and generally we think of conceit as

210
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,919
being something not to do not to be conceited and the kind of

211
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:24,000
in fact in buddhism also since conceit is seen as a form of suffering people have conceit or suffering

212
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:30,000
you know without you know in addition this whatever suffering they cause others

213
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,679
but there's three kinds and the first kind is one here in the in at least in english-speaking world we

214
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:42,240
often most clearly associate with conceit and that is i'm better than others

215
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,159
some form of that but in buddhism there's two other forms of conceit

216
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:53,960
the other the second one is i'm worse than others

217
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,919
and some people what that's conceit um

218
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:08,880
it's conceit because it's a over preoccupation with our own status

219
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,480
in relationship to other people so i'm worse than others and so we're still caught and then in

220
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:20,480
the grip of this self-definition and being someone not being someone

221
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:28,158
and then the third one which is particularly evocative or

222
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,880
concerning for people in the united states given some of the value some of the important values that

223
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,640
are touted in the united states the third form of conceit

224
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:47,440
is that you're equal to others in land we're supposed to be you know

225
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:53,600
equal that's like what's wrong with that we're supposed to be equal and

226
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:59,039
and so the reason that the problem with the equality conceit

227
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:05,520
is when it's still a conceit it's still a comparison holding on to an idea

228
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:11,679
of something so then the question is well what's left

229
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:18,760
and what the alternative to those three is not to do the comparisons

230
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,000
not to place yourself in comparison to anybody else just to be yourself in some way

231
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:31,279
without that playing the comparison game and so when conceit falls away

232
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:37,279
we are who we are but we're not piling on top of it judgments and

233
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:42,960
comparative thinking there's so much suffering in our society tremendous amount

234
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:49,840
from all the different ways that we live in comparison to each other so it's a radical thing to stop doing

235
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:56,400
that and at the same time we have to be very

236
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:03,120
careful with this kind of teaching because this teaching is only meant for again the domain of your heart and your

237
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:09,760
mind don't play the comparison game for yourself the conceit game

238
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:15,520
because we do live in a society where there is inequality

239
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:21,520
and not to see that not to recognize that is to not to recognize the tremendous

240
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:27,039
suffering in our society we do live in a society where there are people who

241
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:32,880
hold themselves superior to others and keep other people

242
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:39,520
you know pushed keeping them down there are people who feel that they're inferior to others

243
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,960
they've learned that and they're struggling with that so we live in a society where those

244
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:53,120
things exist so when we say in buddhism you know don't play the conceit game and no

245
00:25:53,120 --> 00:26:00,000
superior inferior equal that's why this really has to do with what's going on inside of you

246
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,360
we should use our wisdom to recognize what's happening in society

247
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:12,000
but when we see the inequality in our society which is immense

248
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,960
are we supposed to get angry are we supposed to be distressed

249
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,158
are we supposed to be afraid

250
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:32,080
there are people who expect us to be if you're not probably angry or upset or guilty or something

251
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:39,520
then maybe you're part of the problem maybe you are it depends it's complicated right

252
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:47,360
but um but the um but in the in the dharma

253
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,120
trusting that peaceful place inside

254
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:59,120
just stopping just stop something stop that judgment stop the

255
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:05,120
anger but pay attention to the world don't shut down

256
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,720
don't avoid the world what's going on but if what happens if you trust the

257
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:17,360
peaceful place inside maybe that peaceful place inside is not

258
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:23,120
aloof is not removed maybe there's a very different source of

259
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:28,720
motivation a source of stepping up and trying to improve our society and make things

260
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:34,080
better that comes from a very different place maybe comes from compassion maybe it

261
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:40,720
comes from generosity maybe it comes from a deep sense of

262
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:47,520
shared humanity and caring for each other maybe it comes from inspiration maybe it

263
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:54,559
comes from joy one of the ways to improve the world

264
00:27:54,559 --> 00:28:01,120
is to whatever you do to do what brings you a sense of joy and delight so that can be inspiring

265
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:06,880
to save the world while you're miserable does that save the world

266
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,919
that doesn't really convey so in buddhism there's a lot of emphasis

267
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:18,799
on how we do things and there's important things to be done for our society in the world

268
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:24,320
but how do we want to do it and where is the source of the motivation from

269
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:30,720
and and i'd like to propose that it can be from this peaceful place

270
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:36,000
inside that we discover when we've learned

271
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,158
just don't do it just don't do it

272
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:49,600
and what i'm referring to here is just don't do a lot of the preoccupations reactivity

273
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:56,480
of the mind the the the pendulum games were caught in

274
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:05,919
settle down be here trust yourself trust this peaceful place and if it comes out of the heart

275
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:13,039
just do it then do it maybe

276
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:18,559
and maybe it's easier to do when one of the things has been settled over time

277
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:24,320
is fear one of things has settled is inhibition

278
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:30,399
but inhibition without coming from a deep place inside can be disastrous

279
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:37,440
you know i'll say whatever i want to say but you know so just just don't do it

280
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,799
as a vehicle as a means as a practice to discover

281
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:47,919
this peaceful place inside that's not participating in the games

282
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:53,039
the mind has or the pendulums or the reactivities of the mind

283
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:59,360
where maybe it's radical enough it's powerful enough

284
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:05,278
to learn to stop doing the things that are unhealthy for you

285
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:12,880
you don't have to then compensate for that and do you know become a saint

286
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,799
it's enough just not to do that you know the you know the harmful things the

287
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:24,640
difficult things the ways your mind is kind of you know caught in these things

288
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:30,720
and i think that's a radical message it's enough just to

289
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:37,360
stop some of the things you're doing and i think it's very respectful of

290
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:43,440
ourselves because we're learning how not to have too many cooks in the kitchen

291
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:50,159
you know in our kitchen of our own hearts and minds and letting getting out of the way and allowing something to rise and

292
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:56,159
surface learning perhaps that it's okay

293
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:02,960
just to be alive just to be alive and breathing is plenty

294
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,080
we don't have to prove ourselves we don't have to compensate for ourselves or we don't

295
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:13,120
have to prove ourselves in any kind of way

296
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:19,840
but it is wonderful to learn to trust that peaceful heart

297
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:27,360
and learn trust how we come how we respond to the world from that place

298
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:35,120
that's a radical thing there's lots of people in our society who are responding from other places

299
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:42,960
but i think it's good for our society for people to start learning how to actively respond to the world the

300
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:48,960
needs of the world needs a family needs of friends colleagues anything

301
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:55,200
from this place still quiet peaceful place inside

302
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:01,360
that may be the fast way to discover

303
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,720
is just don't do it that little practice

304
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:13,440
easier said than done but maybe

305
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,480
i've given you some perspective that you can try to use today or use and explore

306
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,840
and and see maybe if some of you are in

307
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,039
your dungeon you'll stop trying to pick the lock

308
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:34,880
and try something else so thank you

309
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:40,320
and we have a couple of minutes if any of you like to make any comments on this or

310
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,840
reflections or questions

311
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,480
yes

312
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:00,799
um gail my question goes to um

313
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:06,799
like if if somebody has a habit of course it's not i'm not talking about myself here

314
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:11,840
but if somebody had a habit of being very judgmental to

315
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:18,559
stop to learn how to just not do that is a process i'm sure yeah it's a process and so

316
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:24,320
could you say a few words about how to how to navigate that process and i

317
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:31,840
suspect part of it is uh awareness bringing awareness to when when i i find myself judging

318
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:37,519
um and also to maybe meditate more to get more into

319
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:44,000
this peaceful place but anyway that's my question yeah so i think that

320
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,080
certainly meditation can be a great help if the meditation allows the mind to quiet down enough

321
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:56,320
so the judgments are not there so every time you can do that and drop into a deeper place it's kind of like

322
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:02,640
you're massaging the mind and you might have to do it repeatedly but slowly something begins to give and

323
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:08,320
your mind learns the lesson oh there's another way of doing this and it feels good

324
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:14,158
and uh having that contrast of a place that feels like a better alternative is a way of

325
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:20,878
reconditioning the mind so i wouldn't you know so that's that's if you have that ability in meditation

326
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:27,599
if you don't then uh follow some of the instructions we give on mindfulness of emotions

327
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,960
so you would look at the uh you want to get your bring mindfulness to the judgmentalism

328
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:39,040
and study it in a more careful way what's actually going on in the present moment not where it came from in your

329
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:44,480
life but what's how how is it really going on here and now and

330
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,520
the um so the um and so what is the emotion that's behind

331
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:54,720
it and if you can discover what the emotion is can you sit quietly and just breathe

332
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:00,000
with the emotion and feel it maybe that emotion needs your attention more than their judgments

333
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,280
the judgments might just be the messenger don't kill the messenger and the message is not

334
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:12,320
what it's saying the message is uh that you're hurting in some way you're afraid you're lonely or

335
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:18,240
something you know feeling inadequate or there's a conceit maybe maybe you feel

336
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:25,520
i'm not saying it's you but some people judge a lot because they feel inadequate in themselves

337
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,960
and judging others is a way of feeling adequate if they're bad then i know i'm okay

338
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:37,440
but it's kind of the conceit game and it's kind of funny way so you know stop and take a deeper look

339
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,960
great i think over here

340
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,320
and then okay maybe i'll tell you two more than you

341
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:55,680
so gil um thank you for the talk um i'd like to make two points one is that boredom is

342
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:03,760
considered the lack of focus because if you're focused you're not bored the second point is

343
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:10,319
you stressed several times in some of your talks that it's

344
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:17,200
dharma teachers just say oh just let go do it don't do it but it's

345
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:22,480
it's also not proper for dharma teachers to say such a thing because

346
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:29,520
there's a lot of these innate fears and things they have such a great grip that it's very

347
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:35,680
difficult to let go and then in one of your talks on um janas you said

348
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:41,680
the buddha was a very wise teacher which is why he substituted anxiety with

349
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:50,240
pleasure so when you trade it's easier for people to change the focus on something else

350
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:56,480
than to just let go so that is one way for personally for me

351
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:02,560
um a lot of the stress and anxiety the way i was able to let go was by

352
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:08,800
tuning into these sensations in the body and then you go on to find something

353
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:17,200
deeper wonderful thank you so then over here last one

354
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:24,880
thank you hi gail uh thank you so much for the

355
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:30,800
talk i really appreciated it um i just wanted to say i guess

356
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,839
one thing that i thought i i think it was i don't know if it was from a book i read or from one of your other talks i

357
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:41,200
talked about how there was 113 different emotions

358
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:47,040
and i was thinking about how sometimes it's easier to kind of embrace whatever

359
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:52,160
you're feeling when you can recognize that emotion but 113 is a lot

360
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,599
so i don't know if you've heard i just started reading this book and i thought it was really helpful and they did or

361
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:03,040
she did make some references to buddhism it was called uh the atlas of the heart

362
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:09,359
and like 87 different types of emotions and so it was really interesting because it kind of showed how some things could

363
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:15,599
be similar but how they're different and anyways i just wanted to bring it up i don't know if that would be something

364
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:21,839
that would be helpful or anything that you'd ever want to look into but i really liked it so far and just wanted

365
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:26,880
an update yeah i think developing emotional literacy is really helpful

366
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:33,680
and knowing the range of emotions and the distinctions between anger and

367
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:39,280
irritation and ire and rage and annoyance and be able to separate and

368
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:45,520
really see the distinctions and becoming you know more and more familiar with it all some people have never

369
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:52,079
really developed much emotional literacy and it's just like a vague sense of you know i'm feeling lousy or something

370
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:59,200
so i think it's a great thing to do yeah thank you okay so we should stop so we can have

371
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:04,800
our tea and um and it's time for us to stop and so you're welcome to come up afterwards now

372
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:11,359
if you want or meet outside for tea so you're all welcome to stay and so the idea is we the reason to get your tea in

373
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:16,400
indoors hot tea is that there's a hot water

374
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,520
dispenser on the counter there and there's tea in the drawer there i guess or i don't know how it's set up

375
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:31,400
and then those of you who want to stay will meet outside and chat and say hello and i hope all of you stay so thank you
