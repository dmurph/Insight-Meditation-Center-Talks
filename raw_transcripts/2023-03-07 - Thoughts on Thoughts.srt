1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:08,280
welcome welcome everyone nice to see you all nice to practice

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:16,260
together I've been away for a number of weeks I

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:22,099
had the great Good Fortune to sit along Retreat and

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,740
so here I am now I feel like well maybe I should say something like profound about the retreat but uh

5
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:38,579
nothing's arising so uh but tonight I wanted to talk

6
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,680
a little bit about something that I played around with and

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:52,020
kind of explored on this retreat but I like to start start here with this

8
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:58,800
idea that it's very common when the most Retreats like if it's a

9
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,860
week-long retreat or something that there's a standard formula of the instructions that are given in the

10
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:12,360
morning and one of those instructions is mindfulness of thoughts

11
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:18,420
this idea of you know if we just that's part of the human experience and we can

12
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,880
bring mindfulness to everything so let's bring mindfulness to thoughts

13
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:32,360
and so there's a few ways that this instruction is given first is to notice what is the

14
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,799
experience of thinking

15
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:43,680
so our thoughts is it something like images that you see

16
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:51,899
or or it sounds that you hear like is it a voice or what is the experience

17
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:58,799
completely independent of the content like what does it just like to think

18
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:07,320
and putting our Awareness on that on the form or the experience helps us to not

19
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,660
get lost so much in the thoughts [Applause]

20
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:20,040
and then if we recognize that the thoughts like are really persistent and just uh or compelling and we're just

21
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,500
finding ourselves completely lost in thought to maybe have a little inquiry

22
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,020
well what is uh is there an emotion under here that's fueling the

23
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:37,440
like what what's what's giving the quality of these thoughts to be so

24
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,379
compelling that we find ourselves lost in them

25
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:50,940
and maybe we might even give the instruction well notice if there's a particular theme not some the exact

26
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:58,260
content but a theme a lot of planning say I had no idea what I've planned or I

27
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:05,940
was I never didn't consider myself a planner until I started meditation practice wow we I do a lot of planning

28
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:11,159
quite something or maybe we do a lot of fantasizing of like oh wouldn't it be

29
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:18,900
great at this or that you're like imagining something that's better or maybe do a lot of reminiscing or

30
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:25,019
um ruminating about something that's happened in the past right there just might be certain flavors or themes

31
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:31,200
the types of thoughts that we have and part of the reason why we give this

32
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,860
instruction to have mindfulness of thoughts is this recognition that

33
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:42,480
whatever is happening in in our experience whether it's a thought or a

34
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:49,440
bodily experience sounds whatever it might be there's a way if we like honor

35
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,799
or respect that it's here

36
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:00,900
then there's a way and that we kind of like brings us into the present moment

37
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:07,560
brings us into our experience so it's like recognizing oh it's here it's

38
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:16,620
actually happening right now there's a way that this tuning into presence can just be a gateway to a

39
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:23,160
direct experience and direct experience is a gateway towards greater freedom

40
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:30,120
and I want to talk a little bit more about that but maybe I'll start with

41
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,759
okay with mindfulness of thoughts but what are thoughts

42
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,800
like what are they have you ever thought about this

43
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,100
so there's a few ways we might think about thoughts one is these are like ideas

44
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,680
and they have like an ideas that have maybe like a certain like a power behind

45
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,560
them that allows us to be creative or allows us to innovate or you know do

46
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:06,300
something in the world that might not happen if we didn't have those thoughts that's one way to think about it

47
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,759
another way to consider thoughts is their occasional nuisances

48
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,580
they show up and we're trying to meditate and we just feel like we can't get settled because the mind is just

49
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,979
going incessantly with thinking and maybe the thoughts are even a little bit troubling

50
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:30,300
or maybe there are nuisances because we're trying to sleep and can't sleep because there's all

51
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:36,240
these thoughts going or maybe another way to think about

52
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:43,740
thoughts is this capacity that humans have like this self-reflection and it's part

53
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:50,520
of what distinguishes us from plants or some of the animals

54
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:56,759
and not only that this self-reflection allows us to plan and to communicate

55
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:02,220
with others what our plans are and even to like maybe organize groups of people

56
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,280
together to you know do these plans

57
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:15,360
or maybe we can take like a scientific approach and say well thoughts are just these neurochemical processes that

58
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,919
involve a lot of neurons and some organized fashion or something like this

59
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:29,880
there's a number of different ways we might think about thoughts but I think for like our purposes for this

60
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:36,780
idea of this wanting to have this movement towards greater Freedom greater ease

61
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:42,479
greater peace in our lives one way we can think about thoughts

62
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:48,780
is if you can write it down it's a thought

63
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:54,180
just this right if there's a sentence that you can make out of it it's a

64
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:59,340
thought and there's something about that that kind of like simplifies it for me I've

65
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:04,740
kind of like find this uh happy or I'm sorry like it there's a way

66
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:11,100
that kind of like takes the power out of them or the mystery out of them in some kind of way oh yeah I can write this down it's a

67
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:17,639
thought and over New Year's

68
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:24,780
I did a thinking of thinking about uh okay so is there you know like

69
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:31,440
some reflection I want to do start the new year that's kind of a

70
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:39,680
tradition might we often do as with uh some other people and uh

71
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:46,620
and my like uh what I wanted to offer was or what is something I'm working

72
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:53,400
with this year this idea they're just thoughts

73
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:59,460
they're just thoughts and there's a way of kind of recognizing you know that thoughts come and they

74
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:06,060
thought thoughts go they are powerful but they don't have to be

75
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:11,699
they don't have to be powerful right it's kind of when we believe them or give them Authority or something like

76
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:16,460
this but otherwise they can just be one mental event

77
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,180
so one thing about thoughts part of why they can be powerful and maybe not so

78
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:29,940
helpful way and sometimes it's not helpful is that they're very often like discursive right

79
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:36,719
it's not like we have just one thought it leads to another which leads to another or another another and off we go

80
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:44,820
but not only that they're very often like self-referential have you noticed this have you looked at your thoughts

81
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:51,180
It's All About Me I'm gonna do this I'm not gonna do that

82
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:56,220
I should do this I can't believe that person said this to me

83
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:02,760
I'm gonna make sure that this I don't know I want to do this or that it's it's

84
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:08,880
quite something it's really quite something on this Retreat I was looking like okay

85
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:15,060
I'm gonna see is there any thought that isn't self-referential because so much

86
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:22,279
of it is like oh there's a sound and I don't like it right there's all this kind of a

87
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:30,140
self-referential stuff so but there's this way also this uh the the

88
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:37,440
self that's getting referenced this is I think a really important it's distorted

89
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:44,580
our thoughts are distorting them it's not really how things are and I

90
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:50,760
heard this from somebody else and I really liked this idea that there's all these assumptions about

91
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:57,120
how we are there's all these uh views about how we are that maybe we're true

92
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:03,839
at one moment but aren't necessarily true at that particular moment but yet we're kind of like dragging it into the

93
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:09,120
present moment and so I heard this uh idea that it's like you

94
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,459
um turn on a TV program in the middle and you there's this assumption that you

95
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:20,760
already know who all the characters are and everything and that you're just gonna go along with whatever's happening

96
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:26,700
but this pointing to the direct experience reminds us that well you know

97
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:34,080
maybe that me that's getting referenced isn't uh quite accurate isn't really

98
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:41,120
what's happening at that moment that's something as I said it's kind of getting dragged from the past

99
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,060
so we have these views we have these views about what it means

100
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:54,000
to be a person in general as well as what does it means to be this particular

101
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,839
person one that we take ourselves to be

102
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:06,060
and so these views are thoughts too of course they are

103
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:11,480
right and often we we could also use this word beliefs

104
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:18,240
and we might say okay well belief view are these the same

105
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,199
for the purposes of what I'm going to talk about tonight I like to say that they are the same

106
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:31,860
and so what what is a belief what is a view one definition could be an acceptance

107
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:39,540
that a statement is true or that something exists

108
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:45,600
and we could see how that relates to this sense of self we have this sense of of course there's this me that has to be

109
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,120
protected and bolstered and enhanced and you know all these types of

110
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,399
things but a belief it's a thought and a view

111
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:05,640
but what makes it maybe different than what we would say just a regular thought is that it's partially hidden

112
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:11,820
it's not so obvious to us something that's like operating a little

113
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:18,899
bit underneath the radar maybe I'll distinguish like beliefs and

114
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:26,399
views from opinions because opinions have like a solution they're offering

115
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:32,700
like okay here's a solution to a problem that's an opinion I suppose I believe or a view is more just like a statement

116
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:39,560
that this is true or this exists or something like that so I'll make that uh distinction

117
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:46,019
and so we might also say that views are this

118
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:51,420
mental events that happen cognitive activity type of thoughts that aren't

119
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:58,200
quite seen and and when we see it in ourselves these are you know based on our experience and

120
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:04,680
based on facts it's of course we have these views of course we have these beliefs

121
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:12,720
when we see them in others let's see them as uh unproven and rigid

122
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,899
and narrow and oh they're just conditioned by their experienced or idiosyncratic or maybe even a little bit

123
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:24,000
weird or something so it's very interesting right how we hold hours

124
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,040
but you know of course this is the way it is but when we see other people's

125
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,560
views we tend to be discounted discount them but not our own

126
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:42,300
and that's so much about what practice is about is to help see some of these views that

127
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:50,000
are influencing Us in so many ways and we're not even aware of it

128
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:57,480
of course right it's that views show up in the way we behave

129
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:04,200
what we think is valuable what is invaluable or what's worthwhile what's helpful what isn't helpful right all

130
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,720
these things are based on views beliefs

131
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:15,600
and so one thing is interesting that maybe we

132
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:22,940
don't really notice is that our view about views our beliefs about beliefs

133
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:30,060
because I'll offer that the I also heard this from somebody else is that the

134
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:36,420
quantity and intensity that we hold our beliefs how many we have and how hard

135
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:42,300
we're holding on inversely proportional to the amount of Freedom we have

136
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:50,100
but we might be thinking like no I have to hold on to these it's it helps make me safe and that's why you Orient to the

137
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:56,639
world or into the have this view that um

138
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,459
has to be quiet in order to meditate or even the view that I have to meditate a

139
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:09,600
lot in order to have greater Freedom or greater ease and or everybody else seems to get this

140
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:16,380
meditation thing but I don't know it doesn't quite work for me or where the Dharma is going to answer

141
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:21,959
everything for me if only I could just uh I don't know figure things out or

142
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:29,519
learn Paulie read more suit does you know or something like this like we have these views that often are limiting

143
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:36,019
what we think is possible for ourselves or even what's possible for others

144
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:43,560
makes sense that we have them of course we do but what's being pointed to you is can we hold them lately with Open Hands

145
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:49,740
instead of you know grabbing on to them maybe some other views we might have

146
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:55,019
that to show up in some of the ways we practice and I know I certainly had this

147
00:15:55,019 --> 00:16:02,040
View this uh I think this used to be a commercial I'm not sure but this

148
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:09,360
expression no pain no gain you know that that more suffering the better right I

149
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:15,540
don't know the things that I put myself through you know thinking that I had to with meditation practice or a long

150
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:21,839
retreat practice or things that uh just was painful just swimming in the Duke uh

151
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:28,980
kind of like thinking that oh I have to figure this out and just rehashing the most painful things like

152
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:34,920
during some of these meditation sessions some of that comes up and it's unavoidable but there is a way that I

153
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:42,000
kind of had this view of I deserve to suffer a little bit or that I had to get

154
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:49,500
to the bottom of it and the only way I could get to the bottom of it is to think about it incessantly and then recognizing that actually there is no

155
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:54,500
bottom as long as you were thinking about it right there is no bottom

156
00:16:54,660 --> 00:17:00,300
so maybe this idea of no pain no gain and I do want to you know acknowledge that there

157
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:07,140
certainly is uncomfortableness in practice physical discomfort

158
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:12,600
learning to meditate but there's also the discomfort of so

159
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:17,699
much about practices like we gain some greater understanding about ourselves

160
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:23,480
about the world and it's not always what we wish right

161
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:31,860
I wanted to like this idea that oh I'm such a planner to have when I I was like so disappointed in myself I felt like oh

162
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:39,000
Diana I thought you know you could be more in the moment or something like that but I wasn't in the moment

163
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,760
beginning of my meditation practice absolutely not and I felt embarrassed about it and felt

164
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:49,520
like it was this deep secret I didn't want to share with anybody

165
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:59,580
so what views do we have and importantly what is our relationship

166
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:07,980
to them are we attached to our ideas

167
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:14,100
or do we hold them lightly and often we don't know this until they

168
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:19,639
get challenged and so we meet somebody who has a different View

169
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:26,700
where we find that we feel like we're some resistance or

170
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:32,640
reluctance to like do something like that just doesn't seem right

171
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,179
maybe we can't even quite put our finger on why it doesn't seem right

172
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:46,260
but some views about views we might have are having strong beliefs makes me a strong

173
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:51,960
person there might be a way in which you know that might be in there because I did

174
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:59,280
that okay I have to hold on because if I don't have strong beliefs I will be easily fooled people will take advantage

175
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,500
of me but there's also this way right in which

176
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:10,100
we are whatever we're like really holding on to limits us

177
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:15,360
I'm not saying throw away all of you so I'm saying hold them lightly

178
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:21,720
yeah this is my current understanding this is what makes sense to me right now

179
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:29,760
this is what I'm resonating with right now instead of like this is the truth

180
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:37,940
or yeah that's or this is my current hypothesis I'm trained as a scientist right I love that kind of thing right

181
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,179
right or maybe we have this belief a person is defined by their beliefs

182
00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:50,700
defined by their views and I want to be defined this way so I'm going to hold

183
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:57,720
really tightly to these views or another one that where not only people are defined but what tribe they belong to is

184
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:02,880
by what their beliefs are and so I have to hold on to these beliefs and Views

185
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:09,480
because I want to belong to this community again there's nothing wrong with sharing

186
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:16,799
beliefs with other people it's just can we hold them lightly instead of this divisiveness

187
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:23,900
because as I said early earlier that's the number of beliefs and how strong we are holding holding holding on to them

188
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:30,120
limits us amidst our freedom because again there's

189
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:37,559
so many of these unseen views that are influencing us influencing our Behavior

190
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:42,840
these unseen views are the way are the reason why sometimes we do self-de

191
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:48,840
defeating behaviors things that don't serve us because there's a view underneath there

192
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:54,780
there's a belief that we don't know or aren't that we're still believing in

193
00:20:54,780 --> 00:21:00,780
some kind of way so

194
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:10,940
how can we see some of these beliefs or some of these views how can we see the Unseen

195
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:17,700
it's part of what practice is about part of it was what I talked it opened

196
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:24,299
with was this idea of noticing our thoughts but you know some of our thoughts are on the surface and easy and

197
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:27,440
some of them are not so easy

198
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:37,740
so one way or maybe I should say noticing thoughts isn't the only way to work with thoughts

199
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:43,980
it's often what we're teaching it's often what you don't if we teach introduction to meditation or on our

200
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:50,059
Meditation Retreat it's what we're teaching but there's other ways

201
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,340
and so but before we like uh

202
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:01,559
examine or explore some of these other ways part of it is that we have to

203
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:08,400
notice that we have to put down some of the views we have about what does it mean to do Buddhist

204
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:15,419
practice what does it mean to meditate because we might have this idea that

205
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:22,559
well the Mind should be completely devoid of any thinking that's what real meditation is and

206
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:28,640
I don't know have you tried it right

207
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:34,980
I you know with some real concentration there the thoughts really do get quite

208
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:40,440
and I'll talk about that in a moment but when we have these types of ideas that

209
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:46,860
the thought of the Mind the thinking should only be one way then you know we kind of set ourselves

210
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:52,980
up for the inner critic to get really loud because that's not what our experience is or frustration or

211
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,720
disappointment or those kinds of things

212
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:06,000
but for some of us the idea of maybe like using the Mind during meditation

213
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,039
doesn't doesn't feel quite right and maybe it feels like that's a little bit

214
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:17,520
of a shift that we feel uncomfortable with because often there's the teaching

215
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:24,179
is is that we're just noticing thoughts and this is great this is really powerful

216
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:31,799
but maybe I'd like to offer maybe there's something that we can do besides just noticing

217
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:36,139
that can really support us with this

218
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:45,140
but before I I talk about that I also want to notice that sometimes we might have views that well a good meditation

219
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:51,659
is when we have this experience of like not knowing

220
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:57,960
maybe where there's this hangout in this maybe vague fluffy cottony

221
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:06,059
space that feels comforting maybe maybe for us that's the what we

222
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:13,020
have this idea about what meditation is and this idea that we should do anything else doesn't feel comfortable

223
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:19,740
or maybe we have a view that we have to actually figure things out and that's what meditation is about you sit down

224
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:25,799
and find the answers to whatever is needs answers

225
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:31,580
or maybe your views about what meditation should be aren't maybe so clearly

226
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:37,380
articulated or aren't so obvious but it's worthwhile considering

227
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:42,260
what views you have about meditation

228
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:50,700
so how to and how to see the Unseen views I'd like to offer this idea is to

229
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:58,620
do it inquiry practice and again I want to say this is not straight up mindfulness

230
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:04,799
but it can be really like augment or Turbo Charge or something like this the

231
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,960
mindfulness practice so what is what am I talking about this

232
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:15,380
idea of dropping in a question

233
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:23,100
and this could definitely be doing meditation but it can also be in daily life and but it's really important like how

234
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:29,159
we drop this question in is dropped in with a like this sense of

235
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:34,260
curiosity and this openness and there's a way that can we receive an

236
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:41,159
answer instead of okay I gotta figure this out what is this it's very like you know

237
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:48,299
different instead this kind of like just dropping and maybe just opening to see

238
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:54,539
if something arises something may not arise

239
00:25:54,539 --> 00:26:01,919
it may it may not but it's the idea of opening to The Answer instead of

240
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:07,260
figuring it out and so and bringing this maybe this a

241
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:13,500
certain amount of curiosity to it but not only some curiosity like some warmth

242
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:19,700
some care like oh what what is this

243
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:26,778
so here are some questions that might help with this

244
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:33,020
is there a view here that I'm not seeing

245
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:39,779
I said obvious straight question or maybe

246
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:44,600
what view am I holding on to

247
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:51,860
or what belief is operating in the background

248
00:26:52,320 --> 00:27:00,200
or maybe what am I resisting what am I avoiding

249
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:08,159
so it's just the dropping in of the question as I said maybe an answer arises maybe

250
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:15,000
an answer doesn't arise but part of the reason

251
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:22,679
we want to maybe like explore and play around with this is that if you feel stuck

252
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:27,720
in your meditation practice and I would say maybe even in your life

253
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:33,020
it's because there is one of these views that's underneath that somehow is maybe

254
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:40,860
sabotaging you know unknowingly or I guess yeah like

255
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:46,500
there's a belief or something that we're holding on to that doesn't allow this movement forward

256
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:52,679
but often we just don't know what those are so an inquiry practice is to drop in

257
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:59,480
this question is there a view here that I'm not seeing

258
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:06,059
and as I said this can be during meditation it can be in daily life

259
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:12,260
and in some ways this reminds me of like you know the Zen of this koan practice

260
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:19,380
co-wan practices you're working with something that doesn't quite make sense but it's the same idea of like kind of

261
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:26,460
like opening up to something might arise something different might arise

262
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:31,940
so having this inquiry is there a view here that I'm not seeing

263
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:40,820
what what am I holding on to what belief am I holding on to

264
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,179
and there's often a reason why they're not seen is because they're uncomfortable or they're protecting us

265
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:54,539
from something that's uncomfortable so if you start to feel squirmy restlessness

266
00:28:54,539 --> 00:29:01,500
this is a good sign this means that you're like in the right territory

267
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:07,500
if you started to feel like whoa I don't want to do this and you get up from your meditation or something

268
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:15,840
this is a indicator that you're in the area where maybe something new which you

269
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:22,200
know isn't always Pleasant is in the neighborhood maybe about to arise so if we're always staying in

270
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:27,559
what's comfortable you know we'll always stay in what's comfortable

271
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:35,898
so how to see the Unseen one is to do an inquiry practice

272
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:42,720
another one is maybe to do a settling practice what I'll call a settling

273
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:48,059
practice which is a little bit different than just mindfulness and you may say this is

274
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:53,640
more like a samadhi or yeah I'll just use that word somebody

275
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:59,120
for those of you know kind of like a gathering collecting settling

276
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:05,880
maybe I'll end with this um with this beautiful simile about

277
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:13,158
settling that the Buddha offers in the samyukta Akama

278
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:20,399
and it goes like this I I yeah it goes like this it is just as someone who is panning for

279
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:26,640
gold you know panning for gold I I've done this go up to the Foothills here and you ever get a little pan and water

280
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,419
and dirt and try to find some gold right

281
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:39,960
it is just as someone who is panning for gold and who places a horde of sand and Earth into a trough and then rinses it

282
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:46,500
with water so that the large pieces emerge and the contamination by solid stones and hard

283
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:52,500
chunks flows away with the water so you're just describing you know putting some mud in there is what I'm imagining

284
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:58,140
the miners did here and the 49ers did here in California

285
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:03,539
yet there remains sand that is interspersed among the gold and by

286
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:09,720
rinsing it again with water the sand flows out with the water and after this

287
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:16,220
the gold becomes visible yet there is fine sand

288
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:22,620
interspersed with soil and by rinsing it again with water the fine sand and the

289
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:27,899
soil flow out with the water and after that there was gold that is pure clean

290
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:34,740
and without add mixture yet there still appears fine dross in

291
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:41,039
the gold and I had to look this up what is dros I can't imagine having to translate this

292
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:48,659
word from Poli to English so kudos to the some of these early translators so dros is the residue that's left on

293
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:54,019
the surface of a molten metal I didn't know this so

294
00:31:54,539 --> 00:32:01,799
so then there's so you get the gold away from all the dirt but still there's this dress on it so then it goes from the

295
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:08,159
person who is panning from gold to the Goldsmith and then the simile continues after a

296
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:14,520
Goldsmith places the gold into the furnace Heats it up eating it and blowing on it until it melts in order to

297
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:21,000
remove the dross and the contamination but because the gold that is visible is

298
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,159
not light not soft does not send forth Brilliance and would break if it were

299
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,260
bent or straightened the Goldsmith places it again into the

300
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:37,500
furnace Heats it up Beats on it blows it turns it around casts it

301
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:44,279
and then after that they'll go this light soft and Brilliant and it will not

302
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:51,240
break if bent or straightened and then according to one's wish it can be made

303
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:58,320
into an earring a necklace a hairpin or a bracelet

304
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:04,380
or whatever one wishes I like this idea of settling right that

305
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:09,600
there's uh you know we could think about it in one meditation session but we can

306
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:16,740
also think about like our whole meditation practice you know like over the years right we start to see things

307
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:22,679
some of these jewels start to become present that as we start to like with

308
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:29,159
practice with time with repetition we start to see some of the Finer Things that we hadn't seen

309
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:36,299
before and this there's always this value and getting rid of like these really big

310
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:44,059
things that are don't help us even to see the gold and then even to like purify the gold

311
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:53,399
so I like to leave with this idea that thoughts right there are constant companions

312
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:57,380
you can work with them by noticing them

313
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:04,080
and beliefs and Views I'd like to say are a type of thoughts

314
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,118
and what makes them different than thoughts is that they're often unseen

315
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:16,020
and these unseen parts are often what is uh if we feel stuck some way or we feel

316
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:22,919
like we're not uh having if we find ourselves uh doing

317
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:30,599
things that aren't helpful there's like some view under there and so one way we can do them as an inquiry

318
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:38,700
practice or settling and I could say also mindfulness will as

319
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:43,740
well but you know it might take a little bit longer because mindfulness is kind

320
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:50,280
of like passively maybe less uh directly kind of like purifying and moving away

321
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:56,638
all the obstructions so like to offer you with that leave you

322
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:03,319
with that and now open it up to see if there's some questions or comments

323
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:28,200
um these are really interesting topic and I was kind of curious

324
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:34,440
as to um have you heard people say um how they viewed their thoughts

325
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:42,000
because I know for me it's usually like pictures of action but I'm wondering do

326
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,480
I wonder if people see their thoughts differently yeah I mean like do they see

327
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:55,140
words or like you said sounds yeah yeah yes I definitely have like when I teach

328
00:35:55,140 --> 00:36:01,020
introduction to meditation we talk about this and we like kind of like take a little bit of survey okay who who has

329
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:07,980
and definitely some people tend to have them more as like a voice that's speaking and then the question could be

330
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:14,880
is it your voice is it like a parent voice is what's the tone is it warm or

331
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:22,020
is it you know you know harsh or something like that as well as like little mini movies that can be seen and

332
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:27,540
then the question we could ask is is it really clear and high definition or is

333
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:33,300
it kind of sepia you know Brown and not so clear and and then the question

334
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:42,079
another question we could ask is well or maybe there's types of thoughts that are images and types that are sounds

335
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:48,720
so this could be a great way to kind of like shift our relationship to thoughts because otherwise we just tend to

336
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:54,900
believe all of them and think they're authoritative and get lost in them but to have this curiosity this exploration

337
00:36:54,900 --> 00:37:01,140
helps us to let me shift our experience or shift our relationship to thoughts I

338
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:07,020
would say yeah because um I know for myself do you want to use that microphone um I know for myself my

339
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:12,780
thoughts are always telling me to do do do do do because that's how it's brought up right you just you keep going you

340
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:18,359
have goals and you do do do do do but I'm wondering if people have kind of and

341
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:25,740
it's not like an unkind voice in my head but um I would like it to change you know not

342
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:31,380
always happen to be like so productive yeah to be a little nicer right yeah

343
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:38,180
yeah yeah so I really appreciate it yeah great thank you

344
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:07,619
thank you Diana do you think that um

345
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:12,660
the inside in our theravada tradition

346
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:19,980
they are kind of thoughts also I would say that insights are seen

347
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:26,040
through some of our beliefs some of our core beliefs are they

348
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:33,000
thoughts I I think they become thoughts but

349
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,740
they're they're more experiential

350
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:46,320
there's more than one type of insight maybe I'll say that too right some of the really transformative ones yeah well

351
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:53,480
they're all transformed that's part of the definition of an Insight this is I would say an Insight is

352
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:59,820
um maybe we could say it's a thought and recognition that lesson suffering

353
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:04,859
and some of the insights we have are like psychological like oh now I

354
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:11,040
understand that I do that because uh this happened in my earlier in my life

355
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:17,460
or I want to get that or something like that so we have those types of insights but some of the insights particularly

356
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:23,099
into the three characteristics and permanent not self-suffering those ones

357
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:28,619
that are like really transformative life-changing I would say

358
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:34,200
um I think those tend to be more experiential but then they as we try to

359
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:38,660
understand what happened we put thoughts on top of them

360
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:45,000
I see because sometimes those um the small

361
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:52,020
insight for me it's um it's like

362
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:58,260
some simple things during the daily life you know I I just looked things at a

363
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:04,859
different angles and I thought well is that a thought

364
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:13,200
coming through um so I don't follow my habitual

365
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:20,640
patterns anymore and I see the different angle different way to do things

366
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:27,839
so um yeah I think you're right probably that's a clarification

367
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:32,780
or instead of thought

368
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:39,780
okay I was just does it matter if it's a thought what would be the uh

369
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:44,960
what impact would that have on you if it were or if it weren't

370
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:51,000
I don't think it matters that thought or not however

371
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:57,900
um you know by studying this what is mindfulness of the thought

372
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:03,480
what are they like you said is such a big range of it

373
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:12,180
another thing I was wondering is the intuition you know is the you're talking about

374
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:20,160
um dropping to the inquiries well sometimes I have the intuition is

375
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:27,420
that part of the insert coming through the inter inquiries yeah

376
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:33,720
yeah we should often let's say intuition I

377
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:40,140
thought thoughts it's a different type of knowing I was saying like

378
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:47,460
thoughts are right if you can write it down it's a thought but intuition is not something I mean you could say I just

379
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:52,680
have a feeling I just have this gut feeling or something like that but it's a little bit different

380
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,220
I see

381
00:42:10,859 --> 00:42:15,960
so I have a question for you not and it doesn't need to be answered

382
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:23,339
if you don't want but I was really intrigued by your notion of getting into this place of being uncomfortable

383
00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:30,720
and curious because I've been in some groups and there's a phrase that I've heard so much in the last 10 or 20 years of I'm

384
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:37,099
not comfortable with that and so do you think there's some

385
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:43,980
beneficial and non-beneficial and comfortable absolutely I would say but it's

386
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:49,380
different when you're in groups or not I would say with oneself if you start to

387
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:55,140
feel a little bit uncomfortable and you want you feel stuck and you're doing some inquiry and you start to feel

388
00:42:55,140 --> 00:43:01,560
uncomfortable that's a good sign that means that you're getting close to something that's

389
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:06,839
uh is causing the stuckness you don't want to see or don't want to know or

390
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:12,839
something like this and it's a yeah there's resistance to knowing it or

391
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:20,579
seeing it or something and that's why there's stuckness but I think yeah interpersonally I don't know I guess we

392
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:27,300
kind of have to depends on the relationships and stuff like that I would say yeah because I

393
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:32,400
so maybe a view that I have is that I think there's sometimes that

394
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:39,540
if a group gets into that uncomfortable area there may also be something to learn oh yeah you know what I mean it's

395
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:45,540
it's it's kind of like a group can really avoid you're like don't go there you

396
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:51,780
know that sort of thing so that that's what's been going on for me so that's

397
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:57,480
what I resonated with yeah thank you thank you for saying that maybe I'll just offer this something that I learned

398
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:04,140
like a long time ago maybe all of you guys ever heard this too but I uh use this in groups

399
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:09,359
there's like these three uh phases forming storming norming maybe you've

400
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:16,140
heard this right and so there's like the storming part is like when it's uncomfortable and just recognize it oh that's just part of what it means to be

401
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:21,599
a group but then you get to the other side of it and there's greater intimacy and understanding and stuff so maybe

402
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:26,480
that's what you're pointing to yeah thank you John

403
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:34,800
okay so we're at the top of the hour I want to thank you for your kind attention and for your practice you're

404
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:42,380
welcome to come up and talk to me if you'd like afterwards but otherwise I wish you a lovely rest of the evening thank you
