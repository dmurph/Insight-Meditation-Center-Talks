00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:08,880
so good day to everyone hello and welcome

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,920
to our sunday morning meditation and talk and thank you for those of you who are

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:22,320
doing greetings on the chat and it uh it's very nice for me

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,960
and then i start feeling a real connection to to to those of you who are listening and

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,519
and i appreciate the warmth that's being expressed

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,680
so um

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,840
as an introduction to this meditation today

8
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,480
there's an interesting difference between

9
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,840
the body and the mind the body in a sense has weight it's

10
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,120
substantial and has certain weight we can ask how much do you weigh

11
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:10,640
and we're referring to the weight of the body the mind wide ranging

12
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:17,840
filled with the all kinds of ideas and motivations and memories

13
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,439
the mind being different than the brain the mind has no weight

14
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:29,920
but more specifically the thoughts in the mind they have no

15
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,240
weight they're weightless if you feel your hands maybe you can feel the weight

16
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,840
of your hands maybe your hands are

17
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,840
pushing pressing the weight of gravity is their weight is being pulled by gravity

18
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:55,920
into maybe your legs or into the other hand or some part of your body and you can feel the weight in the sense

19
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,520
of the hand but your thoughts have no weight your

20
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:09,039
judgments in and of themselves have no weight your memories your predictions

21
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:17,840
and about the future have no weight but they can be quite weighty we can say

22
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,879
i'm way down my by my concerns and weighed down by

23
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:30,000
my thoughts and it's not the thoughts themselves but rather it's the contracting the

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:39,200
tensing this pushing the striving the energy that we apply to our thoughts and ideas

25
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,319
and judgments and memories and fantasies that that's where the

26
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:50,319
in the sense the sub substantial nature of them comes alive or that's where the weightiness of them

27
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:56,160
comes in that way that we relate to them we contribute the weight

28
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,440
but in and of themselves our thoughts have no weight

29
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,920
and to realize that to make that real in ourselves to really

30
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,440
feel and sense the weightless quality of these

31
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,840
then we can get a feeling for freedom we can get a freedom

32
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:26,239
a sense of how these float that there's no boundaries to them or no

33
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:34,319
substance to them or no boundaries or no um no way that they just kind of

34
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:46,159
can come and go they can dissolve and appear they float through in a sense

35
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:55,040
and everything else is our contribution our intense interest in them or

36
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,239
alarm or or horror or fear in relationship to them or

37
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:06,879
are wanting and not wanting and contracting and pushing away and this goes on and on

38
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,480
the ways in which we relate and for this meditation maybe you can

39
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:19,440
become aware a little bit of that distinction between the weightiness that

40
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,840
you contribute and the weightlessness of your thinking

41
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,840
of your ideas and thoughts

42
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:40,400
the ways that the substance substantiality of our

43
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,600
tension and holding on reactivity

44
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,680
and the non-substantial nature of these thoughts themselves

45
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:02,560
and one of the things to discover then is that our thoughts

46
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,639
are not bothering us but in a sense we are bothering them or

47
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,160
we are being bothered by them and to discover

48
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,360
how not to be bothered by thoughts and ideas

49
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,039
is to begin discovering how to be free from them

50
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:31,520
so assuming a meditation posture that supports you to

51
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,120
be alert and relaxed

52
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:44,960
and taking a few long slow deep breaths

53
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:52,720
breathing in breathing out

54
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,240
and as you exhale

55
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:06,479
to relax and soften

56
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:15,680
relaxing and softening the muscles of the body contributes to a feeling of fluidity or

57
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:22,000
softness or lightness in the body that's not there if we are tense and

58
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,400
tight

59
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,840
letting your breathing return to normal

60
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,080
taking a few moments to feel

61
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:54,960
your embodied body feeling the sense of

62
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,680
embodiment in this body

63
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:08,160
the weight of the body the substance of the body

64
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:19,120
and then as you exhale gently exhale

65
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,319
softening the muscles of your face

66
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:34,160
letting those muscles the face fall away from the bone in the skull

67
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:59,840
letting your softening your eyes

68
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:11,919
as you exhale softening the shoulders

69
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,319
releasing the shoulders to the pull of

70
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
gravity

71
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:41,839
exhaling and softening in the belly

72
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:55,839
and maybe when you inhale can you keep the belly soft and expensive

73
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:11,839
and then also as you exhale see if you can relax any tension or

74
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:19,040
pressure that's around the mind in the area that you most identify with

75
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,880
the mind maybe it's the same as the brain

76
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,560
area the head

77
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:47,839
if there's any tension contraction relax soften let go

78
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:56,560
the tensions the pressure energy agitation of the mind is not

79
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,320
really of the mind that's of the body

80
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,079
participating reacting engaging

81
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,000
the mind has no weight

82
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:29,839
it has no boundaries no center

83
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:41,200
and the thoughts of the mind the judgments the ideas of the mind

84
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,040
have no weight no substance

85
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:57,440
their weight and substance is contributed in our reactions to them our relationship to them

86
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:04,399
in and of itself to allow the simplicity of thoughts the

87
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:11,839
weightless insubstantial nature

88
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,360
allowing them to be without being bothered by them

89
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:25,839
without bothering them

90
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:34,880
and one way to do this is to let the attention your attention

91
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,440
flow into your body into the breathing body

92
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:55,199
resting awareness and the inhales and the exhales of the body

93
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:06,160
so that the energy of awareness doesn't contribute to the heaviness

94
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:12,160
or substantiality of thoughts

95
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,560
and thoughts maybe at some point will begin to just float

96
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,000
and feel very thin and very light

97
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:34,000
nothing we have to be involved in instead let yourself be centered

98
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:49,839
in the body breathing

99
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,919
you

100
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,919
you

101
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,919
you

102
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:41,760
there is no need to give weight and substance to whatever you're

103
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:48,559
thinking about leave the thoughts alone

104
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:57,360
if you don't pick up a boulder you won't feel its weight

105
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,559
if you don't pick up a thought

106
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:09,840
it has no weight

107
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,919
you

108
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,399
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

109
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:35,760
to consider when thoughts have no weight no

110
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:41,600
substance we're not contributing pressure

111
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:47,519
or resistance contraction around them

112
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:56,559
then the heart is not eclipsed when the thoughts have wait they eclipse

113
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:03,440
the warmth of the heart the radiance of the heart

114
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:10,799
and perhaps softening relaxing the mind

115
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:19,760
in these last moments of the sitting to feel censor

116
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:25,440
whatever capacity for warm-heartedness

117
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:34,320
heartfelt goodwill that you're capable of

118
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:42,640
and without adding weight to your thoughts

119
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,080
lightly openly

120
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:57,039
let that heartful heartfelt warmth

121
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:05,200
open up widely into the world around us to the world around you

122
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:13,200
the people who are closest to you physically and emotionally

123
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:20,640
circles of community from outwards across the land

124
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:31,120
and without any weight of reactions or judgments or planning

125
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:38,080
the simplicity of an open heart

126
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:45,919
wishing that this meditation that you've just done in some way or other

127
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:53,840
may it be in service of the welfare and happiness of others

128
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,399
may it be that the benefits that have come from sitting quietly

129
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:08,799
may you share those benefits with others may they spread from you

130
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:16,878
so that we contribute maybe in small infinitesimal ways

131
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:22,480
but we contribute to a global

132
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:30,800
possibility that all beings may be happy

133
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,879
that all beings may be safe

134
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,638
that all beings may be peaceful

135
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:51,118
that all beings everywhere can be free

136
00:34:54,879 --> 00:35:03,839
and may it be for our own happiness and safety and peace and freedom

137
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:14,640
that we offer weightless care and love for this world that we share

138
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:31,838
may all beings be happy

139
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:41,838
so hello everyone again and

140
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:52,799
here we are on august 1st of 2021

141
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,000
and today was a day that we had the plans here at imc

142
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,560
to open up our doors so people can come together in this event this sunday morning talk

143
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:10,240
was meant to be the first public talk at our center

144
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:16,800
since um mid-march 2020

145
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:24,640
and uh it seemed like over the last few weeks that

146
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:31,440
the course of the pandemic was taking such a direction that it wasn't wise to open up

147
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:39,760
or it didn't contribute to for our community in important ways

148
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,920
where we want to try to be careful not to be

149
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:52,960
transmitters or enable the transmission of this coronavirus and that somehow

150
00:37:52,960 --> 00:38:01,200
being sheltered protected and closed this way hopefully is seen as

151
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:08,320
an act of love and care compassion for this world for ourselves and others

152
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:15,040
so um but it kind of is a poignant moment to have planned to open

153
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:21,920
and then now not opening and makes me reflect on the the impact that

154
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:27,839
this pandemic has had that uh for all these months

155
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:33,680
and i think it's important to be deeply respectful of the impact but to

156
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,960
appreciate understand the

157
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:44,839
the impact that it has on each of us as individuals as a community as a global

158
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:50,720
community that and it's not uncommon for people to

159
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:56,000
feel that that the ongoingness of this

160
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,359
pandemic has worn them down to some degree and there's a kind of tiredness

161
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:08,240
source kind of wariness from the lack of contact with a lot of

162
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:17,440
people [Music] the isolation some people feel the feeling of of um

163
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:24,640
you know the the feeling of compassion the feeling of distress

164
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:30,960
around what's happening in our society in our world as a whole and i think of these months that we've

165
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,519
been in the pandemic as kind of a

166
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:43,359
you know i think some of us to have experience to be aware of a greater

167
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:51,440
range of suffering greater range of challenge locally and internationally then maybe

168
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:59,440
many people experience over a lifetime maybe not since world war ii maybe or that

169
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:04,720
there's been something like this some people have evoked the aids pandemic

170
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:11,119
as being another time where it's been global impact and

171
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:17,119
um but i think that one of the things about this pandemic is how that's remarkable is how much we it's

172
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:24,640
shared by everyone on the globe uh i think there's very few people who

173
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:32,400
are not somehow impacted by it and maybe there's a few you know this uh i had some little bit

174
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,680
of indirect contact with a south pacific island

175
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:43,680
and where it doesn't seem to have reached the shores so they're free of it but they've closed

176
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:52,319
themselves off to the wider world and and so that has an impact as well

177
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:55,119
so um

178
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:04,400
and i can imagine that from a lot of people it felt like finally it's over but then it's not over and

179
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:10,000
and so one of the important things is to care for ourselves

180
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,319
not to allow the weight of this

181
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:23,440
current events to weigh us down to to stress us to uh to the

182
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:29,280
for the wariness of it all to kind of begin wearing us down

183
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:35,838
and so how do we do that how do we how do we

184
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:43,440
not allow the accumula this experience of this ongoing pandemic to accumulate its impact on us

185
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:49,520
and that's a little bit the topic of today or very much the topic and uh

186
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:56,480
and uh and for me the reference point for this is meditation the way that meditation can help and

187
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:02,160
other people some people have other means that are similar to meditation to do the same thing

188
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:10,240
and that is a means by which we can start fresh every day it means by which

189
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:15,520
the accumulation of stress the accumulation of weariness or resistance or

190
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:22,720
or sadness or distress that might be felt that

191
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:30,960
it doesn't accumulate it doesn't build but in but rather than that's the opposite that we're able to put it down

192
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:37,440
and for some period of time to really put it down and and to

193
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:44,240
live free of it without it even if it's just for a few minutes to have the experience so that we can

194
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:49,920
start fresh we can be re refreshed renewed um

195
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:56,160
and so then uh we've interrupted the the building the accumulation of the

196
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:02,720
tremendous weight and the ongoingness of the experience and

197
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:09,040
it's very easy for many of us to be caught up in the in the world when

198
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:15,040
the agitation or the churning of the mind and thoughts and live in them as if

199
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:20,480
that's completely natural and normal and what else is there to do and and

200
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,760
you know and so we're it's kind of like a labyrinth we can't get out of because the thoughts are just kind of thinking

201
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:32,480
themselves and and maybe sometimes the thoughts are thinking about how to

202
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:40,160
be free of the very thing we're thinking about and it's kind of like stuck kind of and um

203
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:46,880
but meditation to really be able to get still focused concentrated in meditation to

204
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:52,960
have mindfulness be a stepping away from preoccupation and thoughts involvement with thoughts are

205
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:58,720
gonna getting a little distance from them and freedom from them and maybe allowing the thinking to quiet

206
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:05,440
and still or it's to shift the center of where we live in our being

207
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:12,160
from being centered on thoughts to being centered in the breathing or in the body

208
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:18,319
and and to feel that shift and and so that we're not feeding our

209
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:25,040
thoughts we're not living in the thoughts we're not swirling around in those thoughts

210
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:31,599
and the analogy for this is

211
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:39,359
whipping up a cream or using an egg beater to whip to to beat

212
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:46,960
up uh egg whites that if you um take either one but you keep

213
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:52,560
stirring and churning and beating and bringing air into the egg whites or air into the

214
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:59,359
cream slowly over time the the cream the egg whites become stiff

215
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:06,319
and and they get stiffer and stiffer until they get so stiff you can take the beater or the fork whatever

216
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:11,839
you're doing and lift it up and you make little these little peaks because it's firm enough that it stays

217
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:19,599
upright and so the same way with our minds if we're constantly using

218
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:25,680
the egg beater an egg beater of the mind or a fork in the mind kind of constantly

219
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:32,079
stirring and stirring and stirring that the mind starts becoming stiff

220
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:40,000
it starts becoming heavy and and feels substantial and feels sticky

221
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,520
and stiffer and stiffer and so there's not much flexibility and fluidity with our experience because of the

222
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:50,640
stiffness of the mind and now with the stiffer the mind becomes the more we're

223
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:58,960
globbed on or coagulated around thoughts ideas concerns coagulated stiff around our suffering

224
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:05,200
the more circumstances impact us or the or we're more fragile in a sense

225
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:13,359
we can the stiffness is vulnerable to being broken or being bumped up against or that

226
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:19,839
doesn't happen if the liquid is really so soft and smooth and you put your finger through the cream

227
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:27,200
and it just kind of like you know just it's smooth there's no resistance to the finger going through the cream

228
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:34,240
and um the um before it's been whipped up in a sense or the egg whites

229
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:42,160
so um so this idea of of letting the mind become soft uh fluid

230
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:47,280
not stiff not coagulated is that's where the accumulation is the

231
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:53,680
accumulation of tension accumulation of of impact of chronic thinking

232
00:46:53,680 --> 00:47:01,680
chronic uh you know and sometimes uh people suffering gets exasperated

233
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:07,359
by this whipping around of the eggbeater in the mind of our fears our plans our resistance

234
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:14,880
our resentments our all these kinds of things our desires our frustrations

235
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:21,599
and so to learn a way to put that down to to stop

236
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:28,559
the egg beating to stop the churning and allow the the thinking mind to get

237
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:33,760
quiet so that for a brief moment maybe or for a short period of time

238
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:42,800
we're not riding on the wave of chronic thinking we're not being pushed by the tides of

239
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:49,040
of of thoughts that are coming and coming and coming and it's kind of like we're able to

240
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:54,319
settle or stand on dry ground and we're no longer the the

241
00:47:54,319 --> 00:48:03,599
momentum of thoughts are not we're not caught in it or spinning in it or swirling in these thoughts

242
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:12,880
and this allows us to feel deeply refreshed allows us to feel at ease at peace

243
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:18,800
and it's a wonderful piece and refreshment that's very hard to understand if we're

244
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:26,960
churning in our thoughts the thoughts they want something and to not want can seem like a betrayal

245
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:33,520
to not uh wanting it seems like we have to be forward-looking reaching

246
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:40,559
in or pulling back and protecting ourselves or doing something in order to find ourselves to be safe to

247
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:46,839
get what we want and the idea of doing nothing of just letting go fully and being

248
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:54,800
peaceful from the logic of our thinking mind this doesn't work the the somehow the

249
00:48:54,800 --> 00:49:01,280
the unconscious logic of thinking is that you can't really afford to stop thinking

250
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:08,079
thinking is what where the solution is going to be thinking is where the where it's all constructed and made

251
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:16,240
and where it exists and thinking has so much weight and substance and authority

252
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:21,520
that we can't we have to stay there and the authority insists like you have to stay here be in your

253
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:27,200
thoughts and figure this out but if we can put it all down and step

254
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:34,960
away from it and discover that the place where there is no weight where there is no authority like that

255
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:40,160
and uh and feel like that's a center then something can relax

256
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:48,240
there there can be discover some capacity for peace and ease letting go and that refreshment then

257
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:55,760
it's kind of like um then we're fresh then we start up and we're not abandoning the world but then when we return to the

258
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:02,000
world after our meditation then we're there in a fresh way in a clear way in a

259
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:08,160
hopefully renewed way and then it's easier to engage in the world around us with our

260
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:14,480
family friends work the world whatever it's easier to read the news

261
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:19,599
and and not be overwhelmed or not have it kind of like be one more

262
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:25,359
thing that gets folded into the churning of the mind the way the egg beating of

263
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:31,280
the mind that we do and that it just becomes something we take in more deeply something news

264
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:38,640
and take in the suffering around us so in a beneficial way it impacts our heart but if the mind is

265
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:43,760
spinning and churning taking in the suffering of the world is probably

266
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:49,680
counterproductive not useful i think that the pandemic i think has

267
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:57,839
been an opportune time to be a witness deep witness heart witness

268
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:04,880
to this the human condition on this planet we're learning so much about injustice

269
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:10,160
so much about the suffering and and so much about um

270
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:17,200
um you know about death and sickness and

271
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:23,760
it's huge what's happened to our planet with it pandemic how do we become a better person because

272
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:30,480
of it how do we not get weighed down by it how does it awaken compassion love

273
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:36,960
good qualities in us so those qualities can meet the world i think it's very hard to do

274
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:43,520
that if we're stuck or in this churning we're staring up the mind beating up the mind

275
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:50,079
whipping up the mind over and over again like you would uh egg white sir

276
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:57,119
we have to stop the churning we have to stop the incessant uh spinning and agitation of

277
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:04,640
the mind or at least slow it down dramatically enough so that there's time for us to be

278
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:09,920
refreshed time to come open the eyes again and the eyes are not

279
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:15,839
so clouded by all these thoughts ideas judgments and fears

280
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:22,480
and in a sense this capacity of meditation to put ourselves you know to get renewed or refreshed is

281
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:29,280
also get renewed from ourselves where we're we're not being disloyal to

282
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:35,359
ourselves that we're not continuing to think about our suffering our problems our concerns

283
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:40,480
um it's actually if we some of them some of our preoccupations are all about

284
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:47,040
me myself and mine and and to be able to really put aside

285
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:52,160
even if we are suffering there's a lot of suffering that we're experiencing many of us

286
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:58,640
and uh and not to diminish that and not to deny that it's there but if what we're doing is using the egg

287
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:04,400
beater of the mind just to just spin spin spin the thoughts and ideas

288
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:10,720
then um the um

289
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:18,000
it's not really um useful for us we're just adding suffering upon suffering

290
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:26,640
it is okay to stop the egg beating it's okay to stop thinking about oneself for a while

291
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:33,119
and get kind of renewed and refreshed and and then we can come back

292
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:40,160
now in buddhism one of the egg beaters one of the that that is one of the core things that

293
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:46,640
buddhist practice is trying to free ourselves from is the egg beater which is the

294
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:51,839
this the um see as things get stiffer in the mind

295
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:56,960
the stiff some of these stiff things in the mind become the egg beater

296
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:06,880
and one of the stiff things in the mind that becomes the egg beater is our idea of self our ideas of self

297
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:14,480
so we have you know it's pretty natural for human beings to have a sense of eminence i am

298
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:19,839
uh there's a centeredness here in in our being

299
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:26,400
that's normal natural but that centeredness and being centered here and feeling a little bit like through

300
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:32,480
our body this substantial nature of our being the vitality of life that's flowing here

301
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:40,160
in this body that's fine but then we start

302
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:47,920
having thoughts ideas judgments uh projections um

303
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:54,960
biases that we add and build and we add to that and that's this so egg beater of self

304
00:54:54,960 --> 00:55:00,319
we're adding to that building on it the baggage of i have to be this way i have to be

305
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:06,880
that way being a person like this means that i have to be treated this way or shouldn't be treated that way or i

306
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:12,000
should be treat myself this way or i need to have that happen or this has to happen

307
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:18,240
just more and more ideas about self and these layers and layers some of them

308
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:25,040
are fine ideas in and of themselves but it isn't the ideas that are the problem

309
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:30,240
but rather how the egg beater of self is churning and spinning and making the

310
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:35,599
more and more solidified sense of self idea of self holding the

311
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:42,880
self contracted and one of the great blessings and benefits of meditation practice

312
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:49,760
is that to stop the egg beating of self st you know retire the constant

313
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:56,799
preoccupation and spinning around me myself and mine and even let that become quiet

314
00:55:56,799 --> 00:56:03,280
and it's not a disloyalty to self but it's a recovery from the stress of this egg beater

315
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:10,880
that's going and it's a remarkable thing to discover that there's a vitality a clarity an

316
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:18,160
openness that's possible for us and they're an engagement even in life that's possible

317
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:23,760
without that stiffness of me myself and mine the stiffness

318
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:29,440
of uh that that help starts making a substantial self or a

319
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:36,559
a weighty self a weighty self

320
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:42,400
whatever the self is if you want to have a self or self ideas or identities that

321
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:48,559
we have they belong in and of themselves to the weightless world

322
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:55,040
of the mind as soon as we there's a way to them then we've

323
00:56:55,040 --> 00:57:02,240
contracted we've gotten tight heavy if we if they get if we get heavy and

324
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:08,798
substantial there's been the eggbeater of the mind has been stirring things up

325
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:17,119
meditation going for a walk in nature reading a nice book taking a nap

326
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:23,599
um you know there's all kinds there's different ways that different people have but to do it something in some in a

327
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:31,680
thorough and deep way that sometimes something unlike meditation can do where we completely put down the egg

328
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:37,280
beating the egg beater of self

329
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:44,799
churning that goes on and to discover a peacefulness a quiet a radiance an

330
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:50,559
openness where there's no reference being made

331
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:57,599
to me myself and i where there's no reference to anything

332
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:03,920
that has any weight the reference is if anything is through

333
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:09,839
something that feels open weightless light

334
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:15,920
free relaxed where we learn to recognize that the egg

335
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:21,359
beater the spinning the churning that goes on incessantly the in the mind

336
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:24,400
has quieted down

337
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:35,520
and it's so important to give ourselves some time to do that because then we

338
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:43,839
think more wisely then we're ready to see more clearly then then there's space in

339
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:51,920
room for the heart for our capacity for goodwill and kindness care

340
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:56,640
compassion warm-heartedness

341
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:05,119
so you might if this talk is you know as is something you can relate

342
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:10,319
to you might start paying attention

343
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:18,559
to when you're spinning your thoughts spinning in the world of the mind beat is egg beating

344
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:24,240
and whipping up your thoughts in ways that things become mentally heavy and

345
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:30,160
substantial and thick and stiff even and to notice

346
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:37,119
how it might eclipse the warm heartedness of the heart how it might eclipse the

347
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:42,880
kindness the generosity the natural goodness

348
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:50,720
of the heart of our being that in and of itself also has no weight

349
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:56,880
in and of itself has no substantiality unless we pick it up that way with

350
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:02,799
clinging and pressure and wanting it pick it up with self the goodness of our

351
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:09,839
heart that has not been churned or by the egg beating of self where the goodness

352
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:16,160
just allowed to be there simply relaxedly openly

353
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:22,799
here and so look and start noticing the distinction

354
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:29,599
between when you're churning and when the churning has stopped when you're spinning and thought and

355
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:35,200
when you really let the thing that stepped away from that world of thought and are at

356
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:41,599
more peace than it is here it's a very important distinction and

357
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:47,760
the more you can see that distinction the more access you'll have to a degree of

358
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:54,880
freedom where not only maybe you don't need to recover so much or renew as much

359
01:00:54,880 --> 01:01:00,400
but you actually stay renewed or you stay relaxed and open because you're not

360
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:08,799
continually accumu not continually accumulating more and more of this tension that comes from

361
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:13,359
whipping up the egg whites in the mind

362
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:21,520
so um i hope you have a chance to each day to do something that really

363
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:29,680
renews or refreshes the mind i think it's as important as brushing your teeth and

364
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:34,960
so please and i think you'll probably find that

365
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:42,480
you'll live a much more effective life so that way so thank you

366
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:49,520
very much and and i do i am looking forward to being with all

367
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:55,200
all of you certainly all of you but too many of you when we do open our doors here and we

368
01:01:55,200 --> 01:02:01,280
can meet in person and that day will come and until then i offer you my

369
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:08,640

good care of yourself and good care of the world thank you
