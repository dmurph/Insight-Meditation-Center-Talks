of compassion which is putting ourselves in someone else's shoes

00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:42,360
presence this ineffable and yet

41
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,360
profound

42
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,080
quality of our own presence

43
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,120
arriving arriving each moment

44
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:17,960
arriving arriving and landing in this body this moment in time

45
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:24,880
feeling feeling embodied as the basis of our practice

46
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,560
and it's not a heady topic this embodiment it's really

47
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,960
earthy how is how is the body feeling can we infuse

48
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,080
our feet with our awareness as our feet are touching the

49
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:49,759
earth can we infuse our feet with knowing that they are being

50
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:57,759
sensed can we infuse our hands with

51
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:07,160
awareness allowing sensations to rush in to be known to be

52
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,120
gently intimately known

53
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:33,319
infusing your sitbones with awareness

54
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:44,879
infusing our sitbones how we're sitting connected to the

55
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:52,759
earth allowing sensations of contact touch hardness

56
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:58,520
softness to be known simply to be known

57
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:13,159
being grounded Earth

58
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:37,719
allowing allowing the breath to move through the body infusing the body

59
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:47,880
can we feel the sensations of breath in breath out breath in the

60
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:55,120
abdomen our hands and our feet our shoulders in our

61
00:08:55,959 --> 00:09:02,440
chest can we allow the body to relax and really

62
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:09,000
release when we are tight in our body we tend to get tight in our thoughts in our

63
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:17,480
mind so relaxing the body supports relaxing of the mind mind

64
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:24,480
heart so soften drop what is not needed just check in what's not needed

65
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:31,680
right now can I release it and simply humbly humbly be with the

66
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:37,639

now I would love to invite you if you would to drop in a

68
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,639
reflection again not into our head but in our heart heart

69
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:42,320
space and inviting inviting a good friend a benefactor

70
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,600
perhaps someone you've been inviting the past couple of days or someone

71
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:57,320
new someone who's easy to invite into your heart

72
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:03,279
space and sit and sit with their goodness with their kindness with their

73
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:10,639
compassion with their wisdom their

74
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,959
loyalty generosity generosity of heart whatever

75
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:22,959
aspect and whatever person comes to your heart this aspect of their being doesn't

76
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:29,399
have to be every aspect of their being but this one particular aspect

77
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,440
sitting with them in your heart

78
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,920
space feeling their presence

79
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,160
receiving their presence in your heart space as if you're sitting with them

80
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:24,079
having tea receiving your heart's face their

81
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,279
presence their unique

82
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:46,240
presence rhyming the heart rhyming the

83
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:54,079
heart and now as if you were swapping place with

84
00:14:54,079 --> 00:15:00,240
places with them as if you were them it's so random

85
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,399
who we get to be who we get to be born as but as if you were

86
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:11,959
them embodying their presence their sense of kindness

87
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:18,279
wisdom whatever it is embodying them embodying their

88
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:25,560
heart their mind shining your awareness out of

89
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:33,120
their eyes out of their being in

90
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:41,360
this exploration don't make it too heavy see what it feels like even a second of

91
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,120
it can be opening

92
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:07,680
what might it feel like to be them with sense of kindness generosity

93
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,480
patience [Music] perhaps

94
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:19,199
friendliness don't think about it let it be embodied feel into it don't think

95
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,600
into it

96
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:25,720
feel into how this shifting of places might soften your heart expand

97
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:30,520
possibilities of ways of being

98
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:08,919
again not a heady thinking practice just feeling

99
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:14,240
into another being's presence as if you were them breathing in their kindness

100
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,360
breathing out their kindness

101
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,159
breathing in their brightness breathing out of their

102
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,760
brightness just to get some

103
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:46,440
flexibility space in our heart in our way of being

104
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:14,080
and now coming back swapping places again coming back to your own

105
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:22,039
presence your own your own felt sense of the body breathing in breathing out your

106
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:30,399
own brightness kindness from your heart center goodwill

107
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:43,600
friendliness embodying this world this life as you tend to do this body as you

108
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,880
do this being who is

109
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:02,400
me appreciating your own being this being who is me

110
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:10,559
this body this life this heart my challenges the way I'm

111
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:17,279
stretched my aspirations feeling into

112
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:25,799
them in breath out breath with kindness gentleness

113
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:16,640
there be appreciation goodwill for the way that I am a friend to myself and

114
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,640
others

115
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:27,600
allowing your heart to rest in the goodness that there is goodness not a

116
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:36,520
time to be critical release that if it's coming up resting resting the

117
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:41,720
goodness and there is always goodness

118
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:33,840
the last part of this practice period another invitation if you

119
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:40,880
wish I can support expanding our heart a bit more

120
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:47,080
if you would invite yourself to swap

121
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:53,159
places with someone that you've had a bit of a challenge not number

122
00:24:53,159 --> 00:25:00,919
10 scale of 10 1 to 10 but maybe four or five

123
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,120
so when you've had a bit of irritation challenge swap

124
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:16,159
places seeing the world through their eyes their circumstances their

125
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:24,520
difficulties how they see the world expanding your

126
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:30,320
heart again if it feels too challenging or too much of a stretch and you get

127
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:36,320
triggered come back come back to yourself to your body or your benefactor

128
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:44,840
dear friend but if it is possible imagine inhabiting the

129
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:52,880
world as them the challenges they have the the limitations the

130
00:25:53,720 --> 00:26:01,880
conditions the way they think and see the world all the experiences genetic

131
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,760
educational familial

132
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:15,360
upbringing and how perhaps you cocreated the challenge the

133
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,360
difficulty

134
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:32,039
together putting oneself in the place of others the foundation of ethical empathy

135
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:43,520
stepping outside of ourself out of our self being the the

136
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:50,960
self being the center of the world and for just a minute just a

137
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,600
minute not forever just for a minute entering somebody else's world

138
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:01,679
reality to expand our heart expand our

139
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:07,880
capacity doesn't mean we're going to condone the wrongdoing at all not about

140
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:15,440
condoning not at all or condoning the harm at all

141
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,879
but just to gain

142
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:38,480
perspective or the freedom of our own heart to gain perspective

143
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:26,000
and now letting that go coming back to your own heart body

144
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:34,320
perspective wishing yourself well appreciating yourself for having done this practice and if available wishing

145
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:39,600
this other person well with whom you've had a bit of a an

146
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,760
entanglement and of course wishing your friend benefactor whom you brought in earlier

147
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:52,039
well with gratitude may my practice be a cause and

148
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:58,799
condition for freedom for well-being for awakening of myself and

149
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,519
all beings everywhere

150
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:11,120
may all beings be happy may all beings know their own

151
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:18,320
goodness including myself may I know my own goodness may I flourish in my own

152
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:26,639
goodness and kindness may I be able to expand my

153
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:36,080
heart for the benefit of all beings may all beings be well may all

154

with our theme of [Music] uh of uh SA

164
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:50,720
community so Oh yes and two bells both the church bell as well as my verbal

165
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:57,480
bell because I don't have my handy uh Tibetan bell with me yeah

166
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:05,640
so so we're continuing with the theme of um sana community kalyan namita

167
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:11,360
um beautiful friendships as part of the path as as

168
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:17,919
the entirety of the path not just a luxury but uh 100% of the path as the

169
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:23,398
Buddha said not 50% as ananded thought

170
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:31,799
So yesterday we talked about friends of the heart

171
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:38,880
suadia the helper the enduring companion in the times of happiness and

172
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:47,960
sorrow the good counsel and the compassionate friend the four different types of friend we also talked about the

173
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:56,720
upakaraka mita upakaraka mita and I was the sadayita the opakarakamita

174
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:03,039
um who's the uh friend assistant companion who points

175
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:08,240
out your faults with kindness celebrates your progress and reminds you of of the

176
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:15,919
dharma in challenging times so today I want to switch to the

177
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:23,519
topic of putting oneself in the place of another and that was an invitation that I I brought in to their guided

178
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,799
meditation to explore that to to try that on for

179
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:35,360
size and um different themes different points I

180
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:42,640
want to cover today one is um that empathy empathy is the foundation of

181
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:51,559
ethical restraint and the Buddha teaches in the Vama Suta in Samutan Nikica

182
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:57,799
557 where the Buddha is teaching lay people about the foundation of mor moral

183
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:03,559
conduct in terms of mutual experience and this is what the Buddha

184
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:09,520
says what is displeasing and disagreeable to me is likewise

185
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:16,079
displeasing and disagreeable to others knowing this one should not inflict it

186
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:23,878
upon another so in this teaching the Buddha is teaching the principle of moral

187
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:31,760
reciprocity it's the natural ethics based on uh not commandments thou shalt

188
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:38,200
not but it's the felt understanding it's a felt embodied

189
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:43,520
understanding that and and it also predates its parallel which is the

190
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:49,280
golden rule do unto others as you wish them to do unto you it's a little more

191
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:56,320
poetic than that but essentially that's the golden rule so it's not theoretical empathy but

192
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:04,960
it's really embodied momentto- moment felt sense ethics if it's displeasing to

193
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,240
you if it's uh disagreeable it's likewise difficult

194
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:18,880
disagreeable to others of course it is and simil in the similar vein the

195
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:26,680
Buddha teaches in itaka 27 that all tremble at

196
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:33,760
violence all fear death comparing oneself with others one should not harm

197
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:40,720
or cause to harm the same way the sense of trembling of the heart that wow this

198
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:49,359
is painful all of us all of us have don't desire or or that we we don't

199
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:56,680
want to be harmed so again this is the ethical the the felt sense basis of of

200
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:02,000
ethics and and there is of course research and modern research that

201
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,320
suggests that um there are uh that that we feel we literally can feel another

202
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:15,440
person's pain if we allow ourselves that are um that there are areas of the brain

203
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:22,880
again not to limit our the found the the wholeness of our experience just to the

204
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:31,359
uh firing of some neurons i'm not trying to do that not being reductionistic and yet both there there

205
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:37,520
is research supporting that different areas of of our brain which which um

206
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:45,040
activate when we are in pain when we witness another people's another person's pain when we allow ourselves to

207
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:50,880
witness some somebody else's pain those areas specifically the anterior insulin

208
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:56,480
and the anterior singulate cortex they do activate during these empathetic

209
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:02,400
experiences and feeling the pain of others as if if it were as if it were

210
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:08,599
our own so so it's that this Buddha's call to

211
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:14,599
ethical empathy is um is supported is is

212
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:19,839
is because we are able to if we allow ourselves to feel somebody else's pain

213
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:25,599
and not cause harm another aspect of the teaching here

214
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:32,960
is um recognizing that selflove is a gateway to universal love loving others

215
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:40,119
and sharing our love so self love is so important it's not luxury it's not

216
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:45,160
selfish it's a foundation of universal

217
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:50,920
love and in Angutra Nikaya 557 in the Sacha

218
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:59,839
Suta the Buddha uh instructs that just as one is dear to oneself so to all all

219
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:06,800
beings are dear to themselves so he says "I am dear to myself and so are others

220
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:13,560
dear to themselves therefore one who loves themsself should not harm

221
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:18,680
another." That's powerful right i am dear to

222
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:25,240
myself and so are others dear to themselves therefore one who loves

223
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:33,359
oneself should not harm another so love yourself love yourself deeply love

224
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:40,240
yourself appreciate yourself be kind to yourself and similarly be kind to others as the

225
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:46,240
kindness to ourselves as the foundation of kindness to others so this sentence

226
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:51,440
this statement this teaching is so profound so profound i want to underline

227
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:59,160
it some more it bridges self- concern and universal ethics showing that

228
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:07,680
nonharming naturally arises from self understanding and self-care

229
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:16,640
self-love and the commentary the commentarial literature also emphasizes

230
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:24,079
that reflection softens the view of beings as other this othering that we do

231
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:29,280
that it softens that and this particular teaching this way of being cultivating

232
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:35,960
this way of being loving ourselves therefore loving others not harming

233
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:41,000
others it reduces what's called

234
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:49,359
selfcenteredness a conceit mana so it reduces

235
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:55,640
self-centeredness and mana conceit instead of increasing

236
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:01,200
it and of course as many of you know and have been practicing meta especially

237
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:07,280
during happy hour this is a foundation it's the foundation of of loving

238
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:13,000
kindness practice meta practice that recognizing that all beings want

239
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:19,920
happiness just as I do just as I want to be happy and not suffer everybody else

240
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:28,480
also doesn't want to suffer and doesn't want to be um just wants to be happy and does not

241
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:36,480
want to suffer so another another teaching I

242
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,839
want to bring in is that there's also this teaching on

243
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:49,920
pre-action reflection pre-action reflection to prevent harm

244
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:56,359
and in Angutra Nikaya 853 in the

245
00:40:56,359 --> 00:41:01,520
Udai the Buddha teaches reflecting thus

246
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:08,560
would this be agreeable or disagreeable if done to me one should abstain from

247
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:13,839
doing it if it would be disagreeable isn't that great so this is

248
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:21,119
just taking it one notch higher this is a really practical invitation so the Buddha again says

249
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:28,240
reflecting thus would this be agreeable or disagreeable if done to me one should

250
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:36,160
abstain from doing it if it would be disagreeable so the Buddha is teaching uh that before

251
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:42,560
reproving or any action towards others one should internally check the ethical

252
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:48,240
response of the action or the ethical resonance of the action is really

253
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:55,680
feeling into like is this agreeable disagreeable would this be hurtful unheardful should I do should I it's

254
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:01,440
just this moment pause that the Buddha is teaching in the sutas how beautiful

255
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,800
is that so internally checking the eth

256
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:13,880
ethical resonance of the action before taking the action and this is an

257
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:21,000
application of yono wise attention yo

258
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:28,000
manasara wise attention and if shifts the mind from reaction from reactivity

259
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,280
to reflection so the purpose of this is not

260
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:40,720
pacivity of course but it's compassionate clarity is so that we act

261
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:46,400
so that we act with discernment and empathy rather than ego and projection

262
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:55,440
and reactivity and and the practice of sati mindfulness

263
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:04,480
essentially which is the bread and butter what we practice essentially leads to to being able to to t being

264
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:11,760
able to take that reflexive pause before action to take that pause like is this

265
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:17,000
is this a wise is this unwise is this going to cause

266
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:24,880
harm and um this is what the Buddha advises so I want to end with three

267
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:31,000
reflective questions for today so here's the First reflective

268
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:39,079
question how often do I actively imagine another's perspective before acting or

269
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:47,000
reacting how often do I actively imagine another's perspective before acting or

270
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:55,520
reacting here's the second reflective question what would it look like to integrate this reflection more fully in

271
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:02,240
small daily moments what do it would be like and here's the last and third

272
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:08,880
reflection can I recognize that others fear grieve and long for safety just as

273
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:15,000
I do just as I do just like me just like me just like

274
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:21,440
others just like me so today we've explored putting

275
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:29,280
ourselves in the shoes of another which is again this basis of ethical

276
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:36,000
uh restraint ethical uh empathy ethical care not in a heady

277
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:42,560
way but in a practical in a practical way woo how would it feel to me if somebody just opened their mouth and

278
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:51,319
said something like this or did something like this do I want to do this taking that mindful pause with yoni sa

279
00:44:51,319 --> 00:44:58,640
nasikara and again selflove being the the corner store of care and love and

280
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:05,560
ethical treatment for others and look at that we have bells today right in time

281
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:12,880
so so thank you all for your practice thank you for your care for

282
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:22,119
your goodness may your goodness May your kindness may your ethical care

283
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:29,400
ring in all [Music] directions thanks

284
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:34,349
everyone see you tomorrow [Music]
