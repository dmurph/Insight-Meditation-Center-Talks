1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:09,240
in the Buddhist teachings there's a phrase that has

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,879
caught my attention over the years

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,220
it's practicing in accordance with the Dharma practicing in accordance with the Dharma

4
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:30,060
it's used quite a bit by the Buddha in the teachings actually it's not just a kind of a one-time thing

5
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:38,460
that he says in one little place he uses it fairly frequently and something that he brings out in his talks

6
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,559
one way that the Buddha talked about it is that practicing in

7
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:49,800
accordance with the Dharma is one of the key factors that supports us to wake up

8
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:56,340
so it's a kind of a key one and a bit more poetically the Buddha

9
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,920
said that people who practice in accordance with the Dharma

10
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,080
beautify the Sangha how about that they beautify the Sangha

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:13,900
so today I wanted to explore this a bit this phrase the poly for it is

12
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:19,860
[Music] practicing in accordance with the Dharma

13
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:28,320
so I think there are several different dimensions to what this can mean and some of that variation has to do

14
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,479
with the range of meaning of the word Dharma itself which is a vast term that

15
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:39,180
can cover a lot of territory the word itself covers different domains

16
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:45,720
and in addition they're said to be about a half dozen qualities of the Dharma

17
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,920
which is not the focus but they'll sort of come in as we're talking about it

18
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:59,040
so the Dharma can be the teachings of the Buddha you know

19
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,700
this is a Dharma talk and we're we're focusing on the Buddha's teachings

20
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:13,800
and so here maybe being in accordance could mean something like following the instructions

21
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,319
so we're not just getting information in a Dharma talk from a teacher that

22
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:26,099
might be part of it there are explanations there are descriptions but there are also instructions among

23
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:33,660
other things things that we can do or perspectives that we can take that will help us move

24
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,879
toward freedom from suffering

25
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,879
you know you may have gotten instructions at some point on mindfulness of breathing or on

26
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,040
mindfulness of emotions or mind States

27
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:56,160
I know mindfulness of aversion for example so maybe you were told to feel

28
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,860
the aversion in the body or to name it you know name recognize

29
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:09,840
that aversion has come into the mind and name it in order to create a little gap before we you know we just act on the

30
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,560
aversion so these are examples of you know instructions that we get for how to how

31
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,940
to live with our body and mind and World in a way that's relatively free

32
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:31,080
you know and if we're doing those instructions when a strong emotion like aversion comes up then we could say that

33
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:37,640
we're practicing in accordance with the Dharma within what the Buddha taught

34
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:46,879
I wanted to offer this story that's found in Gill's book a monastery Within

35
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:52,379
identical twin sisters found their way to the monastery

36
00:03:52,379 --> 00:04:00,060
at first it was very difficult to distinguish one from the other and the monks and nuns often confused them not

37
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:07,860
only did they look the same but they also had the same mannerisms identical ways of talking and as nuns they wore

38
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:15,299
the same robes in addition they both had extremely aversive personalities they were astute

39
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:22,620
observers who seemed always to see what was wrong after some months Market differences

40
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:30,600
began to appear between them they remained as aversive as ever however one sister became more and more

41
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:36,000
dour and discouraged the other became increasingly happy

42
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,400
soon enough the first sister left the monastic life though this did nothing to

43
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:48,540
improve her dark state the second sister went on to become the guest master in many of the monastery

44
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:56,340
guests remarked how her happiness was contagious the first sister directed her aversion

45
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:01,979
outwardly when she suffered all she could see was what was wrong with the world

46
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:07,560
the second sister looked inward when she suffered she focused on being averse to

47
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:14,040
her aversion and toward whatever clinging created it the first sister was crushed by her

48
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:19,100
version the second was liberated by hers

49
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:26,220
so we get these instructions and it's consequential whether we follow them or not

50
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,680
so it's interesting to observe in ourselves

51
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,960
you know whether that we maybe don't always follow the instructions do we

52
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:44,100
I mean sometimes we just forget of course or you know it happens too quickly and we didn't have a chance but

53
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:49,800
there are other things you know we can start to see with the mindfulness practice that things get in the way of

54
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,560
our actually doing these instructions it's normal that there's some challenge

55
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:01,380
for us because not all of us is on board with this process of waking up right our

56
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:06,900
doubt is not on board our ignorance is not on board so when we run into those

57
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:12,900
things they can sometimes get in the way maybe there's fear maybe there's ego I

58
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:18,120
want to do it my way why should I listen to the teacher

59
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,759
the mind is very tricky you know what it's putting up doubt or resistance we literally might not hear the

60
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,840
instructions accurately

61
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:34,020
some people worry a lot about whether they're doing it right in practice so I

62
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:41,400
want to address that directly I want to name that at least is that this phrase in accordance with the Dharma I hope

63
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:48,479
that the word accordance maybe feels a little bit more accommodating than the idea of doing it

64
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,880
right there's a little aversion in whether I'm doing it right or not

65
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:59,639
so maybe we could ask something like are we in harmony with what the Buddha

66
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:04,919
offered so if you're someone who is frequently concerned about whether or not you're

67
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:11,520
doing it right maybe you could ask instead am I in harmony with what I understand of the

68
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:18,780
teachings I might soften it a little bit so thinking about these two sisters you

69
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:24,000
know who were both aversive but one learned how to work within that and find

70
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,419
Freedom and the other did not maybe one Criterion for knowing if our

71
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:36,780
practice is in accordance is our unwholesome states decreasing and

72
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:43,860
wholesome States increasing or the reverse you know are we are we actually becoming

73
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:50,460
happier or Freer in some way and we don't have to check moment to moment to moment because there are times where we

74
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:55,860
have a period of some dukkha or some dryness in the practice but in a

75
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:02,220
long-term sequence are we generally decreasing our unwholesome states and

76
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:08,699
increasing the wholesome ones and remember that mindfulness is wholesome so that helps

77
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:15,120
but of course there's there's more to the teachings of the Buddha than just meditation instructions

78
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,220
so we should look beyond that also more broadly

79
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:25,740
being in accordance with the teachings maybe would be being on the path are we

80
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,919
doing the steps of the Eightfold Path in our life

81
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,060
so if we're for example if we're only doing meditation that's our thing we

82
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:41,700
meditate but we're not paying any attention to ethics or wisdom in our

83
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:48,959
life it might be hard to get fully in tune that would be like tuning one string of

84
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:55,260
our guitar to a tuning fork we've got that one string in tune but we didn't check any of the other strings you know

85
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,600
how is that going to be when we tried to play the guitar

86
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,680
so when we're bringing all the qualities of the path into a

87
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,720
chord together then we could say that the path is unfolding you know sometimes we're

88
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:19,500
working more on one than another and there can be periods of focus but

89
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:26,459
generally we would want to be working on all of the aspects of our life broadly together so that they can all harmonize

90
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:32,940
and unfold together one of the qualities of the Dharma I

91
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:40,620
said I would sometimes bring in the classical qualities of the Dharma of one of them is that it is onward leading

92
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:47,160
open naiko so it means that we don't get stuck forever we can't be stuck forever if

93
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:53,580
we're in accord with the Dharma maybe I should name the steps of the path just in case someone is not

94
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:59,160
familiar um their I use this word right but it's not

95
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:06,060
really right It's let's say appropriate or complete or wise so

96
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:12,800
appropriate view appropriate intention appropriate speech appropriate action

97
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,060
appropriate livelihood and appropriate effort appropriate mindfulness and

98
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:24,180
appropriate concentration so all of those factors you can see that

99
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:31,980
they Encompass our view of the world how we see things how we see ourselves how we act speech action livelihood and also

100
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,680
how we train our mind through making some effort through mindfulness through

101
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,000
collectiveness of mind

102
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,500
so there's another teaching where the Buddha talks about how a person understands the path

103
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:56,339
when they are practicing in accordance with the Dharma how do they frame it in their mind if they're practicing in

104
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:02,100
accordance and in general what this teaching says is that people like that understand two

105
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:08,339
things overall first of all they understand that thoughts of greed hatred and delusion

106
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:15,899
those are the main problems in the mind so thoughts of greed hatred and delusion are ended by practicing well that's how

107
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:22,700
they're ended they're ended by doing practice and not because of things like material gains or other material

108
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:30,300
circumstances so the result is this is that they're they're very careful about not extolling themselves and disparaging

109
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:37,200
others you know let's say you practice for a while and I don't know you become a teacher you become a

110
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:44,339
mindfulness teacher then but you don't you don't say oh this is this makes me so great you know

111
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:51,779
instead there's an understanding no what what is helping my mind to purify or improve or get more in alignment is

112
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:57,360
because I'm practicing and so one focuses on just continuing the

113
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,760
practice and then second which is kind of a more specialized part of the first is that

114
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:09,720
when even when a person experiences water considered attainments or important things on the path like

115
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:16,740
I don't know cultivating deep concentration or going on a long retreat or having an Insight of some kind even

116
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:22,380
then they understand that identifying with those things is not part of the path

117
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:27,420
so once again it's always just continuing to focus on the practice is

118
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:32,459
the sign of being in accordance with the Dharma so this is how we think about our

119
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:38,959
path think about our practice if we're practicing in accordance with the Dharma

120
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:45,800
we're not measuring our success or comparing ourselves with others

121
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,959
so another meaning of Dharma it's related to the teachings of the Buddha but another meaning of Dharma is

122
00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:00,240
simply nature or how things work you know how do things work so as we

123
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:08,040
practice with our own particular experience who else's experience are going to practice with so we sit down we

124
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:13,200
feel our body and its various aches and pains and challenges we have our mind

125
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,240
and we have our memories that come up and the emotions and what it is that

126
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:25,680
we're trying to figure out in our life right now all of those things are part of our what

127
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,079
we can be mindful of in our experience that's what we do and yet as we watch

128
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:36,180
just these specific things about us we start to see patterns and we start to

129
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:42,420
eventually see into more Universal characteristics as we would say so we

130
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:51,060
watch our own mind but we're learning about how the mind works for everyone you know everyone has dukkha and

131
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:57,540
everyone has clinging unless we're totally free so we start to see these more foundational or fundamental things

132
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:03,240
that are going on and in our particular experience are just examples of those

133
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,279
so we come to have our own experience with foundational Dharma principles like

134
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:14,639
the four noble truths or like dependent co-arising things occur because of conditions we start to

135
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:20,279
actually see that in our experience or just generally you know how it is for

136
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:25,380
humans and a big aspect of that is seeing

137
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:31,380
impermanence for example that's one thing that we often emphasize here is noticing that things change and they

138
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:39,500
come and they go arise and pass it's very hard to find something that's been constant for our whole life

139
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:46,800
so there's a famous phrase that people say when they have deep insight into impermanence

140
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:53,160
all that is of the nature to arise is of the nature to pass away

141
00:14:53,160 --> 00:15:00,480
this is kind of an Insight that we can have and I name it because in that phrase nature all that's of a nature to

142
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:09,560
arise the word is Dharma everything that is is of the Dharma to arise is of the Dharma to pass away

143
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,839
that's how it is so then we start to get into you know

144
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:21,300
when we start to see how these teachings of the Buddha are actually applying in

145
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:27,240
our own experience they're true for us we start to have maybe what a kind of a

146
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:33,779
felt sense of the Dharma a felt sense of accordance

147
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:38,880
does this make sense like kind of a feeling of alignment or Attunement in

148
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:46,740
the body this relates to some of the other qualities of the Dharma it's said to be visible here and now sanditiko so

149
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:54,779
the Dharma is something that we can see right here you know I I walked into the room and I was in a lousy mood and I

150
00:15:54,779 --> 00:16:01,500
noticed the tear in the carpet there isn't a tear in the carpet here but you know suppose and then we see in our mind

151
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:07,760
oh when I'm in a bad mood I tend to see what's wrong with the police we see it operating right there in our mind

152
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:12,959
whereas you know if I'd been feeling happy about the spring flowers I just

153
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:18,660
saw maybe what I notice is the happy faces of the people coming in so we

154
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:26,459
start to see how the conditions are flowing along they're changing they're impacting my experience

155
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:32,880
the Dharma is also said to be timeless akalico or immediate another translation

156
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:39,600
in the way that natural laws you know always work they're kind of there all the time in

157
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:46,800
the background so we start to see that aspect of the Dharma the word Accord is related to words like

158
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:53,880
Concord or Discord it's something like being in tune musically consonant we could also say

159
00:16:53,880 --> 00:17:00,720
not dissonant so there's a way that this is really true viscerally sometimes we touch into

160
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,959
it first in meditation you know we're sitting and yeah there's challenging things happening in the mind but we

161
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:13,438
start to kind of Orient ourselves toward oh could I could I align with this somehow could my body be physically

162
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:19,740
aligned could my mind be aligned so we start to feel into the Dharma and

163
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:25,760
that takes us deeper than just knowing it cognitively or thinking about it

164
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:32,760
if we really understand that things are impermanent we'll have a different relationship to things in our life

165
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:38,940
doesn't make so much sense to cling when we see how all of experience is changing

166
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:45,720
so to be in accordance with the Dharma when we see into these foundational principles helps us get lighter and

167
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:51,120
lighter in our life nonetheless it's still possible to be a

168
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:58,020
little bit off so I want to name ways that we can also you know feel a bit if we're getting out

169
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:04,020
of accordance number one is that we can get conceptual you know

170
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:09,059
we think about whether or not there's a rule or a principle something I heard in

171
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:15,539
a talk that I should be applying right now and often it's skillful to start with that you know for example we learn

172
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:21,840
the five precepts as the kind of ethical basis for Life as a layperson and so we

173
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:27,960
might think about those and consider whether or not we're applying that principle correctly

174
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:34,679
but eventually connecting with the Dharma is not meant to be so conceptual it's not meant to be

175
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:41,580
something that we think about quite so consciously just as an example

176
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:48,720
if we are applying the precepts really as rules that we may have learned and are trying

177
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,760
to apply we will eventually start to run into a lot of uncertainty we can start

178
00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:00,539
to run into uncertainty you know for example we might know that one of the precepts says that we should not lie we

179
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:05,940
should not yeah we should not say what knowingly what we know is to be false

180
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:12,059
clear enough it's a rule so then what about a trivial lie in order to make someone feel happy or

181
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:19,320
comfortable if we have a rule of always stating the exact factual truth but we also have a

182
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:24,480
value of caring for our friends what about that moment that classic

183
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,780
moment when they say do you like my sweater and you don't

184
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:35,580
you know you know it can be a real moment of uncertainty for if we have a

185
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:40,620
rule system in conflict with our care for this

186
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:46,679
person so practice in accordance cannot only mean following conceptual principles

187
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:51,840
it's more flexible than that it's not so rigid if you're wondering what the answer is

188
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:57,059
there isn't there isn't one clear answer for how to move through that moment

189
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:03,900
but if we are attuned in accordance with the Dharma we can find something to say

190
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:10,919
somehow that navigates that another way that we can get a little bit

191
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:17,640
off is actually um you know the felt sins which I pointed

192
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:23,340
to Second it's closer you know it's more flexible but even the felt sense can be

193
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:30,299
a little bit off and what that can happen when we get focused on one particular feeling

194
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:37,440
so again an example suppose we have an experience where we're feeling tightness

195
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,840
in our chest you know you've gotten attuned to the body you're going You're Going Through the world with mindfulness

196
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:48,120
and you feel that you've gotten a little bit tight in the heart area and as

197
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:53,640
you're mindful of that the tightness melts away and you feel your heart open

198
00:20:53,640 --> 00:21:00,360
it's a beautiful experience when something like like that happens you know we we come into Attunement and

199
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:07,080
somehow we open but then the mind can fix onto that and say oh that exact

200
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:13,500
feeling is what it means to be in accordance with the Dharma that's the feeling of it it's when my heart melts

201
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:20,220
and feels open so then after that we go through the world we are continually monitoring the feeling in our chest for

202
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:27,960
tightness and if there's any tightness we try to make it relax right this so I'm Hamming it up a little

203
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:33,960
bit but I've done patterns like this you know where I had a certain experience and I then I felt like oh that's it

204
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:39,960
that's it now I've got it and so then there can be a subtle trying to make

205
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:45,780
that happen again or believing that that's what the Dharma feels like

206
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:52,799
so it kind of makes sense but Freedom or Dharma is not any one

207
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:59,580
particular feeling it's not any one particular kind of felt sense it's not always the same way and we don't want to

208
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:04,799
get into manufacturing feelings so we have to be a little bit careful

209
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:11,220
so we can get off by bringing in too many theories and too many ideas or by getting attached to a certain kind of

210
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:16,320
feeling or a certain kind of emotion so maybe a good image then you know how

211
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,919
do we we're painting a bigger picture now how do we consider this idea then of accordance

212
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:29,520
with the Dharma maybe a good image is to see in terms of a process of Attunement kind of a

213
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:37,080
dynamic balance like the way riding a bicycle is a dynamic balance if you're riding a

214
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:43,860
bike you're almost always falling over in some Direction but you're always pulling

215
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:50,640
yourself back toward being in alignment always moving toward balance so you know

216
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:57,659
we have a gradual practice we're finding our way toward more and more accordance with the Dharma but we don't always get

217
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:03,659
it right we definitely don't always get it right and even if we do get it right for a little while then the conditions change

218
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:10,559
and things are off balance slightly and so maybe we think more about moving toward balance instead of getting to

219
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:16,980
balance and staying there there's very little where we're just you know set it and forget it in the

220
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:22,460
Dharma so

221
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:30,299
I feel like as we discover what practicing in accordance with the Dharma means and what it means for us it will

222
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:35,640
take us toward the maturing of both our thought and our emotion so when our

223
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:42,240
thought maybe originally was very conceptual and a little bit rigid we sort of move toward being more flexible

224
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:48,960
in how we think and having more intuition you know the sort of the mature form of the cognitive mind

225
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:56,460
and similarly our emotional heart I don't know that they're so separate but let's pretend for a moment you know

226
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:01,980
maybe we start out with a lot of reactivity and difficult experiences and

227
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:07,620
then over time that Smooths out a little bit and we move toward qualities like

228
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:13,320
Compassion or Goodwill or you know things that ways of understanding relationship that are part of some

229
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:21,120
larger whole kind of a maturing of the emotional side also we might still be aversive like that one

230
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:27,000
of the sisters you know have a a critical mind that can see the challenges with things but you know we

231
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,419
move toward using that will and we have more and more happiness like she did or we might always have kind of a sensual

232
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:38,760
orientation you know maybe you're uh that that type but that can move into

233
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:44,480
meta for example you know love instead of Love of sensual things we move toward

234
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,740
Universal love that connects beings together

235
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:56,700
it looks different for different people so this maturing process

236
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:02,760
can take some turns also often when we often we can reach a new level of

237
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:08,580
accordance when we give up or Surrender have any of you seen this in your

238
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:13,860
practice um things can't change and they they're

239
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:21,200
sort of stuck or dry and we we're putting in effort and we have to we do have to put in effort in order to engage

240
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:29,220
but at some point what's most fruitful is to give up to let go sometimes sometimes it's about

241
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:35,460
us doing something in order to practice if we don't do anything I would guess that

242
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:40,919
we will continue to keep suffering if you just sit on your couch waiting to

243
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:47,340
awaken probably will end up just continuing to suffer but there are also times when

244
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:53,400
we're getting in our own way in a sense or our our view our way of seeing things

245
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:58,440
is itself limiting and they're asked to we sort of grapple with that and at some

246
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,600
point it's the stepping back that helps for the Dharma to lead us onward

247
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:09,539
so then a question for us is can we you know can we learn to trust in the

248
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:15,779
unfolding of Our Own specific experience you know can we learn to trust the the

249
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:24,179
flow of the Dharma and it might not look how we think this accordance I want to tell a story now of a it's a

250
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:32,700
it's a true story of an Irish Trappist Monk so a Catholic monk who his story of in

251
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:40,140
his experience was Zen meditation so he was early in his monk life he was

252
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:46,140
given a book about Zen and he wasn't very interested in it somebody gave it

253
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:53,039
to him and said you might find this interesting and he thought I don't think so and the person further qualified the

254
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:58,919
book by saying this is a Spanish translation of a German trans of an

255
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:04,320
English translation of the German original and it's a bad translation

256
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:12,179
so he really wasn't very excited about reading this book but he did agree to read it and he did and he got two things

257
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:18,059
from this book one was he got instructions in for how to sit on a

258
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:23,820
cushion and you know which he had never done right and he decided to try it because

259
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:31,320
he was often falling asleep in the when he was sitting in the Pew in the church or wherever he was sitting in the church

260
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:38,100
he was often falling asleep so he got got a pile of blankets he didn't have a meditation cushion so he got a big pile

261
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:45,360
of blankets and he sat on it and he figured if I'm sitting in a position like this with my legs crossed I'm not going to fall asleep as easily

262
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:51,240
and then the second thing he got out of the book was it had a koan in it he

263
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:57,539
didn't know the word koan he didn't really know what that meant but it had this question and the question was what

264
00:27:57,539 --> 00:28:03,600
was your face before you were born which is a classic koan from the Zen tradition

265
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:09,059
and so he had no idea what a koan was or how to work with it he didn't have any

266
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:15,900
instructions for sitting meditation he didn't have a teacher but for some reason in his heart he was drawn to

267
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:21,600
engaging with this practice and so he just did his best to follow the instructions

268
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:28,919
so his fellow Catholic monastics were teasing him gently about whether he was really Catholic or was he Buddhist they

269
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:34,860
also asked him to sit somewhere else because it was a distracting for them when he sat on his pile of blankets in

270
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:40,380
the church so he found a little room to sit by himself and he contemplated this

271
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:45,419
koan about his face before he was born and

272
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:52,020
after a long time of doing that making adjustments along the way that felt

273
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:57,659
intuitively right you know he really did his best and he tried he did make some

274
00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:03,799
changes but eventually he decided that he hadn't seen anything and there was really nothing coming from this practice

275
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:09,600
and so he was a little bit sorry that he hadn't ever really found a teacher to learn more about it

276
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:15,539
and he decided to give up so he stood up and in his words

277
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:20,059
that's when I saw my face before I was born

278
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:27,600
later he met some Zen teachers and he actually eventually became a roshi an authorized

279
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:34,140
and teacher in addition to still remaining a Trappist Monk and he said that all of this drew that Drew him much

280
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:39,899
closer to the deepest teachings of Jesus he really understood how those Point toward emptiness that was his

281
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:45,600
understanding so this too I would say is practice in

282
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:51,299
accordance with the Dharma um really bringing himself to it really

283
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:58,260
living the sincerity of his engagement with this and maybe maybe you'll agree with me

284
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:05,600
that there's some beauty to this Monk's path and how he just kept engaging

285
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:14,700
so how about us so engaging when we engage with Dharma practice which all of us are in some way even if this is the

286
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:20,659
very first time you came here or the very first time you're tuning in on YouTube

287
00:30:20,659 --> 00:30:26,039
you're here so in some way you're engaging with the Dharma right now

288
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:31,799
and so we we often will find that we'll run into unfamiliar terms like

289
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:38,039
practicing in accordance with the Dharma as I said this has caught my attention over the years I didn't know at all what

290
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:44,760
it meant when I first read it the very first time and I found it to be fruitful to engage over over the years and

291
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:51,480
consider in my own practice you know what is this how does it unfold what does it mean for me now

292
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:57,960
how do we explore and familiarize ourselves with terms like this

293
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:04,860
if it feels important or relevant or interesting I encourage you to engage with terms even if they seem like

294
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:10,140
they're like you're not sure what they mean so one you know we've been doing a

295
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:15,179
little bit of that during this talk I've been kind of exploring different dimensions

296
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:23,100
trying to create a larger picture you're welcome to take the ones that make sense to you and leave the ones that don't

297
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:29,460
so we can also step back a little bit and kind of consider that process itself you know what is it that we're doing

298
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:36,539
so we might engage with a Dharma term by posing a question that monk had a koan as a question some

299
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:42,720
Buddhist Traditions have made this into an art form we don't do that so explicitly but even less formally

300
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:48,000
questions are a very good way to engage with the Dharma so we can pose the

301
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,019
question what does it mean to practice in accordance with the Dharma

302
00:31:54,299 --> 00:32:02,100
but the question might be then to whom or to what are we posing that question are we posing it to our intellect

303
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:10,440
our linguistic mind I decided to pose this question to uh

304
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:16,380
chat GPT so I thought it was interesting I

305
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:22,080
thought I would read you the answer so I typed in what does practice in

306
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:27,419
accordance with the dhamma mean I think I'll read it in the voice that

307
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:33,539
kind of goes with it the term dhamma typically refers to the

308
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:40,320
teachings of the Buddha which emphasized the development of ethical Behavior mindfulness and wisdom therefore

309
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:47,279
practice in accordance with Adama means to practice in accordance with the ethical principles mindfulness and

310
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:53,100
wisdom taught by the Buddha in Practical terms this means striving to cultivate

311
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:58,559
wholesome thoughts speech and actions while avoiding unwholesome ones it also

312
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:05,720
means developing mindfulness or a clear and non-judgmental awareness of one's thoughts feelings and surroundings

313
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:11,399
lastly it means cultivating wisdom or an understanding of the nature of reality

314
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:16,460
and the causes of suffering as taught in the Buddhist tradition overall

315
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:21,659
practicing in accordance with the dhamma means making a conscious effort to live

316
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:29,039
in a way that aligns with the teachings of the Buddha with the goal of reducing suffering and cultivating inner peace

317
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:34,399
and happiness q-e-d

318
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:42,059
so in terms of basic information content I have to admit that this might be a lot of what I've said during this talk I

319
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:47,640
don't know do you guys need Dharma teachers anymore um I would probably change a little bit of

320
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:53,039
the language I saw a few holes in in the doctrine there but you know it's good

321
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:59,820
information actually it's pretty good information but do you think it gets you all the way

322
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:06,360
there no what about that Trappist Monk who

323
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:14,220
didn't have any of this information he had no books he had no teacher

324
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:21,898
he had no chat GPT but he did sit on a pile of blankets and sincerely

325
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:27,139
apply his mind until his heart opened

326
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:33,898
so in exploring a Dharma term we are not just posing a question to our language

327
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:39,898
oriented mind you know the answer to our question is not a bunch of information it's not

328
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:47,398
about the language we're posing the question to our cheetah to our heart mind or even more broadly

329
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:54,179
to our whole body heart mind system that means that we can use the whole

330
00:34:54,179 --> 00:35:00,020
body hard mind system to resonate with that question

331
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:06,060
a friend of mine I think said it nicely she said accordance is multi-dimensional

332
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:12,359
mind heart and body are all used to connect to wisdom and knowing In This

333
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:17,400
Moment knowing right now such that practice is in accord

334
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:23,579
another of the qualities of the Dharma is that it is inviting us to come and

335
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:29,820
see in particular note that the body is

336
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:34,859
involved you know we can we can consider the Dharma or drop in a

337
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:42,240
question and then feel the energetic ripples in our body that's it no need to cognize what's going on create a story

338
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:48,960
figure it out so to do this kind of full engagement

339
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:55,020
with the Dharma term or question is kind of kind of like living it

340
00:35:55,020 --> 00:36:00,599
to live the question I'm borrowing that phrase there's another phrase that we could ask you know what is live the

341
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:06,540
question it's from uh actually comes from the Western tradition it's from a

342
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:12,420
work called letters to a young Poet by Reiner Maria rilka this is a fairly oft

343
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:18,839
quoted segment have patience with everything that

344
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:26,940
remains unsolved in your heart try to love the questions themselves like locked rooms and like books written

345
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:31,980
in a foreign language do not now look for the answers they

346
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:39,359
cannot now be given to you because you could not live them it is a it is a question of experiencing

347
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:46,560
everything at present you need to live the question and perhaps you will gradually without

348
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:52,380
even noticing it find yourself experiencing the answer

349
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:58,500
so to live the question of what it means to practice in accordance with the Dharma

350
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:03,839
is to take that question into daily life into relationship into work into

351
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:11,599
community life into deep into your heart while sitting on the cushion all of those

352
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:18,119
it takes some trust and confidence to listen carefully to that question

353
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:24,480
that you've posed with your whole mind body heart and then actually go into it

354
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,579
to actually go with it to actually change things in your life in order to

355
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:35,160
live by that question this is your life

356
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:40,460
it matters it matters what you do

357
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:47,640
so maybe you have some sense now of what it means to say that somebody

358
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:53,839
who is practicing in accordance with the Dharma beautifies the Sangha

359
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:59,820
the Buddha loved to see people engaging with the teachings and really seeing how

360
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:06,000
they play out in their own life and he created an environment where

361
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,099
people could do that they could give themselves fully to the

362
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:16,980
teachings so I've been here with the IMC Community

363
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:23,339
for a long time and I can say that it's quite a good place for practicing in accordance with

364
00:38:23,339 --> 00:38:30,540
the Dharma it's a place where people can try out different ways of being

365
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:37,020
where they can feel some Harmony and yet

366
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:42,480
enough security to be daring with how they

367
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:51,060
are and their support all along the path for engaging with our ethics our

368
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:57,420
mental training our wisdom all of that is here and I think we see that beauty among us

369
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:03,599
today and we can even extend it out into the folks on YouTube who are joining us

370
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:09,200
can see how far across the world the beauty is spreading

371
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:15,599
so thank you all for your beauty and your engagement with the Dharma

372
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:23,700
it'd be yeah so I'm there's a few more minutes we can

373
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:29,599
if anybody would like to ask questions or comments

374
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:39,000
yes here why don't you wait for the microphone thank you

375
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,579
this is I was just wondering what that song is

376
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:51,060
the Sangha what is it wow there's a whole other explanation that we could do yeah I did use that term without

377
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:56,339
defining it thank you probably other people want to know too so Sangha is the

378
00:39:56,339 --> 00:40:03,000
poly word for the community generally it refers to the community in

379
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:10,380
the west we use it as the community of practitioners so like this is the IMC Sangha and the IMC Community more

380
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:17,520
traditionally it refers either to the monastic Sangha of people who were ordained or actually the most generally

381
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:22,680
it refers to people who have some understanding of the Buddhist teachings

382
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:28,740
so people who have reached some deep insight into it and can serve as guides

383
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:34,200
for others um and maybe one more Dimension I'll mention is that the Sangha is one of the

384
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:39,900
refuges for us so Buddha Dharma and Sangha are the places where we can

385
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:47,460
Orient toward in order to support our practice as we're going along the path but does that help yeah

386
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,900
thank you for asking the question

387
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,020
here's another one

388
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:10,980
do you could you share the name of the Trappist monk did he write anything

389
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:16,920
oh it's a good question I didn't have um I didn't write his name down I found a

390
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:22,380
video where he spoke about this in a Buddhist Christian Conference like a

391
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:28,020
um and I didn't catch his name so I'm sorry for that but it was a recent video

392
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:34,200
and he was right there speaking it so I'm sure he is alive well I'm not sure but as of when he made

393
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,560
the video

394
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:02,180
anything else one more yeah

395
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:17,520
you talked about the twin nuns and how they were both aversive and then one was

396
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:25,619
no longer as aversive or actually followed the Dharma how do you handle or

397
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:32,460
approach friendships and relationships in your life with people who are aversive

398
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:39,660
or become more aversive over time how do you work with that that's a good question so is it is such a person a

399
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:44,700
practitioner or not most likely not most likely not yeah we

400
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:52,260
can't always know for sure huh so then um what we're working with is how it

401
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:59,040
feels for us in relationship with that person and it can be

402
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:04,440
that we need to be in relationship with this person we don't have a choice is that the case I have the feeling you're

403
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:14,280
referring to a specific example but we don't need more details but is that true okay yeah yeah so then we do still have

404
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:22,140
some choice right we have our own sense of what's coming up in Us in response to

405
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:27,540
observing or experiencing that aversion of course if there's any danger you know

406
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:32,579
the aversion is directed toward you in a harmful way then you know there would

407
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:38,760
need to be some caretaking for yourself I just want to state that right up front but if it's a

408
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:44,940
little bit more of an observational thing um then there are things that we can

409
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:52,440
cultivate to protect ourselves essentially so certainly mindfulness you know being aware okay I'm observing that

410
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:58,020
we are allowed to observe things externally externally internally and both

411
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:03,720
but in yourself probably the first cultivation is equanimity accepting

412
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:09,260
the reality okay this is what's going on for that person I don't know

413
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:15,319
what's happening inside of them but accepting it and then there can be also

414
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:20,819
some Connection in that people who are behaving aversively and not apparently

415
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:26,040
aware of it are probably suffering so an appropriate response for you might

416
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:31,319
also be compassion for them and for you for the experience

417
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:38,359
that you're having so there are ways that we can begin to change ourselves in relationship to this energy

418
00:44:38,359 --> 00:44:44,940
such that it is less harmful it's not coming into us and getting stuck you may

419
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:50,579
need techniques also to allow energy to move through or you may need to you know

420
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:56,640
physically moved to a different place when things are happening you know you can leave the

421
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:03,359
room or or even giving a wide range set a boundary things like that

422
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:09,119
but generally we have more options than we think we do is this helping

423
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:14,280
yes thank you okay yeah and of course if you need to if you

424
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:20,339
want to speak sometime with a teacher about more specifics of that there might be also things that I could say more

425
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:25,819
specifically than in a general setting yeah

426
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:38,040
oh looks like we're at the time so thank you everyone it's been a delight

427
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,280
foreign
