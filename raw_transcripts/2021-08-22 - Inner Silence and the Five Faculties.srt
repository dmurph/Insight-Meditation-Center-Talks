1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:10,320
i'll continue with what uh i'll give the talk i was thinking about giving and that's been on my mind for a

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,599
few days and the topic is the five faculties

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,920
but as but for introducing the five faculties i want to read a

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,080
story from my little book the monastery within

5
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,480
it says the title is noise and silence

6
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,680
the monastery work leader always appeared peaceful

7
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:48,640
this was not so unusual among the monks and nuns of the monastery he was unique however

8
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,719
in that he remained peaceful and calm even when the monastery was at its busiest

9
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,120
for example when large crowds of people visited to celebrate the buddha's birthday

10
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:07,520
if a person was needed to visit the hustle and bustle of the local market town

11
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,760
this was the monk the monastery usually sent when asked how he managed to remain

12
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:20,000
peaceful he said i entered the monastery for peace and quiet

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,680
i spent years in the harried world of commerce and people

14
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,920
i longed for the silence of the monastery it was rumored to have

15
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:40,560
i was delighted with my first weeks in the monastery the silence was exquisite

16
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:47,840
however as i settled into the silence of the place i was shocked to learn

17
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,680
how noisy my own mind was the real noise was within

18
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:01,439
it was the busyness of my own mind that oppressed me not the noise and activity of the world

19
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:09,840
now it doesn't matter where i go i carry the silence with me

20
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:16,720
so the part of the noise of the mind

21
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,760
is all the thinking that goes on the swirl of thoughts and images that

22
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:29,360
goes on in the mind and when those are strong and we are somehow obsessed with it or swept away

23
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,120
in those thoughts and concerns it's almost like losing our life

24
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,239
and when we stop being obsessed and swept along by the current of thinking

25
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,519
it's kind of like getting the life back and for some people meditation is maybe

26
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:52,400
one of the primary places where they get their life back because in meditation the mind quiets

27
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,840
and there we're not so we learn to let go of our preoccupation with thoughts

28
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,599
are being pulled away in them and the mind begins starts to become quieter

29
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:09,599
and stiller and it doesn't necessarily mean that thoughts have to go away

30
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:15,840
but that but that

31
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,360
it feels like there's silence it feels like there is a

32
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:30,080
piece a piece there as well so the day of silence in meditation

33
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,239
the idea of is the reference point for how i want to

34
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,159
teach today about the five faculties

35
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:48,480
and um so um the background for this talk

36
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,760
is the idea that when the buddha before the buddha was awakened

37
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,799
he went and studied with two spiritual teachers of his time and they

38
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,159
were kind of meditation teachers or they they had their access to the

39
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:12,000
truth that they were teaching their teeth there was through meditation but first he learned

40
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:19,600
um the teachings of these teachers and he learned them well and he became

41
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,639
together with others who had learned those teachings he kind of mastered the teachings

42
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,680
and and he assumed and this is an amazing story

43
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:36,160
he assumed that he now knew and saw what was true

44
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,080
but he actually he didn't he just learned the teachings but sometimes teachings can be so

45
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,919
compelling and so uh kind of enlightening the teachings that people sometimes confuse

46
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:55,440
a cognitive understanding of this life with this deeper deeper life that this has to do with a kind of

47
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:02,000
a more silent knowing a silent uh seeing of what's happening here

48
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,320
so then uh he went to those teachers and he said you know is how do i have access to

49
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:15,120
really know and see oh really to know and see what uh what you're teaching

50
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,240
and so they explained to him they taught him the kind of meditation practice they were teaching

51
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,800
both of them were kind of meditation practices where you really kind of disappear from this world a

52
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:34,160
world of senses and experience and one of them is it a meditation state of nothingness where you dip into a place

53
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:41,039
of tremendous oh nothing nothing is there just absence and the second one talked a little bit

54
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,800
further along that that even the perception of absence kind of disappears

55
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,560
and there's a bit is so rarified so simple so a lack of input on the mind

56
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,880
the mind is very very still and peaceful but the buddha thought this is not

57
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,639
uh this is not freedom and then he had a realization or had a

58
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,400
self-reflection that he had five qualities

59
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:16,800
that he could rely on to find his way he had faith

60
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,840
usually called faith he had confidence he had courage

61
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:29,120
he had the capacity to bring attention to his experience and he had ability to be

62
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:36,160
centered in his experience and he had the ability to be discerning to see clearly what's going on here and

63
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:42,560
differentiate between what's happening and these are my translation for today for the five faculties usually

64
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:49,199
translated as faith energy mindfulness concentration and wisdom

65
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:57,120
and now faith because sometimes it assumes to be kind of a faith in something

66
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,759
like in teachings in a teacher or something um this is not what the buddha had faith

67
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,039
in at this point but rather he had confidence in his himself

68
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:15,039
and so he was able then to go to meditate and call on this confidence

69
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:20,720
and he didn't know what the truth was he didn't know what liberation was yet he just knew that

70
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,240
that's what he was going uh pursuing and so the not knowing where this is

71
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,080
going not having a teacher to to accompany him on the path or point

72
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:38,720
him out the pitfalls of the path and keep him on track he was on his own

73
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,240
so it took courage not just energy but real courage

74
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:50,560
and then certainly took mindfulness but probably it took you know a real sense of presence with

75
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,879
all the attentional faculties that he had to engage attentively with what's

76
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,080
happening and then the concentration part was to be centered to be one

77
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,520
pointed or one centered really here centered

78
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,520
and then to be discerning now each of these five

79
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:20,000
could be seen in what i why i started with this this little teaching about silence one reference point for understanding

80
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,120
how to evoke these and support have they support meditation practice

81
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,479
is to evoke them in such a way that they help the mind become silent

82
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:36,000
to quiet the mind so this confidence is not

83
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,360
to stare us uh stir us up or faith is not to stir us up with beliefs ideas and thoughts about what we

84
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,480
have confidence and faith in but rather a kind of embodied confidence

85
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:55,360
which allows the anxious mind the planning mind the the confused mind

86
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,880
and the obsessed mind to quiet down almost as if the thinking is not really

87
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,080
needed much what's needed is is the mind to become

88
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:12,480
still and silent silent from his chatter silence from its inner noise that spins

89
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,920
around so to call on a

90
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,120
confidence to sit here and become still

91
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,480
quiet and to have the courage to do so

92
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:35,360
the pull and the authority of our concerns the things we're anxious about the things that we're resentful

93
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:43,200
for the things that we want the thoughts about me myself and mine

94
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:49,680
these have a lot of authority and people are often quite ready to defend them how important they are and

95
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,959
and how can i be safe how can i find my way in my life unless i engage in these

96
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:02,640
kinds of authoritative kind of thoughts which just if we engage with them are just more noise

97
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,079
and so to have the courage for in at least in meditation

98
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:13,279
to not pursue a career not pursue and fix a

99
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:19,120
relationship not to be worried about the future not to be caught up in what's happened

100
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:25,279
in the past all those things are appropriate at times there's a time and season for all

101
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:32,480
those kinds of thinking about the future the past our desires the problems we have in our life

102
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,600
but it takes a kind of courage to not succumb to them to not get sucked

103
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,279
into them but to have the courage to really sit okay now is a time

104
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:50,959
to be here silent and still and then uh attention

105
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:57,519
to do so with attention attentiveness an attentiveness that kind of partakes

106
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:03,360
to the silence so it's not attentiveness that uh is thinking about what's

107
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,640
happening some people confuse mindfulness with with thoughtfulness

108
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:16,560
and there's a kind of thinking of what's happening in the present moment but an attempt to a silent attentiveness

109
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:22,000
to enter into that the silence that is not the lack of sounds

110
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,200
but rather its a ability to be more attuned more sensitive to take in

111
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:35,200
all the data that's happening and then

112
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,640
and then the the support that's being

113
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:46,320
centered in our experience gives to being silent the ability to

114
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,440
uh to be within our middle of our experience

115
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:58,399
and find a place of center it could be the object of concentration it could be

116
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:05,360
the belly as it moves the sensations of the breathing someplace in the body tip of the nose but it isn't so much

117
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,600
that we're focusing like from the control tower onto this singular

118
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,680
place of attention it's kind of more likely of course we're composing ourselves on it

119
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,200
a composure a centeredness some people like the word become

120
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:30,240
grounded in this and so like all and that from this composure grounded centeredness

121
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,800
is an embodied experience where all of us is here present

122
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:43,200
and then this discernment and wisdom faculty in the service of silence

123
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:50,000
in the service of differentiating and seeing oh now i'm getting obsessed with thoughts

124
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,560
now i'm involved with the noise and contributing to the agitation of the mind what is it if i

125
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:02,240
turn my attention and keep it in the realm of what's quieting and

126
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,760
stilling and the silence what a part of the function of wisdom is

127
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:14,079
to see and discern and work with the other four faculties

128
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:20,000
so one way understanding these five faculties is that they are not separate from each

129
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,399
other it isn't like five separate capacities but rather there's a way in which when

130
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,880
the um when what we're doing is uh attentive

131
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:39,600
a silent attentiveness they actually are five facets of the

132
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:46,399
same jewel the jewel of stillness the jewel of silence the jewel of kind of peace

133
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:54,959
and so it's possible in meditation to go through uh kind of like a checklist

134
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:02,079
and check in with oneself where is my confidence

135
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:07,839
and to you know evoke it if necessary but don't

136
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:14,880
evoke it with thoughts and ideas but where is there an embodied feeling of

137
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,720
confidence that allows something to be still and quiet

138
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,839
and you know embodied feelings are not thoughts

139
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,360
and so they don't partake of the world of chatter of noise

140
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,959
but to feel the silent quality of embodiment an embodied sense of

141
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:42,240
confidence maybe a strength that's there

142
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,279
and then uh the embodied quality of courage

143
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,399
so not talking yourself into being courageous

144
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,760
being strong in your dedication but but a courage

145
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:04,079
to allow yourself to be still allow yourself to be silent

146
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:11,040
and this is probably takes a lot of courage because sometimes the forces of

147
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,880
concerns that we have are important sometimes they're

148
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:23,519
they have tremendous power and strength themselves so much so that if we try to sit still

149
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:30,560
and sit quiet we might get very restless anxious angry all kinds of things can happen

150
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,839
that because we're up meeting and confronting these deep kind of operating

151
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:42,639
systems or conditioning that that sometimes have been formed over a difficult lifetime

152
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,680
but what is the courage that allows us to sit still and quiet

153
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:54,240
and i love the fact that courage comes from the french word heart curl and that it not only is it courage but

154
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,279
maybe courage comes with or with compassion with heartfeltness

155
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:05,680
with care and then attentiveness what's the attention

156
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:11,120
that is left or that which has a chance to shine when

157
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,399
um we're still in quiet if we're not distracted by thoughts

158
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:23,199
if we're not busy talking to ourselves how would attention appears

159
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:29,759
it's kind of like if the curtains have been pulled we don't see outside and then if we pulled the curtains what

160
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,839
do we see outside how's the weather changed and what do we notice

161
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:40,880
so uh this silent attentiveness

162
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,720
is the attention that is left when the mind is silent

163
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,399
and rather being so much something that we have to apply and do do the mindfulness

164
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:57,519
it's more of a allowing of that attentiveness the natural attention

165
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:03,839
whatever the attentiveness is for you at any given time when the mind is allowed to be quiet

166
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:10,959
enough still enough receptive enough to just for the attentiveness to surface and be there

167
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:17,360
it's very hard not to be attentive not to be aware not to know what's happening

168
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:23,600
if the mind is quiet and still and alert and that's why the courage and the

169
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:29,440
strength the confidence brings that alertness

170
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:36,480
and then the centeredness that provides stability that provides steadiness

171
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,080
and and what is the steadiness stability centeredness groundedness

172
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,280
that you can feel your way to when the mind starts becoming quiet and

173
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:53,919
still and um and then the discernment again they're

174
00:17:53,919 --> 00:18:00,480
recognizing they're keeping the attention noticing these things so going through the checklist and saying oh

175
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:07,039
here's my confidence here's my courage or my strength

176
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:12,720
here's my attention this is attentiveness here is

177
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:19,120
stability steadiness centeredness and here is the discernment the

178
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,799
understanding the seeing clearly and perhaps in going through that

179
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:31,200
rather than thinking of each of them as being separate they're each part and parcel of this quality

180
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:38,320
of attentiveness a quality of it's all kind of one big package there's one thing

181
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,440
so a jewel that has you know five sides and depending on what

182
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,440
side you're looking at you see a different quality so they're not these the qualities are

183
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:55,280
not distinct practices but they're

184
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:01,600
things that are there when we are stably attentive

185
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:08,919
here it's kind of like if you um

186
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:17,120
maybe you know uh if you've been on a train for a long long time and shaking on the train shaking on the train and

187
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:23,679
you know you have to kind of get your balance all the time and then you come out of the train and you're no longer cooped up and you're no

188
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:30,160
longer on this moving vehicle and you open up onto the you know maybe it's a

189
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:36,960
a train stop in some rural place where open skies and vast fields

190
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,080
and you come down on the and you're and you just it's so good to be now on solid

191
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:48,400
ground and and maybe that sense of stability and solidness

192
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:56,080
and space and aliveness and attentiveness is all one thing

193
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:01,200
it's being it's we're experiencing it all at once it isn't like we're uh

194
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,360
developing each one of them by itself so the buddha before he

195
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,640
when after he left his teachers he called on these five qualities that

196
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,240
he had to support him in sitting still and quiet

197
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:24,159
and and delving deeply into um his you know the realms of freedom of

198
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:30,559
letting go of being here and and seeing clearly and knowing clearly

199
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:37,039
what this lived life is and i think of the buddha's liberation as as giving him

200
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:44,080
life and and if we get caught up in too many thoughts and preoccupation we kind of

201
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:50,720
lose a life in the dhammapada it says this kind of to paraphrase it wildly

202
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:57,120
that um to spend too much time distracted and obsessing in thoughts

203
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:03,360
for it can be as if we're already dead but to really

204
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:11,440
show up and be attentive is to never die

205
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:18,320
something like that so in these last minutes of the sitting of this talk what i'd like to do

206
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:24,960
is to suggest we do a short maybe five minute meditation

207
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:31,360
and and i will name each of these five faculties

208
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:38,000
and see if you have any reference point for how each of these faculties

209
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,120
each of these sides of the jewel can support you

210
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,240
to become quiet a kind of inner silence

211
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,840
it doesn't have to be 100 quiet of thoughts but a kind of silence that allows the

212
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:59,200
thoughts to be there without you being obsessed it might not be that you have

213
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,799
direct access today but to kind of feel in and imagine and

214
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:11,360
maybe something some point in your life you something happened or some contact to these things that can be a reference

215
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:19,840
point for you about how these five faculties support you in becoming still and quiet

216
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:27,840
so if you're comfortable with with it you can close your eyes

217
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:35,200
and if you are sitting you might sit up a teeny bit a little bit straighter than you

218
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,720
are especially if you're you know

219
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:47,919
listening casually on the couch or something sit up straighter because

220
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:55,840
you want to find a way some this is an embodied practice we're doing here

221
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:03,039
where the embodiment of these qualities is what supports the silence

222
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:11,679
if we have to think about them then maybe we get more noise

223
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:28,320
and as you exhale for next three exhales allow yourself

224
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:35,919
to relax alert and relax they're going to settle

225
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,679
in quiet down

226
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,480
and then to

227
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:32,679
hear these words the the names for each of the faculties

228
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:38,799
and maybe not think about it so much but feel your way

229
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:46,240
is there some embodied quality that someplace in your body where these qualities live

230
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,919
or some way you associate with bodily feelings

231
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:59,279
that if you center yourself on them they support more silence

232
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,840
quiet

233
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:11,080
so the first is confidence

234
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:17,919
is there any confidence already in you

235
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,320
confidence in the in your capacity

236
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:33,120
for a few minutes to just sit to be still

237
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,320
to be quiet

238
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,679
the second is

239
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,080
courage

240
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:06,799
is there a courage to show up for what's here

241
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:14,880
to be present for this experience now your embodied experience

242
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,520
a courage which is calming

243
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,840
steadying

244
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:37,600
a courage that helps you become more embodied

245
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,480
here and now

246
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:56,159
and as you enter into the world of inner silence

247
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:02,880
stillness is there quality or

248
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,440
form of attentiveness

249
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,640
which is part of that silence

250
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,679
that is part of the stillness

251
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,080
that's not something you do but something you become

252
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:34,278
attuned to attuned to

253
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,360
quiet still attentiveness

254
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:01,880
and then there's a quality of being centered

255
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,120
steadiness stability

256
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:18,559
where attention is centered in the midst of your life midst of your

257
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,880
body

258
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,200
is there kind of a centering

259
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,559
that is part of the stillness part of the silence

260
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,840
that enhances the silence of now

261
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:12,960
and then your ability to notice confidence

262
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,440
courage attentiveness

263
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:28,760
centeredness that is discernment

264
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:36,240
maybe a silent recognition silent

265
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,240
attunement

266
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:55,240
and maybe these five qualities

267
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:06,320
make a part of the whole make part up of the whole experience

268
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:12,720
of sitting here with an inner silence stillness

269
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,960
and peace

270
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,960
and then to end this meditation

271
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,039
you can take a few long slow deep breaths

272
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,200
feel your body more fully

273
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,720
and when you're ready

274
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,200
you can open your eyes

275
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:53,160
[Music]

276
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:12,399
so thank you

277
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:18,320
and if you found this interesting the five

278
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:23,519
faculties it's one of the kind of foundational

279
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:30,000
teachings about these inner inner capacities we have that can

280
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,840
support meditation you might find it interesting to time to time to go through

281
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:42,960
them systematically and i've done it sometimes by on each breath i do a different one

282
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,240
first breath confidence strength or car

283
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,440
courage attentiveness centeredness and then discernment

284
00:32:53,440 --> 00:33:00,159
and just kind of go through and there's something about having a little task that is self-esteem and focusing

285
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:06,559
and instance quieting and maybe you'll come to appreciate

286
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:13,440
your capacity for inner stillness and it's a stillness you can carry with you wherever you go

287
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:20,640
it doesn't matter how noisy it is around you because you you carry the stillness inside

288
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:26,880
so thank you very much for this time and then one announcement

289
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,000
and that is that um

290
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:39,440
you know i think that probably many of us have been moved by many of the

291
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:45,679
serious difficulties existing in the world right now and i thought it'd be very nice for this

292
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:52,480
youtube community and people are watching sharing and with these teachings for so long and

293
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:59,200
joining together and practicing together and you know i often end every meditation except today

294
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:05,519
every meditation with a dedication of merit or expression about the value of

295
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:10,878
of uh allowing the momentum of the meditation to go into

296
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:18,158
living a life that benefits the world around us so one way that we can do that if you're interested in is i thought

297
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:24,960
collectively to make donations to help the people of haiti a country that has been having

298
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,800
challenges for years and years and the donations will go to partners in health

299
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:38,320
a wonderful non-profit that does health care in in haiti and they do it at grassroots level

300
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:44,960
and so they really go out there and into the towns the villages work with the grassroots medical care

301
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:51,280
teams and nurses and people to make sure that it goes to the people who need it and um it's a they have a quite an

302
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:57,520
extensive network in in haiti so it's a great organization to support and you can certainly go there directly

303
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:03,480
to do it yourself to the um i think it's um

304
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:08,560
pih.org is the website or it's also be nice if you want to do

305
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:14,240
it through imc and so what we're doing is uh friday saturday and today

306
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:20,079
is that any donation that goes to imc whether it's to me sometimes people make

307
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:25,440
teacher donation or it goes to imc general fund that

308
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,960
that can will will turn right around and donate it to partners in health and all

309
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:37,040
of it will go that way and um and the way to make that donation we don't have a special haiti button
