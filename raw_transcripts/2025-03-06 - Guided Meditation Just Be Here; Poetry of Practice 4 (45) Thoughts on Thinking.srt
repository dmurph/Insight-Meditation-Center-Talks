1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:09,839
this idea of using poetry as a support for practice just this recognition

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,400
that I think having malleability or flexibility in the way in which we

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:21,000
support practice I would say in which we approach

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,840
or engage with anything in life is tremendously helpful can even be

5
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:38,000
transformational if we're so used to thinking thinking quote unquote that we have to engage

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,520
with our experience in one particular way and that really limits

7
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,000
us limits our experiences limits

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,320
our um interpretations or ways in which we can work with whatever is arising in

9
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:01,519
our life so my hope my wish is is for this

10
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:07,680
these days working with poetry is pointing to another

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:17,240
way than perhaps our usual way of engaging with being with interacting

12
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:24,600
with our experiences and certainly our meditation experiences our spiritual

13
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,520
life be anything and maybe maybe part of the reason why I appreciate so much this uh

14
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:39,079
poetry of practice days some of you know that I was trained as a research scientist spent years working in the

15
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:45,640
laboratory test tubes white uh jacket you know the lab coat gloves you know

16
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:51,240
the whole thing and uh so I thought that life was just you know one particular

17
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:59,320
way and had it solved and became good at thinking through things and then it was

18
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,439
just with practice that I realize yes that's valuable what I had been trained

19
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:09,759
to do but it's not the only way in fact

20
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:15,080
to have this flexibility to have this malleability is

21
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,920
invaluable not only have freedom in our lives but have a rich full

22
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:29,360
life so with that as an introduction I'll do a little bit of a guided meditation this morning and to help us

23
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,840
maybe get settled and then I'll drop in a poem and then I'll talk about the poem

24
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:42,519
uh after the guided meditation so again these poems as they get dropped in you don't have to think

25
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:47,720
about them you don't have to figure them out you don't have to understand them you don't have to look them up you don't

26
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:53,400
have to Google them and get the title and all that you can do that later you can do that

27
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:00,400
later the invitation here is just to experience them and I like this word

28
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,200
Shimmer maybe is there's maybe there's a sentence a word that shimmers for

29
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:13,000
you and what is that experience like of having some

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,200
shimmering some alternatives to this word Shimmer maybe it strikes a cord in

31
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,360
the heart or mind or maybe it uh

32
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:31,000
remembers you can like remember something about it something like that

33
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:46,319
okay maybe with a big exhale setting the intention to turn

34
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,319
towards meditation

35
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:06,040
this exhale allowing some

36
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,480
tightness intention to maybe be

37
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:21,120
released ah allow a certain amount

38
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,120
of arriving

39
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:59,840
opening to the sounds that are in your environment

40
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:22,360
what would it be like if there are not distractions or problems but just part

41
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,478
of the present moment experience

42
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:40,479
feeling the feet on the

43
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:54,120
ground this can be such a support in all areas of our life daily life

44
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:01,639
meditation just feeling the feet touching the ground or whatever they're

45
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,199
touching we are here just

46
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:28,639
here feeling the pressure against the body where it's connected to in contact

47
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,080
with this sitting

48
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,000
surface and gently moving up the

49
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:14,680
body if the back is against the back rest to feel the pressure the

50
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:24,560
contact and feel into the bodily experience lower back and the upper back

51
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,400
is there a sense of

52
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,080
uprightness figuratively or

53
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:01,440
literally and can we let the arms hang

54
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:08,080
from the spine relaxing the

55
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:36,680
shoulders maybe the shoulders moved as a tiny bit back and out very very very small

56
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:42,399
movement that allows the chest to become more

57
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:48,519
available maybe less guarded less armored

58
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:19,480
and the belly our beautiful Bellies can may be relaxed open spacious

59
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:56,480
and our hands feeling what they are touching

60
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:07,959
they're warm or cool smooth or rough

61
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,079
and then we'll check in with a

62
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,480
face place we often hold tension or

63
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:47,120
tightness can we just bring some kindness to the

64
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,720
face some warmth some caring

65
00:10:52,720 --> 00:11:00,720
attention allowing any tension to slip away

66
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:34,240
and you be in this body this moment just as it

67
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:39,639
is just this moment

68
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:10,079
and resting the attention on the sensations of

69
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,160
breathing e

70
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:26,920
and when the mind wanders doesn't have to be a

71
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:33,959
problem just very simply gently begin

72
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:39,679
again with the sensations of [Music]

73
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:53,199
breathing and you just be here this

74
00:13:53,199 --> 00:14:01,040
moment this experience

75
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

76
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
e

77
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

78
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

79
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,920
e e

80
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:15,880
and to drop in a [Music] poem you don't have to figure it out you

81
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:23,079
don't have to think about it you don't have to understand it you don't have to like

82
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:30,840
it and you be here with the experience of it

83
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,360
the poem is called introduction to poetry by Billy

84
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,960
Collins introduction to poetry by Billy

85
00:17:54,159 --> 00:18:01,400
Collins I asked them to take a poem and hold it up to the the light like a color

86
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,679
slide or press an ear against its

87
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:13,120
hive I say drop a mouse into a poem and watch him probe his way

88
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:20,880
out or walk inside the poem's room and feel the walls for a light

89
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:27,640
switch I want them to water ski across the surface of a poem waving at the

90
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:35,760
author's name on the shore but all they want to do is tie the poem

91
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,960
to a chair with rope and torture a confession out of

92
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:47,960
it they begin beating it with a hose to find out what it really

93
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
means

94
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,720
e e

95
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,280

97
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:27,000

101
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:53,880
switch I want them to water ski across the surface of a poem waving at the

102
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:59,640
author's name on the shore but all they want to do is tie the

103
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:07,240
poem to a chair with rope and torture a confession out of it they begin beating

104
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,799
it with a hose to find out what it really

105

e e

120
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:05,519
thank you for your practice or sitting

121
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:15,240
together so this poem introduction to poetry by Billy

122
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:21,039
Collins I'll say that Billy Collins he was the poet laureate for the United

123
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:27,399
States in 2001 to 2003 his uh poems kind of use Simple

124
00:30:27,399 --> 00:30:32,640
language and they often have a certain Whimsy to them and I I appreciate them

125
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:38,120
very much I'll say that um he's currently a

126
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:46,200
professor and he has been a professor for different universities uh during his career so introduction to poetry we can

127
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:51,518
imagine is a course that uh he was

128
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:57,399
teaching and uh maybe I'll read the poem

129
00:30:57,399 --> 00:31:04,919
again and I'll say a little bit more about uh him and uh the the

130
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:12,960
poem so this poem is called a introduction to poetry again it's by Billy

131
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:20,799
Collins I ask them to take a poem and hold it up to the light like a color

132
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:28,760
slide or press an ear against its hive I say drop a mouth house into a

133
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:36,399
poem and watch him probe his way out or walk inside the poem's room and

134
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:42,000
feel the walls for a light switch I want them to water ski across

135
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,440
the surface of a poem waving at the author's name on the shore but all they

136
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,799
want to do is tie the poem to a chair with a rope and torture a confession out

137
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:59,240
of it they begin beating it with a hose to find out what it really means

138
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:04,399
wow this last slide they begin beating it with a hose to find out what it

139
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:09,960
really means quite something right a certain like violence of trying to

140
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:17,840
figure things out I don't know it makes me chuckle because how many times did I uh do this

141
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:24,720
with my experiences in the world trying to figure everything out it's been using my mind to figure everything

142
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,960
out instead of the senses right that Billy Collins is pointing to listening

143
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:37,039
water sking on the surface so kind like feeling and waving at the author's name

144
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:44,200
so uh instead of looking up their biography and figuring out everything and all this kind of stuff I just love

145
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:51,120
this so I'll say here's a um something about Billy Collins that he writes about

146
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:58,519
uh his process of writing poetry and he says I tried to create a hospitable tone

147
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:03,880
at the beginning of a poem because stepping from the title to

148
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:10,399
the first lines it's like stepping into a canoe a lot of things can go wrong I

149
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:17,679
just love this idea stepping from the title to the first line is like stepping in a canoe could be a little bit out of

150
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:23,480
balance so this is a reminder that for this poem the title and the first few

151
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:29,639
lines are introduction to poetry I asked them to take poem and hold it up to the

152
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:37,159
light so right this feels like tangible take a poem and hold it up to the light so he makes it accessible

153
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:42,639
so uh that's Billy Collins but I also want to say something

154
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:49,679
about a leemon she's our current poet laurate for the United States and 2010

155
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:55,600
she talks about the relationship between poetry and

156
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:02,720
noticing which is arguably we could say is what Billy Collins is pointing to as well this relationship between poetry

157
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:08,638
and noticing and I would say relationship between poetry and practice

158
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:15,520
right it's about noticing so this is AD leemon she's our current poet

159
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:21,280
laurate or maybe I should say the poet laurate in the United States not everybody that listens to this is in the

160
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:27,158
United States so Adon says we find it hard to

161
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:32,520
settle our our brains down and poetry offers us that silence

162
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:40,839
that quiet space that allows us to reconnect with ourselves or with an idea or with an emotion it's almost as if

163
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:47,638
poets are offering a religion of noticing things or a religion of paying

164
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:56,679
attention and it it's nice that it doesn't have any connotation other than that just notice just pay attention just

165
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:03,119
be here I'd like to build on this idea of just

166
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:08,560
be here or just notice because what are we doing if

167
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:14,400
we're not just being here and just noticing and that is we're often lost in

168
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:21,040
thought as Billy col says beating the B with a hose which oh gosh it just feels

169
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:28,200
so painful right trying to get a confession or trying to understand things

170
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:33,480
so often we have this habit of just trying to figure everything out which is

171
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:40,960
appropriate and helpful a lot but not 100% of the

172
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:48,160
time if we have this Hammer we have these beautiful brains these Minds that can analyze and figure things out but it

173
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:55,319
doesn't mean that everything in our experience is in nail and part of I would say living a

174
00:35:55,319 --> 00:36:00,440
full life a rich life in part of of what poetry offers us and part of what

175
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:06,200
practice meditation practice mindfulness practice offers us is this

176
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:13,640
recognition there's more than one way there's things that aren't nails that don't require the hammer of figuring

177
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:21,119
things out but instead uh maybe they are butterflies or maybe they are blue skies

178
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:29,839
or maybe it's the soft touch of a kitten that comes up and nudges your

179
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:35,560
hand so there's this way in which analysis removes us from our experience

180
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:43,680
we kind of like lose contact with what's being experienced what's being heard what's been seen and what's being

181
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:50,280
felt felt literally with the body or with our emotions and we want to just um

182
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:55,800
get in there and think about it it's not surprising that we do this

183
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:02,800
because we've been conditioned to do this we've been rewarded to do this certainly I've probably many of you just

184
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:10,599
like me our professional lives were so much about figuring things out and it's feels nice right to have a

185
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:17,720
problem and then solve it or maybe even just have a problem and think about it and try to solve

186
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:24,800
it so and maybe I'll say also there's a discomfort of with not knowing like of

187
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:33,040
feeling confused like why I don't get it like people don't like to have that feeling I don't get it and so they will

188
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:38,280
do a lot of things to try to make sure that they don't have that

189
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:46,079
experience so I don't want to say that practice is about never thinking but what I do want to say is

190
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:52,480
our life practice included is not only about figuring things

191
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:58,839
out there's a way that we can feel our way into experience

192
00:37:58,839 --> 00:38:04,160
and so we also another trap we can fall into is that with meditation we might

193
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:09,480
think that uh we have to get rid of thoughts or have to give rid of a all

194
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:15,960
thinking shouldn't be there there shouldn't be any thoughts or something like that that's a trap

195
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:23,280
too so I would say poetry and practice are offering us different ways to be

196
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:29,319
with experience and I'll just say a few things about

197
00:38:29,319 --> 00:38:36,040
practice with thinking that we can maybe there's we can have aspirations or we

198
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:42,359
can have a even to recognize that there's these different types of relationships to

199
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:50,760
thinking that we can have but there's this way that there's different more than one way to be with thinking so one

200
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:56,000
is can we not feel harassed or hanged by

201
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,680
our thoughts or can we not be diluted by our thoughts

202
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:09,119
so there's there's this way can we have thinking and feel free recognize the

203
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:17,280
freedom while thinking is happening that's maybe one way that we can have as a direction to go if we're not there

204
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:25,640
already if our relationship with thoughts a second one is can we develop

205
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:30,760
the ability to think well that is to reflect clearly maybe even

206
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:36,640
boldly like you know to have some creative to have some uh original

207
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:43,520
thoughts as opposed to Simply like being agreeing or disagreeing with what we're

208
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:51,200
presented with you know by the media or by others or Dharma teachers or you know something like this but instead can we

209
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:58,040
engage and like ask questions and allow what's being presented to us

210
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:04,800
in whatever format reading podcast th talks uh social media you know all these

211
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:12,440
types of things can we develop the ability to actually think things through

212
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:17,760
and have this commitment wait I want to understand this and think it through as

213
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,920
opposed to just passively consuming stuff and allowing ourselves to be

214
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:31,200
impacted by it and a third way is can we use uh can

215
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:36,280
we discern when is thinking unhelpful and when is it helpful because it's both

216
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:42,880
right sometimes it's very helpful required and needed and sometimes it's not so helpful and can we have room for

217
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:48,200
both in our life to notice yeah this type of thinking it's not so helpful and

218
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:55,359
and we recognize it and as best we can let it go when we see so clear how it's

219
00:40:55,359 --> 00:41:01,359
unhelpful often this Letting Go happens naturally and then maybe I'll just say

220
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:08,480
briefly the Buddha talked about in um in his own path towards Awakening that he

221
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:14,560
recognized oh there is helpful thinking and unhelpful thinking there's UNH

222
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:21,440
helpful being um defined as causes Affliction or agitation or

223
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:27,960
uneasiness in oneself and or in others so what is the

224
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:35,760
type of thinking that doesn't support greater Freedom greater well-being either for ourselves or for

225
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:43,520
others and then maybe this simplified way is thoughts of Cruelty or harming

226
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:50,800
thoughts of ill will thoughts of sensual desire reliably do not lead to Greater

227
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:57,880
Freedom peace ease and [Music] well-being so when we notice that this

228
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:03,560
is happening is there a way that we can soften or let go and part of the way is

229
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:10,240
maybe to recognize the the Dua of that type of thinking the way that our minds

230
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:16,839
get constricted and there's this closed mindedness and this uh tightness

231
00:42:16,839 --> 00:42:23,800
that gets associated with that there's a lots more that could be said about this but just to recognize that there's

232
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:29,040
different ways we can have this relationship with thinking can we be

233
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:36,319
free with thinking not to be harassed by it is there a way that we can recognize

234
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:44,280
and be able to think well to think through something and have a certain commitment to okay I want to stay with

235
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:53,040
this and see if I can get to a oh excuse me see if we can get to a conclusion or

236
00:42:53,040 --> 00:43:01,480
maybe there's a way of creative a new understanding so have a commit to think through things and then the third is to

237
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:07,359
recognize oh yeah when is it helpful and when is it not helpful what are the

238
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:14,079
topics that are helpful and the topics that are not helpful with our

239
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:20,960
thinking and I'd like to say Billy Collins and his poem is kind of pointing to there's more than one way we can use

240
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:26,119
our mind more than one way we can use our

241
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:35,000
experience I'll read this poem one more time introduction to poetry by Billy

242
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Collins I asked them to take a poem and hold it up to the light like a color slide or press an ear against its

243
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:50,200
hive I say drop a mouse into a poem and watch him probe his way out or walk

244
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:57,240
inside the poem's rooms and feel the walls for a light switch I want them to water ski across

245
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:05,880
the surface of a poem waving as at the author's name on the shore but all they want to do is tie the

246
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:11,640
poem to a chair and torture a confession out of it they began beating it with a

247
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:18,559
hose to find out what it really means so thank

248
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:24,160
you thank you for uh joining me on this uh fourth day where we're talking about

249
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:30,640
poetry and maybe I'm beating it poem with a hose to find out what it really

250
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:36,640
means I don't know what do you think thank you thank

251
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:00,839
you yeah Bob writes many Minds him of years as a Zen student

252
00:45:00,839 --> 00:45:07,640
working with coons trying to figure them out than just being with them thank you B that's ex exactly right there's a way

253
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:13,359
in which Coons right it can't be figured out

254
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:55,160
Teresa writes poetry and meditation our cousins very nice very

255
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:59,720
nice it's kind of a fun way to think about

256
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:19,760
it water skiing across the surface Bill row writes so right on you still need to

257
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:26,359
practice but it's freeing to fly wow thank you water SK right like

258
00:46:26,359 --> 00:46:33,920
we're still holding on to the Rope so the poem is like maybe taking us somewhere but there is this uh Delight

259
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:43,400
right when we water ski I don't think I've ever water skied but I can imagine it looks like it's delightful have fun

260
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:12,960
looking forward to practicing with you all tomorrow thank you
