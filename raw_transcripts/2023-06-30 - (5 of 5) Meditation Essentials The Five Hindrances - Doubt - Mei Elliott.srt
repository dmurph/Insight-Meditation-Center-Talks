1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:06,540
all right well welcome back everyone uh my name is May Elliott this is the last

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,940
day in our five day series on the five hindrances and as I've shared getting to

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:18,779
know the 500 suits in our meditation practice is really essential for learning how to settle the mind uh and

4
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:24,000
five hindrances for those who need a review include sense desire ill will or

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,980
aversion restlessness sloth and torpor and doubt so today we'll focus on the hindrance of

6
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,860
doubt this might be doubting the practice or doubting ourselves doubting

7
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:46,860
our teachers and the traditional antidote for doubt um is Faith or Sada and Pali another

8
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:52,440
word we might use instead of faith if that word doesn't resonate for you is confidence or we could use the word

9
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,500
trust so in our meditation today we'll be cultivating confidence and Trust in

10
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,680
the practice so let's go ahead and find our meditation posture

11
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:11,539
um something that allows you to be alert and relaxed

12
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,740
tuning into a sense of the body

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,100
my felt sense of being here

14
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,880
setting the intention to land in this moment

15
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:59,820
and as we begin our meditation today I will actually engage in a reflective practice

16
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,700
um where we're actually allowing the mind to think but we're doing so in a way where we're present and we're

17
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:12,480
intentional about the topic about the reflection so let's start by taking a moment to

18
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,879
reflect on times the practice has been beneficial for you

19
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:23,220
maybe it was a time that you were stressed and the practice made you feel

20
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:31,319
more calm or maybe you were listening to a Dharma talk and had an insight about your practice and

21
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:39,900
or maybe you had a time where there was a you experienced a beautiful meditation state or there was just some general

22
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,080
a deeper resonance with the truth of the Dharma

23
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,340
so these are all different ways that you might have experienced the fruit of the

24
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,560
practice so take a few moments now to reflect on times where the practice has

25
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,599
been supportive for you

26
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:07,800
I might consider these we're reflecting on moments that are faith building moments

27
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:33,060
sometimes there isn't a particular moment for ourselves that inspires our

28
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:39,060
practice or that brings forth Faith but there's a teacher that we're inspired by

29
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:45,780
so we can also bring that person to mind how we feel around them or when we listen to them and we can lean on their

30
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:51,000
faith I might not have faith in ourselves but we have faith in in the teachers

31
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,199
practice so we can bring that person to mind as a representation of faith that might be

32
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:03,840
the Dalai Lama or it might be from an archetypal figure

33
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,259
the bodhisattva of compassion Kuan Yin or it might be a teacher that you know

34
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:16,100
or that you listen to online or in person maybe at IMC

35
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,400
maybe Gill somebody that brings forth your faith

36
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:47,360
so having reflected for a few moments on faith this morning or things that

37
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,280
inspired our practice or ways that we've been benefited by the practice we'll let

38
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,740
this reflection Infuse your your meditation today

39
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:05,880
um uh with some confidence um and remind you of kind of a sense of

40
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:12,500
purpose of why we're showing up here there's a reason we're doing this practice

41
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:24,720
so at this time we'll drop any uh reflecting we're doing um and we'll enter the more formal part

42
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,759
of our meditation practice where we can connect with our anchor so go ahead and

43
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:37,699
find the anchor that works for you the breath the soundscape the global sense of the body sitting

44
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,139
and just take some time to land

45
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:03,180
maybe having trust that focusing on your anchor can support you allowing this

46
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:11,000
practice to support you not needing to think of past or future

47
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:18,180
no need to engage in planning or fixing or regretting

48
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:24,180
can put all that down and have confidence

49
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:29,300
in the freedom that's possible by staying here

50
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:53,700
as we sit we're bringing just enough energy to the practice to make sure that we can be

51
00:09:53,700 --> 00:10:00,060
here so that might mean bringing enough energy to bring the Mind back to the present if you've gotten lost in

52
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:05,700
thinking but we're not over exerting we're not

53
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:14,100
trying to create any special States or make anything happen instead can you trust that whatever's

54
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,920
arising for you in the practice is exactly the teaching that you need to receive

55
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,920
so can you have confidence in your practice uh confidence that the

56
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:33,480
Dharma is bringing you whatever you need whether that's a challenge or a joy

57
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:39,420
this is where where the learning is this is the learning Edge

58
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:46,140
so whatever is arising in your life in your practice is exactly the curriculum you need to

59
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,579
study in order to be free

60
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:03,420
and then trusting that whatever arises that you can meet that

61
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:11,339
having faith in yourself that you're able to meet that meeting your life with mindfulness with

62
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:18,240
kindness with patience maybe we can't do this every moment

63
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:26,120
one moment at a time we can cultivate these wholesome States in relationship to whatever's happening

64
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:58,940
staying in this moment with things as they are

65
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:11,540
can you trust the Dharma to allow things to unfold naturally

66
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:10,079
and at any point in the meditation today if you find that you're struggling struggling to be here

67
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:15,720
to stay with your anchor to stay in the body and you find yourself getting lost in thought

68
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:23,300
or falling asleep you might check to see if any of the other hindrances are present

69
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:30,120
you might ask the question what's beneath this there's a lot of

70
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:35,000
thinking what am I feeling right now

71
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,760
maybe sense desire is fueling the thinking mind

72
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,620
or ill will aversion

73
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,720
maybe the mind is like a pond overgrown with moss

74
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,320
filled with Sloth and torpor sleepiness

75
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,540
maybe restlessness is present

76
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:23,480
so if you notice any of these things can you recognize them clearly shining the light of awareness on them

77
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:32,300
and then feel them in the body get to know them what are they like

78
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:49,339
and if there are no hindrances In This Moment

79
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:55,860
take note of the absence of hindrance this is a really wholesome thing to

80
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:01,440
notice the Mind free from hindrance that is one of the conditions for the

81
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,839
arising of gladness so if the mind is free from hindrance

82
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:15,079
see if you can touch into whether there's any gladness in the heart Joy of being free

83
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:29,539
one analogy from James Beres about faith

84
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:36,440
lichens growing Faith to the process of learning to swim

85
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,240
so when we first learned to swim we might be thrashing around in the water

86
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:48,559
struggling striving to just keep our head above water

87
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:53,700
as we start to gain more confidence in the

88
00:21:53,700 --> 00:22:00,320
water that the water can hold us things become a little bit more useful

89
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:07,320
you start to trust okay I'm not going to sink here I can trust the water

90
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:15,000
and in the same way we learn to express the Dharma okay I can trust this I can put faith in

91
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,280
this and eventually

92
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:25,500
we learned that we can just rest floating on our back in the water

93
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:30,840
effortless that ease allowing the water to hold us

94
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,620
completely

95
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,360
this is complete confidence in the Dharma

96
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:55,740
we can rest and Trust the Dharma

97
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:03,140
let me show up here we make the effort to be here to be mindful

98
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,780
and we can trust

99
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:46,400
may be selected goodness of our practice benefit all beings

100
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:51,900
so they may be happy healthy

101
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:59,940
safe and free from suffering may all beings know happiness and the

102
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,500
causes of happiness

103
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:32,220
thank you very much foreign

104
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:50,100
not sure if the fell sound came through for you this time original sound has

105
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:55,980
been on this week but I'm not sure um I love the term original sound it

106
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:01,320
sounds kind of like a a Zen koan like

107
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:06,419
what's the original sound of one hand clapping or something like that

108
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:12,120
so it's okay well now let's begin for those just

109
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:17,400
arriving my name is May Elliott and today is the last day of our series on

110
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:23,340
the hindrances um and today is the teaching on doubt

111
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:30,059
um so this hindrance can manifest as doubt in the Buddha's teaching like

112
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:38,279
does this really work well maybe I should have tried Sufi dancing instead or chakra realignment like I don't know

113
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:43,320
if I'm in the right place um or doubt in your teachers or doubting

114
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:50,400
yourself doubt in oneself is often often manifests as doubt in one's own capacity

115
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:57,179
or ability to do the practice uh Philip Moffett says my doubt is the

116
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:03,179
mother of all the hindrances because it can stop you before you get started

117
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:10,380
and so doubt is significant in that it has the capacity uh to make us quit

118
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:16,278
um and it can also stop the energy from our practice and agitate the mind

119
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:23,100
so some time ago when I agreed to undergo a period of more intensive

120
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:28,500
meditation training it was in a technique that I wasn't all that familiar with

121
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:36,480
and in that setting there was actually a good bit of pressure to learn the technique and as you can imagine feeling

122
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:42,840
pressured to learn a meditation technique is not a very supportive condition for learning to meditate

123
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:50,539
um so it's no surprise then that um but it was a little stressful right

124
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:57,299
and so I was wondering you know am I any good at this technique um again am I able to keep up with the

125
00:29:57,299 --> 00:30:04,200
training um so one day I was I was sitting mulling over my sense of

126
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:09,360
impending insufficiency when something interesting happened so a thought

127
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:17,220
appeared in the mind and it said this is just doubt

128
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:24,779
that's it just said this is doubt and it was true all that was happening in that moment was doubt and I went oh

129
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:31,799
doubt is one of the hindrances um and I know I don't need to take the hindrances personally and so with this

130
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:38,460
recognition this clear seeing of oh this is doubt it was as though the magic

131
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:44,220
spell was lifted the naming of Doubt completely released

132
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:50,100
its power and the whole package fell away um so in that moment I didn't need to

133
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:55,440
let go of the doubt the mind's inner wisdom Let It Go

134
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:01,799
now prior to that experience I had many painful spells of Doubt where I was able

135
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:06,840
to recognize the doubt was present you know the Mind said oh no that's what this is

136
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:14,580
um but the doubt didn't release upon recognition instead I had to sit with the painful feeling of doubt and sense

137
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:19,860
it you know feel it in the body recognize and feel so I did the practice that I've been

138
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:25,679
sharing with you um knowing it's present recognizing it feeling it sensing the sensations in the

139
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:31,919
body feeling the moon that's present the unfed in a unpleasant feeling tone so

140
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:39,480
over and over again I practiced recognizing the doubt and feeling the dukkha the suffering of the doubt um

141
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:47,399
and part of this was really letting the Mind know fully the suffering associated with that form of selfing with that the

142
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:54,480
selfing of women of Doubt um so you want to zoom in a little bit on

143
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,520
this practice of feeling I've talked about about feeling you know

144
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:06,360
feeling a hindrance a zillion times this week I want to underline one of the reasons it's so important

145
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:12,899
um it's through being with the felt experience of the suffering of a hindrance to really being in the body

146
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:18,059
with the experience of anger or craving or restlessness or doubt that our system

147
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:23,760
can register oh this is suffering suffering hurts you don't want to do

148
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:30,659
this anymore I don't need to do this anymore um so through doing this our system learns

149
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:36,419
to naturally let go of a hindrance um it's kind of like like grabbing a hot

150
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:43,440
iron skillet if we do it enough times times the Mind eventually learns don't grab the skillet

151
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,600
it hurts and after a while if we touch the skillet and we don't have to think

152
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:55,679
ah gee I'm grabbing the skillet again I really need to figure out how to like go it's unnecessary instead the hand just

153
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:03,000
releases it so when I recognize doubt then the experienced upon recognition just you

154
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:10,620
know evaporated I didn't let go of the doubt it was inner wisdom that let go of the doubt

155
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:16,140
and that wisdom developed because I had spent so much time clearly seeing

156
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:23,220
clearly recognizing doubt and feeling the suffering of it you know I had I had touched that hot Skillet enough times so

157
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:29,760
when the Mind saw that it was coming it released it immediately ouch this hurts I don't want to do it

158
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:35,700
again so it's not that the release isn't coming from aversion it's coming from

159
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:42,080
Clarity knowing suffering and the causes of suffering it can release

160
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:48,240
I mean so when we become deeply intimate with our hindrances when we study our

161
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:54,899
hindrances fully when we feel them over and over eventually the cheetah the

162
00:33:54,899 --> 00:34:00,899
heart mind learns that they're Duca and the inner wisdom knows to release them

163
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:07,620
so hopefully that that provides a little more understanding of kind of how this process can unfold and how much Freedom

164
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:13,980
becomes possible as we really get to know our hindrances um we're much less likely to be hijacked

165
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:21,839
by them if we know them really well so I'd like to shift now to discuss uh

166
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:27,000
two conditions for the arising of doubt and both are related one is expectation

167
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:36,898
and one's a value evaluation and it can go hand in hand so uh Temple Smith says the Insight

168
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:43,440
teacher he says doubt arises when reality doesn't meet our expectation of

169
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:49,020
where we should be at as in we think the Mind should be more

170
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:56,460
concentrated or we think the Mind should have less thinking or we should be less upset about X Y or Z

171
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:03,060
and when that's not the case when reality doesn't meet our expectations of where we should be at we feel doubt

172
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:10,260
about ourselves or we doubt the practice or about our teachers so our challenge is to let go of

173
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:16,800
expectations that we should be anywhere else than where we're at in our practice instead can we trust that what is

174
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:22,800
arising is coming right on schedule you know this is our new curriculum

175
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:29,220
well so when we don't meet certain expectations for where we should be at

176
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:34,640
often we're evaluating our practice you know that was the the second word that I'd mentioned

177
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:40,500
expectation and evaluation so I'm trying to assess or evaluate whether our

178
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:46,260
practice is good or bad or productive this tends to just be a cause for

179
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:52,740
suffering and it's certainly a cause for doubt um so for example in evaluating we might

180
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:58,740
go gee you know nothing's happening in my practice maybe it's not working

181
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:05,579
um or you know I'm so distracted in my practice you know I I'm you know I'm really just I'm a bad meditator so

182
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:12,300
that'd be an evaluation so in both there's this sense of evaluating what's happening there's not

183
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:18,780
nothing's happening I'm too distracted and and these can be these assessments

184
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:26,040
these evaluations um can really be a catalyst for the mind to doubt the practice or doubt your

185
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:32,880
capacity so for those who are wounded out in their practice which is most of us if

186
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,820
not all or it can be really helpful to remember I love that there's no need to

187
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:44,520
evaluate or judge your progress you can't know where you are on the path for

188
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:51,060
sure or why something's coming or how um how you can grow from it

189
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:56,640
so you know if if we go to a guitar lesson for the

190
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:02,520
first time we don't expect to be a grammy-winning musician the next day and that would be

191
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:08,820
ludicrous so at the same time you know we sit um but to assume that the mind is going

192
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:15,440
to be completely still without thoughts and that the heart will be you know radiating loving kindness

193
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:21,599
you know what that might not be realistic so instead we need to be

194
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:29,280
really deeply patient with ourselves you know if we're trying to chop wood

195
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:38,040
with an ax it might take a hundred strikes to split the wood and we need to be patient and if on the 30th strike we

196
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:43,079
think oh gee this isn't working why bother I'm just going to give up

197
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:49,440
um you know we're selling ourselves short but we're not not during that you know

198
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:55,740
if we're we're evaluating the 30th strike we're not aware of the way that

199
00:37:55,740 --> 00:38:01,740
each strike loosens the wood it opens the crack a tiny bit bigger you know

200
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:09,660
each strike is a causal factor in the eventual splitting of the wood we might not be able to sense that or know that

201
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:16,619
um but that's what's happening and each strike that's not just splitting the wood a little further but

202
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:23,339
um we're growing in these secondary qualities who are growing in patients in determination of all of these qualities

203
00:38:23,339 --> 00:38:28,980
these wholesome qualities are being cultivated in these moments where it could seem like the practice isn't

204
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:36,300
working so on the night leading up to the

205
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:42,420
Buddha's Enlightenment uh the demon Mara visited the Buddha to prevent him from

206
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:48,540
Awakening and Mara tried all sorts of things to distract the Buddha and he sent his

207
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:54,660
armies he tempted the Buddha with beautiful women and Mara's final

208
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:59,880
ammunition after trying everything he says to the Buddha

209
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:07,740
who do you think you are that you could be enlightened so Mara's final ammunition is to evoke

210
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:12,740
doubt who Do You Think You Are

211
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:21,240
at that moment the Buddha touched the Earth and said with the Earth as my witness I have a right to be here

212
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:28,619
and he became free so doubt is no small matter

213
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:33,660
um you know it was the last the last assault for the Buddha before Liberation

214
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:41,220
on the last effort of Mara and so will experienced out in our practice

215
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:46,579
it arises early in practice it arises late arises late in practice

216
00:39:46,579 --> 00:39:54,180
so best thing we can do is get to know it so now I want to shift to the antidote

217
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:59,700
for doubt so as discussed in the meditation the classic antidote for

218
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:06,540
doubt is faith virtual confidence and we can use any of those words

219
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:12,200
um you know can we trust that whatever's arriving arising is arising right on time

220
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:17,579
can we trust that we're right on track and we trust the Dharma can we twist the

221
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:26,640
best and if you struggle with doubt build a daily Faith practice reflect on

222
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:33,420
why you're practicing recollect moments in your life when the practice was really beneficial for you

223
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:39,960
that's what we did at the beginning of the meditation so connecting with moments where the

224
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:46,560
practice has benefited us it's faith building you know borrow the faith of your

225
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:54,200
teachers um teachers that inspire you um to see the practice working in them

226
00:40:54,200 --> 00:41:03,540
so you too can have confidence in it I saw a sign a while ago that said um

227
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:09,780
proceed as though success were inevitable proceed as though successful or

228
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:14,940
inevitable and so can we trust that if we just show up with mindfulness and

229
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:20,880
curiosity that the practice is reliable we can have confidence in it we can have

230
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:28,220
confidence in ourselves can we proceed as though success or inevitable

231
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:39,060
so lastly I want to remind you that if you're visited by hindrance this isn't a

232
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:45,359
bad thing it's not a mistake or a problem the hindrances are the medium by which

233
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:51,540
we wake up so in a way learning to be with the hindrances

234
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:58,440
um learning to do this without rejection is an act of radical inclusion

235
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:04,560
we're making ourselves whole because we're not we're not sending we're not

236
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:10,800
making any parts of ourself uh separate we're not pushing away the hindrances

237
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:17,579
so we're making ourselves whole such that there's nothing we're rejecting nothing we're excluding there's nothing

238
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:23,900
left out so I'd like to end with a poem by

239
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:31,200
izumiashikibu a female Japanese poet from the 10th Century it goes like this

240
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:37,320
uh watching the Moon watching the moon at dawn

241
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:44,579
solitary mid-sky I knew myself completely no part left

242
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:51,119
out I'll read it again

243
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:56,400
watching the moon at dawn solitary Minsky

244
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:02,539
I knew myself completely no part left out

245
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:11,760
thank you very much for your kind attention it's been absolutely wonderful to spend the week with you

246
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:19,440
uh may your practice with the hindrances be a catalyst for your Awakening

247
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:28,200
um it's been so lovely seeing your messages in the chat and getting to spend this time uh with a worldwide Sangha take

248
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,560
care everyone
