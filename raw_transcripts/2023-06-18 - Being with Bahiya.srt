1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:09,059
so for those of you who don't know I'm Diana Clark as Martha said there at the beginning and it's a delight to be here

2
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:15,179
with you all some of you may know that I teach on Monday nights so here I am on a Sunday

3
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:21,000
morning instead of a Monday night but today I'd like to share a little bit

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,100
about asuta my story specifically that's in a suit uh

5
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:32,279
maybe I'll start by saying Gil and I taught to study course for ended up

6
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:38,880
being almost two years it just ended and a theme that we kept on pointing

7
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:47,640
back to in so many different ways the theme was the importance of direct experience like what is happening right

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,460
now this moment as opposed to our ideas about it as

9
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,340
opposed to some philosophy as opposed to some mystical or metaphysical ideas just

10
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:07,560
this you know encouragement to come back what's actually happening In This Moment

11
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,900
and it was quite something to see just how this showed up in the sutas in so

12
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:19,020
many different ways and I would say that a big part of practice is learning to make this

13
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,960
distinction you might think well that's obvious I know what I'm thinking and I know when

14
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,780
I'm sensing but it turns out this can be even more and more subtle the way that

15
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,180
our Concepts our Notions our ideas our beliefs our views our little bit

16
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:42,180
different than what's actually happening in this moment

17
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:49,140
and of course we do this of course humans do this they have ideas and Views

18
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,259
and opinions of course they do we need them but there's so much a way in which we

19
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:01,259
are often living in our heads instead of being embodied

20
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:07,200
there's a way in that we are looking for the answers we're looking for ease we're

21
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,560
looking for Comfort we're looking for happiness with something that's out there and out there being something that's

22
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:20,280
going to happen in the future or in another setting or anywhere but here

23
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:27,560
right and out there of course only exists in our minds doesn't happen right here in the moment

24
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,200
if we're not looking for a happiness and well-being or end of suffering with

25
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,239
something out there then maybe it shows up as we're trying to figure something

26
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:46,319
out like everything is going to be okay as soon as I solve this problem or maybe there's that problem right have

27
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:52,200
you noticed it never ends right and of course we do this many of us in

28
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:58,319
our professional lives or in certain education we've been rewarded for this type of thinking and just solve the

29
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:04,920
problem the next problem the next problem the next problem and everything will be fine and it's such a radical idea in some

30
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,500
ways that this teaching is pointing to can we just be with actually with the

31
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:17,519
experience is here and then Phil I'm going to ask you can you put that volume just a little bit

32
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,560
higher I feel like I'm straining a little bit with my voice to make it just be a little bit louder

33
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,680
thank you so many of you will be familiar with

34
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:36,420
this suta that I'll be talking about it's the Bahia suta

35
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:43,459
and I'm going to kind of tell this story and then drop in some commentary as we go along

36
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,739
so The Suitor begins thus have I heard many of you know this is the common

37
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:55,980
beginning and maybe we could say once upon a time something like this

38
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:03,420
have I heard at one time the Buddha was staying near sovereignty in Jedis Grove and at the pindicus park I'll say that

39
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:10,620
so many sutas start this like where the Buddha is kind of giving a setting

40
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:16,260
now at that time Bahia at the bark cloth was residing by superica on the ocean

41
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:23,040
floor so Bahia he's in another place the Buddha's over here but he is over there

42
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,759
but he was honored respected revered venerated and esteemed and he received

43
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:36,360
robes alms food lodging and medicine and supplies for the sick so they're kind of giving but he is

44
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:43,800
credentials you know who is this person he was a spiritual leader a lot of people followed him thought that he was

45
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,919
a good leader and these list robes alms Foods lodgings and Medicine those are

46
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,199
the usual like the list of four things that spiritual leaders need and in

47
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,620
particular Buddhist leaders need they would say they need those four things and only those four things but that's

48
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:07,919
another story to talk about that but maybe we'll also say that Bahia is

49
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:15,240
not a Buddhist practitioner and partly we know this because he's wearing bark cloth

50
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:22,199
so just in the same way that we can tell the difference between who's a lay person who's a tariff automanastic who's

51
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:28,680
a Zen practitioner who's a Tibetan monastic by what they're wearing in the same way back at the time of the

52
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:35,100
Buddha we could also but he's so he's not a Buddhist

53
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:40,380
practitioner but he's this esteemed spiritual leader

54
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:48,300
and then coming back to the sutta when Bahia was alone in seclusion we can

55
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:54,960
understand this as when he was meditating when he was alone in seclusion this line

56
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:01,639
of thinking appeared to his awareness now of those who in this world are

57
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:06,960
awakened or have entered the path of Awakening

58
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,660
am I one he's wondering about his practice he's

59
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:19,759
wondering I think I'm awake and everybody else thinks I'm awakened but am I really

60
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,199
so I appreciate this very much right but yeah he's not complacent just because

61
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:31,080
everybody thinks oh yeah okay this guy is uh a leader he's a spiritual leader

62
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:38,160
of course he has it all figured out of course he's not trying to solve problems or not in the present moment or whatever

63
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:45,240
it might be like all these things are kind of get projected onto spiritual leaders but he

64
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,759
wasn't buying all of it and this question am I really awakened

65
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:58,800
and importantly he allowed this doubt about his practice to be there he didn't

66
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:07,139
immediately push it away he didn't immediately start thinking of other things you know distract himself

67
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:12,240
or he was had this willingness to stay present

68
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,419
to that experience of having this doubt which you can imagine was an uncomfortable experience

69
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:23,580
to say well everybody thinks I am but am I really

70
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:28,620
maybe this is different than having some

71
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:34,500
ideas of this imposter syndrome that sometimes or maybe it is the same as an

72
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:40,620
imposter syndrome that sometimes happens when people feel like well if people really knew me they wouldn't think what

73
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:46,020
they think about me maybe but he is doing this of course I don't really know

74
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:52,560
but his willingness to stay present and to stay open not to just collapse

75
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,039
and close down when there's this doubt about his practice shows up this willingness allows

76
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:06,300
another voice to enter so a continuation of the sutta

77
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:13,919
then a Deva who had once been a relative of bahia's compassionate and Desiring but he is

78
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:21,060
welfare and knowing with her own awareness the line of thinking that had Arisen and bahia's awareness so this

79
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,280
David knows what's going on in bahia's mind

80
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:33,000
but here that David went by here and on arrival said to him

81
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,500
you Bahia are neither awakened nor have you even

82
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:46,500
entered the path to Awakening you don't even have the practice whereby you would

83
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,779
become awakened or enter in the path of Awakening

84
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:57,540
you can imagine if he has like as well okay

85
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:02,940
so here we go we have a Deva meeting uh

86
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:09,120
that be here in this suta I don't know exactly what Divas are

87
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:17,779
yes there's uh different ways we might understand them some of them have this disembodied entities

88
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:23,279
one thing that I do know that in all the suit does teachings the Devas are just

89
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:29,940
like humans in this sense that they are not awakened either they're not completely they're not you know uh like

90
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:36,540
they're not like other Buddhas or something like this but something I appreciate very much and

91
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:42,360
this is by Douglas Phillips who's another Dharma teacher who teaches both in this tradition and in the Zen

92
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:50,760
tradition and the one way that he considers this Deva is by the

93
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:58,320
role that she plays rather than what exactly David is what's the function in the story of having a

94
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,680
Deva come and meet Bahia and Douglas Phillips has this idea that

95
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:12,360
the Deva is the embodiment of feminine wisdom of course I kind of like this being a

96
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:19,140
woman myself I like this but there's a way in which we can imagine sometimes uh there's this

97
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:24,480
masculine side of us that's trying to go get things make it happen

98
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,779
and then there's this we might say right this is a gross generalization of course right gross generalization and not

99
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:35,940
accurate but it's a way we might think about what the role of Davis is that

100
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,980
then there's also kind of this feminine wisdom that's like wait is that the only

101
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:48,300
thing that there is is this going and getting things and she like challenges but here with

102
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:54,240
this brutal honesty right this is kind of painful like she's just cuts to the chase nope you're not awakened and

103
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:00,839
you're not even gonna get awakened so telling Bahia that despite his years

104
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:10,260
of practice and despite he has all these admiring students he's not even a beginner on the path

105
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:16,800
another way we might think of this idea of the feminine wisdom is that there's

106
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:24,180
sometimes making this distinction between masculine or feminine no matter which gender we are that there sometimes

107
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:33,000
are aspects of ourselves that we're cutting off a little bit that we're ignoring not paying attention to

108
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,440
we can just drop this idea of feminine or masculine there's just often parts of us that we are

109
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:46,260
trying to avoid that we're trying to you know pretend

110
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:53,399
aren't there and maybe even secretly wish that they'll go away so this is when Douglas Phillips is one

111
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:59,880
way that he's interpreting this Deva but no matter how we think about it we might

112
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:05,399
notice that maybe doubt has it risen in your

113
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:12,120
practice too maybe you've had some ideas like am I

114
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:17,700
doing this right everybody else seems like they're awakened or on the brink of awakenment

115
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:22,800
and I'm here struggling with uh being lost in thoughts or whatever it is that

116
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,700
we might be struggling with at the moment

117
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:36,240
so we might have doubt about our capacities we might have doubts about the teachings

118
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,240
what's this idea of Divas might have doubt about the teacher do they really know what they're talking

119
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,639
about does she really know what she's talking about

120
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:52,860
or maybe we've had expectations about you know the results of this practice we

121
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:58,320
had this idea okay I'm just going to learn this meditation practice is everything is going to be easier my life

122
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:05,459
is going to be better and maybe it hasn't turned out exactly the way that you were hoping or wanted it to

123
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:12,319
be so maybe in some ways we're kind of like Bahia

124
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,779
but there's something here that what do we do when we have these doubts for our

125
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:24,440
practice or we have some indicators that we still have some work to do

126
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:34,079
there's two ways that we could do this that we could approach this when this doubt arises one is to go down

127
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:40,920
the path of resignation self-judgment despair

128
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,959
bitterness blaming disdain like there's

129
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:52,380
all kinds of words I could use here and sometimes we might travel some distance down this path before we

130
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:57,540
realize this actually is leading to more suffering not to less suffering this

131
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:03,240
isn't making things better to have this blaming or

132
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,540
collapsing or resignation

133
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:14,279
that's one way to go chances are all of us do some version of that and I know I

134
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:20,160
certainly did certainly earlier in my practice I didn't I would just get angry at the

135
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,800
teachers these poor teachers they didn't know what I was projecting onto them like I just thought I don't know I just

136
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:32,220
thought it was their fault somehow that this was so hard and I didn't know how to do it or I was getting lost or having

137
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:37,100
difficulties I thought if they would only be better teachers

138
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:42,660
now I'm one of those teachers right I can tell you we don't have all the answers for

139
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:49,079
everybody right we have to find our own way of course we do of course we do

140
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:56,579
and that's the second path or that's the second response we could have when we have all this response when we discover

141
00:14:56,579 --> 00:15:01,860
that there's some difficulties we could rather than the path of blaming

142
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,899
or self-judgment we could go down the path of practice

143
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:15,120
that is we could bring attention to our experience at that moment

144
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,639
this is what doubt feels like this is what

145
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:26,820
blaming feels like this is what despair feels like

146
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:32,040
this is what feeling confused and angry and not even sure I want to do this

147
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:39,740
practice anymore feels like it feels like this and it's uncomfortable

148
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:49,740
so there's a way in which we can just bring our practice to our experience which to be sure might be the precise

149
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:57,300
thing we don't want to do but this is what's been asked of us not

150
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:04,320
to be somebody different not to have different experiences but to be with what's arising

151
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:12,860
as best we can as best we can with whatever's arising

152
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:22,019
so if we do have some doubts about our not only our experience or about the teachings or the teachers what can we do

153
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:28,199
we can be with our experience but bring it with a sense of curiosity do some

154
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:34,199
investigation talk to a teacher read Dharma books listen to Dharma talks talk to other

155
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:40,019
people there's so many ways in which we can maybe share our experience in a way

156
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:45,839
that feels comfortable for us that is a part of the practice

157
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:52,620
I would say for me I certainly would not have stayed with this practice if it weren't for some friends that I had

158
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:59,639
along this dormant path to share kind of the difficulties and

159
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:07,140
after Derma talks to talk about things like what I didn't get it did you get it you know this kind of thing or to just

160
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,040
like share ideas

161
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:19,620
and maybe the last thing I'll say about this that's this when we're having difficulties to engage with the practice

162
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:27,019
and to bring some curiosity about it maybe some of you will recognize this as investigation

163
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:33,240
many of you will know that investigation is a factor of Awakening like it's an

164
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:40,620
integral part of this path towards Awakening so it's not like something that we do on the side until we could

165
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:48,240
get back to the real practice it is the practice to bring some curiosity some

166
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:56,720
some just being present like what what's going on here to what's actually happening

167
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:02,580
okay to get back to the suta Bahia so the David just told him okay you're

168
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:07,860
not awakened and you're not even going to be awakened and I give but he a lot of credit

169
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:16,260
because here's what happens next without hesitation Bahia asked the Deva

170
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:23,580
but who in this world is awakened or has entered the path to Awakening

171
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:29,220
and she said Bahia in the northern city of saviti lives the

172
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:35,760
blessed one the Buddha a rightly self-awakened one he is truly

173
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:42,000
awakened and he teaches the Dharma that leads to Awakening

174
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,820
then but he had deeply chastened by the Deva left saparaka and traveled all the

175
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:54,780
way to where the Buddha was traveling with where the Buddha was staying put this in context this is thousands of

176
00:18:54,780 --> 00:19:02,460
years ago and the distance between where Bahia was and where the Buddha was it's over a thousand miles

177
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:08,039
right he had to walk right maybe he had a chariot part of the way or some of the way I don't know but

178
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:15,000
a thousand miles is a long time right before there's roads or Pavements not even it doesn't exist yet you know this

179
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:22,320
is but here he undergoes this he has this commitment and he's willing to travel this distance

180
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:29,580
in my mind this this uh in adding this little detail into the story is pointing

181
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:35,460
to the the amount of commitment that Bahia has like he really wants to get

182
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:42,440
awakened so

183
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:50,280
I uh so but he doesn't defend or rationalize uh his but everybody else

184
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:56,700
thinks I'm awakened are you sure instead he says well if I don't have it where can I find it and then he goes to see if

185
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,919
he can find it so he travels to where the Buddha is and

186
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:09,480
getting back to the suta there but he have found a number of monks doing walking meditation outside

187
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:17,880
he went directly up to them and asked where venerable sirs is the Buddha stain

188
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:26,000
I must see him immediately he has this you know urgency

189
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:31,740
and then he was told that that Buddha had gone into the city for Ohm's round right of course the monastics every day

190
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:36,900
are getting alms so the Buddha wasn't there the place

191
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:43,440
where other monastics were he was in the town so but he had hurried immediately to the

192
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:50,460
city where he found the Buddha on alms round the Buddha was moving with great calm

193
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:55,559
his mind at peace tranquil and poised

194
00:20:55,559 --> 00:21:02,640
this is how Buddhas are but he approached the Buddha threw

195
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:09,299
himself to the ground before him and with his head at the Buddha's feet he said teach me the Dharma blessed one

196
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:14,880
teach me the Dharma a holy one so that it will be for my long-term welfare and

197
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,700
happiness the Buddha replies this is not the time

198
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:25,919
by here we have entered the town for alms

199
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:33,000
so in an irreverent way in my mind he's saying if I'm on my lunch break I got

200
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,539
back later

201
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:43,380
I'm sure the Buddha would be a little bit different but you know that's kind of what happened right and recognizing

202
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:50,760
right that this time the Buddha only ate one time a day right so he needs to eat he needs to have a meal every day

203
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:56,940
but but he have pleaded with the Buddha a second time but holy one it is hard to

204
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:02,220
know for sure what dangers there may be for the Buddha's life or what dangers

205
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:07,260
there may be for my life please teach me the Derma o blessed one

206
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:13,500
so that I may be happy and free so be a Bahia say no no teach me now

207
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:18,620
because you know we don't know what's going to happen in the next moment

208
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:25,860
again the boo that but Buddha tried to put off Bahia and he's saying that it wasn't the right

209
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:32,460
time to teach because this is the arms around so but he is persistent

210
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:37,740
he has a certain amount of diligence but he also recognizes you know

211
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:43,260
impermanence this recognition that you know we're not guaranteed a next moment

212
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:48,480
none of us are not even Buddhas

213
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:54,179
even though we might be thinking okay I'll be doing this later later everything will be fine later I'll figure that out later I'll practice

214
00:22:54,179 --> 00:23:00,900
later I'll be with my present moment experience but here has enough wisdom to recognize no

215
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:06,500
we don't actually know what's going to happen the next moment

216
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:13,100
so he's but he is respectful but tenacious

217
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:22,980
so the suit continues but he had pleaded his case a third time

218
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:30,179
and this is a common theme that we see in the suit does it's very interesting and I don't know the origins or the

219
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:37,260
story around this but common that if you ask a Buddha three times after the third time he will

220
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:42,659
relent just keep that in your back pocket the next time you meet a Buddha you can ask

221
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:46,159
them three times for something

222
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,240
Bahia pleaded his case a third time and this time the Buddha relented and said

223
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,679
well then Bahia you should train like this

224
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:08,340
in the scene will be merely the scene in the scene in

225
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:14,100
The Herd will be merely The Herd

226
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:20,100
in the sensed will be merely the sensed

227
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:26,720
in the cognized will be merely the cognized

228
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:35,820
so that Buddha is pointing to just being with the present moment experience

229
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:41,100
cognized we could have that stand for all whatever mental events are happening

230
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:47,700
in the mind sensed we could say there's a shorthand for any senses

231
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,860
in in addition to seeing and hearing

232
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:58,380
so when seeing or hearing is happening just to be only searing or hearing or

233
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:02,299
sensing or having mental events

234
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:10,500
we might say that uh a big part of practice is discovering

235
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:16,140
all the extra quote unquote things that we do besides just being with our

236
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:22,140
experience sometimes the experience is uncomfortable

237
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:27,960
and then as we spoke about earlier there might be this but I don't want it to be

238
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:34,080
here and then there's a whole story making that happens many of you might be familiar with this

239
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,960
idea of papancha right this mental proliferation that often starts with something's really Pleasant or

240
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:46,919
unpleasant then there's a way in which the Mind wants more and it starts to make a story about how it wants more I

241
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:53,940
want this or I don't want that or this reminds me of the time that you

242
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:59,640
know XYZ or this means something about me this often happens right and then

243
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:05,039
we're no longer with the present moment instead we're with what's off lost in

244
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:10,140
our stories so the Buddhas pointing to the

245
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:15,139
importance of just staying with the present moment experience

246
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:23,059
so then The Suitor continues it's more than just being with the present moment experience

247
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:32,820
the Buddha says and when you have trained in that way and the scene will be merely this scene and the herd will

248
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:38,220
be merely the herd and this sensed will be merely the sensed in the cognized

249
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:45,840
will be merely the cognized then be here there is no you

250
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:52,260
in connection with that and when there is no you in connection

251
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:58,559
with that there is no you there and when there is no you there there is

252
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:05,000
no you here nor Yonder nor in between

253
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:11,720
and just this is the end of suffering

254
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:19,320
upon hearing this brief explanation from the Buddha but he is mind was immediately freed from the defilements

255
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:26,039
from grasping and he became an arhand so you might wait and wonder like wait

256
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:32,820
what what happened there what the Buddha is pointing to is that

257
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:38,220
imputing a sense of self or having this self-concept

258
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:45,380
is extra and it's associated with suffering

259
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:51,360
so we might consider like the Buddha's description of when the scene is just

260
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:58,440
the scene or the hearing is just the hearing might be a description of what it means when there isn't this

261
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:04,340
self-concept that's getting overlaid on top of our experience

262
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:09,480
this idea of that there is a there's a

263
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:16,260
pattern of experience but there's no entanglement with it there's no papancha

264
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:22,400
that's happening after it as an example

265
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:27,779
you might have noticed that sometimes during meditation

266
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:33,059
sessions the most peaceful

267
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:40,559
the most delightful part of the whole meditation session

268
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:47,100
is when the bell rings at the end because at that moment like there's a

269
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:53,400
little huh and there's any doing that had was being done like there's a

270
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:58,559
meditator here that's trying to meditate or I'm meditating for that moment when

271
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:03,840
the bell rings that sense of oh I I quote unquote have to meditate gets put

272
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:11,640
down there's this kind of this relaxation this little bit of a just an opening

273
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:18,720
like oh okay now what's next I finished that but before there's the I finished

274
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:25,140
that that moment there's this this can be this peacefulness at the next meditation session notice what happens

275
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:30,779
at the moment when the bell rings there often is this opening this relaxation

276
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:37,799
this ease because at that time there's like the

277
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:44,460
mind isn't like doing anything you're not trying to meditate you're not trying to be a meditator nothing needs to

278
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:52,200
happen right at that moment and it might just be a flash or a flicker but just notice how at that time there's

279
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:58,220
this peacefulness or this delightfulness

280
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:04,440
but not only is there no longer this sense of somebody who's doing this

281
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:09,600
meditation but at that moment also the reactivity

282
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:16,799
and the measuring has been quieted or dropped

283
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:22,679
there's often such a subtle way in fact it might be subtle and so constant and

284
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:28,320
familiar we might not even recognize it but there's a way when often when we're

285
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:33,419
meditate or we're trying to meditate there's this subtle way in which there's

286
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:39,840
a I like this more than that

287
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:46,020
oh it was better yesterday what am I going to do tomorrow so I can

288
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:51,419
have this experience again or I don't like this as much as that right

289
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:57,480
there's this subtle measuring or comparing or a sense of me trying to

290
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:04,860
make things happen that gets tangled up with our experience

291
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:13,200
and what the Buddha is pointing to is that's extra we don't actually have to do that

292
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:20,460
that doesn't need to happen in fact that can get quieter and quieter and quieter

293
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:25,919
and usually this is how it happens is it's uh this x during the extra is on a

294
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:33,120
spectrum sometimes it's so obvious like I don't like this please make it go away I hate this when is that tank Bell gonna

295
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:39,720
ring and there can be a really strong sense of I want something in particular to

296
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:44,760
happen or there it could be a really quiet

297
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:51,720
just every now and then there's a thought that floats up like oh yeah this is nice I hope it stays like this wow

298
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:58,080
look at me I'm meditating there can be something like this it can be really really strong or really really

299
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:07,140
subtle it's not a binary on or off when this uh this extra is added

300
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:13,980
so this reactivity this measuring this entanglement

301
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:19,760
is caused we might say by the self-concept that there's this

302
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:27,179
idea of a self that because the self it wants things to be a particular way

303
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:32,480
wants things to be pleasant and comfortable

304
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:41,760
and it's this way of trying to bolster and protect this notion of this core or

305
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:49,020
this notion of an essence that underlies suffering

306
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:55,260
and whether that's suffering is just stress or uncomfortableness or just flat

307
00:32:55,260 --> 00:33:00,659
out awfulness it's this self-concept at the beginning

308
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:06,840
at the this at the sense of this being at the core that is the source that's

309
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:12,440
fueling the reactivity it's fueling the suffering

310
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,600
so whatever is happening

311
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:27,679
and whatever moment and each moment whatever is happening

312
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:32,720
this can be the entry point of practice

313
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:39,960
learning to live fully in the life that we have

314
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:46,140
not in some imagined future or remembered past but living to just be

315
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:54,080
here oh yeah this is sensing feels like this

316
00:33:54,179 --> 00:34:00,000
seeing seeing is like this hearing

317
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,100
hearing is like this whether you're in a meditative stage

318
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:12,000
whether you're in a meditation poster whether you're just washing the dishes or driving or whatever it might be whatever

319
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,119
your experiences this can be a doorway to practice

320
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:22,618
and just to be with the seeing or the hearing or

321
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:31,320
whatever mental experience is happening and freedom is possible Right There at

322
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:36,358
that moment we don't have to wait for some imagined

323
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:42,060
you know perfect conditions whatever is happening right there we can be with the

324
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:48,720
experience and maybe it's just a moment a flicker of a little bit more ease

325
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:53,820
but this is exactly how the practice unfolds is with a tasting or a

326
00:34:53,820 --> 00:35:00,420
recognition of oh yeah there's a little bit more ease this direction when I'm just with the experience there's less

327
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:05,880
ease this direction when I'm adding on all the thoughts and ideas of how I

328
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:10,760
should be or how this experience should be

329
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:21,320
so being with our experience and the life we actually have

330
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:27,980
can be the doorway to Greater freedom thank you
