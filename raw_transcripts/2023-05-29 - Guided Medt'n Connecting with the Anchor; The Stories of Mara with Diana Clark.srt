1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:06,620
okay so here we are the top of the hour

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:14,519
just a warm welcome to everybody I'm Delight it is for me to be here and to

3
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,939
be sharing it in with the goodness of this Sangha it's quite something

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:26,340
and many of you know that Gail is starting a a retreat

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:33,300
so more than happy to help support him I see

6
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,460
take some well-deserved Retreat time

7
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:47,239
maybe I'll wait a few more seconds before I start with the guided meditation

8
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:57,600
and wishing everybody a good morning again and here it's a little cloudy too I like

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:05,220
how there's a little bit this weather report there is a little bit cloudy I'm in Redwood City not too far from IMC

10
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,519
actually

11
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:18,920
okay so we'll start with a set

12
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,740
being in the meditation posture

13
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:35,820
and can we bring an aliveness of attention

14
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,100
to the experience of sitting

15
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,798
to taking a moment to settle in

16
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:56,118
what does it feel like to sit to be in this particular posture

17
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:09,000
be feeling the legs or touching the chair or the

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,099
mat says a bench couch bed

19
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:20,239
whatever it is

20
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,280
feeling the feet

21
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,900
and whatever they're touching

22
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,500
on the back side whatever it's touching

23
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:58,080
cushion chair couch bed

24
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,379
bench so many different ways so many different ways we can support

25
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:07,459
her sitting

26
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:19,940
feeling the pressure against the body feeling connected

27
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,959
feeling grounded

28
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:53,780
and can we feel the stability of this sitting base

29
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:10,220
feeling the steadiness of this sitting base our legs and feet and backside

30
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:20,959
and allowing that to support us

31
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:38,040
then bringing an aliveness of attention into the body

32
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,220
into the bodily experience more generally

33
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:02,040
is there a way we can inhabit the body with aliveness

34
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,360
with presence

35
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:18,080
alive to the body and the way it feels right now

36
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,940
maybe there are some areas of tension or tightness

37
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:53,539
if so we can rest our attention on those areas

38
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:06,360
with a spirit or with a intention of allowing

39
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,460
just for this sit can it be okay

40
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:30,020
those areas of tension tightness are there

41
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,978
maybe your the shoulders

42
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,580
the face

43
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:59,120
around the eyes or the jaw

44
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:18,800
allowing any softening any opening relaxing

45
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:39,240
and if there isn't any softening opening or relaxing

46
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,340
can we allow that to

47
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,639
being okay with it not being quite okay

48
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:31,139
can we set the direction the attitude of

49
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:38,640
our sit together this morning can it be a direction of kindness

50
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,580
of warmth

51
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,440
of care

52
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,800
in some ways we might say that

53
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:27,740
just the ACT is sitting down to meditate is an act of kindness towards ourselves

54
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,139
way of taking care of ourselves

55
00:09:52,260 --> 00:10:02,000
but just intentionally bringing in that orientation that direction of kindness

56
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,879
goodness time together

57
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:34,740
and if you haven't already is resting the attention on the

58
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,000
sensations of breathing

59
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:23,180
feeling the body as it breathes

60
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:55,800
in a relaxed easy way just noticing

61
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:01,639
the sensations breathing

62
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:13,800
you know in the mind wanders as it's apt to do

63
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:20,300
just very simply gently Begin Again

64
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,579
foreign

65
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:08,779
foreign

66
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:10,020
foreign

67
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:35,778
foreign

68
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,580
foreign

69
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,579
[Music]

70
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:33,710
[Music]

71
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:12,260
so again oh let's see I need to stop the recording here for a moment

72
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:27,720
so good morning good morning thank you for that

73
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:32,539
set together it's lovely to sit together

74
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:39,480
and so this morning I'd like to talk a little bit about stories

75
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:45,659
and the role that they play and some of the stories we tell ourselves and certainly some of the stories that are

76
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:52,500
in our tradition so there's one story that probably many

77
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:59,000
of you are familiar with and that is the story about the Buddha's Awakening

78
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:04,740
The Story Goes that after the Buddha to be after renouncing Bulls like this

79
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:10,320
Central indulgement in all possible Central pleasures and

80
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:16,559
then going to the opposite extreme and having this extreme asceticism nearly

81
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:23,100
starving himself to death so after trying both of these extremes

82
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:29,340
and that didn't work he didn't become awakened then he decided okay well I'm going to meditate and it's going to go

83
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:35,520
under a tree and sit and not move until he was awakened until

84
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:41,760
he was enlightened and while I was sitting there under the

85
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:49,860
tree The Story Goes there's a number of different versions of this story as often as the case when there are stories

86
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:55,380
is that he was visited by Mara

87
00:32:55,380 --> 00:33:00,419
Amara tried to entice the Buddha to be with these different fantastic things

88
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:05,640
Central indulgences and when that didn't work he attacked

89
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:11,820
the Buddha to be with armies and that's a little bit what I'd like to

90
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:19,380
talk about in that in our week together is about these different armies that uh Mara used to attack the Buddha to be

91
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:24,600
before his Awakening so that this story here

92
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:30,840
so we might say that Mara and this story symbolizes that which

93
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:36,179
gets in the way of our for their freedom our Awakening

94
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:43,559
this movement towards enlightenment I might say that Mara represents some

95
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:48,779
people might say the hindrances and certainly you know Mara we could say it's the hindrances but it's also more

96
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:56,100
than that it's uh that which gets us that captures us and uh makes us think

97
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:02,820
that we don't need to move along this path towards greater Awakening or distracts us uh from this path towards

98
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:10,020
greater freedom Tamara as a character I want to

99
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:17,158
emphasize that he's not like satanic sometimes I've heard uh different teachers or writings that kind of refer

100
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:23,339
to him more as this demon or demonic but I would say that real important

101
00:34:23,339 --> 00:34:30,060
distinction between Mara and any satanic ideas we might have is that Mara

102
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:37,740
absolutely has no wish for beans to do evil or to be in hell

103
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:45,540
it's actually the opposite Mara wants individuals to enjoy all the

104
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:52,919
sense Pleasures they can imagine Mara would like for us to have the best

105
00:34:52,919 --> 00:35:01,800
food ever that best vacations ever the best sex ever the best anything just so

106
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:07,260
that we like feel Intoxicated by essential pleasures and or indulging in

107
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:14,339
them again and again and again and instead of like seeking towards

108
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:22,260
greater Enlightenment or Awakening we find ourselves endlessly seeking and searching and striving towards freedom

109
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:29,040
and peace but never finding it because we're like stuck with these

110
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:35,700
enticements of uh whatever it is that it's in the way of our Awakening gets in

111
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:41,940
the way of Greater freedom and peace so for Mara you would say there's this

112
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:47,280
way in which we're never leaving what we might call samsara

113
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,859
there's a few ways to understand samsara one is that there's these different

114
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:59,880
Realms that beings can exist in some of them we might say are Heavenly Realms some are hell Realms we can understand

115
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:05,040
it as you know some moments we're in the heaven Realms things are just perfect and ideal

116
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:10,980
it was nice for me to sit with you guys just a few minutes ago maybe we could say that was a little bit of a heaven

117
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:17,760
Realm and then the hell Realms where we have real difficulties you know

118
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:23,640
difficulties and then the human realm or just kind of our everyday life

119
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:29,400
so we can understand it it's just one moment in the next or we could understand it as you know one lifetime

120
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:34,619
to the next for the purposes of what we're talking about this week absolutely doesn't

121
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:40,500
matter however you like to hold this idea of samsara of you know this being

122
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:47,099
in the next one realm one after the other but getting back to this idea of Mara so

123
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:55,560
he's not uh satanic doesn't want you know evil or bad so he

124
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:02,940
emphasizes complacency and contentment in some kind of way but

125
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:08,700
really like this complacency so the story of Mara is the story of

126
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:14,180
complacency versus effort

127
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:19,500
being satisfied not really doing anything versus you know

128
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:26,520
working or I don't know if that's the right word opening uh towards greater Awakening so it's not

129
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:32,520
good versus evil it's complacency versus I'll use this word effort but I don't

130
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:39,359
want to imply that it has to be super hard effort because sometimes it does but sometimes it doesn't

131
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:45,060
so to this uh story of Mara there's been a

132
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:51,480
modern day reinterpretation that I just think is delightful and that I've really

133
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:58,680
um have enjoyed and this story has been written

134
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:05,640
by ajan punedamo who from the arrow River Forest Hermitage in Northern

135
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:12,119
Ontario Canada and he's in the ajanta lineage

136
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:17,220
and he uh wrote this story that's the

137
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:23,520
story of Mara writing letters

138
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:30,720
to the generals of these 10 armies so he has these uh letters that he's

139
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:37,200
written to kind of like encourage those individuals who are leading these armies

140
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:45,839
that lead in humans we'll say into this complacency so here's the setting in which uh

141
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:52,500
Jean punadamo wrote as describing Mara sitting down to

142
00:38:52,500 --> 00:39:00,500
write these letters and here's here's a description in a far away realm there's this most

143
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:06,780
intoxicatingly beautiful Pleasure Park in all the vast swarms of universes

144
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:13,400
Golden Leaves suede by gentle breezes tinkle with soft and lazy Melodies

145
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:19,260
gorgeous birds and enormous butterflies flutter through the Shady Groves

146
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:24,359
and then he goes on to describe how there's this castle and inside this

147
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:33,119
Castle there is this individual named Mara who is sitting at a desk

148
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:39,119
um setting down sitting down to dictate a letter to the ten armies to the

149
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:45,119
generals of these ten armies so you can this really Fantastical realm

150
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:54,660
and sometimes that's kind of what makes it fun I think is this Fantastical realm that this uh maybe this sense of Whimsy

151
00:39:54,660 --> 00:40:01,380
as opposed to some of the seriousness because this practice is really serious but sometimes we need a little bit of

152
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:07,800
Whimsy to uplift the heart and for maybe to see ourselves in a way

153
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:13,560
that isn't so maybe critical or overbearing

154
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:18,720
so the scene is Mara is sitting at this desk in this beautiful castle in this

155
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:24,359
beautiful land to write letters to his generals or the leaders of these 10

156
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:31,680
armies so what are the ten armies sense desires

157
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:37,380
boredom hunger and thirst craving

158
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:45,240
sloth and torpor uncertainty malice and obstancy

159
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:50,520
honor Renown and notoriety and self-praise and denigration of

160
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:56,280
others so these are the ten armies these are the things that uh

161
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:02,579
get in the way of our leading to Greater freedom

162
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:07,980
and so in this um in these ensuing weeks I'll be

163
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:14,160
talking a little bit about these armies and the letters that ajan punadamo has

164
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:20,339
written to the leaders of these armies so

165
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:25,500
um we might talk say well why what about stories like why do we even bother with

166
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:31,380
these uh stories like this is silly Diana but stories have such an important

167
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:38,579
part and kind of like The Human Experience like we all share stories we share stories with our family of our

168
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:43,920
family of work of our experiences and certainly uh in our daily lives we might

169
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:51,000
refer to myths or folklores or characters from TV shows you know that to explain things to

170
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,339
others or maybe even to explain things to ourselves and I know in Buddhist circles we

171
00:41:56,339 --> 00:42:01,380
sometimes use this expression like the second Arrow referring to a story right

172
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:06,960
the Buddhist story of the first arrow is what life brings us

173
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:13,560
but the second arrow is our reaction to difficulties and the second arrow is can

174
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:21,300
be just as painful or as painful as the first Arrow so that's just a representation of a

175
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:27,960
story that kind of as practitioners we share and we often use it to represent

176
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:33,720
something that's meaningful and the use of a story is a way in which

177
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:39,140
we can maybe do a shorthand but also kind of connects us

178
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:46,800
stories let us share information that maybe creates a little bit of an emotional connection with others or or

179
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:54,660
maybe help us understand information and maybe even make that information memorable it's really easier to remember

180
00:42:54,660 --> 00:43:00,260
this idea of the second Arrow rather than a complicated

181
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:06,540
idea of well then there's what happens and then there's our reactions to what happens

182
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:11,780
but how can we use these stories to help our practice

183
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:19,200
maybe even these stories with Mara and his armies these stories can help us recognize our

184
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:25,619
common Humanity all beings

185
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:30,900
experience these visits from Mara and his army

186
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:37,440
we don't have to take it personally it's part of the human experience to be

187
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:45,960
visited by sense desires boredom malice and obstacy thirst and hunger and you

188
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:53,160
know all these other armies so we don't have to identify with them when they arise

189
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:58,200
because when we identify with them we may feel incompetent or inadequate or we

190
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:04,500
may feel discouraged so there's a way in which sharing these stories

191
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:09,660
can be a way for us to connect with others and to feel like oh yeah this is what it

192
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:15,720
means to be human and then I'll add the role of Whimsy

193
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:22,380
for me I actually really like this Whimsy because there's a way in which it dissolves some of this anger and

194
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:29,460
frustration or maybe we might say let's light shine in some of the Dark Places

195
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:34,800
or we might even say that it warms our hearts or softens our hearts and makes

196
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:41,520
life more interesting to have some of these stories and to have a little bit of Whimsy that eases some tension

197
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:48,780
there's a way that connects us together so the role of stories in practice

198
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:56,760
certainly there's stories that we tell ourselves that are not helpful but I'm hoping in these few days

199
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:02,099
together to share stories that are helpful and them having this Whimsical

200
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:07,380
Fantastical form helps us remind us that their stories and maybe helps us be able

201
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:14,099
to look at ourselves and our own experience with uh some of this warmth and kindness

202
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:21,060
that connects us with others so I hope that you'll join me for the rest of this week as well as I'll share

203
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:27,720
some of these letters that were written to the leaders of these different armies I'll choose a few of these tomorrow will

204
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:35,760
be boredom so how does Mara encourage people to be bored and then how can we

205
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:42,060
as practitioners work with that so thank you and I look forward to

206
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:49,818
spending these days together and wishing you a wonderful rest of the day thank you
