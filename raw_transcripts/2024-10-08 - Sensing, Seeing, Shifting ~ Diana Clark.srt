1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,799
good evening welcome welcome hope everybody's doing okay with

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:12,559
the heat that uh we're having hopefully we're on the tail end

3
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:18,880
of that so today I wanted to talk a little

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,359
bit about this whole notion or this idea of seeing

5
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:30,720
seeing you know this usual and complicated thing that uh humans do

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,000
but first I wanted to talk about how we like just in English how we sometimes

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,239
use this verb to see there's the obvious one this like literal perception with

8
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:49,520
the eyes like I can see the mountains from here or maybe there's this way we use

9
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,600
the word seeing to talk about you know dating or being in relationship yeah

10
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:01,840
they've been seeing one another for a few months or you know something like that or maybe we use this uh we're

11
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,400
seeing to talk about imagination or can't can't you just see

12
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:13,360
yourself going down the slopes in the skiing when it's so hot or something

13
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,119
like this you know just this invitation to uh imagine something in

14
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,600
particular or maybe we even use this expression C to talk about like I'll

15
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:31,200
accompany you I'll see you to the door or maybe there's this way we also

16
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,799
say that seeing is related to understanding oh I

17
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,240
see this kind of way I kind of like it when there's these

18
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:48,840
simple words that get used in so many different ways and we can look at them differently and understand things

19
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:56,159
differently in some ways we might say that that's so much about meditation practice Buddhist practice is about

20
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,200
taking something that seems ordinary and looking at it in a little bit different

21
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,280
way and it has a have a different understanding it has a different

22
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:13,720
impact so I'm going to look at this uh word seeing and maybe what it points to

23
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:19,360
and some of the way the experience of it from a number of different

24
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,959
ways and in particularly like how this this part of a path of practice to

25
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,959
Greater freedom and ease and peace and well-being not only just some little

26
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:39,159
intellectual curiosity fun thing to do but uh it's something that will help to bring some more ease in our lives to

27
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:47,920
understand maybe a little bit the way that uh we see and maybe some of the ways we don't

28
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,599
see as a support for practice so first I'll start with maybe

29
00:02:53,599 --> 00:03:01,200
the obvious thing the you know using the senses the the eyes we

30
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,959
see and in uh the classical Buddhist teachings they talk a certain amount

31
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:13,959
about this how there has to be a contact with eyeballs I'll say or the eye

32
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:19,080
apparatus and there has to be something out there to see in order for seeing to

33
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,400
happen when we say it this way it sounds pretty obvious but uh there's a way in

34
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,519
which um we could unpack that and look at that from a number of different angles but

35
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm not going to here I'm just now I'm just going to highlight that there are a

36
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,760
number of elements to this thing that we just do all day long and if yeah that we

37
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:48,480
do all day long and one is to have a visual apparatus that

38
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:56,120
works not everybody does and sometimes it doesn't work so well and maybe as

39
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,239
we're aging we're noticing oh yeah it doesn't work the way that it did or when

40
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:07,400
I have my glasses on it certainly works much better than when it doesn't or something like

41
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:14,480
that and then also the second element that there needs to be something to be

42
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,239
seen I mean maybe that's like so obvious we don't think about it but uh there's a

43
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:27,360
way in which we could um unpack that that there's it's that there

44
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,960
requires something that's belongs to the human body body and then something that doesn't belong to the human body in

45
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,638
order for this whole seeing thing uh to

46
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,680
happen I think I'll leave it there that's pretty uh pretty obvious not so

47
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:50,840
complicated but I wanted to spend a little more time talking about this idea

48
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:59,720
that like seeing like the role that the mind has in seeing it's not just a a

49
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:06,160
labs and nerves the optic nerve and all that kind of

50
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,639
stuff because probably we know this but maybe I'll say it explicitly you know

51
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:20,000
our eyes or maybe I should say our experience of seeing are not like

52
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,960
cameras we all have this experience where you see a picture of yourself you're like oh I look like that because

53
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:33,759
when we see ourselves in the mirror we see ourselves in some particular way and then when you see a photo you're like oh

54
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:39,080
okay there's it looks a little bit different so it's not like we get a a

55
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:44,720
perfectly accurate uh view of what's out

56
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:51,039
there and I just recently heard this story which also highlighted that

57
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:56,280
sometimes we just don't notice stuff that maybe that would show up on a

58
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:03,039
camera maybe even like a zoom camera maybe we uh have this

59
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,319
experience of noticing sometimes uh during the pandemic I did a lot I spent

60
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:14,479
a lot of time on zoom and I did a lot of teaching on zoom and sometimes having like a curious like I wonder if this

61
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:21,080
person recognizes that in their background is this you know curious thing that uh maybe they wouldn't want

62
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:29,960
all of us to look at and uh I heard this story recently of um a zen teacher who

63
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:35,160
um was in her Zen robes very official shaved head you know very serious giving

64
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:41,160
a talk and not realizing that her panties were for set out to dry on a

65
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,720
line behind her so I'm sure righta this probably wasn't what she was imagining

66
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,319
when she was uh giving this talk I'm sure people were kind of looking or something I don't

67
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:59,800
know so there's this way in which sometimes we don't notice things

68
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,720
and in fact this is like a wellestablished phenomenon that uh advertisers and

69
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:13,639
marketers are uh working with and trying to influence with and that is maybe

70
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:19,360
you've had this experience too that um I'll I'll share I had

71
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:26,599
experienced not too long ago where I was um at the shore down there the water and

72
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:32,120
um saw oh look at these these uh this type of uh seashell wow look at this

73
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,560
I've never seen anything like this this is amazing wow this is so

74
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:43,160
great and then when I looked again I thought oh they're everywhere I just

75
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:50,240
hadn't noticed just that when You' really look at something and now your the mind kind of recognizes it then you

76
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:57,319
start to see it everywhere people talk about this like well I think I'm going to buy this particular car and then when

77
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:04,440
you're driving you start to see oh wow okay this car is everywhere but you hadn't really noticed it

78
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:10,599
before this is actually called the B Mina phenomena so I didn't know it actually

79
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:16,599
has a name but there's something interesting that happens here there's

80
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:22,560
this way that there's this cognitive processes that kick in and that are

81
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,440
affecting what we see so there's this one in which we have

82
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:34,159
this itive attention for me when I didn't notice i' had been walking along

83
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:39,200
the water for quite some time before I noticed oh wow look at this and then I

84
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:47,720
started to see there's so much everywhere that when we there's like maybe a a subconsciously maybe decide

85
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:54,760
that something is important noteworthy worthwhile to see before we

86
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:00,480
hadn't made that decision consciously or unconsciously but once we see something

87
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:07,800
and often then it's unconscious we start to see it more and more and more so there's this cognitive process that has

88
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:14,000
decided oh this is important I'm going to notice it

89
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,240
more so then what wasn't seen before all a sudden starts to become

90
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:27,040
seen and then there's this second thing that's happening is this um confirmation

91
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:33,800
bias that we start to believe that something is important so then it must also be prevalent or if it's prevalent

92
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:39,120
it must be important this kind of like link between prevalence and importance

93
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:46,040
gets made and then because we're seeing it more often we start to think like oh this is everywhere everybody thinks this

94
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:53,160
or this must be true just because we tend to be seeing it more often but it's

95
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:59,000
just this confirmation bias this idea that we want because we've decided

96
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:07,839
something is important we want to see it more often so I'm pointing this out just to

97
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:17,240
highlight how the mind has a role and what is like actually what's

98
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:23,120
seen it's not so innocent just this seeing

99
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,880
things not as innocent as we might like to think so we don't see the visual

100
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:35,279
field with as much Fidelity as a camera does for

101
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:44,519
example so there's this way so we might say that just the sense organ meeting the sense

102
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:52,240
object it's kind of like that with the Buddhist language use which would be sensing and maybe we might say seeing is

103
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:58,760
something that the Mind does when the scene is when the mind is

104
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:04,399
in interpreting or analyzing or manipulating or somehow you know working

105
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:11,360
with this data that's coming in through the visual field but we might also notice that

106
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:19,920
there's seeing versus looking it's kind like this subtle

107
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:27,279
difference and so seeing is like this natural effortless sensory

108
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:33,399
experience when the sense or meets the sense object so there's no intentional

109
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:43,079
effort whether it's conscious or unconscious it's just a what just a experience of seeing is

110
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:49,000
happening but looking is a very subtle but it's more

111
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,959
of an intentional like oh I'm what what is going on there and wanting to look so

112
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:02,279
there's more of a focusing in sometimes going for a walk we're just uh

113
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:07,680
we're seeing that there's green plants all around but then like oh wow look at

114
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,880
this look at uh how there's this plant that's growing out of this sidewalk

115
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,920
right here next to this other thing and we stop and kind of look at like wow how did that

116
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:25,920
happen wish I could give you a great example off the top of my head but I don't have one but I think we all have

117
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:32,079
this experience of was that a mouse that was just going by what was said you know looking or

118
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:39,079
something not here not a mouse here I'm see I was thinking about that did happen to me not long ago I was out for a walk

119
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:44,279
I was like a little mouse went by like oh

120
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:52,519
okay so looking is this more intentional directed action whereas seeing is not so

121
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:59,279
much intentional but there's something that can happen if we become sensitive to

122
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:06,160
this shift between seeing and looking there's this way that we can

123
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:13,079
learn something about ourselves what are the types of objects

124
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:20,480
that encourage this shift to really look at for me it was those plants the one

125
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:27,279
that was growing up out of the sidewalk and trying to see it did it come out of this crack or is it related to this

126
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:33,959
other plant over here that you know just trying to understand how it grew like for me it was I kind of

127
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:40,360
like this idea that there's Greenery that can find its way in difficult

128
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:45,519
circumstances you know something beautiful and life I like this notion so

129
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:52,759
there's this idea that I notice these things it uh really it confirms this

130
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:58,320
this preference that I have it's also of course seeing moving

131
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,160
things but when we become aware of the shift

132
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:10,440
between seeing and looking we start to understand ourselves better what is it

133
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:16,079
that causes this looking what do we pause and pay attention

134
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:22,440
to and what don't we what don't we pause and pay attention

135
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:28,519
to so what are the like maybe the thought patterns that we have that uh

136
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:36,120
direct our visual attention oh here's a short little poem

137
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,880
that talks about this by Rosemary

138
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:47,079
traumer and this was H written in February I think February of this year

139
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:54,199
2024 but I'm not exactly sure and it's this poem goes like

140
00:14:54,199 --> 00:15:01,720
this I'm not sure I could say they are beautiful these brittle Brown sink foil

141
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:07,959
stems trembling in the wind though part of me longs to find

142
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:15,120
beauty everywhere ah the longing to see beauty

143
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:23,199
shapes the way I meet the world there seeing this truth beautiful

144
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:29,120
as a Golden Flower so just this recognition oh yeah

145
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:35,399
she's always wanting to see beauty and is oriented towards seeing

146
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:41,079
Beauty and that understanding about herself she finds

147
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:46,120
beautiful and why might it be helpful or beautiful to

148
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:53,199
recognize one's preferences for seeing or what uh one's orientation

149
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:59,519
is because if we have an orientation towards Beauty for example we'll see

150
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:05,319
beauty but we will also see a lot of ugliness because it becomes like this

151
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:11,680
Frame is this beautiful no is this beautiful yes and there becomes a little

152
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:20,040
bit of no there's a little bit of pulling back and yes oh want more

153
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:26,759
of and then our life maybe becomes a little bit smaller because there's a lot of like oh that's not beautiful get out

154
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:32,040
of here and this kind of dismissive not wanting it to be there have this

155
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:38,639
aversion this uh subtle way and like you know we want to bat it away and go find

156
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:46,440
something beautiful for this talk I'm talking about uh visual experiences but you know

157
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,680
this could be with everything but just to have this Insight

158
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:59,800
what is it that causes us to look maybe it's like something Cur ious

159
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:06,160
and maybe we like to see problems or and we like to solve them or maybe it's

160
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:13,240
something that doesn't make sense and we have this bias that we want things to make sense in order for us to feel safe

161
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:19,079
in the world we want to understand it and it should be uh I don't know clear

162
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:24,600
to us so then we spend a lot of our maybe

163
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:31,600
Life Energy and trying to understand things and make sense of things that may maybe it's not worth all our life energy

164
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:41,080
maybe it's uh something that uh it's not understandable like why did uh something

165
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:46,799
or rather happen presumably there's a

166
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:52,799
reason but do we have to spend so much energy trying to figure this

167
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:59,799
out or maybe we tend to really look at things or maybe maybe I'll back up on

168
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:06,280
this or I'll continue on this here I am in the middle I'm noticing how I'm

169
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:12,880
seeing how I I I got stuck there for a little bit having two thoughts in my mind at the same

170
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:21,240
time this idea that maybe we are just noticing as problems because a we like to fix things

171
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:27,520
or we're noticing things that aren't clear because B we feel like we want to understand

172
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:33,039
things where nothing wrong in this but then we might understand like okay how

173
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:40,120
are these patterns affecting our life same problems maybe we want to fix

174
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:46,200
things because we want to be seen as one like okay I can take care of it and perfectly

175
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:52,039
capable and then we kind of get stuck in this identity then we always have to fix

176
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:59,159
things because we're defining ourselves as the one who can fix things or should

177
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:06,200
fix things or maybe we have this idea that I want to understand things because

178
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:13,880
really we're not feeling safe in some kind of way and we're feeling like okay if I understand it better then I I'd

179
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:21,159
feel a little bit more safe i' feel a little bit more comfortable so there's this way in which

180
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:27,440
just seeing this recognition from recognizing the seeing to looking

181
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:34,080
shift can really be a doorway to Greater understanding this something that we do

182
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:42,200
all the time and when we notice it we can also do the shift the opposite way we can go

183
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:48,159
from looking to seeing just like relax the

184
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:54,559
focusing and maybe there's a way there's a little bit of a softing

185
00:19:54,559 --> 00:20:00,240
softening and just allow the scene to happen and the because what happens when

186
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:06,120
we just allow the scene then there's less judging and

187
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:11,280
comparing and evaluating and when there's less

188
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:17,679
comparing judging and evaluating there's more freedom there's more freedom there's more

189
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:24,640
ease I'm not saying that we have to like stop using our intellect and not discern between what's uh harmful and not

190
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:31,600
harmful or what is appropriate and inappropriate or you know what's helpful and not helpful I'm not saying that of

191
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,919
course we still need to be doing that I'm just talking about noticing just

192
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:44,400
like this judging and like oh that's not good enough or how can they do that or who do they

193
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:50,760
think they are or this comparing wow that person is

194
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:55,840
uh taller and that I am or something like

195
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,600
this said from somebody who's not very tall

196
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:07,320
it's for me it's remarkable how we can just notice like this uh the path of

197
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:13,919
practice this movement towards greater Freedom often we can have the sense that okay you have to meditate you have to

198
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:19,720
sit in a meditation posture and has to be a particular way and then you'll gain some

199
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:25,840
insights but what this is pointing to is just your everyday

200
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:32,000
experience we're seeing if we have have Vision whenever the Eyes Are Open well

201
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,679
we can see when the eyes are closed too right we can see the back of the eyelids well I don't know what we see but it's

202
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:44,720
there's something there when I'm closing my eyes I see something so there's this way of that we

203
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:51,600
can have this understanding about actually how our minds create

204
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:58,360
suffering with all this comparing and judging and evaluating which I'm saying is distinct

205
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:06,279
from I'm Discerning what is helpful and not helpful what's wholesome and not wholesome what's helpful what's skillful

206
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:13,799
and what's unskillful we can start to see the role that our mind does because not only is

207
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:20,600
it doing all this judging and comparing it's also making stories like based on

208
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:26,080
what we see there might be a way in which this uh visual

209
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:32,840
cue has uh kind of like Trigg triggers a reaction and then this the reaction

210
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:38,200
could just lead us down this whole thought train into more and more

211
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,880
suffrin there's this way in

212
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:53,039
which this can be really helpful that the visual field can start a thought train a reaction for example if I have

213
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:59,279
to remember to bring something with me when I'm going to go somewhere maybe you guys do this too I put something near

214
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:06,360
the door okay I have to remember I will see this as I'm going to the door and um I'll remember to take it is really

215
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:12,320
helpful but there's also a way in which we can see things and we'll just make

216
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,919
this up oh yeah there's that paperwor on my desk I have to take care of it but I

217
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:24,240
can't take care of that because oh that's that terrible thing that's happened it reminds me of that and I

218
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:30,760
don't want to be reminded of that so I'm not going to take care of this paperwork and then it just keeps on

219
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:37,679
getting later and later and more and more overdue or whatever it might be but

220
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:44,480
and then we start to feel bad like oh I haven't take I haven't taken care of that but I don't want to because then

221
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:51,600
people will know that I didn't X Y or Z and then there's this lowgrade suffering

222
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:57,120
that kind of shows up in our life so these stories that are getting

223
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,600
connected to just paper on the desk or something like

224
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:07,679
this I find myself at a loss tonight to like come up with any interesting

225
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:15,760
anecdotes I'm sure all of you have more interesting examples than the ones that I'm giving where seeing something kind

226
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:23,159
like just starts a whole thought train that uh leads to a sense of unease a

227
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:28,520
sense of dis Qui a sense of like ah

228
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:32,960
this G something like

229
00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:41,520
that so not only do like the stories that often come up after uh we see

230
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:48,279
something are they kind of lead to suffering because they maybe are filled with some of this judging

231
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:54,520
and comparing but it also these stories take

232
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:59,559
us away from the present moment like we're no longer like experiencing our

233
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:05,360
life instead we're off thinking about whatever it is we're thinking well we're

234
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:11,159
just walking past the desk and walking past the desk feels

235
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:17,919
like just a mundane thing why would we pay attention to that but our life is

236
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:24,440
filled with just these mundane activities if we are dismissive just for

237
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:33,240
these ordinary experiences then there's this way in which our life just passes Us by as we

238
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:41,080
more and more are waiting for something titillating or to you know catch our attention Meanwhile we're just lost

239
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:49,240
in stories which you know what are stories they're a dime a dozen they have no you

240
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:54,960
know substance they have uh often they're completely fabricated they have

241
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,240
they start with an experience and off they go

242
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:06,720
and that's not really living life that's being lost in stories and so often we

243
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:14,279
don't even recognize how being lost in stories is harming us often we like to do it because it

244
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:19,640
distracts us or diverts US from some uncomfortable experience but then we

245
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,880
start to become disconnected from our lives and there's this way we kind of

246
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:32,200
start to feel a little bit alienated from our lives and disconnected from it and then we it can grow into being

247
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:39,320
disconnected from others because we're disconnected from ourselves and there's this way in which the stories just

248
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:46,159
really turn out not to be helpful so this shift from looking to

249
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:51,240
seeing is also a way like seeing is something that's happening right now in

250
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:57,880
this present moment I'm seeing something that's black there on I don't even quite sure what it

251
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:04,799
is there on the floor now I know what it is but right just seeing instead of like

252
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:12,200
a big story about it keeping things simple so that's one another way of

253
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,760
seeing it's like recognizing how the mind is really influencing seeing as

254
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:26,240
opposed to sensing sensing I'm trying to be cute that use these letter s sense and C but uh

255
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,919
sensing is maybe we we we could say seeing with the senses and seeing with

256
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:37,279
the mind and then I'd like to talk about one other type of seeing and this is

257
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:44,320
what we might call Insight and that is we might say like seeing through

258
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:50,799
something so not seeing the surface of what something

259
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:58,760
is not even looking at the surface of something is but seeing the quality that

260
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:07,799
it has for in particular qualities that things arise and pass away in the visual

261
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:14,159
field just it's their nature to arise and pass away things are inconstant

262
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:20,840
they're impermanent they're not always there there's this way in which

263
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:27,399
they change and our noticing that they're changing helps uh shifts our

264
00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:32,640
relationship to them are noticing that they're changing

265
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,440
also makes them more it makes them impersonal in the sense of oh this is

266
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:47,159
something that's just uh shifting and changing on its own it doesn't have to mean anything about me as a person it's

267
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:53,360
has its own causes and conditions that made it arise and different causes and

268
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:58,640
conditions that made it pass away and in the same way I'm

269
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:05,840
like this what I take myself to be is also just a collection of these

270
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:11,880
experiences I've been talking about seeing but you know hearing tasting

271
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:19,799
smelling tactile feeling and we could say also thinking as an

272
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:25,799
experience we could say that this insight into a not only the things out

273
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:32,960
there are changing but there's nothing in here that isn't

274
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:40,279
changing everything in here is changing also it's just a collection of

275
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:46,799
experiences and so this way of seeing what we might call Insight is a

276
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:55,240
way that really reduces the suffering and really helps us to find more and more freedom helps us to let go of any

277
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:01,480
clinging that we might have or let go of our um expectations of how things might

278
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,600
be but instead just to

279
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:12,760
recognize the way things are and the way that we can if we can

280
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:18,679
like disengage from our habitual reactivity when we start to see oh

281
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:24,960
they're changing all the time I don't have to make them stay don't it just doesn't make sense to try

282
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:31,080
to hold on to them or make them go away they're shifting and changing already

283
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:39,240
and besides the shifting and changing experiences are all that actually happens there isn't an Essence inside

284
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:45,399
here to Which experiences happen right there's nothing here like

285
00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:50,559
that has a visual experience and then has a hearing experience and then has a

286
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:58,799
tasting experience there's just hearing tasting seeing feeling thinking just collection

287
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:05,799
of experiences that are coming and going and so these two insights can lead

288
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:13,919
to greater and greater Freedom the greatest freedom I would say we have this shift in our

289
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:21,320
understanding or this shift in the way that we see things like oh I see it's

290
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:28,240
not as constant and solid and as I was imagining or thought it was or how I

291
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:34,000
initially perceived it and I'm not as constant and solid as I had been

292
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:42,399
imagining or thinking or perceiving myself so seeing there's just the visual

293
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:49,760
activity of seeing there's the seeing with the Mind recognizing how

294
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:55,720
the mind really does have an influence on what gets perceived and then there's the scene

295
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:02,559
maybe we could say scene through the Insight when we start to see the qualities of experiences no longer lost

296
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:08,399
in the content or just on the surface of what's happening but to see the quality

297
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:16,320
of it arising and passing away so with that I think I'll stop and

298
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,158
open it up to see if there's some questions or

299
00:32:26,639 --> 00:32:29,840
comments okay

300
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:42,880
uh what comes to mind to me is the eyewitness accounts of things

301
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:50,200
are scientifically or empirically proven to be unreliable there you go thank you

302
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:59,200
that's right that's right how would you um deconstruct that yeah so we all have

303
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,559
biases it's kind of what I'm pointing to biases about what's important uh what

304
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:10,240
things mean and how it relates to us so it's impossible to see something

305
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:17,440
actually perfectly clear because there's this uh the I'm using this word biases

306
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:23,080
that we have so it's relates to like it's not it's actually not possible for

307
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:28,120
a human brain to see something in the same way that a camera does

308
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:35,480
even though we think that we are and this is why we like to fight about what's actually there because we're so convinced that what I saw is actually

309
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:43,200
the truth I don't know what you saw you must have been somewhere else but what I saw is the truth just not recognized and it's actually not possible for to be

310
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:50,440
completely a like a camera thank you

311
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:55,600
s anybody else have a comment or

312
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,799
question I got another quick okay um when we go into a museum we we

313
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:09,839
see art right we maybe we browse through and we see art and then something in US

314
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:17,200
tells us well I want to go look at that piece of art so I think looking when you're

315
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:23,440
looking at something maybe you're activating more things in your brain that you're

316
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:29,118
connecting with or you're um interested to learn about or to to look closer at

317
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:36,040
so I guess I I think of seeing as a um just a quick overview yeah and then

318
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:41,480
looking is something that you're you're using to investigate something yeah yeah I would say

319
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:48,079
investigate and I would say that uh art in particular we we could say that art

320
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:53,760
has a um is a part of a language that well maybe I don't have to go that far

321
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:59,160
but to say there's a resonance some pieces like oh we can feel a little stirring in ourselves and then we want

322
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:06,079
to go look so then we could uh just get curious like what are the types of things that I feel this stirring and

323
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:12,440
want to go look right is the ugly things or is it the confusing things is it the beautiful things or I don't know

324
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:19,400
something like this thank you so back

325
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:31,760
there so would you say that when we're seeing or looking the Lesser

326
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:37,760
filter we have like the less filter that we have within us you know in our

327
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:43,000
perception would be we' see trer we'd look

328
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:52,359
trer yeah this word true right uh let's see so the less filter we have yes but I

329
00:35:52,359 --> 00:36:01,240
think it's not possible for humans to have zero filter but I think the power here is recognizing what are our

330
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:06,280
filters what what what are we oriented toward what are what biases do we have

331
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:13,960
when we look at things what uh catches our attention and looks at thank

332
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:26,400
you thank you so so I was reminded of of um Shakespeare and like much to do about

333
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:32,200
nothing right where when when you watch a play you as the audience

334
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:40,040
know information you have information right dramatic irony that the characters don't have and you watch them unfold

335
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:46,440
this drama that has to do with their perception what they see what they overhear what they think they hear and

336
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:53,200
you're sort of caught in the story and you know at the end you're like wow boy if they had only known this right they

337
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,400
don't know the whole story and that's why they are you know kind of stuck in this suffering you know if you wanted to

338
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:05,119
put it into that that context and you know sometimes it resolves well like a much I do about nothing you know it's a

339
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:10,920
comedy and so at the end everything gets resolved and all the misunderstandings are solved and you

340
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:16,800
know the bad you know there's one bad guy and he gets caught and whatever and then sometimes you know Merchant of

341
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:24,280
Venice it ends up very poorly for a lot of people you know and it's kind of the same right so you know it it can be

342
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:29,920
dangerous and it you know sometimes it can be comedic and we can learn from it so anyway that's what I was drawn to I

343
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:36,079
don't know others thought about it like that yeah yeah thank you right I mean this the human life is filled with this

344
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:42,480
right a lot of there's even how many movies are like he said she said kind of versions too right or something like

345
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:50,040
this yeah yeah misunderstandings misunderstandings but it can be I was thinking about uh one thing about Vision

346
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:56,720
which is also the same for hearing is to notice the scene to looking because when we that's like can be a way in which we

347
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:03,400
can notice what what are the things that we catch us the same thing could be happening for hearing and listening

348
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:11,760
right so yeah thank you anybody else have a comment

349
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:21,440
thanks so so a lot of interesting ideas here

350
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:27,720
um in my experience the Dilemma has been

351
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:35,280
on one hand being very very aware of cognitive biases

352
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:42,200
and filter of our perception and leaning very heavily on

353
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:49,640
that at the cost of invalidating or perhaps challenging

354
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:55,079
my own beliefs and perceptions and so I wonder if you have

355
00:38:55,079 --> 00:39:01,319
thoughts on navigating that line between

356
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:06,880
acknowledging the limitation of our views and biases and you know the way we

357
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:12,599
filter and look for particular um things on one hand but on

358
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:19,560
the other hand um not gaslighting ourselves it's it's a tricky uh

359
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:25,200
something I've really struggled with so often what I let's see if I

360
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:31,440
understand this what your what you're point to here is if we have this idea that okay I want to find out what's true

361
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:37,760
and what's right maybe I'll just use this word true then we're like okay well I know I have some cognitive bises but

362
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,839
then like what's true but instead if we hold things like well this is my current

363
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:50,200
understanding this is what makes sense to me this is my hypothesis so our views if we just not hold them tightly just

364
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:57,079
like you know this is what makes sense to me instead of insisting okay this is true it's like okay this is what I think

365
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:02,400
how is and then we're not lost always trying to find what's right we're not

366
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:10,240
yeah trying to find what's the most true the least biased because like is of

367
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:16,880
course we don't want to be biased in a way that's harmful especially but there's I don't it's not possible for

368
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:22,839
humans to be completely see things completely

369
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:30,160
true even though we want to we want to think that we can and we want to think that we are and those other people

370
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:36,359
aren't is this helpful yeah I think

371
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:44,760
so I guess um so if yeah so if if none of the

372
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:51,560
beliefs or views we have are necessarily true uh at some point we have to act on

373
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:58,720
beliefs or make decisions based on our perceptions yeah and

374
00:40:58,839 --> 00:41:05,480
yeah either you act you act on a decision or you act on a perception or belief that

375
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:10,960
is it could be wildly different two options and

376
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,400
and but we we do like but it's like okay well this is my current understanding

377
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:26,000
this is what makes sense instead of saying this is true saying like this all the data I have supports this view this

378
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,800
is what I'm going to make a decision based on this we may never know whether it's actually yeah true or so I guess

379
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:40,720
maybe maybe the question then is the value of uh questioning those beliefs so if something feels and uh

380
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:48,000
appears true or uh reliable uh the value of really

381
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:54,160
heavily questioning those beliefs and uh perceptions you on one hand that can be

382
00:41:54,160 --> 00:42:00,920
very helpful in seeing more clearly on the the other hand the danger can be um

383
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:09,000
like I said gaslighting or nihilism right like nothingness yeah yeah so denying a Truth uh that may be very um

384
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:16,760
protective for example I'm sorry denying denying a belief that may be very protective

385
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:24,640
oh I think um denying a belief that may be very

386
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:30,800
protective or or or aggressively challenging a very deeply held belief oh

387
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:37,119
here we go are we talking about somebody else's beliefs or our own our own

388
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:42,559
yeah I think our own it's to to uh

389
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:47,920
question it I think it's fantastic actually like am I sure about this yeah

390
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:54,839
I I think so and then just recognize you know when more data comes in we may change our mind or something like this I

391
00:42:54,839 --> 00:43:00,000
think there's real value and looking at our beliefs

392
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:08,920
yeah interesting yeah thank you you're welcome you're welcome okay so I wish you a wonderful

393
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:16,839
rest of the evening and that's at the right temperature thank you
