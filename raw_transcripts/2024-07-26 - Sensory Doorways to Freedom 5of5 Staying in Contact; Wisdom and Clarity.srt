00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,119
up early to meditate Taste of a last sip of coffee

13
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:27,420
or tea before we settle [Music]

14
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:35,880
in and noticing too the weight weight of your body on the cushion or bed or

15
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:42,720
chair this feeling of being rooted settled in the

16
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,399
moment and then when you're ready allowing the eyes to

17
00:01:52,399 --> 00:02:01,600
soften become receptive and turning your gaze inward

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,160
can be helpful to take a couple two or three longer slower deeper

19
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,720
breaths into the

20
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:23,360
belly and releasing releasing the

21
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:31,840
breath letting go of any tension along with it

22
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,519
and then allowing the breathing to be natural

23
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,879
normal closing the eyes when you're

24
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:03,440
ready and scan rning through your

25
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:12,720
body noticing the sensations of air or clothing on [Music]

26
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:19,159
skin the amount of moisture or dryness in the

27
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,040
air warmth they

28
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:35,319
cool and then letting the tensions settle more deeply inward in teros

29
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:41,480
setion to the aliveness of your

30
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,200
body perhaps rolling your shoulders and inviting any excess

31
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:59,799
tension in the muscles of the neck and shoulders to release

32
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:10,799
softening the eyes even more softening the

33
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:17,880
tongue allowing the tip of the tongue to rest on the palet just behind your teeth

34
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,359
top of your

35
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:34,039
mouth allowing the spine all the way from the base of the skull

36
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:39,800
through the sacrum to

37
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:45,039
relax and also be

38
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:53,400
steady allowing the muscles around your

39
00:04:53,400 --> 00:05:01,599
core to be easeful trusting the bones

40
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:29,840
allowing the core of your body to be known the viscera

41
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,039
the Motions of breathing in your abdomen belly

42
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,400
diaphragm rib

43
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:59,319
cage bringing awareness to the hips and buttocks the weight of the body

44
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:23,880
and allowing awareness to fill the legs and feet from the inside out not the concept

45
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:34,199
of legs and feet with the internal feeling

46
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,199
pulsing

47
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,560
aliveness vibration or

48
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,240
Stillness being in

49
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:01,319
contact with the aliveness of your whole body

50
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,560
nothing left out

51
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:52,240
and then as you are in contact with this whole

52
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:58,360
body inviting the whole body to relax

53
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:09,479
and then inviting to may this heart and mind be clear open

54
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:22,599
soft and the tuning tuning in to mindful

55
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:28,000
awareness at the Forefront of your attention

56
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,959
staying in contact with each

57
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:45,120
breath each sound each sensation

58
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,480
simply noticing the beginning

59
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:06,480
the very Inception of a breath sensation or

60
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:17,880
sound and allowing it to move through with all the

61
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:24,440
[Music] variations flowing through perhaps to the swell of the

62
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,640
breath of fullness

63
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:43,120
and then the release fading away of air or sound or

64
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
sensation and contact all the way through to that moment of

65
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,959
Stillness that space between

66
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:35,880
staying closed allowing experience sensory

67
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:43,200
experience to flow through unobscured

68
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:51,920
unimpeded relax allowing and

69
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:03,399
receiving we'll practice mostly in silence with an occasional prompt

70
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240

106
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:17,000
back over these moments of

107
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:24,399
practice with loving appreciation

108
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:33,640
kindness including any challenges there possibilities for being Stepping

109
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:41,559
Stones rather than obstacles with

110
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,600
generosity and [Music] then gathering

111
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:55,200
in savoring soaking [Music]

112
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,120

kindness letting them nourish your heart and mind

115
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,640
and from that place casting that internal gaze outwards to the others

116
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,159
this life

117
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:45,240

123
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:26,120
Liberation wisdom and peace in the world

124
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,569
[Music]

125
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,679
thank you for your presence and your

126
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,039
practice

127
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,960
e e

128
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:14,159
so warm greetings everyone warm greetings and thank you for your

129
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:21,840
practice I'm curious as um we start to settle into the Dharma talk portion of

130
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:28,600
this morning together what you noticed in your sensory doorway practice

131
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:35,000
yesterday what did you notice would love to see in the

132
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:48,519
chat which senses were most helpful in helping you stay present what

133
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:53,559
did you notice in the spaces were the difference between

134
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:59,840
being in the senses and in the mind

135
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:22,760
a slowing down and opening up of time beautiful yeah I think many people

136
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:29,760
notice that difference in internal acceleration versus the face of actual

137
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,320
sensory

138
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,360
experience any

139
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:47,880
others noticing happily

140
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:55,440
beautiful tuning into what's left of a sense very powerful the

141
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,840
fleeting quality bear attention

142
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:10,000
peacefulness and quiet with young ones young grandchildren and a sense of

143
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:18,039
Attunement with other creatures I love reading these These are

144
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:24,360
great so because of the lag I'm not going to be able to read all of them as I continue but as I promised yesterday I

145
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:30,279
will read all of them once I'm done talking I love learning about the vibrancy

146
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:36,880
aliveness [Music] tenderness all of it grounding centering

147
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,960
that you're experiencing and today as I promised

148
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:47,880
yesterday we're going to play in the deep end of the pool of sensory doorway

149
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:55,120
practice and I want to start with an image this is an simile from the ancient

150
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:03,720
teachings the Buddha talks about imagining pure light coming into a window at Sunrise

151
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:09,480
open clear clean window panes and that if there's no clutter in

152
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:17,878
the house no furniture it lands on the far wall the Western Wall

153
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:23,638
unobscured beautiful the Buddha said that when

154
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:29,560
Faith confidence settledness in the practice are

155
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:36,919
deep practice of the senses can be like this in other words the five sense

156
00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:43,118
faculties become like those clear window panes for awareness

157
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:50,398
itself so when Clarity that kind of Simplicity

158
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:57,079
exists by directly experiencing the senses its possibility for wisdom to

159
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:05,440
arise it's possible to know the difference between the contact of a sense object

160
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:15,079
like a bit of light with your retina and to notice that simply with simple

161
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:21,119
cognizance vanana it's called and that all of this happens a split second

162
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:26,800
before any evaluation any evaluation of pleasant

163
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:34,040
unpleasant or new Neal V that we talked about yesterday and that that is often a clue

164
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:40,800
a way of loosening any hook not what the Buddha called

165
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:47,000
Fetter sometimes shows up as resistance that might

166
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,839
arise so this is useful because it stops the

167
00:35:52,839 --> 00:35:59,160
mind and heart from cascading to all kinds of other unhelpful stuff and I I'll give you very simple example so

168
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:06,280
back during covid lockdown shelter in place I was um doing a lot of these

169
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:11,839
online Retreats at home um my job had a spurl because of the kind of work we were

170
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:19,640
doing and um I was practicing walking meditation in my living room which looked out over a back porch that was

171
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:26,240
basically mine but the neighbors who owned to the place um would access it occasionally and I was doing Simple

172
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:32,280
walking there beautiful morning light striking I noticed this big pile of

173
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:41,040
clutter my neighbor had left on the porch or so I thought like I noticed the

174
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:46,680
light striking something and unpleasant come up conditioned by past experience

175
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:51,880
with the neighbor memory and a split second later the Mind parched

176
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:57,839
that object dis clutter and then I could see the story

177
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:03,480
arising about the neighbor and the grumpiness not huge grumpiness but mild

178
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:08,520
grumpiness but what was so fascinating was I turned and of course my walking

179
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:13,599
path took me right back that by that window again and oh my goodness what I

180
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:20,720
thought was quter it was actually something else so I say all of this

181
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:28,440
because the act of perceiving itself that moment moment of catching

182
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:34,839
the unpleasant allowed me to have a little more space from the evaluation and the

183
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:42,079
judgments and to see the process of that very clearly and it also allowed me to see

184
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:47,800
that our preconceived notions our memories our attitudes our

185
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:53,800
biases our views can actually shape how we see and even what we see and this is

186
00:37:53,800 --> 00:38:01,760
true for the other senses as well so in this case aversion came up in

187
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:08,880
other cases it might be desire or resistance or um any host of other sort

188
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:16,119
of secondary emotions Envy or um Shaden fra

189
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:25,599
or appreciative Joy whatever's there so in Buddhist teachings often

190
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:31,680
noticing this link between Pleasant and unpleasant the contact of our senses Pleasant and unpleasant and the next

191
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:37,160
thing is often taught as simple greed or aversion and that's

192
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:43,920
absolutely true these are very basic responses but the Buddha also taught

193
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,119
this about emotions so in a way today is emotions

194
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:56,720
2.1 we talked about them earlier in the week but um the Buddha taught in

195
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:05,760
particular about the difference between householder or hooked emotions and Dharma emotions emerging

196
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,920
renunciation emotions and they fall into three basic

197
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:16,720
categories of sadness or grief joy and

198
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:22,800
equinity and the um sadness or grief I'll just touch on very briefly because

199
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:29,960
we talked about working with it a little bit earlier this week and that is the difference a a hooked sadness or grief

200
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:38,160
is sadness or grief that arises in conjunction with what comes up

201
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:43,680
in the senses by grabbing onto it so the true

202
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:48,960
sadness for example of loss about hearing or seeing that happens naturally

203
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,119
for many of us as we age so that's not to denigrate it it's

204
00:39:54,119 --> 00:40:03,079
truly there but rather than allowing it to inform and shape and

205
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:11,000
um become a problem the Buddha talks about not using the second Arrow not

206
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,240
adding on piling on extra extra grief

207
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:23,319
extra attitude extra judgment with any of it but rather rather than obsessing

208
00:40:23,319 --> 00:40:29,040
over something being with it kind L turning

209
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:34,920
to the body holding softly with love

210
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:43,480
awareness and then Shifting the term he uses is by by

211
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:49,920
relying on this abandon that allowing any sense of grief or

212
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:57,440
sadness to inspire motivate

213
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:03,520
our practice to let go of any ways we make things worse any sadness that makes

214
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:10,599
things worse any um involvement or entangling and rather

215
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:17,040
shift to a longing or wish or

216
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,640
commitment to letting go to being

217
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:28,599
free and then relying on that to allow

218
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:33,680
simple Joys simple Joys to inform us the simple

219
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:39,880
joys of what's left in my visual capacity I used to have eagle eyes and

220
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:48,480
now I wear glasses almost all the time unless I'm this close to a screen but appreciating what's there and

221
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:53,960
there's so much good and nothing wrong with simple joy from being present with

222
00:41:53,960 --> 00:42:03,200
the senses turning to towards that however the Buddha does

223
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:09,839
recommend not becoming hooked with them and all of us are hooked at some point

224
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:15,839
all of us are hooked at some point but to notice when that hook arises that fetcher

225
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:21,240
arises if there's grasping towards something pleasant you

226
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:28,040
may notice it actually decreases the pleasantness of it and it might decrease the joy too

227
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:33,319
it's hard to experience Joy fully when hanging on really

228
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:38,599
tight so this kind of hooked Joy is a greed need for more the planning the

229
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:44,880
protecting the defending the hanging on and

230
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:50,880
instead the suggestion is to savor and

231
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,640
allow savoring and allowing means it can be transient and even appreciating the

232
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:02,119
moment of transient change and then the Buddha

233
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:09,400
describes that kind of Joy the joy of non-grasping emergent Joy of being

234
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:17,079
present as Dharma Joy renunciation Joy this can mature into the joy of insight

235
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:22,880
itself clear seeing the way we surfed the senses

236
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:28,319
earlier this week the non clinging

237
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:35,520
itself the presence itself can be a source of

238
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:43,359
Joy the last emotion he talks about is equinity and how equinity can be

239
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:52,319
specific to a particular experience a particular sense experience of object of

240
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:59,520
sound striking the ear for example or it can be more General a

241
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:04,720
general sense trust in the practice of okayness

242
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:13,280
equipoise allowing and how while both kinds of equanimity are helpful the second kind

243
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:20,880
is onward leading portable useful and by relying on that equinity

244
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:28,200
eventually it's possible to let go of identification and

245
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:35,680
instead rely on non- craving non-c conceit not having

246
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:42,440
a need to construct anything at all from sensory experience but rather resting

247
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:49,880
there and eventually that kind of non- clinging opens a practitioner up to the

248
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:58,880
most beautiful of spaces absences and joys of all nibana Nirvana freedom

249
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:04,680
I'll close by saying the Buddha had another simile about window

250
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:11,559
panes and that is Imagine That Pure Morning Light flowing through the

251
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:16,880
window but rather than striking a wall on the other side there's no wall and

252
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:22,880
there's no ground the light just keeps going pure

253
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:29,040
beautiful radiant and that is one of of his similes for

254
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:37,160
awakening nothing there to obscure so thank you very much this week

255
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:42,720
for your wonderful attention your practice your exploration of this with

256
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:50,079
me and to say that I spoke of the full path of practice very briefly today that

257
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:57,440
these moments of quiet space Joy Simplicity every single moment is on W

258
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:06,160
leading like drops in a bowl fill the bowl with water so trust them enjoy them

259
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:12,520
Savor them and trust your practice thank you it's been a delight

260
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:20,759
