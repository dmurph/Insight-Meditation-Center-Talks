1
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,639
hello everyone welcome

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,799
and to begin

3
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,960
there's a variety of turns of phrases or

4
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:35,760
expressions that convey something very important about dharma practice

5
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,760
and one of them is that um

6
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:54,000
maybe we're not focusing on changing our experience as much as increasing our capacity

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,559
for experience expanding our capacity

8
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:06,560
for being with discomfort expanding our capacity to be with

9
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,200
comfort with pleasure with joy

10
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,320
increasing our capacity to be with challenging emotions

11
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,560
increasing our capacity to be with beautiful emotions this idea of

12
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,159
being able to have to hold or to

13
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:36,560
make space for our emotional experience

14
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:44,240
if we have very little capacity then we become easily reactive or shut down

15
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:52,320
or try to run away or collapse all kinds of things

16
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,840
and if we have a capacity to hold anger without

17
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,560
acting on the anger hold sadness hold

18
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:13,599
despair hold emotional pain it's a radically different thing to make

19
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:23,640
room for to hold it and what this means is not to be defined by it not to be

20
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,879
constricted by it not to be pushed around by it

21
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:35,280
not to be necessarily before or against it you're not kind of caught in its

22
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,360
in its in its grip or caught in its you know making it into something but

23
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:50,040
rather allowing it to be there and and even very intense

24
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:56,720
and sorrows to just kind of keep opening keep relaxing well i can relax with this too

25
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,959
this too even though there might be tension as part of it sometimes there's a greater capacity of awareness of the

26
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:09,360
heart of the body to hold it to make room for it to expand

27
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,480
beyond it to allow it to be there

28
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,959
so with that in mind maybe we'll sit today meditate today

29
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:28,879
with the uh not with changing anything not with

30
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,519
probing anything but rather opening to

31
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:42,159
everything opening our capacity to hold to be present to make a room for

32
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,360
so to begin

33
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,599
to have a posture that for you and your way

34
00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:00,799
the posture that is stable strong open enough

35
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:10,439
so that you can bring a capacity to be with challenges and joys

36
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,160
the body is a great help for this capacity building

37
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,199
and gently closing your eyes

38
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,960
and to check in with yourself sitting here right now

39
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,759
respectfully respecting yourself as you are

40
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,160
what is your capacity right now some people are

41
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,880
stressed some people have difficult life situations going on some people

42
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:06,479
have illnesses all kinds of things can happen that might limit our capacity

43
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:12,000
to be with new challenges or even new joys which are energetic or

44
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,520
challenging demanding and to recognize that's the case

45
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:26,400
to do that with respect with care with love this is how it is now

46
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,000
maybe your capacity feels bigger maybe it's a time in your life where

47
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,759
things are settled and peaceful and you've had lots of rest and so you feel

48
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:49,720
like you're now you have lots of room and respect that

49
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,440
and then to take a few long slow deep gentle breaths

50
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:19,280
as if you're breathing through it all breathing through your capacity to hold

51
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,840
your experience

52
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:44,880
as the body as your breathing exhales to relax

53
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,600
soften

54
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,639
to let your breathing return to normal

55
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,759
and gently without ambition

56
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,680
as you breathe see if you can

57
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,120
spread waves of calming calmness

58
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,680
through your body

59
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:08,160
see if you could also let there be a calming of the mind as

60
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,240
you maybe as you exhale

61
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,720
the quieting of your thinking

62
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,839
settling into your breathing

63
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,560
and as you inhale

64
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,399
be present for the full length of the inhale

65
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:21,040
as if deep as you breathe in and the lungs

66
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,279
fill with air the chest expands

67
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,560
as if you're expanding

68
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:39,120
the boundaries of your body is if you're opening up and becoming

69
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,120
larger

70
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,440
whatever you're experiencing as you sit here

71
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:55,920
rather than changing anything open up more fully to experience it make

72
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,720
room for it

73
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,040
whatever is happening recognize it's happening

74
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:17,720
and allow it to be there as if it has a lot of room

75
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,079
whatever is happening physically in the body

76
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:34,360
emotionally mentally in the mind

77
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,199
allow yourself to become bigger than the experience

78
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:36,079
whatever is happening whatever way you get distracted or involved in thoughts

79
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:43,120
or feelings body sensations you can gently say

80
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,480
this too you're open to

81
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,680
this too you will allow and breathe

82
00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:00,759
breathe with it making room for it

83
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,360
so

84
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:13,360
and as we come to the end of this sitting

85
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:23,200
is there some way that silence supports a greater capacity

86
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,600
to be with all experience

87
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:36,480
a certain kind of silence of mind silence of heart

88
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:44,360
the silence of the space around us

89
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:24,480
and is there some way that a healthy inner silence or stillness

90
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:31,120
can give you a greater capacity for being with the joys and sorrows of

91
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,520
others

92
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:43,200
a capacity to accompany others

93
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,120
in their challenges and their celebrations

94
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:07,760
and in that greater capacity to be with people to share with people

95
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,640
their joys and sorrows

96
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:21,279
maybe it's easier to tap into

97
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:29,360
feelings of care and good will love

98
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:35,200
kindness

99
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:45,519
may it be that our capacity to be present for all experience

100
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:53,000
makes room for our love and kindness and our friendliness

101
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:00,880
everyone that we encounter may it be that our practice

102
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:07,600
this morning is for the welfare and happiness of others

103
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,720
and our own may all

104
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:21,559
beings be happy may all beings be safe

105
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,880
may all beings be peaceful

106
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,600
may all beings be free

107
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:46,819
[Music]

108
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:59,039
thank you so on this fifth uh talk

109
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:05,080
on becoming wise with emotion towards emotions

110
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:12,559
i want to talk a little bit about uh attention to the source of our emotions

111
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:20,880
now where they the emotions arise from and now certainly there are layers of

112
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,720
sources from within and a little bit i talked about that yesterday

113
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:33,840
is that certain emotions might have other emotions that are the source for it or that immediate

114
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:41,039
predecessor for it anger might be hurt or fear

115
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:48,159
joy might be vary the source within it within us

116
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:56,480
it might be uh praise to our conceit and we're so energized joyfully about that

117
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:02,720
or it might be this delightful sense of freedom or ease

118
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,840
that comes when conceit disappears

119
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:15,320
and um when it's not there and um

120
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:21,600
and so but the in the teachings of the buddha there's a

121
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:27,840
distinction between two sources or two kinds of

122
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:33,840
emotional lives and one is

123
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:39,440
i like to call dharmic and the other we call

124
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:46,799
non-dharmic some people might call it spiritual and worldly some people call it um

125
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:53,200
yeah you know there's a variety of things they call this but at the heart of the buddhist teachings on mindfulness

126
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,399
is this distinction between that which belongs to the sensual world

127
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:04,159
and that which belongs something deeper that is the non-sensual world

128
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:11,519
and spiritual and non-spiritual it's not it's not a a criticism or a denigrating

129
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:17,840
of the what's maybe non-spiritual or that which is essential

130
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:24,000
but there is a distinction between uh that which um uh

131
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,480
emotions to get they get triggered by our reactivity

132
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,840
and those emotions that um are not

133
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:43,679
not arising reactively to something but rather emerge flow through us

134
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:49,200
arise out of us almost almost independent of the conditions

135
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:56,000
around us so if i am in a hurry to get somewhere driving

136
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,519
somewhere and someone is driving really slow

137
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:08,638
my eagerness my strong desire to get someplace is frustrated

138
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:14,240
and i might then get angry or get afraid reacting to the person who's driving

139
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:21,358
slow another situation same situation i might be trying to go somewhere maybe i need

140
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:26,480
to get there on time but i'm driving in a relaxed open way

141
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,760
someone's driving slow and and i see it and i say oh someone's

142
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:40,398
driving slow and looks like someone who maybe is old and and uh is you know just trying to

143
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:46,960
drive carefully and so i let it be and i use it in this occasion just to

144
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:52,079
relax and in that relaxation that just be the being of the situation there's

145
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:58,960
now room more deeply that i'm not reacting to anything but there's a feeling of contentment or

146
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,320
feeling of gratitude for the day and the sky and

147
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,680
and things like that there might be a sense of uh care and

148
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:16,640
love for the person in the driving slow and um and i don't uh i'm not

149
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:23,680
it's not being triggered by what's out there it's just kind of a of a natural kind of upwelling

150
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,960
of warmth for someone who's driving carefully and caring for them

151
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:35,359
um there we sit and meditate and we might feel

152
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:42,160
like we're you know very ambitious to get really deeply concentrated right away

153
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:49,680
and and that ambition to get you know and maybe we have a bad feeling for ourselves we feel like we've somehow

154
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:55,359
um don't succeed very well in things in our lives and meditation is supposed to help us

155
00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:02,400
and it's supposed to be an alternative to the challenges of life but i have to be successful in meditation and then

156
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:08,000
we're not we're not getting concentrated and so that already there's a built up tension

157
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:15,520
behind doing the meditation and so when meditation is not going successfully we react to that we get

158
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:23,280
angry at meditation angry at ourselves angry at buddhism you know angry at the world

159
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,480
reacting there there's on the surface more i think of more the surface level of who

160
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:34,880
we are um we're carrying the tensions and stresses emotional physical mental

161
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:40,720
and those stresses when they're touched by by the world

162
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:47,040
they get triggered when when we have a great capacity

163
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:52,880
and lots of space and ability to be open to be relaxed to be present and

164
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,800
without those surface tensions stresses then uh

165
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:05,359
in for someone who's really mature in this practice there are no triggers

166
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:11,359
the things occur and they don't so when if we hold up our my in buddhism this

167
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:18,480
idea of holding up conceit and something comes along that threatens that conceit there's like a collision

168
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:25,520
and then there's a reaction to it if there's no conceit something comes along and criticizes us and you know

169
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:32,400
normally maybe it doesn't hit our conceit it just goes right through

170
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:39,680
but that's going right through that capacity to not be caught not be reactive not have

171
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:46,160
something up there that inside that the world hits um makes room

172
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:51,200
for the upwelling of a lot of wonderful emotions there's

173
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:56,720
an upwelling of healing upwelling of movement towards harmony movement

174
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:03,359
towards unification there's an upwelling of contentment or peace

175
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:10,560
sometimes joy and happiness and these are these there's this that

176
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:15,839
which is up that wells up uh is not reactive

177
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:24,400
that is what's dharmic dharmic emotions dharmic feelings are those that arise in the space

178
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,599
uh where kind of an empty space in a certain kind of way empty of

179
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,960
of tension and empty of holding on to certain emotions

180
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:40,000
empty and having certain kinds of demands on the situation or expectations

181
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,480
or cravings or ambitions or oh a strong sense of self that we're

182
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:52,560
protecting or hiding or something and so uh the dharmic

183
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:58,079
emotions are those that they're kind of non-dharmic are the ones that arise when there's a collision with

184
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,359
something hard inside of us the the non

185
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:08,400
the the that's the non-dharmic the dharmic is when there's nothing in there

186
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:14,160
and there's space and things can go right through but more importantly there's space for

187
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:20,000
things to well up and the classic analogy for this similarly for it

188
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:27,520
is that of a mountain lake where there's no rivers or rain that fills the lake

189
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:32,800
it's getting completely refreshed from an underground uh fount underground spring that's

190
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:40,480
welling up from the bottom of the lake spreading this fresh water throughout the lake so in the same way this uh

191
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:46,400
we're not getting um we're not depending on input from the world around us

192
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:52,320
uh the rivers coming into the lake and we're not depending on the rain all

193
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,839
the thoughts and ideas we have in the mind in order to

194
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:03,599
have this upwelling but rather there's more like a subtleness

195
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:09,359
a relaxation a real sense of presence attention to

196
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:15,119
here and then an upwelling of

197
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:20,960
of uh has a chance to arise we have within us a tremendous capacity

198
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,960
dharma capacity for a flow for a naturalness

199
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:32,000
of positive emotions things like love and care and joy and

200
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,640
contentment gratitude um delight glad

201
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:43,920
compassion [Music] beautiful beautiful states

202
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:49,920
and but they're not states that we make happen reactively

203
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:56,880
they are almost like a gift that comes when we our capacity

204
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:04,000
to be present is expansive and open and we're patient and available

205
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,240
without the is stirring up or the agitation

206
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:16,560
of reactivity of a lot of desires that are pushing us around a lot of aversion pushing us

207
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:23,839
around there's a subtleness happening so this distinction between those

208
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:30,319
emotions that are born out of our reactivity and those that emotions that arise from

209
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:36,240
a deeper upwelling that's n is not a react reaction

210
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:42,640
but it is more like the um the innate capacity of our systems

211
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:47,920
psychophysical system to express itself to manifest something

212
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:55,119
that is responsive and in harmony with our environment and with what's happening

213
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:01,599
so i don't know how well i i've articulated this but i think maybe well enough this distinction

214
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:08,079
to maybe give you something to reflect on this weekend

215
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:14,960
to think a little bit about the source of the different emotions that come through over the next few days

216
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:20,560
are the emotions more reactive emotions even the joyful ones are they reacting

217
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:26,480
to something um that's happening in the world so that uh it's you know it's touching some

218
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:33,280
hitting something inside there that then just um reacts

219
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:39,520
or is there an upwelling is there a naturalness is there a kind of a

220
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:45,359
almost as if you're getting out of the way and something wells up

221
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:50,640
dharmic joy dharmic happiness that

222
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:55,839
doesn't depend on the conditions of the world

223
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:01,599
reactive emotions depend on the conditions of the world and

224
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:07,119
and the world being ourselves as well the dharmic are those which are

225
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:12,400
independent non-dependent in a certain kind of way

226
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,960
so um

227
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:26,319
so then uh one announcement that some of you might be interested at in a

228
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:31,760
few weeks a couple weeks at july 9th

229
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:37,920
through insight retreat center we're going to have a day-long retreat

230
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:43,680
online on zoom and that i'll be teaching and if some of you would like to kind of

231
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:48,960
continue this in a deeper way then

232
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:55,440
you know for a day long you can go probably to the uh insightretreatcenter.org website

233
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:03,440
or at some point in the next while it'll probably be announcement about this on the imc website too on the what's new

234
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:10,400
so um thank you all and

235
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:19,200
and i was thinking that maybe on next monday next week maybe to continue with this theme of emotions but maybe to go

236
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:25,520
through and choose five different emotions to consider and reflect on how to practice

237
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:32,480
with and what we've been talking about this week might apply to particular situations

238
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,760
so thank you
