00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,480
hi everyone and welcome

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,559
this evening i want to talk about

3
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:20,880
the topic of resolve and maybe resolve is a

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,919
burdensome concept like you have to work at something

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,840
the ancient word for it is aditana

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,520
one person translates it one book translated as the foundation

7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,559
the the word can mean some literally can mean

8
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:50,239
something like closer to the english words to take a stand or to stand in something

9
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,680
or a special place to stand

10
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:03,039
so it's a place where we kind of come out of take our stand stand on or supported by

11
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:14,880
and um part of the value of this resolve

12
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,320
some people translated as a vow or aspiration

13
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:26,320
is that to the degree to which buddhist practice

14
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:33,920
encourages us to let go deeply or brings us to a place where the

15
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,600
ordinary idea of self is not operating so much

16
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,360
or where brings us to a place where we have

17
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:52,240
we no longer can live with some of the values we've been living with before some of the orientations or purposes of

18
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,240
our life that we had before it's easy to feel disoriented it's easy

19
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,520
to feel a certain kind of what's the purpose or

20
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,959
how do i orient myself now the buddha said once you know nothing

21
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,800
whatsoever is worth clinging to

22
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,840
well if nothing's worth clinging to and i've been clinging my whole life to something or

23
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,480
other to be motivated to know what to do then what do i do when i don't cling do

24
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:33,040
i just sit at home on the couch you know what what do i do

25
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:40,400
and so in this kind of context buddhism offers

26
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,959
resolves aspirations vows a certain kind of orientation way to live in the world

27
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:53,120
that can guide us can support us could be a place to stand a standing place

28
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,120
orientation a foundation for ourselves and um

29
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,720
and in our early buddhist tradition there are four resolves

30
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,239
that are taught and that is to stay close to these these

31
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:16,719
can guide us these can support us so when in doubt

32
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:24,239
live with these resolves and i think of them as being so important such a good foundation or

33
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,959
place to come from that if someone asks you

34
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:38,239
you know what do you do i think in modern english basically they're asking you what what's your work

35
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:44,480
i think that's what they mean it's almost almost anonymous

36
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:52,720
but i think sometimes in our modern society his career and work is kind of overrated

37
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,840
sometimes sometimes people's sense of worth comes from the worth comes from the work they

38
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,319
do or their status or their what you know their

39
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:11,920
their the appreciation that people think oh this person's special is because of the work they do

40
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,479
so so someone asks you what do you do

41
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,199
one answer is you can say oh i

42
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:30,720
do these four resolves i stand in these four resolves so they're they're that important that

43
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,080
if you know if that might for some people be actually be more important than a career or work

44
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:42,280
that they would this is this would be the guiding principles of a life

45
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:51,840
so the four there's four results the first is to be resolved on wisdom

46
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,360
the second is to be resolved on the truth

47
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:06,240
the third is to be resolved on letting go or giving up

48
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,800
relinquishing it's a wonderful word the pali word here

49
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:19,440
because the word can also mean giving or generosity and the fact that these two the word for

50
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:26,720
letting go or relinquishing also means to give or be generous it's kind of a fascinating

51
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:34,000
topic and the fourth resolve is to resolve on peace

52
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:41,280
so wisdom truth letting go and peace these are worthwhile places take a stand

53
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,840
or to be oriented you can ask yourself as i'm sit in any situation you're in

54
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,080
how do i relate to this wisely

55
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:01,360
what's true here what's really the truth here what's the the significant truth of the moment that

56
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:10,800
i'm overlooking and not noticing because i'm involved in my desires or my fears or my

57
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,560
planning for the future but what's the truth of this moment

58
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:24,000
what is it that is appropriate to relinquish here to not hold on to anymore to let go

59
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,120
and how is this letting go in the moment here a generous thing to do

60
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:36,479
not a diminishment of self not a diminishment of our life or not um impoverishing us and letting go

61
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:42,639
but something that is generous and generosity maybe that comes from a

62
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,759
feeling of inner wealth we have an abundance of

63
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,039
well and of course we happy to let go so other people make space we don't we're

64
00:06:53,039 --> 00:07:00,400
not impoverished and then then uh where's the peace here

65
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:07,199
is there peace in this situation a peacefulness is there a place for that here

66
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,199
now this might seem kind of like a maybe artificial or strange orientation

67
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:19,520
to have as we go through the life but

68
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,039
when we think about what many people are actually resolved on

69
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:32,080
maybe sometimes unconsciously they don't even know they're resolved on things what people mostly do with their lives

70
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:38,639
and they make the center of orientation of their life these are pretty good resolves to live

71
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:44,639
live by some people are resolved on greed

72
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,479
some people are resolved on complaining and hostility and blame

73
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:56,080
some people are resolved on fear and anxiety

74
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,680
some people are resolved on hanging on to the past and memories and

75
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:09,680
ideas some people are resolved on fantasies of the future

76
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:16,560
or delusions of grandeur of some kind or other

77
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:23,400
or resolved on being safe

78
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,680
there's i like the little quote to the little cliche that says that

79
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,279
a boat is safe in a harbor but that's not what the boat was built

80
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:43,518
for you know if we spend a lot of time trying to keep ourselves safe we weren't

81
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:50,959
actually built to be safe you know to be always safe so that to be resolved on that maybe we

82
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:56,080
shortchanged ourselves some people are resolved on money and

83
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,680
wealth status power

84
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,440
all kinds of things some people are resolved on being loved

85
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,440
being respected and some of these of course are not

86
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:20,880
necessarily wrong to be oriented towards but if they're the center of the life

87
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,640
maybe that's not maybe we're missing out on something maybe we're diminished with those

88
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:33,360
results if that's really what we're all about these four resolves i propose it's

89
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:40,480
different that if we resolved on those they don't necessarily prevent us to do all other kinds of

90
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:48,000
things they don't replace the things that we might do in our life

91
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,360
but if we take our stand in these four resolves

92
00:09:53,360 --> 00:10:00,399
that will radically change how we do all the things that we do

93
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,640
and maybe some of the ways in which we engage the world

94
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:12,480
are not so healthy for ourselves and for others and to engage in the world to do these

95
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,000
things that we do but to do it from a different orientation

96
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,200
can be powerful so these four resolves

97
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,320
so the first resolve is wisdom and

98
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:35,680
and this is to uh to be wise about how we

99
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,040
view our situation to be wise how we approach our situation

100
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:47,040
why is in what we do and how we understand what we're doing and um

101
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,560
and just to ask that question you know what's the what's the wise thing to do here

102
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:59,440
what's the wise approach to this what's the wise way of seeing the situation

103
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,480
and then it's you know almost i can repeat myself and some of the ways that we view

104
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:11,360
are not particularly wise if we look through the filter of our greed ambition

105
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:18,720
our hostility or blame or anxiety and

106
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,480
those aren't really wise ways doesn't help us see clearly it doesn't help us to see how to live

107
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,920
usefully in a good way so are there different ways of seeing

108
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:38,399
different ways of relating to the situation we're in oddly enough one of the wise ways that

109
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,760
buddhism emphasizes to what we look for what we study

110
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:51,839
is to study where the stress is to study where the

111
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,680
is to it's wise to notice where there's tension where there's suffering where

112
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,279
there's pain not so we can suffer more

113
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,639
but so that we can it's wise to understand that it's

114
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:15,120
happening that it's there so that we can be within a different way

115
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,959
part of wisdom is to be with what's challenging with the stress

116
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:26,160
situation uh in order to understand it better

117
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:32,720
to understand particularly our contributions to it what are we doing that contributes to

118
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:42,160
the way we feel uncomfortable or stressed or afraid or upset or whatever it might be

119
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:50,800
and to um it's wise to study this why is to look at this to understand it

120
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,720
and if there is ways that we contribute to our own stress

121
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,240
then maybe we can let go of it if we know what it is but if we ignore the suffering we have

122
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,760
the stress we have the tension we have and we ignore then

123
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:13,760
our contribution to it then there's no way of knowing what we can do personally to make the situation

124
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:19,279
better one of the ways that's not wise

125
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:25,440
is to spend a lot of time blaming others being resentful or complaining about

126
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:33,319
others i'm certainly i'm sure there are people who are definitely appropriate too

127
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:41,360
i don't know blame for things that happen in the world but if we're resolved always on blaming

128
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:47,760
other people and never look at ourselves we once again limit

129
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:54,079
their lives we narrow our lives and this movement of looking in

130
00:13:54,079 --> 00:14:01,680
ourselves wisely and where our suffering is where our attention and grasping and clinging is

131
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:08,000
and letting go of it is actually a movement that opens us up

132
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,920
that does the opposite of limiting ourselves it creates more an unlimited way of being in the world

133
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:21,279
and so to be resolved on what wisdom and this is what i just described today was in the

134
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:27,920
core forms of buddhist wisdom be wise about our suffering or

135
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:36,000
truth to be wise about what's true to know the truth to ask what is true

136
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
here and of course there's many things you can say is true

137
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,880
you know so someone asked me you know what's true in the moment here i can say well there's a blue tape but

138
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:55,279
then the floor that's crooked and uh you know that's not gonna

139
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,639
that's not the kind of truth that will set you free unless you're a zen master they can say

140
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:06,560
things like that but um but the uh

141
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:14,720
you know but it's not going to go that far but you know if i'm sitting here what's true

142
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:21,120
might be that i appreciate sitting here with you i value that you came here today and

143
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:27,680
i take your interest in the dharma seriously and i feel like i would like to

144
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:33,920
to offer something to you that respects your interest in coming here that's true

145
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:39,120
if that that has a different feeling to recognize that than to recognize that

146
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:46,079
someone put the tape down crooked it's okay for me to say it because i was the one who did it

147
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:53,000
and they um

148
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,959
i suppose what's true as well is that uh i have a teeny bit of

149
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:08,560
apprehension nervousness maybe a little bit that here we are back in person again and teaching in person and

150
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,759
and uh my my offering something that's useful for you and helpful and

151
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,800
worthwhile your time to come here and so i don't know how useful that truth is

152
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:24,079
but i recognize it that that's also here and so rather than having that

153
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:30,480
concern be something that you know eats at me or bothers me or

154
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:37,279
inhibits me or you know i just recognize it's there it's true and knowing it's true then

155
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:43,839
it's like okay you know it's like a it can it's okay it can accompany me it's not going to interfere with what i

156
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:49,680
do here i'm not caught up in it and concerned so i don't know if those are good

157
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:56,079
examples but the idea is to to recognize that what's what's true what's really true here what's true that

158
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:01,199
has to do with our suffering what's true about our freedom what's true about our appreciation of

159
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:06,798
things the love of the moment what's the truth that that

160
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:12,640
brings this moment that we're here into a kind of a full fullness into a

161
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,720
life into a place where we can meet other people and be connected and

162
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:25,199
feel grounded and feel like feel like it's wonderful to be alive

163
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:33,840
is there a truth that would provide that for us what if there is

164
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:44,400
wasn't it kind of sad not to stop and notice it and recognize it

165
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,160
so to discover what is true and uh and part of what the buddhist

166
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,440
tradition emphasizes that's important is to recognize the truth

167
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,840
of where we're grasping where we're clinging what we're clinging to what we're resisting

168
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:09,919
to because that if we recognize the truth of that then there's hope to release it to look

169
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:18,080
through it to the other side but if we don't see the truth of that then we can't do that work

170
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,600
and or the or sometimes it's the opposite that we can see as a truth

171
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,840
we can see the truth of our freedom the truth of our vitality and connectedness

172
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:36,720
to ourselves to others to the world that comes when we're not caught in the grip of clinging or resistance or

173
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:45,280
preoccupation and to recognize that truth and to live it and connect to people and be present

174
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,919
and then this truth of relinquishment letting go

175
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,280
if if i use the word giving up

176
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,559
uh it might be kind of depressing there are all kinds of relationship

177
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:11,200
connotations but but it has the word giving in it and the word chaga the c-a-g-a the word

178
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:17,440
for relinquishment also means generosity giving

179
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,480
and you find that in buddhism the buddhist language is all these words

180
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:29,280
that have this double meaning generosity or giving and then letting go

181
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:35,120
and we find that in english the word um giving up apparently originally

182
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:42,160
um it was related to the word or the expression to offer something up on the altar

183
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:48,559
like some sacred thing and um i don't know if that's true but that's what i've read

184
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:54,240
and now to offer up uh we have the expression uh giving in

185
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:01,200
you give in to someone and it's you know it's a little bit depressing that you're giving in to someone but but then they have the word

186
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,559
giving in it so maybe there's a deeper wonderful way of giving in on the

187
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:12,640
freeway sometimes i like to uh i give way to people someone's coming you

188
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,559
know wants to merge into my lane and you know i probably have the right to be there

189
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:24,559
i probably you know you know it looks safe and you know and i have

190
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:32,240
the right and that took a long time to get into that lane and not someone once it gets in front of me they're coming off getting onto the freeway

191
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,799
you know i i could you know just kind of like

192
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:44,640
insist that i get my way and let them kind of deal with the shoulder of the road

193
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:52,240
but i like what i like to do is give way here you can have it please sort of give way give in

194
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:58,480
give up i don't know i don't know if there's other giving words give attention that's not giving up though

195
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,919
i like the expression giving attention but to let go

196
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:12,559
so what can we relinquish here where it's just where it's a a healthy

197
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:19,520
wonderful place to take a stand where do we relinquish

198
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:25,919
not so that we're diminished but so we're somehow we become bigger or more alive or more

199
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:33,440
present or life feels more worth living than being closed in and held down and

200
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:39,679
holding on to something what are we holding on to what are we holding on to what are we

201
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:45,760
clinging to when we feel socially awkward with other people

202
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:51,840
it's remarkable and sometimes offensive this buddhist idea that

203
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:57,440
i think it's buddhist other people can say it too that you know certainly

204
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:04,480
there's a lot of attachment when there's conceit of being special but these buddhists say that

205
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:10,080
there can be just as much conceit in being shy

206
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,280
that's what's kind that's kind of like what shy people aren't there that's because they're they don't have much self or

207
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:21,120
they're kind of like but there's still a concern with the self there

208
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:27,600
where is it appropriate to let go of self concern self-concern we have

209
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:33,120
is limiting us and certainly shyness can be limiting

210
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:39,360
but so can conceits of grandeur that i'm special even if they people agree with you and

211
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,400
so it feels pretty good it actually limits ourselves a lot it

212
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:50,400
actually becomes a scenario or a world to live in and to let go of conceit

213
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,600
wow what a great thing

214
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,799
and so what can we really what to take a stand on the relinquishment

215
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:07,039
and let it be a kind of generosity what would it look like if

216
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:12,240
there's a benefits a form of wealth or happiness that comes

217
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:18,559
from relinquishment to to relinquish out of a place of abundance

218
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:25,679
or to relinquish to tap into the sense of inner abundance that's not dependent on

219
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:32,400
material goods or status or all kinds of things

220
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:38,720
and that's one of the great possibilities of meditation practice is to discover in the simplicity of

221
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:45,600
meditation or to awaken a feeling of inner abundance

222
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:52,480
that comes with that freedom that comes from a fullness that comes from no longer limiting ourselves

223
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:59,039
with fear and all the different things we can limit ourselves with

224
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:05,200
and to both feel like we're the relinquishment is almost like an offering of that

225
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,400
abundance outwards it's not a giving something up it's a gain

226
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:16,080
i'm fond of the idea that um i think some people when they think of letting go

227
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:22,000
they think it means uh we're going to drop something and

228
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:29,760
and the teachings of the buddha as far as my reading has been um he i think it's rare if ever he talks

229
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:35,840
about letting go of anything uh he talks about um but he just talks

230
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:42,320
about letting go of the clinging and if you hold something and you let go

231
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:49,279
of the clinging to it you might still be holding it if you respect everything

232
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:56,559
you don't drop things you just you hold it and it was what this gesture now

233
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:02,640
this is a gesture of generosity like here or safety or something here

234
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:09,520
and then we can use our wisdom to know whether it should be given to someone or put down or do something

235
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:14,799
but to let go so with this movement with the palm of the hand

236
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:21,360
facing upwards is holding the whatever's there rather than dropping something

237
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,799
which maybe it's not so healthy but this then we can put things down if we need

238
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:32,000
to so to take a stand in that relinquishment

239
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,760
that's generous that releases gender a certain way to freeze a certain generosity they come

240
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:45,520
maybe both comes from abundance and provides a sense of abundance

241
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:52,240
and then the fourth resolve is the resolve of peace

242
00:25:53,679 --> 00:26:00,720
and there is a really good time excellent time

243
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:06,720
to be resolved on peace really good there's a there's a particular circumstance where it's

244
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,400
really a good thing to do the best time to resolve result on peace

245
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,320
is when it's better than the alternative

246
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,679
and how often do you think that occurs that it's better than the alternative if

247
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:30,640
you have a better thing going on than peace by all means forget about the peace

248
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,760
but if the alternative isn't as good you might want to consider it

249
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:42,320
i like the word ease rather than peace somehow the word

250
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,360
peace is nice but ease has a for me a more embodied feeling it's also how how

251
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:53,120
i act how i live what kind of process they're going on inside there's an ease to what happens

252
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,320
whereas peace in my vocabulary feels a little static my ease is more dynamic

253
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:04,000
you might not have that associations but but to be be

254
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,000
take a stand on peace the alternative is to be take a stand on

255
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,919
war on conflict take a stand on

256
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:22,320
being in opposition with reality the reality is not cooperating

257
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,840
the weather is not good it's raining

258
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:36,159
it doesn't really understand that today was not the day to rain i had important things to do to be resolved on peace

259
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,520
one wouldn't then be angry at the clouds

260
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:48,399
well uh where is the peace in this circumstance where do i find my peace where i find

261
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:53,600
ease with whatever is going on

262
00:27:53,600 --> 00:28:01,520
it's not an acceptance of the situation it's not condoning situations not becoming passive in the situation

263
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:07,760
but it is operating from a place of being peaceful

264
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:13,600
being at ease being calm perhaps tranquil certain tranquility

265
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,799
in engaging and doing the things maybe that we have to do

266
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:32,399
there are times in my life where i've when i was younger where i was quick to quick to be alarmed by

267
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:39,360
situations like ah we got to do something so like i call 9-1-1 i did a few times

268
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,559
like oh there's something terrible going on we have to call 9-1 and um

269
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:50,080
and then after a few minutes later uh i think was calmed down i looked at

270
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:55,600
the situation and said there's not a problem here so i hope that never happened to any of

271
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:03,760
you but uh but the ability to be peaceful or calm lets us see the situation clearly

272
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:09,760
i haven't had i haven't had this situation but i have a lot of friends who

273
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:15,679
had dangerous things happened to them and because they stayed calm

274
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,799
there was some creative thinking that arose for them in the moment to take care of the

275
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:26,960
dangerous situation at the time um

276
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:33,200
one person i know was being held up in san francisco by some teenagers or something

277
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:38,840
and um it looked like a dangerous situation and so the person suddenly found himself

278
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:44,480
saying uh you're no christian what would your

279
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:51,278
mother think and that kind of stress you know just stunned them a little bit and then he ran away

280
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:57,679
he had a little moment there that somehow got them off guard so i i don't recommend that strategy

281
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:02,960
particularly but but something in him knew as a strategy but something inside of him knew that

282
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:09,600
that was to to do that and so so you know this creativity or this

283
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,720
intuition or this kind of understanding situation well when we're peaceful

284
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:20,640
that we aren't if we're anxious so

285
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,840
someone might ask you

286
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:33,840
where do you come from and conventionally they might say where were you born or where did you grow up

287
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:40,880
or where you live last or where do you live now but if you want to say what's maybe

288
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,000
where you're most coming from if you're resolved on these you can say

289
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,440
oh i come from i resolved

290
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:57,679
under i come from the resolve on wisdom truth

291
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,760
relinquishment and peace

292
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:09,840
they might even ask you who are you

293
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:17,279
oh you might say truthfully the thing that seems more true than

294
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:24,399
anything else it's not what they're asking for but might be more true as an answer that you might say to them oh

295
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:33,360
i'm i'm the resolve on wisdom and truth and relinquishment

296
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:39,679
on peace so these things can be that central that you could answer that way

297
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:47,840
but chances are if you did you'd annoy some of the people you say so you probably shouldn't do it that easily

298
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:55,120
the um but there might be some people

299
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:00,799
it seems appropriate they might appreciate it they might be inspired because it's

300
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:07,600
unusual in this life to have people who live on really base route route their lives

301
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:13,360
on beautiful values beautiful inspiring values

302
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:19,200
and i think that's what buddhism is recommending and pointing to

303
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:26,480
it's not just a life of meditation a life of stress reduction a life of being calm

304
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:33,039
but it's a life that's really rooted or centered on some inspiring values and

305
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:38,399
possibilities and these four resolves can be seen as

306
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:41,720
part of that

307
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,720
and then when you have these experiences or where the self seems to dissolve or

308
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:57,440
where it seems like meaning it is not found anywhere

309
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:03,519
or disoriented from or kind of

310
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:10,159
having let go really deeply then these provide a foundation to hold

311
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:16,080
you these provide a place to stand and you know it's okay

312
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:25,039
it's okay because i'm committed to wisdom truth letting go

313
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:28,639
generosity peace

314
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:39,759
and what a great place to come from what a great place to be resolved what a great place to base one's life on them

315
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,440
especially if you can understand how these four resolves

316
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:53,440
how healthy they are how how they really bring forth a kind of

317
00:33:53,440 --> 00:34:00,320
delightful spiritual health to ourselves and the world around us

318
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,679
so for results

319
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:19,760
if you have better results great and if they're

320
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:26,000
and if uh these four resolves are the better alternative for you you might want to consider them until

321
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,118
you get until you find something better they're pretty good you're not going to

322
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:36,720
go wrong with them so thank you

323
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:42,000
those are my thoughts we have a little bit of time if i just

324
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,118
if i take five minutes or so if any of you want to ask a question or comment or

325
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:54,720
just say something about any of this you're lovely lovely to hear your voice a

326
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:00,800
little bit now it's kind of i feel it's very special to be together

327
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,760
yes and maybe also say your name you start

328
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:12,560
hello uh ryan is my name um i

329
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:18,960
i i think what resonated for me most what you're talking about was about truth um and i thought it was an interesting

330
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:24,800
contrast that you said you know kind of the this objective truth like the the you

331
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:31,280
know that there's a blue piece of tape on the floor that wasn't as meaningful a truth as

332
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:37,280
this kind of subjective aspect of your experience like it was like the kind of feeling apprehensive

333
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:43,839
about what you're saying like that's not like a you know kind of an objective like objectively verifiable

334
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:50,480
truth but you know that it's it's all it's almost like an opinion yeah you know from like i think from maybe our more standard way of looking at things

335
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:56,240
those kinds of things you're talking about are like the less important you know facts um

336
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:03,040
and so just you know the fact that you're kind of calling attention to the fact that there's this like aspect of our inner experience um

337
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:08,400
that it's not even really a fact or you know it's it's a it's just a kind of an aspect of our

338
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:15,040
feeling tone or the way we're relating that's like the kind of the most fundamental truth like i thought that was really um

339
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:20,800
really interesting so thanks for saying that yeah yeah i think that um that's very important what you're saying and

340
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:26,960
the distinction you made between facts and truth is very important and i think uh i like to think of truths

341
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:33,920
as being aspects of the heart so so like like lying about something

342
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:40,640
is an aspect of the heart something there is it's kind of an illness of the heart and

343
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:46,720
you know some people lie a lot and we might you might say you might say that in a way that's factual

344
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,480
but you might also someone might recognize oh i really spent my life lying i lived

345
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:58,320
a lie boy i wish i knew that truth before and it's not just a fact then it

346
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:04,000
changes them in some deep way so they um

347
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,119
in you know in india the mahatma

348
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:24,720
and some people have translated as the power of truth some people it

349
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,680
it's uh like the adhering to the truth

350
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,040
so anyway that's beautiful he said thank you thank you

351
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,480
