1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:06,720
so hello and welcome to our last

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,920
meditation on the send spheres

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,800
and um and this is it

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,080
the word dharma is sometimes equated with the english

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,199
word nature to see the dharma as a sea nature to see

6
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,320
what's kind of what's natural in this world of ours

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,040
and meditation makes us a little bit a naturalist where we are

8
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,920
looking and understanding what the nature of this life is like especially the nature of ourselves and our mind

9
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,000
and the naturalist has the ability to see what's happening without disturbing

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,399
what's happening without interfering with it and um

11
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,920
and without holding on to the branches of the stream as we go down the canoe

12
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,880
we can just flow along with the natural flow so one of the most natural things for

13
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:21,119
human beings is to have thoughts and it's possible to just know that

14
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,720
there's a thought that appears and there's a kind of a marvel with the

15
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:34,000
arising of an individual thought sometimes because it just seems to appear out of nowhere

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,798
i just sit quietly and a new thought arises

17
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:50,799
and so in this exercise on the senses six senses

18
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,320
there is thoughts and then there's the reception of that thought in the mind there's the mind

19
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,520
knows it that there's a thought and then there's

20
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,560
the fetter the entanglement the knot there's a way we get involved in that

21
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,480
thought and the way that and one of the ways we see that

22
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,160
is when a thought becomes thinking a thought is a relatively brief phrase

23
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,599
or sentence or image that we have and then we get involved in it we pick

24
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:30,000
it up we respond to it we add to it we [Music]

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,920
and then pretty soon we're kind of lost in a whole train of thoughts and might take a long time before we come out of

26
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:44,000
it and know that we're even present and so it's possible just to sit quietly

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,440
and be aware of the thought when it arises and then distinct from that

28
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,480
know how we get involved in it no the pull into it the reaction to it

29
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:03,040
the horror to it the judgments of it all the secondary things that go on

30
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:10,000
that involves some kind of being caught in it but if we are able to be a naturalist of

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,599
thoughts thoughting it's a really it can be very relaxing

32
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:21,680
if we don't take assign meaning to a thought or

33
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,360
value to a thought or we don't define ourselves by the thought you know i'm having this kind of thought therefore

34
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,959
i'm a wonderful person i'm having this kind of thought and i'm a terrible person

35
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,319
it's just a thought this idea of just a thought just thinking

36
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:45,040
and this is one of the places where i think it's valuable to add the word just

37
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:52,159
uh in the label in the recognition of thinking just a thought it's just thinking

38
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,920
and just like a map is not

39
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:04,159
the location that the map represents so a thought it doesn't is not the thing that it

40
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:11,439
usually represents it's just a thought and to settle back and be able to just

41
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,880
see the arising of thoughts and then see if we lean into them or pull away from

42
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:24,720
them or get caught in them and that's seeing the not the entanglement

43
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,800
so assuming a dignified meditation posture

44
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:44,240
and part of the value of being careful with your posture is that the more you can be embodied in

45
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:53,040
your posture the less energy there is to pour into thinking

46
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:01,440
the more you can really be careful and embodied in your posture the more that's a grounding

47
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,639
here in the present moment it's like an anchor

48
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,000
that keeps you from drifting off

49
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:20,400
and then lower your gaze about 45 degrees

50
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,240
relax the focus of your eyes so you're not looking at anything in particular

51
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,000
and then gently close your eyes

52
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,280
and settle in relax with your body

53
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:54,160
gently calmly take some deeper breaths fuller breaths

54
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,360
and as you exhale relax

55
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,758
settle in

56
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,000
and letting your breathing return to normal

57
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,000
and it's really invaluable

58
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,840
to relax when you meditate to have an upright posture or a clear

59
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,919
posture intentional posture

60
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:48,599
and then to relax within that posture

61
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,960
so you might relax the muscles of your face as you exhale

62
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:03,360
and as you get more and more familiar with your face this way you might become more and more aware of

63
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:10,800
the subtle emotions the subtle muscles that can be relaxed soften

64
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,800
released

65
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:22,560
over time there's more and more awareness of muscles maybe you never even knew you

66
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,560
had

67
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,240
on the exhale relaxing the shoulders

68
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:55,160
and going to the belly on the exhale softening the belly

69
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:09,199
in the exhale release your body weight of your body into whatever supporting it

70
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,919
cushion the chair

71
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:28,160
and then some global way of relaxing the whole body

72
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:36,200
if you're bracing yourself against life soften as you exhale

73
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:54,480
and then relaxing the thinking mind on the exhale softening

74
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:03,000
tension or pressure contraction associated with thinking

75
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:16,200
calming any agitation associated with thinking

76
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:14,399
and then take a few moments here to be aware of thoughts arising

77
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:23,000
turn your attention allow yourself to think and know the thoughts that arise

78
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:38,120
you don't necessarily have to know the content of the thoughts but just the event of thinking

79
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:52,560
and as you do so are you involved in your thinking

80
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,800
or can you just observe them from a distance

81
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,600
observing them as natural phenomena

82
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,480
no need to judge or define you define yourself by your

83
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,920
thoughts the thoughts just arise appear

84
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,839
sooner or later they disappear

85
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:13,199
are you involved in your thinking what does that involvement feel like

86
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:19,600
like a glue like a strong gravitational pull

87
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,079
strong interest

88
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,480
worrying about something

89
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,079
and then settling in with your breathing

90
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:54,800
but attentive to the rising of thoughts in any entanglement

91
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:01,279
with thinking and the alternative to entanglement is

92
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:07,600
to simply observe it as a naturalist it's nature

93
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,360
for the mind to produce thoughts

94
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,839
there's no need for you to get involved in your thoughts

95
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:27,240
come back to your breathing breathe with it all

96
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:08,720
it can be a relief to leave thinking alone leave thoughts that come and they

97
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,559
go leave them alone

98
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:21,600
not bothered by them not favoring them not concerned

99
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,640
they're just thoughts

100
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:20,880
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

101
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,240
one of the powers that come with observing thoughts

102
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:34,600
is to know which to put down let go and which to get involved in

103
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:42,480
and as we begin to come out of meditation the thoughts that are nice to have and

104
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:48,640
to participate with little bit are thoughts of good will

105
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:55,679
kindness friendliness and perhaps there's people in your lives

106
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,880
or people you know that you could

107
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:07,840
have a few moments here of thinking caring or generous thoughts

108
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,398
about them

109
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:21,360
with a light feeling not a duty or heavy just lightly

110
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:27,398
positive good feelings and thoughts about them

111
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:38,240
and this is uh not just letting your think stream of thinking be random and

112
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:44,559
without any agency on your part from time to time it's nice to

113
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:51,840
choose what you think about and think about goodwill and friendliness to yourself to

114
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,240
others

115
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:03,279
and in this way may we click keep close by as we go

116
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:09,679
through the day the friendliness the good will the care

117
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:16,720
that comes from the wish the wishes may all beings

118
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:24,000
be happy may all beings be safe

119
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:33,559
may all beings be peaceful may all beings be free

120
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:46,480
[Music]

121
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,480
okay so

122
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:09,120
this weekend we're talking about the buddha's instructions for how to practice with the sense doors

123
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:15,440
and it's to be aware of each door the object that that of

124
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:21,200
that that sense door takes in so for eyes it's site objects where

125
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:27,840
hearing its sounds for for the tongue its taste for the nose it

126
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:33,600
smells for the body its tactile experiences and for

127
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:39,279
the mind its thinking the word for

128
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:46,960
mind here is mano m-a-n-o which uh maybe

129
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:52,880
is closely associated with the thinking part of the mind and so

130
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:59,279
uh and so if if it kind of goes along with the other senses

131
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:04,880
the mind produces thoughts and that is somehow registered or known

132
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:12,000
by the mono by this part of the mind that recognizes there's thinking [Applause]

133
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:19,919
and and then on top of that in addition to that there's a kind of mindful knowing

134
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:25,279
so it's not just kind of vaguely or somewhat aware that there's thoughts going on

135
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:33,760
but this knowing of mindfulness is a clear kind of definitive like oh

136
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:40,640
this is thinking this is just thinking you don't necessarily just say those

137
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:47,039
words to yourself but there's a way in which we step back

138
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:54,559
or turn around and look thinking directly in the eye and say i see you thinking this is thinking

139
00:31:54,559 --> 00:32:00,480
and and observe it and and i think this idea of being a

140
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,679
naturalist of thinking uh conveys the idea of uh

141
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:11,760
of that the thinking is natural natural phenomena and we are observing it

142
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:18,799
but not necessarily defining ourselves or identifying ourselves with the thoughts

143
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:25,840
and and this is a fascinating and wonderful thing to allow a thought to arise

144
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:31,200
but to not place ourselves in the thought some people

145
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:38,799
live in their thoughts their whole identity or their kind of feeling or sense of eminence i am i exist

146
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:46,000
is somehow taken up residency in the middle of thinking and so it's inconceivable

147
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,519
to think about not thinking because that's

148
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:57,840
who would i be if i wasn't thinking it's also um

149
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:04,640
some people feel lost if they're not kind of living in their thoughts and um

150
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:11,279
but we don't have to live in our thoughts we don't have to take residency in our thoughts we can have thought just be a phenomena

151
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:17,600
that arises that's no different than going outside for a walk and

152
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,799
and the leaf blows off a tree and blows down next to you and and

153
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:28,640
that you don't take the tree as you you don't define the the leaf as you you don't define you don't

154
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,760
define yourself by the leaf you don't maybe necessarily get involved with

155
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:40,000
wanting to take the leaf home home and deciding that you're a great leaf selector and you need to let everyone

156
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,120
know what a great capacity you have selecting leaves from the sidewalk

157
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:50,840
you don't get involved just the leaf just falls and it's just you know it's maybe a nice part of the

158
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:56,799
just just false so the same way the thinking thoughts can just be the same

159
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:04,000
relationship to them where we take up residency not in the thinking the thoughts but in

160
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,118
the awareness of them the knowing of them now it's a little bit tricky because

161
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:14,320
knowing of them could be seen as a thought itself but

162
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:21,200
this is a we're talking about maybe different levels of thinking different kinds of thinking and

163
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:29,280
the the this very simple thought that knows oh that's thinking that's just a thought

164
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:36,079
that's also a natural phenomena but that's a natural phenomena that supports this freedom supports this

165
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:42,240
disentanglement as we begin to um

166
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:48,560
so so this whole thing about the sense doors is quite fascinating because

167
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:56,960
the more and more we are able to kind of be present at the point of sense contact

168
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:03,280
and recognize the not the entanglement the bias the leaning into or pulling

169
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,320
back we start seeing our bias our our

170
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:15,280
our prejudices our desires our the influences we bring

171
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,640
on to on top of it and we said we are seldom innocent observers

172
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:27,200
we often have preferences wanting and not wanting and and and it can be very very subtle

173
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:34,320
uh i told this story before but when i was a teenager i i went to morocco

174
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:41,359
and and i don't know how it is now but when i was there the men

175
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:46,800
were yalabas these gowns there was striped gowns

176
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,920
vertically stripes and um and as i was walking around after some

177
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,359
while being in morocco i had this funny feeling that my mind was lighter

178
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:02,560
clear so there's a little different feeling in my mind and as i kind of tried to understand

179
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:09,838
what was going on i came to the conclusion that in the united states

180
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:16,640
i pegged people i didn't just see people i had a judgment about people

181
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:22,240
because i recognized something about them that was a a jock that was a

182
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:28,640
some kind of businessman or that was this or that and i had little judgments about them

183
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:34,720
and uh maybe there wasn't maybe one of the judgments judgments were not exactly

184
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:41,200
conscious but they were there and morocco where all these men were wearing yalabas

185
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:47,599
i had no context to understand anything about them about their professions what they did their politics all kinds of

186
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,960
things and so i um the

187
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,720
and so my mind was light lighter from not making any extra judgments

188
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:04,480
so to not live in ordinary thinking but to live an awareness

189
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,920
the awareness in which this arises and then be able to see the

190
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:16,480
entanglement and not and and it's a big part of the the knots the

191
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,240
entanglements we have is in fact to thinking because if i see something i don't

192
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:27,599
necessarily automatically get entangled to that i do have a thought about it

193
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:35,280
and it's a thought that i get caught in that's the somehow the the knot around the thing i'm seeing

194
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:41,920
and so to be able to settle back and observe thinking to be aware of thinking to be

195
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:51,838
quiet enough still enough open enough present enough to see the birth of a thought

196
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:58,720
to see a thought appear there it is

197
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:04,880
and it's just a thought and then it are you entangled with it

198
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,400
you chase it do you then have a follow-up thought and a follow-up thought

199
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:16,480
or do you just allow the thought to just be there like a leaf the same single leaf that's falling from the sky

200
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,599
just a thought and then

201
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,960
that kind of freedom that that gives of you know seeing and not being involved in thoughts

202
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:32,960
gives us a freedom to then choose what we think and there are things to think about

203
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,560
and one of the things to think about is good will is kindness is friendliness support to

204
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:44,160
others is to to appreciate people

205
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:49,760
that i think that this uh it's all too easy for people to have a negativity bias

206
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:55,520
and uh for all kinds of reasons and be predisposed to seeing what's wrong and

207
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:01,040
and what's not right and but if we can choose what we're thinking

208
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:06,480
about maybe we can choose appropriately appropriate ways

209
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:13,119
to really appreciate people and see their beauty and their wonderfulness and choose to think about how to support

210
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:17,359
people and be friendly to people

211
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:24,240
if in maybe that seems like a lot of work and extra to do a little artificial to do

212
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:30,560
that but it might be better than the alternative

213
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,560
if you're watching your mind carefully choose the best alternative for the mind

214
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:43,440
and don't choose the alternative the option that is for your detriment thinking

215
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:49,599
critical thoughts judgmental thoughts harsh thoughts

216
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:57,400
unkind thoughts it's not really healthy

217
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:04,640
so thinking thoughts mono so this level of practice of this but

218
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:11,920
talking about this week we are tuning into the knots we can begin also start seeing

219
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:17,520
the conditions how we get knotted the desires that arise the aversions

220
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:24,240
that are there the the frustrations the stresses we're living under the stress we have that

221
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:29,520
they're kind of the conditions for us to more likely get knotted up and

222
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,560
knowing those conditions then we can uh we can kind of maybe adjust those

223
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,240
conditions so it's easier to know how to let go of the knots we don't necessarily have to let go of

224
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:45,599
the thought but we let go of being involved in it and caught in it

225
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:52,000
and and this is a wonderful thing to let go of knots to to dissolve the

226
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,760
knots to untie the knots and the mind and one of the reasons that's wonderful

227
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:04,079
is that knots take up a lot of space in the mind a lot of energy a lot of bandwidth

228
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:09,920
and when that bandwidth is not preoccupied with the knots

229
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,040
there's then much more room open space on the

230
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:22,400
for the factors of awakening for some really also natural phenomena

231
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:27,520
but natural phenomena that's really kind of some of the great

232
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,839
treasures that are within us and those are the seven factors of

233
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:38,000
awakening and uh that's the next exercise for the sati britannia text

234
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,760
it goes from um the six sense bases to the seven factors of awakening

235
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:49,599
and then we make a transition now uh to looking at what leads to

236
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:55,119
liberation to freedom once we get a hang of the

237
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:00,839
aspects that keeps us from being free the hindrances

238
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:07,359
the aggregates that we talked about last week and now that fetters the knots that

239
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:13,599
we can we know what those are well those are the things that keep us from being free

240
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:18,960
and as we release them and free ourselves from them

241
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:25,680
then um this new energy this new possibility states can come ones that are onward leading towards

242
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:32,160
freedom and this is one of the great um i'm kind of rewards for doing

243
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:39,680
mindfulness practice when we get to the play the point in practice where we start uh flowing in these beautiful

244
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:45,359
seven factors of awakening of mindfulness investigation energy

245
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:53,040
joy tranquility concentration and equanimity so that'll be the topic for two weeks

246
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:59,040
next week matthew will be here and matthew brent silver and i'm doing

247
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:05,119
the 7am teachings while i'm away and then the following week i'll be back

248
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:11,599
i won't be here at imc but i'll be i'll be back on the on the youtube and

249
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:17,560
we'll do the seven factors of awakening thank you
