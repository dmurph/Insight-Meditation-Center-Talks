it's been a cool day chilly windy day here in california dry and some warmth

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,239
some warmth in our hearts wherever you are however the weather is

7
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:44,640
internally and out and outside externally can be helpful we can never have too

8
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:52,719
much meta kindness warmth for ourselves and care for others so

9
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,399
that's all i want to say really to frame it there's not much framing i think i want to do

10
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:06,080
but to just dedicate the time to practicing together so let's just meditate together dear sangha

11
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,880
so so getting into your meditation posture whatever is comfortable for you

12
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:20,479
to sit in or your stand the next half hour or so

13
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,960
ah and landing landing in this body landing in this

14
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,000
moment in time

15
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,799
here here

16
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:55,000
inviting inviting your muscles to relax to rest

17
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,360
as if they're falling falling

18
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:11,200
falling dropping [Music] nowhere to go nothing to do

19
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:19,360
they can relax your heart can relax in this moment

20
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:26,400
there have been thoughts entanglements worries it's okay

21
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,000
they can all be there

22
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,400
we'll return to them later but now taking refuge

23
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,480
taking refuge in this moment

24
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,040
taking refuge

25
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,920
if it's supportive for you maybe you have this feeling this image of

26
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,200
as if you were a baby you were pre-verbal you're a baby you're being

27
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:14,480
held in the caring arms

28
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:23,440
of a loving mother just being held feeling that you're held

29
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,280
feeling safe the cells of your body know what it's

30
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,440
like you don't have to think about it please don't think about it don't start

31
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,959
thinking about your childhood this and that no drop all that

32
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,599
trusting that your body knows

33
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:55,840
your body your heart knows what it's like to be held and feel safe

34
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,239
as if you're held like a baby feeling safe

35
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:22,800
it's a feeling that's available to you to conjure it up we can't conjure it up

36
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,840
of course of course you can

37
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,600
being held right now the air is holding you

38
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:45,680
your clothes are holding you embracing you here here there there

39
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,479
just be just be and breathe

40
00:04:52,479 --> 00:05:00,320
or let yourself be breathed just let it unfold

41
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:09,240
no [Music] struggling no doing no trying

42
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,520
it can be easy ah

43
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:25,840
drop drop drop let go [Music] of trying too hard in this moment

44
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,039
let go

45
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:40,240
let your mind rest rest be at peace be at ease

46
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:47,360
resting with the breath the lullaby of the breath

47
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:57,600
the mind when it's happy it stays it doesn't run around let your mind feel

48
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:05,240
cocooned let your mind feel cocooned

49
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,319
resting with the breath

50
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,800
the sweet breath in breath and out breath

51
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:19,039
and if your mind wanders to thoughts entanglements it's

52
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,960
okay it's all right tell us it's okay sweetheart it's all

53
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,840
right darling

54
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:41,399
ever so gently inviting you to rest with your heart

55
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:48,480
with the breath to take refuge knowing that there is more sweetness

56
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,360
more rest more nourishment here

57
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:02,959
than any thought no matter how pleasant it might be it's still entanglement

58
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,200
trusting trusting it's more nourishment

59
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:18,399
there's more sweetness here inviting inviting awareness to rest

60
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:25,800
here darling here right here

61
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:53,560
maybe imagining that the breath is entering through the heart center

62
00:12:53,680 --> 00:13:00,880
the center of your chest calming soothing

63
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:11,680
like a healing self for the body for the heart the mind of

64
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:18,320
each breath awareness intertwined

65
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:26,399
awareness cuddling in the heart center with the breath

66
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,839
with kindness with care for this entire

67
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:40,560
being that is you this whole body mind and heart

68
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,639
very simple relaxed

69
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:53,240
easy peaceful

70
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,639
my

71
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,040
see what is needed in this moment

72
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,000
if you've had a long day maybe a hard day

73
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:26,519
maybe [Music] the warm warm healing embrace of metta

74
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,560
in this quiet

75
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:07,600
if you're feeling weary maybe menta feels

76
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,640
like a strength

77
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:19,839
both soothing and giving you strength

78
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:33,600
confidence support see what is needed

79
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,480
in each breath imbued with care

80
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:51,160
or maybe simply quiet is needed for whatever needs to unfold to unfold

81
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:13,840
and again if you find thoughts arising it's okay

82
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:22,400
be gentle with yourself be gentle with your heart with your mind

83
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:31,000
and releasing letting go releasing the body releasing the thoughts

84
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:39,279
let there be resting sense of cocooning with the breath

85
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,240
with kindness

86
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,640
taking a break taking a rest

87
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,720
trusting that rest in care and love

88
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,640
and meta brings solace brings comfort and

89
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,640
strength

90
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:26,440
in ways that are needed not needing to solve a problem right now

91
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:37,919
trusting that a different kinder mind will arise

92
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:46,480
later and it's on just stay

93
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:54,600
stay here

94
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,039
the heart with the breath and the body

95
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:55,599
and now as if you would open [Music]

96
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:03,120
the door and just let maybe

97
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:10,240
one or two beings in or dear to you it could be a child could be a pet

98
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,000
could be a good friend a benefactor

99
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:25,960
in this easy place of rest as your cocooning

100
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,919
let them rest invite them to rest

101
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,080
in your mind's eye

102
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,520
as you hold yourself with ease with kindness

103
00:25:53,520 --> 00:26:01,760
let them be included also may all of us have ease

104
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:10,720
may all of us have well-being ease ease fullness

105
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,840
and how our lives unfold happiness

106
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,640
goodness

107
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:48,960
let it be easeful it's not that you're pumping out goodwill or meta

108
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,880
it's the breath you take it's the air you breathe

109
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,679
the air that holds you

110
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,080
and others your minds are it's the cushion you rest

111
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:15,440
on and them too

112
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:23,120
sense of care just palpable ease

113
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,559
easy easy kindness

114
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:21,679
trusting that you're planting seeds of kindness

115
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:28,480
goodwill meant for yourself and others

116
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,840
it doesn't have to feel like hard work

117
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,640
can be gentle easy flowing

118
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,640
soothing

119
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:29,840
meta can glow [Music] can grow and glow

120
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:38,799
with contentment and peace contentment and peace

121
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:49,200
in the heart planting seeds one by one

122
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:58,640
and that's we bring this practice period to a close

123
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:16,559
let there be kindness ease for whatever rose or did not arise

124
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:25,519
if there was agitation sleepiness distraction it's okay

125
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,559
and if there was one moment of awareness and mental kindness

126
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:37,120
which could be this moment this kindness it's okay i showed up

127
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,480

193
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:16,960
my life that scare me and was able to feel how safety

194
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:23,200
in those situations can be possible i felt it in my body

195
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:30,400
perhaps this will be a new way to experience scary situations

196
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:37,520
with this connections wired oh wow lovely yay

197

00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:49,599
that is so profound that is so profound to feel to be able

199
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:56,240
to feel how safety in those scary situations can be possible this is so

200
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:02,400
profound thank you so much for sharing that insight so perfect

201
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:09,440
profound yeah and and it is possible even in especially in

202
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:15,760
scary moments because the buddha taught meta supposedly originally to monks because

203
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:21,760
they were scared they had fear so this is supposed to be medicine for

204
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:28,240
scary times fearful times so that we feel safe beautiful

205
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:34,560

226
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:50,880
yourselves so i see something came in from christine i'm going to set up the

227
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:57,599
breakout rooms while let's see here we go

228
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:06,400
yeah wow i love that christine says question posted to my local sangha yesterday that i've been pondering in my

229
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:11,440
heart what kind of love can i give myself today that would set me free

230
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:18,960
a little bit more i love that what a nice question let's let's take that question to our small practice rooms

231
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:24,480
yeah i love that you can either maybe answer that in this moment

232
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:30,720
or or sit together and and share anything you'd like to share from the practice that came up for

233
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:36,319
you or maybe just hold silence or you can say pass

234
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:41,680
if your turn comes and you want to be quiet that's perfectly fine

235
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:49,200
so i'm going to open the rooms take care of yourselves take care of each other and here we go

236
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:55,280
and their rooms are closed everybody's back welcome back everyone

237
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:02,319
and we had such lovely reflections at the beginning that there isn't much time for anything

238
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:08,960
uh more but if there's a quick thing you want to write and chat maybe a gift that came from the groups

239
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:14,960
you're welcome and i'll read it out loud i'll pause for a moment

240
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:24,560
after something very quick that came up in the group that just feels appropriate must be shared

241
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:29,760
taking one going once going twice

242
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:35,280
okay seems like it feels complete so so with that

243
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:40,880
thank you all for your practice for coming together supporting each other

244
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:46,800
supporting yourselves may we all be happy and free
