9
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,239
change something to the settings here just in case this is causing problems

10
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:12,799
here we go that might make it better so okay so where was i uh yes so

11
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:20,960
so uh and and we often engage with this practice uh with with people with human beings

12
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,000
and and then in the categories of of meta and the brahmaviharas as we

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,040
expand expand further we the last category is all beings may all

14
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,520
beings

15
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,840
humans

16
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,720
i got logged out well but that seems okay it's still

17
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:02,159
recording wow that was impressive that had never happened before wow i love it you're all still here i'm

18
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,680
back okay so all right so i think the

19
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:15,680
being logged out and logged in i think all the issues of being frozen up should have uh should be fixed

20
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:22,560
now all right things are as they are let's continue let's continue it is what it is it is

21
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,000
what it is such as life right such is life so

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
so uh so yes nourished by nature nourished by nature so um so with the category of of

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,200
all beings um yeah and it's nice to actually

24
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,959
intentionally include nature leaves living beings

25
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:53,519
trees flowers in that and um i'll tell you personally

26
00:02:53,519 --> 00:03:00,319
the the um inspiration the inspiration for tonight came when i

27
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,760
went for a little walk earlier and just looking up again it's an urban

28
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:12,000
area but there are trees there are some you know there's foliage around there's some greenery and just looking

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,120
up i felt so nourished by all the green i started to see and then

30
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,200
i started to see more and more because i was tuned to green just being nourished by the green by the

31
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:30,480
sky and then i imagined what if this wasn't here it was just asphalt and roads and my heart sank so

32
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:37,040
there was so much gratitude so much gratitude for all the green

33
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,080
for all the nature that surrounds us supports us our hearts

34
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,879
and i want to share actually one image with you also another uh

35
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:56,319
motivation for me so when i was on retreat um a

36
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:02,799
few weeks ago i went on a solo hike

37
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:09,920
um in a forest in a redwood forest and lay down in the forest and

38
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,519
just lay down there and looked up and this is for those familiar or not

39
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:21,440
familiar with redwoods this is a grove of redwoods there's usually a mother tree

40
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:29,440
and the mother tree spawns a whole circle of baby trees who grow up so i was

41
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:36,400
lying in this circle in this circle of of um these

42
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:43,360
beautiful giant tall still rhett was feeling held just lying

43
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,199
there meditating for 45 minutes and just took a photo as a memento to remind myself of the

44
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:55,120
beauty and peace and i want to bring that bring that to this guided meditation to

45
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:02,240
be to feel held whatever your version of the grove is of the redwood grove is

46
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,720

182
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:40,560
and i'm in idlewild in southern california and i was here last year around this

183
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,599
time and at that time i was having this

184
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:54,000
really profound spiritual awakening and so there was just this real magical quality to it and

185
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,800
when i got here last night it was so hot and the place i'm staying is so much

186
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:05,920

187
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:13,119
russian um and then this morning i you know i got to this place where i could say this prayer of like can i

190
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:35,760
and what just kept coming to me in that meditation was like nature

191
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:44,160
you know nature is never static it's never the same um just like we're never the same and

192

227
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:38,480
please nice yeah um

228
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:44,640
i just remembered the just how nice it is to be in a forest

229
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:52,078
and hear the rustling of the leaves and the creaking of the branches and the wind and the shade shifting and

230
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:58,000
bringing that same kind of attitude to all the shifting sensations inside and

231
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,960
all of the creaking inside and all of the wrestling inside and just kind of something about the image

232
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:10,000
it really helped just kind of settle back into the flow of it all the pleasant and the unpleasant and this and

233
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:16,480
that and just it's it's so natural for me to be in the flow of the shifting sensations kind of

234
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:22,400
externally of the forest and somehow that was very supportive of settling in and just kind of being with

235
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:28,560
the flow of sensations internally in the body nice nice great beautiful

236
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:34,560
beautiful is this is inside that alright it's the yeah how the wrestling the nature

237
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:40,000
outside like oh yeah it's nature it's okay it's just wrestling and inside oh yeah this is just rustling

238
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:47,119

hi hi um i got cut off in the group but i i was just commenting on what somebody

254
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:51,680
else had said in the group about how nature everything fits in in nature and

255
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:59,119
um how i i think that that's a really beautiful idea and i i i often feel like when i'm in

256
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:06,720
nature all of the kind of um you know just like ego based random

257
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:14,640
self-deprecating thoughts negativity all that stuff kind of falls away and i can sometimes really tap into me being part

258
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:19,839
of that and i think that's one thing that i personally find really

259
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:25,920
healing um being in nature and i really appreciated um the other person anthony in our group

260
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,960
pointing that out because i really i really think it's awesome

262
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:45,599

263
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:52,000
have a desire for it and and also at the same time um both you know there's that desire to be immersed

264
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,040
and what i did want to point out with this guided meditation i often point out

265
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:03,520
is there's nature outside and there's nature inside we can always bring the nature we can feel as if we're immersed like this

266
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:09,280
guided meditation that we are in nature and that sense of oh ease that nicholas was talking about oh

267
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:14,880
yeah there's rustling in the trees oh there's a little rustling inside that's okay i can chill with that

268
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:21,440
there's a set there's so we can bring it in too so yeah and and i love what you've
