1
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:20,240
so we'll sit this morning i'll offer you this morning a guided meditation on metta

2
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:27,040
and the idea is to connect to

3
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:34,720
whatever way you can to the notion of goodwill it could be that

4
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,399
it's simply the intention the aspiration the well-wishing that

5
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,519
you can formulate it could be a feeling of warmth or

6
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:52,079
appreciation or love that radiates from you outwards

7
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:58,079
i'll offer you a simple use of the imagination to

8
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:05,040
evoke it a little bit more but to begin

9
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,720
it's also helpful to use the mindfulness practice

10
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,839
to drop in deeply into your body

11
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,959
into for a few moments to hold the breathing that holds maybe not the right word to

12
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,480
receive the breathe the breathing

13
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,160
with uh care as if the rest of your body

14
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:40,560
was receiving with love with kindness

15
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:47,200
with uh support receiving within a field of safety and

16
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,640
goodwill and warmth and kindness receiving the sensations of

17
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:58,000
breathing so we'll start there and then we'll do an active imagination and

18
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,640
we'll kind of continue with the simple phrases of loving kindness

19
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,880
so to take a meditation posture

20
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,760
to sit in a way that feels

21
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,320
upright and open

22
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:31,920
the idea is to assume a posture of a little bit of

23
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:39,320
embodiment of presence of

24
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,240
as if the posture itself expresses the confidence

25
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:52,160
that you're really here confidently

26
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,319
here this time at this moment

27
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,120
and to gently close your eyes

28
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:16,360
and then as you exhale relax and soften the whole body

29
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:26,800
as you exhale softening around the shoulders relaxing

30
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,519
the shoulders

31
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,680
as you exhale a rather unambitious

32
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:51,200
relaxation of the belly not trying too hard or

33
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,720
and perhaps there's some softening in the face

34
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:08,879
in the eyes in the jaws

35
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:18,240
sometimes the face carries with it our attitude and our drive

36
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,959
to think and to want or to defend

37
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,480
to let the face take take some rest

38
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,279
nothing needs to be expressed through the face right now

39
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:49,600
and ever so gently allowing the exhale

40
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:57,760
to relax meaning maybe allow the exhale

41
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,120
to be a fuller release near the end of the exhale

42
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,480
it doesn't have to be much just a fraction

43
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:17,600
and maybe there's a fuller exhale if gently you take a little bit deeper

44
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,880
inhale it doesn't have to be much

45
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,920
and with a deeper fuller release in the exhale

46
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,320
see also if you can relax your thinking

47
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:54,920
not necessarily letting go of your thoughts but quieting your thinking

48
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:19,000
relaxing the muscles associated with being in the control tower of thinking

49
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:32,759
or for those that fear is an issue relaxing the watchtower of thinking

50
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,920
and then as if the whole body

51
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:09,918
maybe it's a cozy warm easy chair

52
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,558
or a cozy warm safe cabin

53
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,480
in the midst of this cold weather outside

54
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,160
and in your easy chair resting back or in your

55
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,360
cabin of your body

56
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:40,039
let the body receive the changing sensations of breathing

57
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,440
maybe as if there's care kindness

58
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:01,840
that envelops this particular sensations of inhale as inhale begins

59
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,120
and exhale

60
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:19,200
perhaps an inner softness gentleness that surrounds

61
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:28,840
the sensations of breathing that receives them holds them

62
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,799
no matter how the breathing is

63
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:05,679
comfortable or uncomfortable there's a wider field of the body

64
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:13,200
that is able to receive and hold softly accept

65
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:20,720
allow maybe even have a quality of

66
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:27,720
love and compassion the breathing itself

67
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:48,880
and then within your body see if if it's accessible

68
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,799
see if there's a place that you associate with warmth and goodwill

69
00:19:54,799 --> 00:20:02,000
kindness maybe a tenderness softness

70
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
within

71
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,760
and perhaps the breathing

72
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:22,640
can move through that tenderness

73
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,720
or wash across it

74
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:43,520
and from a tender place within bring to mind using your imagination

75
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,600
some person that's easy for you to have good will

76
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,720
someone you respect someone you care for and

77
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,279
love or appreciate deeply

78
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:11,520
it doesn't have to be someone you might most obviously love

79
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:17,760
it could be someone that you very much appreciate and it's easy to have a kind regard for

80
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:23,360
them and bring to mind maybe

81
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:30,240
this person may be imagining when they're there's a smile on their face or they

82
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,880
look happy

83
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,640
they have the potential for happiness and well-being

84
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:51,440
and then keeping this image or keeping the idea of this person in mind

85
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,840
maybe with the breathing breathing from your tender

86
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:03,760
place breathing towards the person back and forth

87
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:09,440
you can repeat these phrases that i say

88
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,919
may you be happy

89
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:27,158
may you be safe

90
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,880
may you be healthy

91
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,840
may you be free

92
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:15,840
yeah and we'll do it again and the last word of each sentence

93
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,520
let that say it during the exhale

94
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:28,159
as if you're dropping a pebble in a pond dropping this word into the core of your

95
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:35,000
being and letting it reverberate outwards

96
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:43,039
the warmth the glow the goodness that it evokes

97
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,880
it goes in the direction of the person that you're directed you're having your

98
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,440
good goodwill

99
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:02,120
may you be happy

100
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,360
may you be safe

101
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,679
may you be healthy

102
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:59,000
may you be free

103
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:23,279
feeling your body feeling whatever softness and tenderness

104
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:29,840
there is within that can be receptive and open

105
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:37,919
with tender care tender appreciation

106
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:45,600
goodwill as we do this practice

107
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:52,960
have a very low bar for perfection

108
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:01,760
that whatever way you're doing it can do it is perfect

109
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,720
feeling your body maybe again

110
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:22,559
the sensations of breathing received in a soft caring

111
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,840
field within the body

112
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,080
relaxing on the exhale

113
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,799
quieting the mind on the exhale

114
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:02,080
and now bring to mind yourself

115
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:10,400
maybe at a time in your life when you were happy when you had a smile on your face

116
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:17,679
or a sparkle in your eye or were any ease

117
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:23,279
in your being appreciating your potential for

118
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,000
well-being

119
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,879
and now you can say these phrases

120
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:42,400
keeping yourself in mind wishing yourself well

121
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:49,720
seeing whatever good will you can have for yourself

122
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,000
so you can repeat may i

123
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,200
be happy

124
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:16,440
may i be safe

125
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:29,720
may i be healthy

126
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:41,960
may i be free

127
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:01,200
sometimes if you hear second hand that some person has

128
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:09,440
good will for you appreciation for you it can feel very nice to feel this

129
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,559
to know that there's someone out there who thinks well of you

130
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,639
in the way that you might appreciate that

131
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:29,600
see if you can allow yourself to appreciate whatever good will you have for yourself

132
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:35,039
and saying these phrases again with the last word

133
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:40,399
being dropped in to the core of your being

134
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:47,360
and letting the associations the feelings associated with these words

135
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:52,039
reverberate within

136
00:29:54,799 --> 00:30:01,080
may i be happy

137
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:20,520
may i be healthy

138
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,679
may i be safe

139
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:53,000
may i be free

140
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:20,080
and to whatever degree you might feel or a sense of good will

141
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:25,120
well-wishing tender kindness

142
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:33,840
warmth for your friend person you appreciate or for yourself

143
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:47,840
breathe with that appreciate that however small it might be

144
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,880
in whatever way it's accessible for you

145
00:31:53,600 --> 00:32:01,840
in the body and the heart and the mind in your thinking or your feeling

146
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:13,480
and then to open up

147
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,279
to open up this goodwill as if you're

148
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:29,840
turning on a light bulb or opening all the windows in your home

149
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:36,960
and have it now spread out to wish goodwill to all beings

150
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,960
everywhere

151
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:48,880
no limitations no barriers

152
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:55,799
just an open broad spectrum's broad

153
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:03,759
feeling sense thought of goodwill for all beings

154
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,559
may all beings be happy

155
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,278
may all beings be safe

156
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:37,398
may all beings be healthy

157
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:50,200
may all beings be free

158
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:14,158
and then imagining that firsthand or secondhand or third

159
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:22,079
hand that your goodwill it becomes known by everyone in the

160
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:28,720
world so many people out there who could use

161
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:36,480
support kindness good will

162
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:43,598
and how encouraging it would be for them to know that they are not forgotten

163
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:51,358
and as if your good will actually reaches them just acknowledge that you have good will

164
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:59,359
repeat these phrases again and as you say the last words

165
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:08,319
let your mind become quiet really still as if in the silence of the mind

166
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:15,280
the word can radiate outwards

167
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,480
that quality and touch the hearts of all beings

168
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:29,640
may all beings be happy

169
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:47,680
may all beings be safe

170
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:02,880
may all beings be healthy

171
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:13,839
and may all beings be free

172
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,039
and as we come to the end of this sitting

173
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:40,319
may it be that all beings

174
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:51,640
can experience your good will and kindness your love and care

175
00:37:53,280 --> 00:38:01,920
while at the same time you make yourself safe for them

176
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:08,720
you help them be free from you

177
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,760
that your love and care has no strings

178
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:21,440
no requirements nothing sticky

179
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,640
may it be that you are a safe person

180
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:33,000
who allows every gives everyone their freedom

181
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,560
freedom from you

182
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:46,400
and maybe they will give freedom to freedom to you

183
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:52,078
and you can meet together in freedom

184
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:59,440
one of the cleanest and clearest ways for people to

185
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:07,720
love each other in the medium of their freedom

186
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:45,760
thank you so then we come now to the last talk of

187
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,400
metta the brahmavihara

188
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,560
and when this brahmavihara becomes strong

189
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:04,560
when this meta becomes strong it's said to be immeasurable or without boundaries limitless

190
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:11,920
spreading out in all directions and um

191
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,000
so you find we find in the teachings of the buddha that it seems the buddha

192
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,359
held loving kindness up to very important way to live a person's

193
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:32,000
life that it's a reference point or it's a teacher for us to uh

194
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,200
that to be kind or have good will in our speech

195
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:42,560
to have it in our actions to other people if we have to have difficult words with

196
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:47,920
someone that buddha said first make sure that you have good will

197
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:53,839
in yourself prepare yourself for that and have good will for the conversation

198
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,920
and if there's no good will then that becomes your teacher that becomes the material for

199
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:06,960
mindfulness and really see what's going on there chances are if there's no good will that

200
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:14,240
you're not really granting other people their freedom giving them their freedom

201
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,800
and i like to think that the freedom that buddhism is championing the liberation

202
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:26,720
that buddhism is about is less your liberation

203
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:34,800
that you become liberated and more that you give liberation to all things that all things

204
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,000
now become free of you and

205
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:47,599
so freedom so good will cultivating goodwill is a

206
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:53,680
very helpful it's healing it's developing it's a wonderful way to

207
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:58,880
develop a kind of a a

208
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:04,880
non-striving non conceited

209
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:11,599
approach to doing mindfulness practice to meditation to develop concentration and mindfulness uh in a field of

210
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:18,560
goodwill and have that as a background and as marvelous as

211
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:23,920
goodwill is as strong as it become

212
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:30,880
it is also associated with the buddhist path of liberation

213
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:36,079
and in a variety of steps along the way as the meta practice deepens

214
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:41,599
that the liberation is part of it the first that uh

215
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:47,760
emphasized by the buddha was that when the when one's good will is strong

216
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:53,920
one is liberated from ill will with when good will is strong there's no ill will

217
00:42:53,920 --> 00:43:01,200
so no hostility and now the wood actually says it's not possible to have any ill will

218
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:06,640
aversion hostility if there is a meta

219
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:13,440
so to cultivate and develop meta to get a hang of it and understand it and make it have it accessible

220
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,480
it helps us to be free of ill will and this idea of making it accessible

221
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:23,599
being familiar with it developing a habit almost a habit or

222
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:29,040
practicing it developing it thinking about it so that when you need it it's available

223
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:35,920
you know how to find it in yourself or to evoke it in a genuine way in a way that's really

224
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:42,240
has integrity to it not something that is uh kind of a just a

225
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:48,400
surface coating of ourselves and um

226
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:57,119
as a meta meditation if we do this as a meditation practice as it deepens

227
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:02,960
then at some point a person that could do with any good meditation practice eventually becomes

228
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:08,560
liberated freed from the hindrances and this is a really appreciated

229
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:15,119
tremendously in the tradition so much though it's called a kind of a preliminary liberation

230
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:20,880
to no longer be caught in the hindrances and it means that when the mind is no longer

231
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:27,200
under the sway of desires and aversions and sloth and

232
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:32,319
torpor and restlessness regrets and doubt and to have the mind no longer under its

233
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:38,079
way no longer under the power of those is a phenomenally wonderful way of being

234
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:43,119
and it clears the heart it clears the mind and then loving kindness has a

235
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:49,599
clear feel to develop and now it could develop much more uninterruptedly

236
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:57,760
and it can deepen and deepen and as a meditation practice it can become boundless as i read yesterday

237
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:05,599
in all directions and when the lovingkindness becomes quite strong comes kind of all pervading

238
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:11,280
or fills us or this is not ultimate this is not the end

239
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:17,599
of the path in buddhism so it's important if you want to do the buddhist path to liberation

240
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:23,760
to not take experiences of boundless love where

241
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:29,599
some people have these wonderful feelings of love or good will or kindness that have no object but seems

242
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:35,040
to radiate in all directions it just seems like everything is touched like midas is touch

243
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:41,680
everything is touched with our good will our love our kindness and it's sometimes called

244
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:48,480
in the tradition it's called wet love and moist love and they have kind of everything gets

245
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:55,520
moistened by our good will and a kindness but to go further

246
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:01,359
this loving kindness practice when done well and strongly is can be a foundation

247
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:07,680
for liberation itself and and so to not stop at uh there but go

248
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:13,040
further there's a story in the ancient texts of a disciple of the buddhist buddha

249
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:18,560
sariputta visiting a man who was dying and

250
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:24,480
and taught him the practice of the brahma viharas to practice these

251
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:30,960
and the man was able to practice him quite deeply and was able to die in this beautiful state of

252
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:36,160
one of the brahmaghara's goodwill or compassion and

253
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:41,760
when the buddha heard about this he told sariputta something like a parapher phrase it well

254
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:46,880
that was nice but actually why didn't you teach him

255
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:53,359
liberation as well because that man was poised ready to really set his mind free

256
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:58,640
and so it's possible to do love and kindness and then

257
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:05,200
go one step further and really do the ultimate act of kindness for oneself or for the world

258
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:10,560
and that is to really let go and be liberated in a very deep way

259
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:17,119
and it's a letting go of the every remnant every trace every

260
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:23,280
foundation within us of the forces within us that lead to suffering

261
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:28,319
so letting go of clinging makes room

262
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:35,520
for love more love and the fundamental letting go liberation is letting go of clinging

263
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:41,119
and without clinging then what is there what's available what sensitivity is

264
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:47,280
there what receptivity what what feelings and connection do we have to the world

265
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:52,640
and so to use loving-kindness as a basis for liberation

266
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:58,720
one of the one of the ins it requires a variety of insights and one of the insights is when the mind

267
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:04,880
is very very still abiding in love imagine that that everything the mind feels and touches

268
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:12,480
and experiences is touched with kind of love for everywhere it's like that characterizes the mind

269
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:17,520
very stable but then to have an insight that

270
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:23,599
this also is conditioned this also is kind of a kind of a certain way constructed

271
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:29,359
not to make it the absolute like this is the nature of the universe this is the nature of the cosmos that everything is

272
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:35,440
love it can feel that way but in the buddhist meditation we don't want to end there

273
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:40,960
but to see oh this too in some deep way is a construct is a

274
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:46,880
is a a movement of the mind activity of the mind to

275
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:53,359
experience this to have it this way and seeing it as being a construct and

276
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:59,920
seeing it as being impermanent seeing it as being inconstant seeing that it there are there are there

277
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:06,480
is something beyond it or between it or underneath it that has vast space

278
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:13,119
where the deep letting go of clinging can happen and so um

279
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:18,400
or to have in doing that to have some sense that there is something more

280
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:25,920
as profound and ultimate as great love can be in deep meditation practice very stable

281
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:31,680
there comes an intuition a sense that there is something else

282
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:36,960
there is freedom and that freedom

283
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:43,040
uh you know is not a thing it's the absence of clinging

284
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:50,240
and and to be there at this tremendously

285
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:56,720
pleasant enjoyable safe satisfying healing place of love

286
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:02,079
and then to understand that oh there i can let go further

287
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:08,160
that whatever sense of self i have who's the one who loves that's not quite the end of the path

288
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:15,760
there's something beyond that sense if i just put that down and have no self-referencing

289
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:22,319
if i last little kind of leaning into it and wanting it letting go there's something more beyond

290
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:28,880
love and in a certain way even love drops away completely the good will this boundless

291
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:34,240
field drops away in liberation

292
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:41,680
and this place of radical non-clinging is one of the safest most wonderful and

293
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:50,000
peaceful places that a person can ever experience it's the culmination of a wish to

294
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,520
be free of suffering and to know that freedom

295
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:01,920
and to come back without clinging then the good will we've been cultivating and

296
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:07,599
developing then that good will can feel connected to others can feel

297
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:14,720
open to others can have love for others compassion and good will and

298
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:21,200
and there's no need no desire no clinging to need to get something back from

299
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:28,079
someone else to rely for other people for our safety or our security our

300
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:33,280
status our admiration our sense of worth

301
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:40,240
our sense of satisfaction our pleasure that then the love this beautiful thing

302
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:45,359
we can offer our love to the world and the love is safe

303
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:51,520
people are free from us in our love and this is a this is a

304
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:56,960
fantastic thing to be able to love and the love itself carries with it

305
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:02,640
the gift of freedom where everyone becomes free

306
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:08,240
of us so it's a deep interconnection

307
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:13,760
without any need and then people can be as they are

308
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:20,559
and if they become free then as i said earlier one of the one of the really wonderful things

309
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:28,400
is when two free people meet in love in good will and kindness

310
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:35,200
each one either one needing something from the other but each one being able to delight and

311
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:40,800
enjoy each other and their good will between them

312
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:47,040
so thank you that's our week on metta and

313
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:53,040
lovingkindness and then on monday we'll begin with the next brahmavihara

314
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:59,040
which is karuna compassion and i wish you all well and

315
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:05,040
may you spend this weekend maybe reflecting thinking talking about

316
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:10,480
and practicing with loving kindness and goodwill

317
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:15,480
wherever you go thank you

318
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:07,119
