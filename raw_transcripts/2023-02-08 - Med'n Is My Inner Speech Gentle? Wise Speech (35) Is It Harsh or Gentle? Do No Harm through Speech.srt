9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,940
so let's uh let's begin let's begin to sit together

10
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:10,740
ah choosing a posture an intentional

11
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,320
posture that is supportive for you

12
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,820
In This Moment In Time

13
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:30,420
if you are sitting you could be lying down or standing as

14
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,360
well but if you are sitting allow your back to have an upright sense

15
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,619
a sense of integrity

16
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,360
as if you're sitting tall like a mountain

17
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:58,220
the Integrity of your body mirroring your inner integrity

18
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:04,938
your inner intentions for integrity

19
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,959
let there be a brightness

20
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,800
a form that feels wholesome in your posture

21
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,540
but not effortful not effortful

22
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:38,879
might be able to imagine An Invisible Thread connected to the top

23
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:45,660
of your head pulling your head gently up supporting you up invisibly

24
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:53,280
ah spine straightening vertebrae by

25
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,280
vertebrae and yet the rest of your body the soft tissue the muscles can

26
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:07,099
relax and relax give their weight to the Earth

27
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,540
bringing down down the center of gravity that's often

28
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:59,400
in our head somewhere around her head with thoughts I bring the center of gravity of your

29
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:06,239
being down through redirecting your attention down

30
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,420
down down [Music] and your face

31
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:20,000
down your neck and your chest and your heart center

32
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,800
proverbial hard Center of the chest

33
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:39,360
place of wholeheartedness emotions and then continuing to move

34
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,400
your awareness center of gravity

35
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:53,300
of your beingness down through your diaphragm foreign

36
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,680
[Music]

37
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,820
your lower abdomen your sit bones

38
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:02,880
and let the center of gravity be in the lower abdomen said bones maybe touching into the lower

39
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,479
the upper legs lower legs and feet as well

40
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:16,699
but receiving receiving the breath and the lower abdomen

41
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:22,440
as if the body itself is an organ of perception

42
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:28,380
perceiving receiving the breath knowing the breath knowing Sensations

43
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:32,240
not from the control tower of the head

44
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,840
letting the body the heart be soft relaxed

45
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,680
upright and relax

46
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,860
In This Moment tonight

47
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:12,259
and if any thoughts arise any inner speech

48
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:18,319
gently kindly no it's important to know

49
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:27,199
oh what is the tone what is the quality of this inner speech of this thought

50
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:35,520
we started with inquiry is it true is it factual

51
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:43,500
is it different true for self-judgment you're a terrible meditator or some such

52
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:51,440
opinion is it even true yes it do and true said even factual

53
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:59,180
a sense of humor challenging the facts of this opinion

54
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,519
the thought is about others is it divisive

55
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,339
said harmonious

56
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:28,019
no today especially noticing let's say gentle or is it

57
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:34,260
sinner speech tone especially when it's directed towards

58
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:40,260
ourselves oh sweetheart no need for any harsh tone

59
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,100

60
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:52,320
kindness kindness and after knowing after the knowing the

61
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:58,940
landscape of the Mind releasing releasing

62
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:09,860
and letting the breath in the lower part of the body the sensations of the breath

63
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:17,760
aches and restraint Center Stage Center Stage

64
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,839
in our awareness that's all

65
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:54,180
is the way you're receiving the breath you're listening to the breath the sensations of the

66
00:12:54,180 --> 00:13:01,879
breath does it have gentleness or harshness in your listening

67
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,399
in your receiving of the sensations

68
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:20,660
what's the posture of the mind of the heart

69
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,279
foreign

70
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:03,020
our bodies are attuning Fork

71
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:10,039
paying attention by knowing

72
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,700
it's happening in the body

73
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:24,919
we know it's what's present in the mind the quality the quality of Earth

74
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:30,120
intention speech inner speech

75
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,679
by calming the body

76
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,440
kindness we can realign and soothe a mind

77
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:05,000
and as we bring set to a close together

78
00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:12,840

[Music]

94
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:58,700
greetings greetings everyone

95
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:07,580
so today our third day of of exploring together the topic of why speech

96
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:15,480
and um on Monday we started with the first

97
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:21,960
um question to ask ourselves and by the way all of these go together all these six

98
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:29,279
that I will be sharing so so if one of the conditions is not met and the last one I want to give you a heads up the

99
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:36,659
last one I'll be sharing on Friday is is it timely is it the right time so even if it's if it's not divisive and it's

100
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:44,760
true and it's today we'll talk about gentleness it's not harsh um uh if it's kind all is everything is

101
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:50,039
is uh satisfied still if it's not the right time then we don't say it so so

102
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:56,220
all of these go together um so I wanted to add a little bit of nuance actually to the teachings from

103
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:03,360
yesterday and and the day before before we um going to the new question today to ask

104
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:08,640
ourselves if our speech is Harsh abusive or is it gentle so that's the new

105
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:14,820
question and and on Monday we talked about is it true and factual and um and

106
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:19,919
yesterday the question was is it um is it divisive is is this speech

107
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,860
divisive what are we about to say divisive or does it create Harmony

108
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:30,720
so a couple of nuances to add to the teachings one as I already mentioned

109
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:37,080
that they all go together um all the questions and the other

110
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:43,559
Nuance um is regarding um truthfulness

111
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:50,520
um is what we're about to say true but it doesn't mean that we just blurt out

112
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:55,679
everything that is true all the time because of course there is wisdom in

113
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:01,080
what is appropriate to say when how all of those other considerations come

114
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:06,840
together come come in um and also again together with the

115
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:13,580
other considerations with truthfulness often um folks bring up this this hypothetical

116
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:22,019
situation oh if I were say if I were alive during the World War II and I was

117
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:28,100
um uh giving safe keeping to to people who were

118
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:35,580
persecuted at the time and they were hiding them in my basement and and and say soldiers Nazis knocked on the door

119
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:43,380
would I have to tell him the truth well I appreciate the the um people who think

120
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:50,220
this way and and really try to engage with what what does truthfulness actually mean there was a bigger

121
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:57,240
question of what is of benefit what is kind of 360 degrees what if what is of

122
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:03,960
benefit what is of least harm so in this case telling a lie that saves a life in

123
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:09,898
this case of someone who's Prosecuting the bigger picture of all things of course it makes sense so it's it's not

124
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:15,260
about um sticking to a particular rule without

125
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:20,638
context without um non-harming this this this

126
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:26,040
um wish for greater goodness and non-harming in a bigger way so

127
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:33,898
it's so important always to to um bring in the context which again maybe this this inquiry or this question

128
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:41,280
in a uh uh more um how should I put it in a uh more

129
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:47,099
casual or or disinquiring a more casual way when somebody you know puts on

130
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:53,398
address and tells you do I look fat you don't blurt out yes you you know you just have to be a little Kinder you know

131
00:34:53,399 --> 00:35:00,480
the other other aspects of kindness come in but how can you be but um

132
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:09,720
and nevertheless the the this this precept uh of of not lying not shading

133
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:14,760
the truth really has to do with the intentions really it goes back to the intentions and that's something I've

134
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:20,640
been trying to stress how does it feel in the body why are we lying is it for

135
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:27,000
uh our gain is it because of hatred like what is what is the underlying intention

136
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:34,140
motivation so really let that be the guide um is are we deceiving in order to get

137
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:39,540
some gain similarly similarly

138
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:47,640
the what I mentioned yesterday with the question of is it harmonious or divisive

139
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:53,160
also there's wisdom there you know you don't want again not divide people up

140
00:35:53,160 --> 00:36:02,099
because you want your friends to just be your friends and break people up you take joy in in Discord

141
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:08,480
um again it comes back to the intention however Buddha also has teachings about if say something has happened

142
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:15,119
say something has happened and another person is invited to say did you

143
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:20,880
see something you know that person is supposed to say what what has happened you know what did they see if

144
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:27,359
um in in a way say um uh if your friend is about to let's say

145
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:32,940
hire someone um who you know is going to be a really

146
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:37,980
bad match um and and it's not going to work out

147
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:45,119
for a variety of reasons of course it's not wise to hold back oh I don't want to be divisive like what is the intention

148
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:50,640
here the intention you need to out of kindness for everyone with the heart of

149
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:57,900
loving kindness for everyone involved oh this this is given these facts in the past maybe you

150
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:04,500
share but this is what this is what you need to know again out

151
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:12,240
of kindness out of kindness or always goes back to the intention and and what is happening in the the body

152
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:18,060
um uh and and in the mind in terms of intentionality so

153
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:25,079
so now with with those nuances it was very important nuances adding more and

154
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:31,859
more layers as we continue this week the third question to ask is is it harsh

155
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:38,420
is it abusive speech what the way I'm about to speak or is it gentle

156
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:45,060
so so the Buddha instructors of course to abandon speech that is spoken in

157
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:50,579
anger or with a mean sarcasm intended to

158
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:58,500
demean to insult to cause pain to make someone feel bad it just it's it's it

159
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:04,140
has it has shards in its speech that has shards in it

160
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:10,260
laughs this kind of abusive said in an angry

161
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:15,540
tone is often is um the root of it is aversion the root of it is hatred one of

162
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:21,780
the three poisonous roots um a very agreed hatred and and the

163
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:27,960
illusion so aversion is its root and it's often impulsive it doesn't

164
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:35,460
involve forethought the same way that Slanders and divisive speech that we talked about yesterday did so slander's

165
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:41,700
speech has doubly heavy Karma because it's both has its as its root has has um

166
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:48,359
hatred and it it involves forethought but but just a slightly lighter Karma

167
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:54,480
this has lighter Karma because it's impulsive just we're just angrily and in a mean way we just say something and

168
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:00,480
maybe later we feel bad and yet ouch we both heard our Karma we've heard the other person the ripples in the world

169
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:07,320
the Ripples and the way it's affected us ouch ouch ouch um

170
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:13,859
still on skillful even if it has a lighter negative Karma of course

171
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:20,700
um the antidote the antidote to to this type of unskillful speech is patience is

172
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:27,300
the parames the beautiful quality of patience patience patience

173
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:32,400
so if you find yourself to be someone who just blurts something out and

174
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,500
regrets it later in in a angry tone in a

175
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:44,940
in a sarcastic rebuking demeaning insulting it's like ouch out and you feel about patience in that moment

176
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:50,760
it could pause come back to the body just not speaking is the best thing causing

177
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:56,760
the least harm causing the least harm is the best method and later when you

178
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:03,000
have your calm the right time then you can address it so patience

179
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:11,339
patience patience beautiful quality of the heart and of course when speaking wisely is is

180
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:18,900
just impossible in a particular situation our secondary goal becomes causing the least harm the least harm

181
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:24,960
to ourselves to our own karma really causing ourselves harm with with unwise

182
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,680
speech and of course to others and to the relationships that we have to others

183
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:37,079
and then the Buddha instructs us instructs us to um not just abandon

184
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:43,859
harsh speech but speak gently and and I love these words the Buddha directs us

185
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:51,240
to speak words that are soothing to the ear affectionate go to the heart

186
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:57,000
or light likable and agreeable to the people I'll read

187
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:04,560
them one more time it's like poetry so pleasure like poetry speak words one speaks speak speaks

188
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:11,220
words that are soothing to the ear affectionate go to the heart

189
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:17,839
polite likeable and agreeable to the people

190
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:26,339
this reading that is goes to my heart and feels affectionate the Buddha really I

191
00:41:26,339 --> 00:41:32,040
it's almost as I hear his his affection and kindness through the Through the

192

194
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:51,240
um my invitation is to notice um is it harsh is it is it gentle or is it

195
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:59,040
harsh and oh yes another thing I want to add especially is with this one in particular not just

196
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:06,480
external speech our external speech might actually be gentler and gentler than our internal speech sometimes we

197
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:13,560
speak to ourselves in tones that we would never ever bear or or want to use

198
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:19,440
with others or so that the tone can be so harsh so are so ouch
