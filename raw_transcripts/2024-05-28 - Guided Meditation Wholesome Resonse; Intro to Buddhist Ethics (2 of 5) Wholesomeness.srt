00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:07,399
hello everyone and welcome and welcome here to IMC where

2
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:17,240
I'm sitting inside Meditation Center in Redwood City and uh very happy to be here with

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:24,760
you so for the meditation today I'd like

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:31,759
to emphasize a very important point and that is

5
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:37,000
that the the key to finding this Freedom

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,039
that Buddhism Freedom that can be found in meditation that Buddhism points to is

7
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:50,760
supported a lot by understanding or focusing on how we respond to what is

8
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,680
happening sometimes I've done the emphasis that there's always only two things ever

9
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:05,478
happening what's happening and our relationship to what's happening the way we but even more so the way that we

10
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:10,880
respond and that we want to kind of really stay close to how we

11
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,960
respond more than being caught up in what is happening so if

12
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:23,640
um if it's a hot day we could be a victim of the hot day

13
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:30,119
we could be troubled by it and upset with it and complain about it maybe

14
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:35,159
and uh or we can notice it's a hot day

15
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:41,040
the the heat is uncomfortable and I'm I'm going to stay

16
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:49,079
present for it I'm going to be open to it I'm going to um uh allow it to be there without

17
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:54,159
reactivity without judgment I will stay present and mindful

18
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,280
of the experience even though it's uncomfortable so we're taking the

19
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,640
initiative to engage in a way to be present that has to do with how we are

20
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,640
relationship to it that we there's a freedom there's a engagement there's a

21
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:18,000
capacity to know and so always every moment we're

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,160
in we have the opportunity to respond to what's

23
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,599
happening instead of reacting to what's happening which has no freedom in it we

24
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:36,360
take take we we take refuge in that place where we have some modum of

25
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:44,640
choice to be present to be mindful to be aware it's kind of like U uh in that way

26
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,000
we're always in the present moment the response to what's happening is a present moment it's kind of

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,440
like having caught the wave and now we're on the on the front

28
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,760
of the wave being carried by it rather than being in the wave and twirled

29
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,760
around in the Water by the wave so we're there riding it with awareness with

30
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:15,680
attention and the key thing here is that we're learning to the respond how to

31
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,879
respond in ways that are skillful ways that are

32
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:30,319
wholesome avoiding the unskillful UNH wholesome responses avoiding reactivity

33
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:38,239
avoiding uh being caught in the hindrances being caught by greed hate and delusion being caught by negativity

34
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,280
or judgment or conceit around what's

35
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:51,239
happening and instead to in be respond in ways that are deeply satisfying

36
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,599
respond in ways that are nourishing which is one of the meanings of

37
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:02,959
wholesome and um so to be able to respond with a simple clear awareness

38
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,920
that's maybe kind maybe compassionate to be present and recognize oh this is

39
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:16,720
what's happening and do so with a gentleness with an openness without a criticism without a big story

40
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:23,240
interpretation opinion but always to what's what's the the

41
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:29,479
wholesome uh response maybe it's a generous response maybe it's kind maybe

42
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:34,840
it's loving maybe it's friendly maybe it's wise maybe it's

43
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:43,320
patience maybe it's um meeting it with ethical Integrity maybe it's meeting with um

44
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:49,039
with uh appreciating the value of Truth telling being really honest oh this is what's

45
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:54,400
happening and uh and appreciating oh honesty is really a nourishing thing in

46
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,199
itself even though what we're honest about is difficult so every moment

47
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:07,919
we have the opportunity to respond in a way that is nourishing wholesome

48
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:13,440
beneficial nice and that's what I'd like to emphasize for today's

49
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:20,240
meditation try that and if you try too hard and it's stressful to do it or if

50
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,919
you are judging yourself or not doing it well enough all those are unskillful UNH

51
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:33,080
wholesome take refuge in the wholesome a wholesome way of staying in the

52
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:40,880
present a Wholesome Way of riding the wave of the of a present

53
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:49,080
moment experience in this way you can think whatever you think you

54
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:56,919
can feel whatever you feel what's important is how you

55
00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:03,600
respond to what you think and what you feel can you respond in a way

56
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:10,880
that where you're free you are free enough to respond

57
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,000
independent of what's Happening free enough to respond with

58
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,360
kindness with truthfulness with

59
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:30,440
mindfulness so assuming a meditation posture and closing your eyes

60
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:44,120
and and before anything else just sitting here quietly for a few

61
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:53,639
moments taking in the experience of your body how is your body right

62
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,560
now and what would be a wholesome

63
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:12,199
way to stay present aware of your body whatever state your body is in

64
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:47,800
become aware of your breathing whatever way your breathing is whether it's comfortable or

65
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:54,639
uncomfortable whatever state your breathing is let it be that

66
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:00,560
way but know it be aware of it

67
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:09,319

68
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:16,000
beratement know it in a way that feels kind

69
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:23,199

70
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:29,599

71
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,840

72
00:08:52,240 --> 00:09:01,440
way noticing what's going on in your mind your thoughts your thought string

73
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:16,440
Nam see if your response to whatever your thought stream

74
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:22,399

75
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:31,360
good for you because it's friendly or kind or a simple truth

76
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:40,680
telling where you are not defined by your thought stream

77
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,560
and then settling into the body's experience of

78
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:29,959
breathing as if the rhythm of breathing

79
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:41,959
is the ongoing basis for responding meeting the present

80
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:51,519
moment in a Wholesome Way not straining not

81

yourself to bring about a Wholesome Way way of

98

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:49,320
feel nourished feel

105
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,320
satisfied by the effort you

for for

111
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,400
perhaps a subtle feeling of Vitality

112
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,799
of energy aliveness in your

113
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:15,080
body can be the wave that you're surfing on gently softly

114
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:29,840
slowly and the surfboard on which you surf

115
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,840
is kindness or honesty or

116
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:43,480
gentleness something that feels wholesome a

117
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,679
goodness being carried

118
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,880
along in the wave of the present

119
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
moment

120
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
for

121
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440

for e

125
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,240
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

126
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:40,840
to turn your thoughts and your heart out into the

127
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:47,360
world and from the vantage point of sitting in

128
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:56,080
meditation can you gaze upon the world reflect on the

129
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:06,320
world in a Wholesome Way way the world that is full of good and

130
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,960
bad the world that's full

131
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:19,600
of people who benefit each other and harm each other with all its challenges

132
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:26,720
and all its Joys to gaze upon it in a

133
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:33,799
way as if your gaze your consideration is the

134
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:45,440
food on which the world will grow and offer the food of wholesomeness

135
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:54,840

149
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,118
[Music]

150
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,679
thank you

151
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:11,480
so welcome to this second talk on uh an introduction to Buddhist

152
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:16,960
ethics and I'm trying to pro pro provide you with some of the

153
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:23,919
foundational attitudes approaches principles that supports Buddhist

154
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:29,200
ethics and yesterday I talked about

155
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:37,360
uh the role of harmlessness non-harming today I want to talk about a

156
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:43,840
very two very important terms I'll give you the PO the ancient Buddhist word for

157
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:53,039
it first and uh and then and then discuss them and these uh two uh the two

158
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:58,559
words are cusa k s u l a

159
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:05,240
and ausa uh so cusa is generally translated

160
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:11,120
as either skillfulness or

161
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:17,760
wholesomeness different translators translate them in different ways but if you look

162
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:24,639
for a poly word ancient Buddhist word that most closely matches the English

163
00:32:24,639 --> 00:32:30,960
word ethics this would be the word there's very hard to find a good word

164
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:38,240
that matches the word ethics really well uh in p uh with uh kind of the more

165
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:43,840
sophisticated or way which ethics is understood but the closest I believe is

166
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:49,480
as Kusa so it's a very important word and it's very significant that the word

167
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,799
for ethics can also mean wholesomeness and it could also mean

168
00:32:54,799 --> 00:33:03,200
skillfulness so skillfulness refers to that it's useful uh it's skillful it's uh uh one

169
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,600
can develop a skill that is onward leading to something

170
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:14,519
beneficial so uh this is the word skillful is uh the best translation in

171
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:19,679
the context of meditation we want to develop skill the skill of meditation

172
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:25,840
the skill of of spiritual practice and uh and it's a skill that we develop over

173
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:32,200
time it's like a training that uh we're training over and over again we're

174
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:40,720
practicing to become skillful in something so skillful in attention skillful in concentration skillful in um

175
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:46,720
mindfulness skillful in equinity just a whole range of things we're de

176
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:52,880
developing some of them are developing as a byproduct of doing basic mindfulness

177
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:58,080
practice uh it's not something we have to actively intentionally develop but um

178
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,399
we are slowly developing this skill and

179
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:13,000
um and the other word is uh translation is wholesomeness which uh uh I I kind of

180
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,679
interpret in as almost same terms as nourishing that which is feels really

181
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:23,839
good and nourishing for our whole system for our body mind and heart it's

182
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:30,800
wholesome there's a goodness to it there's a a very satisfying feeling of rightness

183
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:37,398
goodness that comes when we feel wholesome we feel what we're doing is wholesome there's an inner goodness to

184
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:44,158
it perhaps and um and so so much so that just doing the activity in a Wholesome

185
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:50,960
Way is deeply satisfying it's almost enough in itself just that we're doing it in this way and some activities that

186
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,520
we do maybe it doesn't matter so much if we're successful or not what matters is

187
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:04,000
that that was really to do that um and uh so I mean what comes to mind

188
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,359
is offering our seat and taking a bus and someone clearly maybe uh could use

189
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:16,320
your the seat B more than you you do and so you stand up and offer the seat but

190
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,720
maybe the person doesn't notice or declines and so you were unsuccessful

191
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:27,280
and offering the seat however uh so the purpose of the action you failed in a

192
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:33,119
sense however just the fact that you were uh offering the seat felt nourishing it

193
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:38,280
felt it came from the inner goodness a generosity a Simplicity of being the

194
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:43,720
kind of wholesomeness where there was nothing dependent on the outcome it were

195
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:49,480
looking for praise we're looking for Success it just like was a good thing in and of itself to

196
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:58,319
offer and there's no disappointment that the person didn't take your seat so uh what's also nice about

197
00:35:58,319 --> 00:36:03,640
translating Kusa as ethics as um as

198
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:09,400
skillful is that as we um

199
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:16,000
um uh rather than asking the question is it ethical to do this or

200
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:24,400
unethical uh which carries a lot of connotations in English which are not so useful uh we ask is it skillful or we

201
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:30,800
say that was an unskillful thing to do rather saying that was a wrong thing to do or that was a bad thing to do or that

202
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:38,480
was an unethical thing to do it takes a certain kind of um uh judgmentalism or

203
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:45,079
certain kind of uh punitive quality out of our statements we're making uh and it

204
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:50,880
kind of focuses more on the the uh is it beneficial or not beneficial is it

205
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,960
useful and un relating in a good way or is it not so Buddhists will often ask

206
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:01,560
that question um someone has a difficult and challenging uh decision to make and

207
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:08,599
someone will they make a decision this is what I'd like to do what do you think and is it right that I do this and

208
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:15,880
rather than answering that it's right and wrong it's common to answer the question um is it skillful or I think

209
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:23,800
that's skillful or I think that's unskillful and then you can ask the question you know what is skillful or

210
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:29,800
what's more skillful or um and then but uh in particular what I would emphasize

211
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:36,760
today is the translation of Kusa as wholesome uh wholesome has a beauty to

212
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:43,280
it wholesome has a something nourishing and satisfying feels really good and uh

213
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:49,640
and to live our life uh with this uh in relationship to this possibility we have

214
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:55,880
of inner beauty inner goodness inner wholesomeness inner nourishment as we go

215
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:02,040
through our lives that we can benefit ourselves internally from how we live

216
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:07,200
our life as opposed to feeling and recognizing that the way I go through my

217
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,480
life um yes I'm right and I'm right to be angry I'm right to be critical I I

218
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:19,680
have I'm Wiser more Discerning to other people I see what they don't see and and so I'm upset with them and critical of

219
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:25,680
them and aversive yes you might have you might have a lot of wisdom that allows you to

220
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:31,720
see that but that attitude of aversion that attitude of criticalness doesn't

221
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:37,240
produce nourishment for the heart doesn't make the heart smile or feel

222
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:43,920
feel delighted or feel content in itself and this capacity to really do the

223
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:50,560
things that act in the world so that there's a feeling of deep satisfaction

224
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:58,440
contentment happiness for how we go about our life this is possible and this is a

225
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:04,640
foundation for Buddhist ethics uh considering whether something is skillful or

226
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:12,000
unskillful considering whether it's wholesome or UNH wholesome and this wholesome quality uh

227
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:19,000
gives ethics a very different quality than uh a set of rules that either you

228
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,839
you follow or you don't you're breaking a rule you're a bad person because you

229
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:32,520
did something wrong but rather you're doing things that um are not rule-based

230
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:40,560
exactly uh in a narrow kind of way as Commandments that you you have to do something this way and it's either or

231
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:46,200
and but rather your reference point for how to live an ethical life is from a

232
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:53,160
deep sense of what brings uh a kind of deep sense of Joyful satisfaction some

233
00:39:53,160 --> 00:40:00,640
feeling of wholesomeness a kind of a wholesomeness that has a kind of ethical Integrity to

234
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,400
it but not because we're being puritanical or being holding to uh

235
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:12,480
holding to rules in a tight way but rather because we know we recognize that

236
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:19,720
this is actually for our own benefit this is how we grow if you want to grow a plant you

237
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:26,920
want to make sure that it has sunlight and then it can grow if you want to grow a human being you want to make sure that

238
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:32,599
it has a the sunlight of our own inner warmth and uh and to be able to

239
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:39,560
recognize that now it's not all that easy for many of us to find that inner warmth and

240
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:45,800
inner wholesome attitude that we have but that's one of the purposes of

241
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:52,640
training that's one of the purposes of learning how to be skillful skillfully begin finding the ways we can maybe in

242
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:59,520
small steps one of the ways to learn it to appreciate this is to really appreciate

243
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:04,760
this very precise refined maybe difficult but very

244
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:11,760
simple idea that um what is what is happening what

245
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:19,119
occurs in the moment it's just what occurs we don't have to Define ourselves

246
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:25,000
by it we don't have to be critical by by it but what arises what

247
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:31,520
occurs how can we meet that how can we relate to that in a way that feels

248
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:37,960
wholesome so it's kind of like the next step we take if you take a step and you

249
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:45,960
you move forward onto that forward foot you're kind of committed that's what's happening but the next step is all about

250
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:52,720
a new world The Next Step you can put your foot down a little bit different direction you can take a longer step or

251
00:41:52,720 --> 00:42:00,240
shorter step step over on a step onto a rock above the muddy ground ground if you wish but you have choices about the

252
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:06,760
next step so whatever is happening is the ground upon which you're standing

253
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:12,560
and there's a Next Step the next moment can that be a wholesome step can that be

254
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:18,440
a step that's you attentive to you stay present for and can you take that step

255
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:26,920
in a way that carries in it um an attitude of Peace an attitude

256
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:34,079
of friendliness an attitude of um Integrity honesty an attitude of

257
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:40,240
kindness an attitude of compassion or love there's a whole range of

258
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:46,920
possibilities of things which are wholesome for us but can you take the next step or can you meet each thing

259
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:52,200
that comes your way uh uh so if you have a thought and

260
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:57,599
your thought is really one of the worst thoughts a human being has ever had once

261
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:03,599
it's Arisen that's the step the next step is how do you relate to that can

262
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:09,599
you say oh wow that I feel sorry for that mind or

263
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:17,119
uh it's okay mind I'll be your friend regardless we don't have to take that thought so seriously we can just see it

264
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:22,359
h gaze upon it kindly so uh

265
00:43:22,359 --> 00:43:29,359
wholesomeness is a foundation for Buddhist ethics and it provides a foundation is very different than a

266
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:35,440
rule-based approach to ethics it provides a reference point inside that

267
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:42,480
we can begin to recognize uh how we want to live the choices we want to make that

268
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:49,640
can be understood from the outside as being in English at least as ethical choices of how we live but from the

269
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:55,720
inside they're not exactly ethical they inside they feel like the choices by

270
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:02,800
which we grow in in uh inner uh Beauty in inner wonderfulness

271
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:10,119
in inner warmth or goodness inner wholesomeness this is possible and it's

272
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:20,480
one of the foundations of Buddhist practice um and Buddhist ethics so thank you uh very much and um
