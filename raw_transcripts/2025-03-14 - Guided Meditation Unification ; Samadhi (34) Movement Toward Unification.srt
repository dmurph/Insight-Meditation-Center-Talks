00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:07,160
hello everyone and welcome to

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:13,960
our meditation together And I'll begin

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:20,400
by referring to the idea that often taught in

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,080
Buddhism that everything is impermanent And what that means in

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:34,559
essence is that everything is changing Some things are impermanent because they no don't last But some

6
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,600
things are inconstant They're in the only thing that's constant is their

7
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,200
constant movement and change And when we sit to meditate we're

8
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:52,399
entering into a world of change a world of inconstancy But this world of change and

9
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:59,760
inconstancy in meditation does not have to be random or chaotic

10
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:08,119
We are uh putting the conditions together to um uh where the change that

11
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:15,479
unfolds is a healthy one is a beneficial one That uh the change is

12
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:23,640
oriented towards being organized oriented towards gathering together

13
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:32,320
uh gathering together to be settled instead of scattered To be organized instead of

14
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:39,840
being fragmented to be uh uh centered as

15
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,920
opposed to being desentered or or

16
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:53,119
um and we can feel this movement inside of us sometimes in psychological ways We

17
00:01:53,119 --> 00:02:01,399
can feel physically that uh we lean towards what we want We pull back from what we don't

18
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:08,080
want We the mind wanders off we say and it feels like it goes far away The mind

19
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,760
can be scattered The body could be restless which is a lot of movement The

20
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:21,200
restless body can be uh feel disjointed and not working in

21
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,400
harmony And the body can feel very centered and

22
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,640
collected and settled in itself where the whole body kind of hums as a whole

23
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,879
nice together that uh it's still everything's still in constant but it feels like

24
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:45,120
everything is changing together in harmony like a well tuned engine which

25
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:52,000
is humming along very nicely and um or a well centered

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,599
wheel which is turning smoothly and nicely It's still changing and

27
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:04,879
moving And so it's possible in meditation to orient oneself around that

28
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:13,440
the movement the changing nature of phenomena and to orient oneself to the

29
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:20,200
movement towards harmony the movement towards a gathering together a

30
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:26,800
unification a coming into kind of a centered kind of everything has come

31
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:34,959
become centered and and organized So everything is working together Nothing is scattered Nothing is divided

32
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:41,440
Nothing is left out There's a feeling of wholeness That's of the whole And we're

33
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,200
coming into that wholeness Coming into that gathering And it's possible to have

34
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,599
a kind of it's very subtle but it's possible to have a feeling or a sense

35
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:59,519
that it's almost like the gravitational pull the psychological emotional

36
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:06,319
physical gravitational pull of coming together gathering together

37
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:13,920
um be uh becoming whole becoming here in a full way

38
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:20,959
I've been in crowds of people which it seemed chaotic people milling around talking but then the bell rang and then

39
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,720
you see people kind of slowly kind of gather together in a whole circle They

40
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:33,280
knew to sit in the circle but it was beautiful to watch the coming together and we had a whole circle of people and

41
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,479
a whole different feeling of of being together as a group but everyone had a

42
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,880
sense of where to go to fit into the circle So that sense of everything we

43
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:50,960
are it knows how to find itself together in harmony partly a gravitational pull

44
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:57,680
around the center So in this meditation I'd like to encourage you to

45
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,120
see if you can have this very subtle sense Some of it might be physical some

46
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,320
of it might be emotional some of it might be you know mental Very subtle

47
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:15,680
sense um like the like the subtle feeling of gravity It mostly provides us a sense of

48
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,919
weight and contact against some surface that there's something there that wants

49
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:27,199
you to come together like on a on a trampoline If you're sitting in the

50
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:34,880
middle of trampoline weighing it down a little bit all the balls that are on the trampoline will roll down to the middle

51
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:41,520
We had a trampoline with our little kids that had a lot of balls on it and and so I know what it's like to stand there or

52
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:49,919
sit there in the middle and have the balls gather So to feel the movements things

53
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:56,039
are always in motion Emotions are in

54
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:02,320
motion Thoughts are in motion In a way the body is always in

55
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:09,280
some kind of subtle motion And to have that motion all that motion

56
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:17,520
feel like it's coming together to work together So to assume a meditation

57
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:27,199
posture and think of the meditation posture the outermost form of the meditation

58
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:34,880
posture as creating a wide large

59
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:42,240
open space within which everything will fit

60
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:52,440
Everything has a chance to not be pinched not be cr scrunched

61
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,160
up and not be

62
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:05,520
forgotten Such posture in some ways maybe the chest can be more

63
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:13,199
open the spine a little more erect

64
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,120
The belly

65
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:28,120
relaxed The arms especially around the elbows are soft and

66
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:33,720
relaxed Maybe pulling the elbows a little bit closer into the sides of the

67
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:40,840
body Shaking the elbows a little bit to remind them to be relaxed

68
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:52,639
and gently closing the eyes so the eyes are not searching for

69
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:58,759
things out outside of you Instead let

70
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:06,800
the imagine maybe the gaze of the eyes is relaxed inward and

71
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:14,120
backward So the sense of seeing begins to

72
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,319
participate in this gathering

73
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:30,960
together and relaxing as you meditate in the beginning is part of this gathering

74
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:36,880
together So as you breathe in a easy

75
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:46,159
way on the exhale to relax the muscles of the

76
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,240
face around the

77
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:08,000
eyes The muscles of the cheeks and jaws imagine that they fall away from

78
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,399
the skull and and relax into the skin

79
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:36,240
relaxing the shoulders or feeling the pull of gravity

80
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,720
on the shoulders the weight of the shoulders and how there is a very very

81
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:50,120
subtle Pull for the

82
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,839
shoulders to settle

83
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:15,640
downward to feel the belly there too Is there any

84
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:22,880
subtle tendency for the belly to want to relax and

85
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:31,120
settle Or maybe you feel the opposite the tension pulling in and

86
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:41,399
up As you exhale softening the belly

87
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:57,079
And is the thinking mind activated Is there energy

88
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:02,320
activation agitation movement in the thinking

89
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:15,000
mind and the power of the moving movement of the thinking mind can be

90
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,800
strong But even there can you feel a desire a

91
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:29,680
tendency to move towards rest to move towards

92
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,640
calm And as you

93
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,920
exhale to soften

94
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,600
relax The thinking

95
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:03,720
mind And from whatever degree of calm you can

96
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:10,839
find in the mind From

97
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:20,040
there settle your awareness into the body breathing

98
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,360
The experience of

99
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:31,839
breathing Maybe that place where

100
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:40,399
breathing comes to rest The resting point at the end of the

101
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,399
exhale

102
00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:00,320
The very subtle movement towards for the exhale to move towards a

103
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:06,360
place of being settled and calm [Music]

104
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:13,000
Maybe by allowing the exhale to be a little

105
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,759
longer than normal Not by forcing

106
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:26,760
it but by relaxing more

107
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,320
And as you

108
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:16,399
inhale let the body that's around the sensations of

109
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:23,040
breathing in let Let them be relaxed and

110
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:30,360
receptive to the sensations of the body breathing in

111
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:19,639
The sensations of breathing in the body occurs

112
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:26,519
together with the sensing of those sensations

113
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:35,360
There's not really a distinction to be made between sensations and

114
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:56,959
sensing in a certain way The coming together of sensations

115
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:03,320
and sensing is where the mind and

116
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:09,320
body become intimate with each other

117
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:45,120
And if the mind is scattered or fragmented see if you can

118
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,519
gently Bring all the pieces of the mind organize

119
00:16:52,519 --> 00:17:00,639
them to be relaxed and soft to work

120
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:10,558
together to rest Move towards the sensing of the body

121
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,558
breathing

122
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:51,480
The sensations of the body breathing can be the center

123
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,600
point around everything around which everything

124
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:03,280
gathers And to feel the subtle gravitational

125
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:11,919
pull of unification becoming

126
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:19,640
whole around this experience of breathing

127
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:23,039
Feeling any calm or subtleness that's

128
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:30,559
present And in the middle of the calm and

129
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:41,840
settleness is there a movement a gathering together a settling

130
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:50,760
further Is there a centering point of the trampoline which is welcoming all

131
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:56,679
things to come to settle there at the middle

132
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:36,039
And as we come to the end of the sitting is there some

133
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:42,559
settleness some gathering together unification of

134
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:50,720
being that in and of itself itself needs nothing from

135
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:58,520
others In and of itself needs nothing but to be at home in

136
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,480
itself be centered in

137
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:16,159
itself So that as you bring to mind the world that you'll enter into

138
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:23,278
after meditation the people the work the

139
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:31,000
activities imagine entering into

140
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,200
it without any

141
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:45,600
need for it to be in any Okay Because you because you're centered

142
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,240
here And instead of

143
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:57,278
need there is good

144
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:05,640
will and care and generosity

145
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:12,039
emanating from this place of wholeness

146
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:31,080
where we can care for the world without a need Neediness

147
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,320
May all beings be

148
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:50,640
happy May all beings be

149
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:56,720
safe May all beings be

150
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:03,278
peaceful May all beings be

151
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:11,200
free And may those wishes

152
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:22,600
aspirations be the simple expression of a settled heart

153
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:36,840
[Music]

154
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,039
Thank you

155
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:29,640
So hello and welcome back to this series on

156
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:38,640
samadei And this week is a little bit of a review and getting back into the momentum of

157
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,360
the practice after I was gone for two weeks

158
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:49,799
And uh today the emphasis I'd like to make is talking about the unification

159
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:57,360
process of samadei And that samadei practice is a

160
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,480
pra practice by which uh the different

161
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:08,000
scattered parts of who we are Uh scattered energies scattered thoughts

162
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,840
begin to gather together and there's a feeling of unification feeling of of of

163
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:20,760
some people might call it a feeling of becoming whole where there's nothing

164
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:28,240
uh scattered There's nothing separated nothing cut out All all of us are

165
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,279
working together And it's a slow process to get there Some people are very

166
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:40,159
disconnected from parts of themselves They are very connected to certain parts which feels like it's maybe the whole

167
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:46,559
but maybe they're not connected to their body Some people are not connected to their emotions or some em particular

168
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:53,279
emotions Some people are so involved in their thinking that almost they don't

169
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:59,200
know their thinking Um and it is for the the field of

170
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,360
awareness to open and become wider And so this organizing unification is can be

171
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:13,320
done in two ways One is a feeling of gathering together And the other is a feeling that the awareness is getting

172
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:18,559
expansive open wider to hold it all So

173
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:25,200
it's uh um the um there's so there becomes lots of room

174
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:32,559
for everything And either way there can be a subtle feeling of movement of even

175
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:39,600
direction towards becoming whole And sometimes that wholeness is a feeling that awareness just wants to expand

176
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:46,640
outward to include it all And um so rather than zeroing in on

177
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:52,399
something which is what thinking mind or the anxious mind does or the angry mind

178
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:57,919
or the desiring mind is it focusing on what it wants what it's worried about

179
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:03,760
what it's uh wants to push away what it's for and against Here the feeling is

180
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:10,720
that in the deeper mind the deeper kind of um uh profound kind of place of

181
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:18,080
existence in us just wants to open up doesn't want to be limited and held tight and it wants to just become

182
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:23,760
expansive and include it all At the same time there's that can be also feel like

183
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:31,080
everything is kind of settling together There's a settling process a relaxing process and everything is kind of

184
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:37,519
gathering into this subtle kind of movement And the difference between this

185
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:43,600
widening widening awareness to settling is not so distinct

186
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:49,200
They happen together And um sometimes the expansive

187
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:57,000
one is called the um mahita the big mind or the expansive mind And

188
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,399
um and um and so so the idea is that

189
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:08,800
things are becoming unified organized working together not at odds with each other

190
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:15,440
And um and so this is all part of uh the emphasis in Buddhism that everything is

191
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:24,638
changing all the time And what's important to appreciate that the change is not chaotic The change follows uh the

192
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:33,040
patterns and or the conditions is influenced by the conditions we set in place So if the condition is a

193
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:38,079
preoccupation with thoughts preoccupations with difficult emotions

194
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:45,679
then that creates a movement towards being more scattered and disconnected Um if the orientation is

195
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:52,158
towards calm to be centered to be settled uh that moves the change towards

196
00:34:52,159 --> 00:35:00,000
becoming organized uh collected connected everything connected together

197
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,040
And um and so um and so we can contribute to that We set up the

198
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:12,720
conditions by our what we're oriented towards what our practice is what we're

199
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:18,440
seeing how awareness operates to allow this kind of movement towards

200
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:25,119
wholeness And uh but the uh what it needs is a kind of acute sensitivity to

201
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:31,680
this deeper and deeper sensitivity to the meditative experience as opposed to

202
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:38,240
heightened kind of preoccupation with um me myself and mine Heightened

203
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:45,680
preoccupation with our desires and aversions our fears and and uh anxieties

204
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:50,920
there's a kind of a a shift of orientation from

205
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:58,000
uh what the mind is gripping onto what it's like to have the the mind

206
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:05,280
be open the hand be open And it's almost that difference And in some ways the the

207
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:12,640
hand that's open is unified ready open receptive to what's there The hand

208
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:21,440
that's fisted together might seem unified in a certain way but the lot is lost in the process and and quickly the

209
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,720
tension that's there in the fist becomes the predominant thing When the mind when

210
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:32,960
the hand is whole open there's a way in which the whole hand is kind of gathered

211
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:39,760
or connected or involved together to what's happening And so the same with the mind

212
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:47,680
the same with the heart this relaxing this opening gathering together And so what I'm emphasizing

213
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:54,400
today is this subtle feeling subtle sense that we can have of a healthy

214
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:01,359
direction for the meditation to go Uh that is more subtle and quieter shire

215
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:08,240
than the pull of our ordinary preoccupations But to start being quiet

216
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:16,520
enough to listen to feel to sense um this this subtle movement towards uh

217
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:25,040
becoming settled becoming open becoming expansive becoming connected the subtle

218
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:31,280
movement that um cares for everything that wants everything to come together

219
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:37,680
everything to be itself in a settled way It's almost like every way in which we

220
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:42,880
are scattered every way which we're pulled into preoccupations and desires

221
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:48,320
and aversions if you feel your way into the middle of the desire the aversion

222
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:53,839
into the sensation of pulling and pushing and fighting If you feel your way into each

223
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:59,520
of it you can feel that in there itself has a movement towards

224
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,920
wanting to relax Everything which is fisted wants to

225
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:10,079
relax Everything which is forceful everything which is tight everything

226
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:18,240
which is has excessive kind of willful feeling to it everything that is anxious

227
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:24,079
everything that is insistent everything that's needy in us these are all things

228
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:30,640
to respect And from this deeper place of sensing you can sense into them and feel

229
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:36,160
how they want to be connected to the whole how they want to relax and settle

230
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,920
That all things if they're really attentive to it the heart of it you can

231
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:48,040
feel that they belong to a process of getting organized being connected and

232
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:53,760
unified returning to the whole if you will

233
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,440
And um and so as the meditation gets deeper and deeper uh this becomes part

234
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:06,160
of the hallmark part of the characteristics of the meditation it's not a desire it's not a wanting it's

235
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:11,480
it's inherent in the whole psychophysical system that when it becomes

236
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:17,119
aware clearly aware of what's here when it becomes settled and relaxed when

237
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:23,160
there starts to be a kind of a a centered focus centered experience of

238
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:29,520
here that um everything wants to kind of continue that process of centering

239
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:35,200
continue that process of opening and um and you can feel the pull

240
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:41,440
the desire for that And sometimes that desire can uh continue after meditation

241
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:48,640
in daily life There can be that clear sense of of this is what wants to happen

242
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:54,480
I just want to meditate more I just want to connect to this more This is what uh

243
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:00,800
what um what the whole system is about is this coming into whole coming into

244
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:06,560
the healing coming into the fullness And so there can be this kind

245
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:12,320
of this this feeling of this is the direction to go in my life even and some

246
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:18,640
people will decide to go on long retreats Some people decide to do you

247
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:24,079
know just meditate more Some people will decide to meditate longer That you can

248
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:29,599
feel inside that after a short period of meditation that what's in here is not

249
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:34,800
finished There's this momentum this movement this desire almost to continue

250
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:42,960
this process And um so um the the the or the the

251
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:50,800
gathering organizing uh the uh process of it all and um

252
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:58,560
sometimes it feels like it's all coming into a simple simple center where everything gets simpler and simpler Um

253
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:04,240
the and as it gets simpler just for example just with the breathing at the

254
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:09,280
same time the mind can feel more and more expansive And sometimes the movement seems like

255
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:18,640
this more to like more and more expansive like everything is standing in a wide circle but then what's really left is

256
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:26,200
the edges disappear and what's really left is the center and things get simpler and

257
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:32,400
simpler So it's a movement towards simplicity also in a certain way because

258
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,680
the mind is not thinking about so many things The mind is not interested in

259
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:47,200
thinking about so many things It's the mind has been spending a lifetime thinking and wanting and and worrying

260
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:53,040
And it's done enough of that It's had its chance And sometimes it doesn't seem

261
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:58,079
to have done much good anyway And there's a strong feeling enough for now

262
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:03,720
There's a vacation time There's a time to really settle into this other way of

263
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:09,920
being that is not scattered not preoccupied not desired driven anxious

264
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:15,760
desired driven or something So the this is the unification

265
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:23,680
and the word samadei uh that's one of the meanings of samadei It's kind of a gathering together of the

266
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:29,359
mind in Zen uh 7-day Zen retreats are called

267
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:35,520
sashines means that means something like the gathering of the mind

268
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:40,720
So thank you and uh we'll do one more day tomorrow of this kind of kind of a

269
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:47,280
review and kind of getting into this again and next week we'll return to what

270
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:53,599
we did before which is the approach um into this deeper samadei what's

271
00:42:53,599 --> 00:43:00,800
called jas and we'll spend another week with the approach uh part of samadei um

272
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:08,040
and then I'm hoping the week after that we can begin uh at least the discussion of what's called the Janna the

273
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:13,400
absorptions So thank you all very much
