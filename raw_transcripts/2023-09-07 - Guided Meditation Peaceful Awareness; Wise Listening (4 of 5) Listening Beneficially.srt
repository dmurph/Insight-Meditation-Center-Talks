00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:07,279
hello everyone welcome

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,460
and

3
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,419
so a few words about meditation before we start

4
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,640
that it can go without saying maybe that

5
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,820
didn't context of community that practices mindfulness

6
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:42,540
that mindfulness is important but I think it's probably often the case

7
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:49,140
that for all of us we don't appreciate how important it is

8
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,379
that our capacity to be aware to be attentive

9
00:00:54,379 --> 00:01:01,500
is uh is not is not what we pay attention to

10
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:08,280
is important it is but how we pay attention how we are

11
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:16,080
aware that's the real key and the goal of Buddhism is found more

12
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:24,000
in the freedom of awareness where awareness is not hijacked for our

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,380
desires and our versions that awareness is not drowned out by our

14
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:38,460
self-preoccupations that our connection are in La the way

15
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,579
that awareness can enliven us is not lost by the focus on what we're

16
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:51,360
aware of and so to pay attention to how we're

17
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,259
aware and see if we can find some degree

18
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:04,920
of freedom in the how we're aware some degree of nourishment some degree

19
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:11,099
of peace some degree of of a kind of coming home

20
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:16,739
where it feels really right

21
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:24,360
to abide in Awareness to simply be aware and not be tricked into thinking that

22
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:31,500
what we're aware of is important what we're thinking about it these things are important but that

23
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:38,340
what we're thinking about what we're aware of is the solution is where the you know we

24
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:47,879
have to fix these things or have a better relationship to them or better mindfulness of them and then we can

25
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:55,400
we need to be mindful of things but how we're aware of them how we're mindful

26
00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:00,379
so to assume the meditation posture

27
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,239
and to gently close your eyes

28
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,560
and to begin the meditation to do is just as simple as possible

29
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,480
check in with yourself how are you

30
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:36,300
you know it could be as simple as from scale 1 to 10 where 10 is really good and one is pretty

31
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:41,599
feeling pretty lousy where are you on that scale

32
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,860
and as you recognize how you are

33
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:14,040
are you reactive to how you are are you judging how you are

34
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,340
do you do you somehow are you somehow

35
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:26,340
entangled or concerned about how you are

36
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:35,699
or is there a way of just knowing how you are and let the knowing be so really simple

37
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:40,400
almost as if the part of you that can know

38
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:49,020
maybe it doesn't feel the way you are knowing just as peaceful and quiet

39
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:57,380
open and maybe not that's okay

40
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:09,020
and then to take a few long slow deep breaths

41
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:15,860
relaxing as you exhale

42
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:48,860
and letting your breathing return to normal normal enough

43
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:56,340
and continue as you exhale to soften and relax into your body

44
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,539
settling here

45
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:42,620
and as you exhale to relax the thinking mind

46
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,280
softening in the mind

47
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:21,660
and then becoming aware if it's there

48
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,160
where in your body

49
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:33,180
might your reactivity still remain

50
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:38,520
who where in the body are you emotionally activated

51
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:46,699
either in ways that are Pleasant or unpleasant challenging or comforting

52
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:59,340
and gently let that part of your body soften as you

53
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,759
exhale

54
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,520
not to make it go away

55
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:19,099
but let it allow to be there in a soft way

56
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:23,660
it's okay

57
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:46,700
taking a few moments to feel

58
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:53,580
your Global body the way your whole body

59
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,920
feels as a whole as your attention roams around inside

60
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,519
the body

61
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,500
and then as if it's in the center of your body

62
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:32,060
become aware of your breathing

63
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:43,440
centering yourself on the breathing so that as the inhale expands

64
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:51,480
feel like it the whole torso core breathing fills your body

65
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:59,720
feeling the global body as you breathe in letting it all return

66
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,720
to the center within as you exhale

67
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:26,519
as if breathing is a gentle hand

68
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:33,899
that's accompanying you with however you are without being reactive or

69
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:40,320
without being for or against anything just there

70
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,660
breathing with breathing through

71
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:42,380
and then notice how you're aware

72
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:55,579
is there some adjustments you can make to how you're aware so awareness is more peaceful

73
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:04,860
you might have desires but awareness doesn't you might have aversions but awareness

74
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,220
doesn't

75
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:19,459
you might be in all kinds of ways but awareness is like the space

76
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:26,060
within which all things occur

77
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:40,620
letting your awareness be like space or letting your awareness be peaceful

78
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:03,079
awareness knows but it doesn't react

79
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:56,240
thank you foreign

80
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,500
thank you

81
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:04,860
and as we come to the end of this sitting to check in with yourself again like at

82
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:10,220
the beginning and how are you

83
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:20,940
how are you on a scale of one to ten and keep it that simple

84
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:25,759
the simplest recognition of how you are

85
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:40,020
and to see how you can recognize

86
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:45,919
yourself without reactivity without judgment

87
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:52,820
that holding on or wanting a different just aware

88
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:06,480
but also becoming aware of how things have shifted for you

89
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,760
from the beginning of the meditation to now

90
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,158
is how you are changed

91
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:39,740
is there a way to know yourself here as you meditate

92
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:48,659
visit that is an act of care or respect or even love

93
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:54,240
just to know allowing yourself to be as you are but

94
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,840
to know it

95
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:11,520
knowing that's not impatient knowing that's not

96
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,100
filled with wanting just knowing

97
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:24,260
and then to turn that attention out into the world

98
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:36,600
into open awareness to this complicated world we live in

99
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:44,179
but let the knowing be simple the knowing the

100
00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:50,940
knowing know itself as peaceful as calm

101
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:57,919
is open and spacious just aware

102
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:06,659
of all things the ten thousand Sorrows the ten

103
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:09,440
thousand joys

104
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:21,779
and finding a home in awareness

105
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:26,840
find your good fortune in awareness

106
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:36,059
and to extend that awareness out into the world so it can be a channel

107
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:40,520
for your good will your well-wishing

108
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:47,000
you don't have to love others to wish them well

109
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,640
but understand that meditation

110
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:07,200
is here to help us benefit ourselves and benefit the world

111
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:15,120
and may it be that whatever we've learned in our meditation for how to be present how to be attentive

112
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:20,419
may it be the channel for our Goodwill

113
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:26,640
may we be part of our hearts Joy

114
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:33,419
to wish people well to see them

115
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:36,860
to appreciate them

116
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:46,820
in their inherent value in their preciousness

117
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:56,960
may all beings be happy may all beings

118
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,620
be safe male beings

119
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:11,240
be peaceful and may all beings be free

120
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:26,479
[Music]

121
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,460
thank you

122
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:26,100
so welcome to this fourth talk on wise listening

123
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:36,440
and uh so the fourth topic is to listen

124
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,360
so that it's beneficial to listen for what's

125
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:48,179
the most helpful for others the in the ancient language in terms of

126
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:55,080
speech the fourth criteria is to speak what is beneficial but the the word for this being given

127
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:02,399
for beneficial is which means also the goal and the goal is freedom the goal is to

128
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:12,120
be free of suffering classically in Buddhism and so we apply this to listening is to

129
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:18,500
listen from a place of freedom the best that we have

130
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:23,520
from a place of listening from a place where the benefits we receive through

131
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:31,200
meditation may be the best benefits we received becomes a reference point to how to listen to others

132
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:38,039
and um so like for example for me there's a few times maybe I'm having to

133
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:46,020
go someplace a little bit late but someone wants to talk to me and I can feel inside I'm impatient

134
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:51,120
and I've learned to recognize that my impatient is my own

135
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:56,940
and not in any kind of way project that onto the others like other people

136
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:02,520
and somehow think poorly of them or think the problem is with them

137
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:08,520
but rather I've learned that my impatience harms me my impatience is

138
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:16,440
unfortunate that I should lose a subtle place so I make it my practice then to return

139
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:23,159
to a place of subtleness or openness or Freedom where I'm not caught in the impatience

140
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:28,320
the byproduct of that is then I'm can listen with with out that impatience

141
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:34,679
which is a much better way to listen and so I'm listening with the highest

142
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:43,140
benefits for myself as a reference point and as I practice with that then I you

143
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:49,019
know with a little bit of luck can be available without that hindrance and

144
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:54,720
just be there listening to others so that pattern of checking in with

145
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:02,340
myself what the hindrances I have and freeing them myself of it means that I'm not trying to be

146
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:08,099
impatient act impatient well really what's happening is I'm impatient

147
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:14,760
uh really what's happening is I'm caught up in my desires or really what's happening is I'm trying to not I'm not

148
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,919
listening I'm caught up in needing to prove myself or defend myself or do

149
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:25,560
something and uh that gets in the way of really being listening to someone but rather

150
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:31,500
than insisting that I should listen the practice is Gil take a good look

151
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:37,378
here become free of these hindrances or at least free enough

152
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:45,080
so that it becomes I can come into the listening without it and then I'm a better listener

153
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:51,118
as a byproduct of doing this inner work I might be motivated originally to be a

154
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:56,580
better listener but I know that I should check in and work on myself so that I can be a better

155
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:01,920
listener so to listen in a way that's beneficial

156
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:08,580
to listen in a way where we're tapping into the deepest benefits that we know that's available maybe from practice or

157
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:15,680
from our spirituality or from our life this is uh part of healthy listening

158
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:22,380
Dharma dharmic listening and then to list it in such a way that

159
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:29,339
we have other people's welfare in mind as well so to listen and in a way to

160
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:36,960
so that you know we hear people out I mean for people to be heard out to receive the

161
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,720
gift of listening to receive someone who holds it all spaciously even if they

162
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,180
have a tendency to over speak and are dominating there's some wonderful Aikido

163
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:55,680
a wonderful kind of movement that just instead of being reactive to that step towards it and

164
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:01,079
open up and listen even better the very thing maybe that I sometimes don't want to do because now I'm

165
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:07,560
reinforcing their over speaking but sometimes to step forward oh and get

166
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:14,220
involved active listening and get interested and sometimes people who speak too much haven't had that

167
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:19,920
experience of people really interested them and perhaps something deeper in them

168
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,619
needs to be fed or needs to be met then just the words they're speaking

169
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:31,740
so the idea of what you know offering the highest benefit to others through

170
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:37,320
our listening um and now it is a wonderful reference

171
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:43,020
point for being a listener it doesn't have to be this way all the time it maybe shouldn't be this way all the time

172
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:49,800
because there's none naive and overlooking the context but this is one of the gifts that can come around this

173
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:55,560
practice is uh really becoming not only a good listener but listening in such a

174
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:00,900
way that we're attuning ourselves or or connecting ourselves to some deeper

175
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:08,839
potential of Freedom that's possible in the other person one way one formula takes is to listen

176
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:14,339
uh appreciating the other person appreciating something about them maybe

177
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:21,660
that they can't even appreciate them in themselves um appreciating their capacity for love

178
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:27,900
they're appreciating here is a tender person here's a person with life experiences that's been difficult and

179
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:32,960
they're doing the best they can given their challenges

180
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:39,839
so yesterday I read this poem the song of the open road by Walt Whitman

181
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:45,660
and he has a wonderful line I think the second line of the poem that goes something like

182
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:54,300
um I ask not for Good Fortune I am good fortune

183
00:37:54,300 --> 00:38:02,240
so rather than asserting out in the world provide me with Benefits provide me with good fortune

184
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:08,820
he says I'm I am good fortune and this is the possibility of this

185
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:16,320
practice is that we're not looking outside of ourselves to be happy or to be peaceful we become

186
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:23,040
our inner peace we become an inner happiness we find it in ourselves

187
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:28,680
and it takes some responsibility for finding it here so is listening

188
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:33,839
in a way that's beneficial that has the highest welfare in mind

189
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:40,560
um can transform an individual s that we be we just feel like yes all

190
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:48,900
kinds of misconventional misfortunes can have with us it could happen to us but we are the good fortune we are the

191
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:54,240
free heart we we are the open mind

192
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:00,440
um and and that's so beneficial that why would we

193
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:10,220
allow ourselves to get carried away by impatience as I said talked about earlier or Carried Away by

194
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:15,359
reactivity or fear when we have a practice

195
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:20,400
to help us go back and find that place of Good Fortune find that place of

196
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:27,300
freedom find that place of openness and then from there listen to others

197
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:32,460
from there take care of what needs to be taken care of in the world take care of

198
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:39,859
our challenges and our difficulties but they carry our Good Fortune with us

199
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:46,020
so to listen from the place that's most beneficial in

200
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:51,859
us to have some sense of that then that's one of the

201
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:58,020
values of this meditation practice is to find some reference point

202
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:03,480
of well-being that can help us listen to that and with

203
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:10,740
that be in the world be present in the world connected to that open to it what's the

204
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:16,079
highest benefit here for me and certainly I asked this for myself

205
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:22,320
and um and and frequently enough I've been caught up in

206
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:28,760
something that seems important and and it's not the highest benefit

207
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:36,720
um I went I had my car serviced yesterday and um and you know I was a little bit

208
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:44,460
concerned about the price and the concerns with with some little bit would I be overcharged and different things

209
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:51,780
but uh I could see that why would I come with that tension and tightness to

210
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:57,359
uh and cause myself this kind of tension with those kinds of concerns

211
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:03,900
so certainly I had those thoughts in the back of my mind but I relaxed and just kind of stayed there and and appreciated

212
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:10,800
the service person that I was with and and uh and uh and just uh it was in very

213
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:17,520
nice conversation and I delighted in him and I think he's kind of started smiling and was happy as well and

214
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:23,720
and at some point he asked me um

215
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:29,700
um you know something like how are you and I said honestly I said oh I'm quite

216
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:35,700
happy because I was sitting there quite happy I'd done my work to be in that kind of place

217
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:42,359
and then I said yeah I'm quite happy um except for the you know you know I'm

218
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:48,119
not so happy about the high price of the service you know I wasn't asking for anything but that was just true you know

219
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:54,900
there's a little bit you seemed kind of high expensive and uh and he said okay I'll I'll take

220
00:41:54,900 --> 00:42:00,839
100 off and um I don't know if it was I don't know how

221
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:06,420
much you want to make from that little story but uh the important point was here was

222
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:11,880
a situation where I was going to be present I was going to take care of myself in

223
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:18,240
this situation and not sacrifice my own well-being because of my fears because of my

224
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:23,400
concerns in this small situation like this I was going to take care of the

225
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:29,460
situation the best I could but I was going to care for this place of freedom and not get caught by

226
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:35,040
something that compromised it did myself so I kind of became my own good fortune

227
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:42,180
in a way that Walt Whitman talks about so to listen be present to others

228
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:50,040
from our freedom from and do the inner work that stays as close to that that's really great that's a fantastic

229
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:56,400
thing to do so um thank you

230
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:01,560
and uh so we have one more talk tomorrow and

231
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,579
wise listening
