1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:07,839
so good morning good day good evening hello everyone

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:14,960
and here we are to do this morning meditation or

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:24,800
together and a little bit the topic of

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,080
theme of this session of mindfulness meditation

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:39,440
is what's called investigation or exploration a process of discovery

6
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,039
and as one of the seven factors of awakening it's sometimes said to be the most

7
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:50,079
important one for the purpose of awakening

8
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:57,680
for the purpose of freedom and there's something about

9
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:04,320
choosing to explore to discover

10
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,159
to investigate what our experience is

11
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:17,520
which is an expression or a manifestation of freedom

12
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:25,360
no matter how difficult something might be to choose to take

13
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,920
take another look at this to step in a sense step towards it to

14
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,680
see it better or sometimes we step away from it to get

15
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,880
a better view of it it's always to discover to see to

16
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,159
investigate and when we do that we're not a victim

17
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:54,159
of experience when we do that we're not under the

18
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,960
control of experiences around us within us

19
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:07,119
when we do that we are our attention is not being hijacked

20
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:14,560
by our hindrances or our neurosis or our fears whatever it

21
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,920
might be and so this ability to decide okay what

22
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,599
what is this what is this experience i'm having

23
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:32,480
and not to answer that question with words not to answer that question with

24
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,400
an explanation but to answer the answer it with

25
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,439
um with

26
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:55,360
a clear seeing to answer it with a clear

27
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:05,120
perception feeling for what's happening

28
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,599
so taking a meditation posture

29
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:22,000
and in some sense this expression of freedom which is to take a

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,239
good look begins with caring for your posture

31
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:34,959
choosing to use this wonderful resource of attention

32
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,959
to scan through your posture

33
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,640
and to

34
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,080
make small adjustments

35
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,120
that not only help you be more settled and more relaxed

36
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:06,239
but also a little bit more alert physically alert

37
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:15,840
ready to discover ready to see what's here

38
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:29,759
and then to take a few moments to discover your own breathing

39
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:36,240
without doing any different breathing just notice how it is for you to be breathing

40
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,000
to explore it to feel it

41
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,840
and as you do so maybe you can notice a difference between being

42
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,080
entangled with your breathing and

43
00:04:53,120 --> 00:05:03,360
wanting to be different or concerned about it or and simply discovering it

44
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:11,840
simply becoming familiar oh this is how it is now

45
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:24,240
without being for or against

46
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:31,039
without being analytical and

47
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:39,840
preferences just discover it in its own way how the breathing is

48
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:53,840
and then having done so now to take a few long slow deep breaths

49
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,160
as a way of establishing yourself in this body

50
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,160
here and now

51
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:17,600
and then as you exhale long exhale

52
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:25,280
relaxing settling in releasing yourself

53
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,280
the tensions of the body

54
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,160
and then to

55
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:46,880
let your breathing return to normal a little bit more it's useful to release

56
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,319
and relax the holdings of the body as you exhale

57
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,840
and often enough the tensions and holdings of our body

58
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,120
give pressure or give yeah maybe a kind of pressure to the

59
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:13,599
mind to keep thinking about things being preoccupied and as we relax

60
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:20,240
the body there is less of that pressure to think

61
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,840
softening the face around the eyes

62
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,080
softening around the shoulders

63
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:51,199
releasing the shoulders maybe adjusting your hands a little elbows so the whole arm is a little bit

64
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:59,840
more at ease

65
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:27,840
and perhaps softening the belly

66
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:41,200
and then settling into your body breathing in whatever way breathing is most

67
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:49,040
compelling or easiest most pleasant for you to attend to

68
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,880
in the belly in the chest and the nostrils

69
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,920
wherever it might be

70
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:09,839
and then very simply

71
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,800
choose to be with your breathing

72
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,680
to discover how it actually is now

73
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,080
distinct from how you want it to be

74
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:36,880
in a sense to explore it to discover it to investigate it

75
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:42,320
feeling the freedom in that choice

76
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:50,720
that you're exercising your your ability

77
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:59,600
to direct your attention to discover and feel and get to know

78
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,839
better

79
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:16,640
noticing the difference between the bodily experience of inhaling

80
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,839
and exhaling

81
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,440
noticing a difference between the experiences of breathing where there's some tightness or

82
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,839
constriction and where there's some looseness and releasing

83
00:10:52,399 --> 00:11:01,600
to investigate it to explore it means to let feel it on its own terms

84
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:09,600
step towards it to just get to know it better without it needing to be different

85
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:29,839
without trying to fix it just know constriction here looseness here

86
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,959
and discovering a little bit what it's like for you to be aware of

87
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:50,560
your breathing what it's like for you to explore

88
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,560
investigate the experience of breathing

89
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:05,040
not to make anything right or wrong but how is it for you to discover

90
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,839
the kind of discovery that of a naturalist

91
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:20,880
simply discovering something in nature patiently observing it as a natural

92
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:27,440
phenomena noticing how you are in relationship to

93
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,800
mindfulness or breathing as a natural phenomena

94
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,440
if there's resistance or reluctance eagerness

95
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:47,279
if they're straining or complacency whatever it might be

96
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:53,839
discover it notice it and let it be that simple

97
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:10,160
the simpler the discovery is the more freedom there is

98
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:17,279
freedom to let things just be as they are freedom from our internal reactions of

99
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:24,480
things just being aware discovering

100
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:41,440
seeing and then returning to the breathing

101
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:49,839
maybe seeing how simple the discovery can be just discovery just seeing

102
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:56,959
not seeing anything special or hidden but just how it appears

103
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:03,839
just how it shows itself to you

104
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:31,519
if you get lost in thought that's just another natural phenomenon

105
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:37,759
and you the naturalist that's studying it seeing it

106
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:45,839
this is how it is

107
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,839
and then settling back into your breathing

108
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:24,320
a silent discovery a silent dis investigation of breathing

109
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:31,040
where there's an intimacy or a clarity

110
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:41,839
about the different sensations that come into play as you breathe

111
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,800
and to follow along

112
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:54,560
to observe in the distinct sensations of breathing in and breathing

113
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:00,079
out distinct sensations of

114
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:08,480
the beginning middle and end of the inhale beginning middle and end of the exhale

115
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,320
discovering your breathing

116
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:23,199
and very easily with ease

117
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:30,480
maybe you can feel the freedom the independence that you bring to your

118
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:38,800
experience by choosing to discover it to see it

119
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,720
more fully more clearly

120
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,839
without it needing to be anything different

121
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:41,679
even when our thinking is pleasant if we get preoccupied and lost in

122
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:47,919
thought there is also a loss of freedom

123
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:54,799
but to wake up our capacity to discover

124
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,000
what's happening here

125
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:07,840
is to enact our freedom

126
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:23,279
and asking the question what's happening here is not to be answered per se

127
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:30,559
but to encourage taking a gentle clear

128
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:36,480
look what is happening here just seeing and feeling and

129
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,480
just what's obvious no need to

130
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:51,278
think or probe just discover

131
00:27:51,440 --> 00:28:03,840
what is showing itself to us now

132
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:20,559
to investigate does not need to involve a contraction or a tightening

133
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:26,799
of attention or the mind it's more useful to have it be involved

134
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:32,960
in opening an expansion of attention of awareness of the mind

135
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,840
it's open and receptive

136
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:55,440
and you know and it's possible to let this investigation factor

137
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:06,640
come to its fullness in simply being mindful of the breathing

138
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,880
breathing with greater intimacy and

139
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,960
clarity discovering

140
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:27,360
the obvious experiences of breathing in and breathing out

141
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,720
with clarity and

142
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,679
distinctions

143
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:46,399
with a quiet mind a mind that gets quieter

144
00:31:46,399 --> 00:32:01,840
the more we discover

145
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,560
so to bring this sitting to an end

146
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:16,000
to use your freedom and investigation

147
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,359
your ability to discover be open be available

148
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:27,599
to you see if you can use it to have that freedom of openness of

149
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:34,560
discovery for others to allow them to be

150
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:51,838
as they are because you are free

151
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:04,640
so and i see that you could hear my phone

152
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:11,520
calls with my wife so perhaps you can hold all this in investigation and

153
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:17,040
freedom and simple discovery how it is and

154
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:24,720
so in doing so may all beings be free

155
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:35,680
may all beings be peaceful may all beings be safe

156
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,760
and may all beings everywhere

157
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,838
be happy

158
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:05,040
so so let me talk a few minutes about this uh

159
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:15,359
what's often called the investigation factor um so not quite loud enough someone says

160
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:20,880
so let me see [Music]

161
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:28,560
so i think now is it better now the sound okay so let me

162
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:33,920
say a few minutes here about the investigation factor of awakening

163
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:41,920
and it's usually called investigation and people who look into this

164
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:48,079
will say that it's probably not the right best translation but it's a pretty good one overall it's

165
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:54,640
an overarching generalization because

166
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:02,640
it involves uh a exploration a discovery a deeper discernment

167
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:07,760
of what our experiences and

168
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,680
this process of exploration is in english is often called investigation

169
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:19,920
and um but investigation uh if it means a kind of a deeper probing in searching

170
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:25,520
it's not what we're what is referred to when we're doing this vipassana practice

171
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:33,839
but rather it's a state of openness and receptivity to allow the experience to show itself

172
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:39,359
fully to us and for me it's represented by the question what

173
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:46,960
what is happening here what just what is it but we never look for an answer

174
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:54,400
as more that the what prompts a clear looking a clear discovery

175
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:00,400
of a kind of a silent kind of sensing or feeling or looking or

176
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:05,520
perceiving of what is here and and in doing so

177
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:10,640
we're beginning to in enact or tap into

178
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:17,599
our capacity for freedom that it's so easy to be caught

179
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:23,520
and entangled by our experiences by our thoughts by our feelings by what's happening in the world

180
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,880
and and there's so many ways we get entangled so many ways in which we get

181
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:34,160
attached we get reactive to how things are and when there's reactivity

182
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:41,599
reactivity by itself is the is not is not freedom uh to respond

183
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:47,440
with choice to respond with wisdom can it be an enactment of our freedom

184
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,720
but but to react is not so if we're always reacting and being

185
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:58,240
pulling around by our thoughts and hijacked by our thoughts if we feel like

186
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:03,520
we're a victim of experience then we haven't discovered freedom

187
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:11,920
and one of the ways it can begin this freedom is in acts of mindfulness to be mindful of what's here but also

188
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:17,920
acts of mindfulness can also grow to be a little bit stronger forms

189
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:22,960
of freedom which is investigation to uh

190
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:28,560
uh to see to discover what is here and the kind of core investigation

191
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:35,520
that's part of vipassana practice is is what further on the retreat

192
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:43,440
inez talked about yesterday dhamma vichaya and vichaya comes from the word prefix v

193
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:49,200
i and then the root word c-a-y-a

194
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:57,040
and chaya means to heap up to accumulate and v means to separate and human beings

195
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:04,319
have amazing and very important capacity to generalize to lump things together to to

196
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:10,720
hold concepts of things altogether and and they're useful but also they can

197
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:15,760
limit our ability to see clearly what's here to discern distinguish

198
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:21,200
the details of our experience so if i say that i had

199
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:27,280
a you know a difficult morning with the technology

200
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:33,200
then well that's a generalization but what specifically was the experience like of

201
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:40,319
being here with technology for this morning some of it was quite delightful and enjoyable and inspiring to see the

202
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:45,440
people in the retreat to see the people on on youtube and

203
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:51,760
and with the chats for example and and um some of it was quite nice to be

204
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,960
exploring for me exploring the dharma as i spoke it was nice to sit and meditate while

205
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:02,480
while there was some quiet for me and i was meditating and

206
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:08,800
and then there was the issue of the technology that there's so many

207
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:16,720
different uh devices and things here that i got confused about which uh charging uh battery charger

208
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:23,359
that was supposed to be at home and what was supposed to be here and so the so this what the you know it suddenly

209
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:29,119
went dark my laptop and it wasn't actually unpleasant experience at all it was just kind of it just was

210
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:34,319
what it was and um suddenly this was there and there was an issue to look into

211
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:39,920
and probably the most unpleasant part of it all was needing to ask my wife for some help

212
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:45,520
when she's busy at home and and also wondering how i was going to

213
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:51,599
get back and having running in time for the zoom people and then uh the awkwardness of realizing

214
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:57,119
that you could hear what i was saying some of you on on youtube and um

215
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:03,920
and let's see you know what what impact did that have on people meditating and but that was all very particular and as

216
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:09,680
i distinguished all the different parts of it i wouldn't say it was a challenging morning here

217
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:15,359
it was it had its unique challenges its own particular things but i didn't lump it all together as

218
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:20,480
like a lousy morning with technology it was all these little if i

219
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:25,599
if i wrote out the details the distinctions of the moment moment what was happening

220
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:31,359
there were challenging parts and not challenging parts there were pleasant parts and maybe some parts that were not so pleasant

221
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:37,040
and this ability to begin distinguishing and not lump and in sense buddhists you know if you

222
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:45,359
know the distinction between lumpers and splitters buddhism thrives on on being splitters

223
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:51,119
on really seeing more and more carefully what's really happening here what are the details rather than

224
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:56,880
generalizing about things and so this idea of this disability this

225
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:04,079
clarity of mind that gets cultivated through mindfulness the mind gets clearer and clearer

226
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:09,280
and the details the particular particularities the details of experience the

227
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,319
unique little component parts of experience begin

228
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:19,520
revealing themselves more and more and more and where that becomes particularly

229
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:26,880
important is when the capacity to distinguish to see the particularities the details of what goes on

230
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:33,520
is um is um goes together with wisdom

231
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:40,000
the wisdom factor and the wisdom factor is uh the one the many things that are

232
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,760
considered wisdom the factor of wisdom in in this practice we do

233
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:54,319
but one of the core aspects is being able to make the distinction between what is helpful and what is not

234
00:46:54,319 --> 00:47:00,960
the distinction what is wholesome and what is not what is healthy and what is not or the

235
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:09,119
distinction between what has a an ouch in it or an ah this is good or a distinction between

236
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:16,480
what is where freedom is or where freedom is not that distinction is a is the what wisdom

237
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:24,400
is capable of making mindfulness puts us in the clarity that we see things as they are and see them

238
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:30,000
clear and clear and wisdom sees what is useful and what is not

239
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,040
and that distinction is where we discover the path

240
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:42,240
where we discover or where the choices can be and so the simple distinction between

241
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:48,640
being entangled in experience and being free when we investigate it

242
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:55,200
with wisdom we see actually it's better to be free than entangled and so to the degree which we have in a

243
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:03,440
capacity we put effort and energy into going in the direction of freedom and in this case investigate

244
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:09,920
or discern or see more clearly what the experience is

245
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:15,200
and so it said that the the the investigation factor of awakening that

246
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:20,480
clarity of mind that can really see the details of experience not lumping the

247
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:26,160
generalization of what it is that um that ability

248
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:31,599
then um inspires the effort factor of awakening the energy

249
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:37,760
because we see oh this is the direction to go this is where freedom is this is where

250
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:43,760
peace is this is where the lack of stress the lack of suffering

251
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,880
is found and that's inspiring to make that choice and go in that direction

252
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:56,640
to go in that direction is another manifestation of our capacity for inner freedom

253
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:04,800
and as we walk this path we keep discovering more and more ways in which we can manifest or enact

254
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:12,800
our freedom until at some point freedom becomes a state that we live in as opposed to something

255
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:19,280
we find in the details of our you know of how we live and the choices we make in our life

256
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:26,559
so the investigation mindfulness leads to the capacity to see

257
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:33,760
clearly that's called discernment making distinctions investigation

258
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:40,400
and that in itself then is a prompt or a catalyst for the effort

259
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:46,400
factor in practice so that the effort factor of awakening can get born and

260
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:53,040
and come to fulfillment and that'll be the topic for the next

261
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:59,440
topic for the retreat and the next topic for youtube and like tomorrow morning

262
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:06,319
so thank you and and i think this hopefully this uh

263
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:13,359
little technology issue today wasn't too much of a

264
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:22,240
was you know interruption at all and it all worked well enough for everyone so thank you very much and and

265
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,760
so we'll continue
