1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:07,279
well good morning or good day and uh

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,639
i feel kind of cozy being here this morning kind of

3
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:21,680
i'm alone in this big room with there's a kind of a fog low clouds here

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,279
today california and bay area and starting to be a little dark in this

5
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,880
room in the mornings now in the coming fall so it's kind of cozy nice

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,079
thank you for being part of this

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,680
so in mindfulness practice

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,600
we are using are the medium for it is our capacity for perception

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:01:00,239
and the primary example of perception that's used repeatedly in in the buddha's teachings is seeing

10
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,680
and one of the advantages of using this as an example

11
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,479
it can be clear that when we see something maybe you know outside of ourselves

12
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:19,759
that it is outside of ourselves it's there and that the eyes that see the ability to see is

13
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:27,920
here with us and that between those two there is the act of

14
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:37,200
seeing and which is the coming together of the object and the ability to see

15
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,880
and and that excuse me

16
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,920
and and that that ability to see

17
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,560
uh that that coming together to have the seeing that's where the dynamic aspect

18
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,240
of mindfulness or the revelation of practice opens up

19
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,360
and sometimes we look ex too much at the object as if

20
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,920
only the object has the answer just really bear down on the object look at it see it deeply

21
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:22,879
there's a role to that but it can be it's only part of the picture

22
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:29,599
the other part is the ability to see and it has to be there

23
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:35,760
and then there's the coming together of those two and if we're too interested in the

24
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,280
object reacting to it or bearing down it in some way

25
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,040
investigating it deeply we might miss the other two parts

26
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,519
and the other two parts are also where we can discover where we're caught in something where we're

27
00:02:53,519 --> 00:03:00,800
entangled or attached to something which is often felt as a freezing

28
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,840
of the seeing freezing of the act of perception and locking in or

29
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,599
locking out putting pulling back and the ability this the meeting of the

30
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:19,480
two stops being so smooth and fluid in the present moment as it unfolds

31
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,040
so the ability to see

32
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:34,319
is discovered in the seeing and that ability to see how we see the

33
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:40,959
what is where we is a beautiful thing that's what the buddha people calls it

34
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,040
uh the beautiful witnessing

35
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,799
how we see is the

36
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,239
is where we discover the unfolding of the dharma of the practice

37
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:04,480
we have to see we have to stay close to that meeting place of the scene and the scene

38
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:12,720
but how we see how we perceive how we know and so in this meditation

39
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:20,320
you might take an interest

40
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,160
in how you're seeing which always happens

41
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,199
here and now which is always

42
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:37,440
part of the immediacy of the present moment how you see

43
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,639
and can that way of seeing the way of knowing the way of perceiving

44
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,160
way of seeing with the inner eye kind of what's going on inside of you

45
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,840
can you give a lot of time to that the extended present

46
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:04,320
moment can you allow for it to be calm and expansive and

47
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,600
unhurried just here

48
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,720
to now

49
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:26,320
directly visible in a certain way is our seeing it's the seeing itself

50
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,960
so to assume a meditation posture

51
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,400
and lowering your gaze to begin the process of relaxing your

52
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,880
eyes

53
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,840
so you're not really looking at anything

54
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,639
the central vision of the eye is not really engaged with anything

55
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,000
and it's more the peripheral vision

56
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,649
which is open [Music]

57
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:26,400
gently closing your eyes and no need to physically engage your

58
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:35,080
eyes or in order to be aware and mindful

59
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,319
no need to engage physically the eyes at all

60
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,240
letting the eyes relax in their sockets

61
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,560
almost as if they can eyes can kind of rest backwards

62
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,520
downwards in the sockets

63
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,280
and then with the as if you have

64
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:17,840
infinite time taking some long slow deep breaths

65
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,080
and to relax as you exhale

66
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,840
to let the whole your whole psychophysical system

67
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:42,879
settle into some

68
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,120
modicum of calm as you exhale

69
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,680
letting your breathing return to normal

70
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,960
and as you exhale as you inhale

71
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:26,319
feel your hands and wrists and if there's any holding there on the

72
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:32,159
exhale adjust your hands or relax the holding

73
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,279
if there's any ways in which there's holding in your elbows

74
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,240
they're pulled in tight to your side of your body or

75
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:57,680
or they're pull too far forward

76
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,080
adjust your elbows let them relax

77
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,720
and then feel your shoulders

78
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,040
and then the exhale relax your shoulders

79
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,880
maybe the shoulders can relax a little bit more

80
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:49,800
if you gently pull back and lift up your head

81
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,680
and if you gently incrementally

82
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:03,240
sit up a little straighter with your upper spine

83
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:17,800
and on the exhale softening the belly

84
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,600
letting the belly hang forward and down

85
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:37,360
and as the belly relaxes letting the relaxation

86
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,480
spread around the waist to the sides

87
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,360
letting the relaxation spread down into your pelvis

88
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,760
hip joints groin area

89
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:20,320
and then on the exhale to soften relax

90
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,639
the thinking mind

91
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,880
relaxing any intensity or force

92
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:43,320
fixation connected to thinking

93
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:08,120
and then settling in to your body breathing

94
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,320
and here with your breathing

95
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,560
there's the experience there's breathing

96
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,320
the parts of your body that move as you breathe

97
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:43,600
here's your ability to feel or know yourself breathing

98
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:51,399
and the meeting of those two

99
00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:01,800
where you know and experience breathing

100
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,839
and avoiding being excessively focused on

101
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,440
the physical aspect of breathing itself

102
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,839
see if you can appreciate more

103
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:39,839
the knowing or the sensing of breathing

104
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,720
our ability to sense is one thing

105
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:53,279
the sensations are other and then the meeting of those two is

106
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:59,000
our sensing of the body breathing

107
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,360
and perhaps you can

108
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:30,920
have some sense some intuitive sense of the knowing the sensing

109
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,040
has its own thing

110
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:46,000
and then that knowing or sensing a wearing of

111
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,560
breathing

112
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,160
to let that be

113
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:03,519
expansive in time

114
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,440
as if there's

115
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,360
an extended present moment

116
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,880
to feel what's happening as your body breathes to know it

117
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,560
to experience it in the knowing

118
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,960
in whatever way you're aware mindful

119
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,240
relax back into it to see if there's a place where you can

120
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,840
be aware peacefully

121
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,880
where there's kind of like the window is open and the wind gently blows in

122
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,840
continuously

123
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:18,039
that your perception is open available

124
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:30,960
and what you're aware of is known in that open peaceful space and

125
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,039
continuously

126
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,720
and as we come to the end of this sitting

127
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:41,440
there is that there is these three parts also to love there's the object of our love

128
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:47,279
our ability to love and the loving

129
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:56,880
it's possible to relax back closer to the ability to love the loving

130
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,600
that may be there without the object

131
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:12,240
there's what we care for our ability to care

132
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,720
and the object and the and the caring itself

133
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:27,840
can you take refuge in your ability to

134
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:34,399
care have compassion to love

135
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:41,039
without so much concern with the object

136
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,159
where that care love compassion

137
00:27:52,159 --> 00:28:00,120
is peaceful and calm may be receptive

138
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,480
so that when you meet the world

139
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,919
that suffers or that you care for

140
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,639
you do so peacefully calmly

141
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:28,960
the kind of peace and calm which gives lots of time to time

142
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:36,640
lots of openness to the extended present moment

143
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:49,440
and perhaps this ability to care from this relaxed calm way

144
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,559
ability to love

145
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:00,320
can be touched can be

146
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:09,278
inspired or recognized as you hear these words

147
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,559
may all beings be happy

148
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:23,200
may all beings be safe

149
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,919
may all beings be peaceful

150
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:35,600
may all beings be free

151
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,799
and may our care

152
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,519
touch the world

153
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:04,159
not with midas touch that turns it into gold but with a meta touch

154
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:13,799
that turns it all into our friends may we be friends with this world

155
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:30,229
[Music]

156
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,278
so

157
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:49,440
so this is the third talk on the five characteristics of the dharma

158
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:55,679
that's an expression or it kind of is meant to express the kind of confidence

159
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:00,799
that it's possible that would people some people have in the dharma

160
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:07,039
and so this this the saying goes

161
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:14,399
the dharma is well spoken by the buddha

162
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:20,320
it is visible here and now immediate

163
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:27,158
inviting us to see

164
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:34,960
onward leading and to be personally known

165
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,840
experienced by the wise so today the topic is

166
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:46,000
pasico which is what sometimes translated as inviting inspection

167
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,039
inviting us to come and see and uh it's a uh

168
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:57,799
the this the compound word or two words that he

169
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:04,159
is the the kind of the instruction come come here

170
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:13,278
and um and pasico has the word to see in it come and see

171
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:21,919
the and it's the same kind of root uh as bipassana which has pasana in it

172
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:28,480
is that to see as well and so come and see and the buddha when

173
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:34,799
early in his teaching career when someone wanted to become ordained as a monastic

174
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:41,760
he would say to them come come monastic and that just simply that come come here

175
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:48,320
come into this was uh that was the ordination ceremony nothing more nothing more fancy

176
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:54,320
and so i kind of like this because this idea of ehi come

177
00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:00,799
and see has this kind of association in my mind to this movement

178
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:06,720
to really step into their spiritual life the dharmic life really fully

179
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:13,598
as this come into this

180
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:20,560
and um so the dharma beckons us to see

181
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:26,720
invites us to see says come look come look and

182
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:33,679
and it's not telling us come learn come read these books

183
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:40,800
come memorize these teachings come believe what i'm saying rather it's saying come and look come

184
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,000
and see and it's a beckoning us

185
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,240
and the question is what is doing the calling what's inviting us to come and

186
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:57,920
see and some people have suggested it's the world

187
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:04,079
that everything that's there there's a request that we connect with it that we know it they really are present for this

188
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:10,400
world because everything is important and i've known

189
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:16,960
some wonderful spiritual practitioners you get a sense when you're with them that everything is important every

190
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:23,760
little detail everything we do and the inspiring little event story that i

191
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:30,720
witnessed was in many many years ago in late 1970s

192
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:36,480
i was a witness to a unusual gathering maybe the first time

193
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:42,079
of about seven uh maybe the only seven full

194
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:49,200
send teachers in the united states and most of them were japanese who were moved to here to teach

195
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:55,119
zen and they had a meeting and after one evening of their kind of

196
00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:01,280
gathering they had they had a panel for us zen students and um

197
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,400
and someone they were there sitting behind a table and answering questions and things

198
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,920
and and some zen student came along with glasses

199
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:19,200
of water for them and then soon just reached behind them and put it on the table for them kind of

200
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:25,359
kind of innocuously kind of but as he went down the table he came to the

201
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:30,880
last person and a teacher may zumi roshi

202
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:36,960
and and when he the student left the water for the

203
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,880
teacher the teacher turned around as if that person bring the water was the most

204
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,960
important person in that moment and bowed kind of in kind of an appreciation and thanks

205
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,480
and the fact that none of the other teachers had done that it really started wow this is important

206
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:01,760
for this teacher this is important as anything else and the other teachers seem to me they were so involved in the q a that they

207
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:08,640
you know they didn't notice maybe but they said everything's important later i was sitting in a retreat next to

208
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,839
it japanese and monken i saw him bow to his teacup

209
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:19,599
i know why would you bow to a teacup so everything is important and so you would

210
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:25,280
maybe some what's inviting us to see is the world be present for it everything everything is

211
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:31,119
important another way of understanding what we're being invited to see

212
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:37,040
is the seeing itself that that that's a seeing that's

213
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:43,760
important come and see come and be involved in the seeing

214
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:50,640
that the freedom is found in how we see how we're aware how we know

215
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:56,400
and as we start tuning in to how we see how we know

216
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:03,680
it's a fantastic thing begins to happen is we start seeing recognizing

217
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:09,359
how our awareness our seeing our knowing gets hijacked gets

218
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:15,839
caught in gets utilized by our attachments our greeds our agendas

219
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:22,720
our conceits because we feel it getting it gets tight it gets frozen it gets

220
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:29,680
pressure it gets assertive the knowing is not spacious relaxed open peaceful

221
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:35,680
and and so come and see is i think to be partly an invitation

222
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:41,359
was not so much what you look at or in addition to what you're looking at

223
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:47,520
it's the act of seeing come really see learn about your seeing learn about how

224
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:53,359
you're aware learn about the the richness and the value of this

225
00:38:53,359 --> 00:39:00,560
present moment ability to be present and to see and so what's been calling us to see

226
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:06,800
is the seeing itself because the seeing itself

227
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:13,680
wants to be free wants to be open is available and i think you know the analogy i have

228
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:18,240
for this sometimes is um um

229
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:25,280
you know if you sit and meditate like in a nice way and come out of meditation very calm and

230
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,400
centered and very present then the seeing of the world around us

231
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,839
um just kind of happens naturally easily and things begin to sparkle and stand

232
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:42,560
out and highlight in a way they weren't when we're busy and stressed in everyday life maybe before meditation

233
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:49,200
i remember the first time i had this experience i kind of felt everything was sparkling

234
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:54,839
and i said wow had someone gone around and cleaned well i wasn't paying attention and

235
00:39:54,839 --> 00:40:01,359
wow or sometimes taking a nap during the day and i've woken up in a place where

236
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:07,920
there's sunlight coming in through the window and i can see all the dust particles playing in the sunlight

237
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:13,520
and i'm just kind of that is that's completely interesting to

238
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:19,839
see uh not because the dust particles are so interesting perhaps but what's so

239
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:24,880
compelling is the very relaxed open way of seeing

240
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:30,720
that just seems to happen on its own a kind of way of seeing it's free of

241
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:36,480
attachments and genders and all this stuff so come and see the dharma is come and

242
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,640
see see each thing may be as important come and see

243
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:47,520
be in the seeing and the freedom that's there

244
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:53,280
and and see deeply and as we do that there's a lot to see

245
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,960
and and one of the things to see is this what we'll talk about tomorrow a

246
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,560
another amazing quality of the dharma is that it's onward leading

247
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:10,000
and what is that onward leading well well i'm getting ahead of myself now but so that's where tomorrow i'm kind of

248
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,000
excited um but for now it's um

249
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:23,839
our capacity to perceive our capacity to know um a capacity to seize

250
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:30,000
literally and representing all the all the acts of perception

251
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,599
there's something that is welcoming us inviting us to let that come to the

252
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:41,040
foreground and the yeah that there's some feeling of invitation some

253
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:46,160
calling to it come is uh

254
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:54,640
is part of the dharma that's within us this call to be present this call to

255
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:59,680
know to see is lives within us

256
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:06,400
that gets obscured gets covered over by preoccupation by strong desires

257
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,440
strong aversions being in a hurry

258
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,200
and but as we are no longer in a hurry we live in this extended present moment

259
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:24,160
with where time gets stretched out or is more open or seems timeless

260
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:32,240
i think maybe you'll feel the call to being aware

261
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:40,240
to being aware in a way where being aware has been set free

262
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:45,599
of our thoughts preoccupation stories

263
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:52,640
past future where just being alive is enough

264
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:01,680
so eh come and see

265
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:08,160
come look may this be the day where you explore this and consider this

266
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:14,720
it requires what i'm suggesting and giving yourself that kind of extended time of now

267
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:22,800
because if you're in a hurry you can't feel the call the request the invitation

268
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:30,560
but take from time from time to time through the day to give yourself this extended time

269
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,079
and see what you can discover

270
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:42,240
that might be similar to this call to attention

271
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:48,640
that is free peaceful so thank you

272
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:54,400
and i hope you enjoy your day and you're exploring of this wonderful

273
00:43:54,400 --> 00:44:00,079
invitation to be present and maybe that

274
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:04,640
responding to that call can be

275
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:11,880
entering into a deeper life fuller life thank you
