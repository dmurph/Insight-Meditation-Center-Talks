1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:06,720
good evening welcome welcome nice to see you all

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,858
to practice together

3
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:19,880
so today I'd like to start with this uh little quote that's uh in the suit does

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,820
this uh where somebody asks the Buddha question

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:33,719
it seems like a for me when I hear this it seems like a relevant question that we could just ask

6
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,880
today absolutely so the question is

7
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:45,000
when beings all wish to live in peace this recognition that all of us want

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,860
peace of course all of us do not only humans do you write old beings this is part of

9
00:00:52,860 --> 00:01:01,020
I don't know I just imagine what it's part of what it means to be alive so the question is when beings all wish

10
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:08,360
to live in peace why are they perpetually embroiled in conflict

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,880
that's a good question like we all want peace but why is there so much conflict

12
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,659
all over the place and really obvious ways and even in really uh subtle quiet

13
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:28,860
ways of course we have like nation states but we also have you know just being

14
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:35,700
irritated with the neighbor because they're a dog barks all the time or something like this right there's

15
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:44,400
this maybe the conflict isn't um obvious or you know manifest in some

16
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:50,640
terrible throwing things or saying things or harming but there's this like

17
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,780
conflict like not getting along with being in contention with so why is that that even though we want

18
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:04,200
peace we find ourselves in conflict sometimes we're even in conflict with

19
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,420
the moment like I don't want this to be happening make it go away

20
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:16,140
this way in which we're kind of like trying to push things away or change them or manipulate them engineer them in

21
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:21,360
any way we can just to make them feel more comfortable so that we don't

22
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,459
feel like we have to be in conflict with them

23
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:34,080
so then as you might imagine and these suit does after that question the Buddha gives a talk

24
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,860
I'm not going to go into exactly that particular suit uh but he gives this discourse where he's tracing all the

25
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:47,459
causes of conflicts and hostility and he talks about settler and settler

26
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:52,800
more and more subtle elements of our experience

27
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,340
so I finally kind of like landing on it's our views

28
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:05,160
beliefs of course it is like how could it be

29
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:11,099
anything else these ideas that we have about how things should be or how we

30
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:16,440
should be but it's something it's not quite that

31
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:23,159
simple either because otherwise we could just say okay well we'll just change our beliefs or

32
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:28,379
don't have any beliefs or anything like that and then you wouldn't be in Conflict but

33
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:34,379
somehow that doesn't quite work there's this way in which we have these

34
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:40,560
views that we're not even aware of we're holding on to them in a way that we don't even know

35
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:47,700
and we don't want to have this uh approach like oh nothing matters or

36
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:54,060
everything's okay and we don't need any boundaries and we don't need to say this

37
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:02,519
is okay and that's not okay like we don't want to do that so how do we find our way with this

38
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:08,420
this idea of conflict and Views and beliefs

39
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,459
well first I'll start by here's a story that the Buddha gives about himself it's

40
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:20,940
a little autobiographical and it's a little bit different than what we usually hear about the Buddha it's

41
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:29,580
before he's awakened and what it was like to be a young man at that time in ancient India

42
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:37,680
it's very interesting because I can imagine that what he's saying actually I would say that a lot of what he talks

43
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:44,520
about is we could be talking about the same thing today I mean at the last verse but where he

44
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:50,720
kind of talks about is the way forward that he found but

45
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:57,960
starts like this just look at people and their quarrels

46
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:05,160
and I will speak of my dismay in the way that I was shaken seeing people thrash about like fish and

47
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,620
little water right there is this way that we people that thrashing about and fish a little

48
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,720
water there's this agitation whether it's obvious with their body

49
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:23,639
movements but there's a agitation that's wanting to lash out or to harm or blame or you know

50
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:30,240
something like this there's this quality of you know efficient little water has this little desperation to it or it's

51
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,240
feeling like it's not going to survive in some ways people feel like this often

52
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,900
too it's not so much that they're not going to survive but something in them feels threatened

53
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,539
and so they're thrashing about like fish and little water

54
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:55,740
I will speak of my dismay in the way that I was shaken seeing people thrash

55
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:01,139
about like fish in little water and seen them feuding with each other

56
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:07,680
I became afraid quite something somebody who's becomes

57
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,139
the Buddha says I became afraid

58
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:23,220
maybe I'll just say that I had some neighbors that reliably at 9 00 PM the yelling

59
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:29,039
would start and it was quite something it was like in the summer especially when we all have our windows open and

60
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:35,580
they were close enough to me wow I couldn't you know understand the words but I didn't need to

61
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:40,680
it was made me so anxious that night just to like hear all the yelling and

62
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:48,060
the yelling and the I felt like oh I don't know what's happening over there but it's pretty reliably almost every

63
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:53,160
night for years so it's just so heartbreaking

64
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,919
and it's sad too so when the Buddha to be he's talking

65
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:05,340
about seeing them feuding with each other I became afraid yeah maybe you've had that same

66
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:11,940
experience too or something about when we see

67
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:17,400
even like we see like on social media like people are thrashing around and

68
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:23,220
yelling at each other and you know there's some real ugly stuff that happens there there's this kind of

69
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:29,639
feeling too of I don't know is it fear but it's something like that

70
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:38,180
contraction and dismay maybe like this word of dismay

71
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:44,220
so the Buddha says seeing them feuding with each other I became afraid

72
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:49,919
I felt discontent at seeing only conflict to the very end

73
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:57,720
so he felt like everywhere he could see maybe I don't know what it means exactly to the end but in my mind Imagining the

74
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:04,139
end like of time like he couldn't see that it was about to finish like it was just gonna happen all the time and maybe

75
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:12,319
the end in terms of space like doesn't matter where he had been and with whom he was with there was plenty of conflict

76
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:19,919
same as it is now I felt discontented seeing only conflict

77
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:26,639
to the very end then but now here's where they'll shift

78
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:33,800
I saw an arrow here hard to see

79
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:40,140
embedded in the heart quite something

80
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:48,000
hard to see right didn't notice it but notice that there was this Arrow like a dart something like stabbing in

81
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,320
the heart pierced by this Arrow people Dash about

82
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:01,380
in all directions when the arrow is pulled out

83
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:06,380
they don't run and they don't sink

84
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:13,339
when the arrow is pulled out they don't run and they don't sink

85
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:20,279
they don't run and they don't sink is a reference to later or in another discourse

86
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:27,000
somebody asks the Buddha how did you cross the flood like how did you get through all this morass of difficulties

87
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,300
of life and with this metaphor of the flood like maybe a raging River

88
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:38,940
somebody asks them how did you get across like to the other side where things are safe and

89
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:44,880
um spacious and free he says I got Across The Other Side by

90
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:51,779
not halting and by not struggling so he's saying here when the arrow is

91
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:57,500
pulled out it's the same thing but they don't run and they don't sink

92
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:05,399
so it's a way to get to the other side where there's freedom and peace and

93
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:10,560
safety I appreciate this very much because the

94
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:16,200
Buddha is pointing to something that he discovered in himself he's not saying well okay you know all

95
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:23,220
you guys you have this problem and you gotta fix it he's saying you know I was distressed

96
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:28,980
and with that I've discovered that actually there was something I was contributing to this

97
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:35,700
this Arrow and not only is he saying that he is saying that other people can pull it out

98
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:42,899
too it's not just something that he did and of course we might even say that his

99
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:48,600
lifetime of teaching was about pulling out this Arrow

100
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:54,240
so we might ask well what is this Arrow how do we pull it out

101
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,700
how can we put an end to this conflict

102
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:09,000
so maybe before I answer that I'll tell One More Story this uh one little more uh discourse that also comes out of this

103
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,540
suit does this is a well-known one I think uh probably all of you who have heard this

104
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:20,940
it's there's a version of this story and a number of different religious traditions

105
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,980
so not just Buddhism I think from India it's in a number of

106
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:32,940
different Traditions I kind of like this idea that there's just this wisdom that was just being shared

107
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:39,139
and you know different Traditions kind of Incorporated it into their scriptures

108
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:47,279
and there's something about the version I haven't read it in any other religious tradition but the details of

109
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:54,360
this version I'll point out at the end kind of like makes a difference than the more sanitized version that I've heard

110
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:01,399
in Derma talks when I went to actually read I thought oh this is an important difference here

111
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:07,980
so there's this uh King when we might think

112
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:14,940
of a king as just somebody who has Authority there's this king who asks his servant

113
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:21,000
and we might even think just serve into somebody who obeys the authority of somebody else

114
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,060
could be a worker or whomever it is the king as the servant to round up

115
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:33,540
persons who are blind from birth so people had never seen

116
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:38,880
and when the servant had done so the king asked the servant to show the blind

117
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:46,260
people an elephant elephants huge these are just huge so

118
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:53,459
big and powerful so to some so of these blind people he

119
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:58,620
showed the elephant's head to some of the elephant's ear to some of the

120
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:06,240
elephant's Tusk to some the elephant's trunk you can just imagine where this is going right if you feel if you're a

121
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:13,019
blind person and you feel a Tusk you're going to have one idea you have a trunk you're going to have a different idea

122
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:18,300
so the body the foot the hindquarters the tail and even the tuft at the end of

123
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:24,779
the tail so you can imagine where this is going right that everybody just gets feels one

124
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:31,079
little portion of this giant elephant and then

125
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:36,139
the king asked the blind people what is an elephant like

126
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,399
of course somebody says it's like a water jar it's like a basket it's like

127
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:48,480
an arrow it's like a pull it's like a store room it's like a post it's like a mortar it's like a pestle it's like a

128
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,120
broom these are all different things

129
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:59,220
but then here's what comes next so they're saying an elephant is like this

130
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:05,940
it's not like that but it's not like that it's like this so they get to fighting all these different the blind

131
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:11,579
people are fighting amongst each other and then this they uh fought each other

132
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:16,740
with Fists so they couldn't see one another but they were flailing around and like it's

133
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:23,100
punching each other and the King was delighted with the spectacle technical so this was like

134
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,380
just for the amusement of this person so maybe unlike the Buddha who's like when

135
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:33,600
he's seen the conflict is feeling afraid and upset here's somebody who's like

136
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,820
just doing it for sport but you know if we do some of that right

137
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:44,880
maybe there's a part of us we do this too maybe there's some uh athletic events

138
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,519
that are a little bit like this or maybe there's a politics that are like this

139
00:14:50,519 --> 00:15:00,839
right there's this way in which we kind of like set up this conflict and it's entertainment

140
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:06,480
this is even like part of uh about like so many like reality TV right

141
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,920
this kind of stuff this is so the people became quarrelsome

142
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:18,180
disputatious and wrangling wounding each other with verbal daggers so they're

143
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:25,320
calling each other names and and then at the end of this then there's

144
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:31,199
a little bit of a discourse in the Buddha says in the same way

145
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:38,519
some religious practitioners so-called are deeply attached to their own views

146
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:45,800
people who only see one side of thing engage in quarrels and disputes

147
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:54,660
the people who only gauge in one side of things of course we have views

148
00:15:54,660 --> 00:16:01,980
but it's something different to have views and to be holding on to them so tightly that you have to quarrel and get

149
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:09,139
in fights with others and try to convince others that it's you know we're right and they're wrong

150
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:16,500
so this last story kind of with the elephant points to this tendency that we often think that we know the truth or we

151
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:23,220
know what's really happening when Only We Know a piece of the story

152
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:28,760
often we don't know what's going on inside somebody else

153
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:35,639
maybe sometimes when we're in the middle of a conflict we aren't thinking about like the bigger picture like

154
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:40,680
can you imagine if how the these blind people would have

155
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:47,339
how they would have reacted if the person who was showing them the elephant said okay so

156
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:53,759
now I'm doing this so we can do this entertainment for the king and I'm gonna tell everybody else something different

157
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,100
and then we're going to ask you to say what it is so if they had like the bigger picture

158
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:05,520
they would probably say I'm not going to do that I'm going to go talk to these other people and maybe we will just talk

159
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:12,120
together what is it like or something so this idea that we often think we have

160
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:17,760
the bigger picture but we don't or maybe we even have a really big

161
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:24,120
picture but we're still just holding on but maybe we're just missing one integral

162
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:30,179
piece of information that maybe we wouldn't even recognize like from our

163
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:35,700
background our social location our history like we might be biased to think

164
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:42,480
about things one way and not even recognize that different people think different ways of course they do

165
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:48,780
how can they not people from different family stories

166
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,940
cultures whatever it is

167
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:03,059
so maybe we I'll point out that we all have

168
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:10,080
distorted views not only do we not have the big picture but some of the views that we have are

169
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,840
distorted about the world and about ourselves

170
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:23,179
that's what we might think that we want to hold on to them but how accurate are they

171
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:30,240
that's where you might think that we're the ones who see clearly and these other people they're just obviously confused

172
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:36,539
or just don't know or we might have this idea is that we are the ones that are upstanding and

173
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:42,419
they are not you know us and Them me and everybody else

174
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:49,280
or we might have the sense that we are the aggrieved and they are the transgressors

175
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:58,700
we so often have these views but is this the whole picture and what are we not seeing

176
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:05,700
what are we not seeing and here's one thing that death this

177
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:11,280
little exercise that I this was offered as um

178
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:17,580
maybe I won't give all the Gory details but here's something that an exercise that I did that was a little bit of an

179
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:25,020
eye-opener for me a realization about oh some of these

180
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:31,400
views that I didn't even know I was holding that's kind of holding on to them tightly

181
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:37,080
unknowingly so here's it just starts with this

182
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:42,720
and just an exercise that we can do together so what are the groups that we belong to

183
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,660
of course we belong to groups so you might say that are you an

184
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:55,260
employee of a certain company and are you in a particular division within that company

185
00:19:55,260 --> 00:20:01,860
to that group or maybe you're interested in a particular Hobby

186
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:09,120
belong to that group maybe those hobbyists or you have a profession or maybe you belong to that group and

187
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:16,440
are you maybe you're involved or interested in the Arts and maybe you identify with a particular style or

188
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:23,580
school or genre of the Arts you know the violin is better than the

189
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:29,100
piano horsey or something like this maybe you have this certain

190
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:36,000
philosophical ideas and there's these different schools of philosophy certain Buddhist philosophy and Buddhist

191
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:43,020
tradition as well maybe this idea well you know this tradition is distinct and different than the other

192
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:49,919
traditions and I belong to this one or maybe you know sports teams or maybe

193
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:56,160
even brand names people or PC

194
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:02,640
Android or iPhone and maybe there's like this uh affiliation with wanting to be

195
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:09,179
with uh one of these or maybe citizen of him Nation

196
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:14,820
City Community neighborhood we all kind of like belong to these

197
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:19,919
groups a number of them maybe some of them we

198
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:26,880
don't identify with very strongly but we can ask ourselves

199
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:36,659
in what way is the identity of this group related to another group in some way

200
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:43,260
is there a rival team is there a competitor

201
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:48,960
and I remember like wow when I was in Corporate America this the department I

202
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:55,860
was in we had to partner with this other department in my department we were always complaining

203
00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:03,000
about that other department and then as a company we were always like the arrival was this other company so

204
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,100
there's this little bit of conflict right that's kind of just got set up as

205
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:15,419
part of like being part of this group or do we have this like this common

206
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:20,460
enemies for lack of a better word that's you know kind of that we're all

207
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:27,960
that provides some of the cohesiveness in this group so there's a way in which there's this

208
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:35,400
um underlying beliefs just shows up in so many ways that like sow the seeds for

209
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:41,640
conflict sow the seeds for US versus them

210
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,940
me versus you me against the world

211
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,640
and so there's this um quote from Michelle de montania

212
00:22:53,640 --> 00:23:00,059
it's a French philosopher I think in the 16th century he says

213
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:06,659
I consider myself an average person except for the fact except for the fact

214
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:13,080
that I consider myself an average person right we all kind of think that somehow

215
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:20,280
we're a little bit better than average I think there's kind of this recognition right you know even these hundreds of

216
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:26,400
years ago so of course there is nothing inherent

217
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:32,700
in any person nothing that makes them fundamentally

218
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:38,580
our enemy or competitor or something we need to be opposed

219
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:44,940
and yet we are so you know easily kind of kind of fall into that fall into that

220
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:51,780
kind of thinking and so this these are just cognitive biases that we have I

221
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:57,240
think probably all humans have them and one person a person could even say that

222
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,280
there's some evolutionary advantage to having some cohesiveness within a group

223
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:09,900
so we can take care of each other but clinging to our views contributes to

224
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:16,200
conflict clinging to anything

225
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:24,020
leads to suffering of course it does we know this clinging is not the weight of freedom

226
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,340
but sometimes we have these views that we don't even recognize that we have

227
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:35,159
we aren't even aware of and so

228
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:41,360
what can we do what are some ways in which we might be able to work with this

229
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:47,400
maybe I'll judge art with something this that uh Gill said

230
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:55,640
a number of years ago I think he might have said it more recently also and this idea of

231
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:02,240
be still and look upon everything kindly

232
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:08,760
there's something kind of like very simple be still and look upon everything kindly

233
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:16,140
so be still is pointing to is there a way that we can stop the thrush in about like fish out of water

234
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:22,140
which is you know exaggerated but there is sometimes this agitation the same

235
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:28,760
sense of agitation so can we quiet the mind

236
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:36,299
soothe the heart so that we can see a bigger picture

237
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:43,580
otherwise you know we're our view is limited definitely

238
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:52,740
can we quiet the mind so that we can check in with our experience

239
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:58,020
and notice how agitated we are sometimes when we're disagitated we're lost in the

240
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:03,779
agitation and don't really have any awareness of that I know this

241
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:09,900
happens for me sometimes like when those I had those neighbors that were yelling like sometimes I would just not even be

242
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:17,100
aware that I was agitated but I would just be agitated

243
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,840
trying to escape from the sound

244
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:29,539
and then this idea to look upon everything kindly

245
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:35,700
maybe we need to have to be still in order that we can look upon things kindly

246
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:43,559
and there's so many different ways we might interpret this idea of look upon things kindly but one of them is can we

247
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:49,980
soften our heart and soften our mind can we open up

248
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:54,440
whatever is kind of like feeling constricted

249
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:59,900
of course there's a few ways that we can do that

250
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:08,880
one is to just check in with the body and to relax the body of course the body and the mind are

251
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,980
connected sometimes it's easiest to start with the body

252
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:20,760
stretch be do something comfortable do some long deep breaths or long

253
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:28,260
exhales these are ways to kind of soften the body these kind of like soothe the nervous system also

254
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:34,740
then when the nervous system starts to calm down a little bit then we can see a bigger picture and maybe soften and open

255
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:42,059
the heart a little bit what would it be like

256
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:49,500
if in a conflict even if it's something that's subtle like this idea of identifying with a one group

257
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:55,440
that's opposed to another group what would it be like to give this other

258
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:01,620
group or the other individual a victory yeah you're right you know that's

259
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:06,960
actually a good point uh you're sorry yeah you know what I

260
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:13,080
changed my mind I can see what you're saying now oh I didn't realize that okay I didn't

261
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:19,460
know that other information so now that what you're saying makes more sense

262
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:29,299
we're saying you know I'm not entirely convinced but I can see that you're convinced so help me understand

263
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:35,580
these different ways you might maybe like give them a victory so that then that kind of like just brings the

264
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:42,299
tension down and everybody can maybe with some relaxation there can be

265
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:45,740
some seeing the bigger picture

266
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:52,919
I think many of us know this first from the dhamapada

267
00:28:52,919 --> 00:29:00,539
hatred never ends through hatred by non-hate alone does it end

268
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:08,100
this is an ancient truth course hatred never ends through hatred

269
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:13,320
hatred is maybe is a strong word but it's pointing to right conflict isn't

270
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:19,220
going to end with conflict

271
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:25,220
where is it going to end why not with us

272
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:38,399
so sometimes we have these cognitive have these biases of like me against the

273
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:44,640
world US versus them that way don't even aren't even aware of they just seem so

274
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:50,279
familiar that we don't even question them so much about this practice is starting

275
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:56,220
to see some of these underlying beliefs that we have about ourselves about others about the

276
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:03,260
world and and just start to hold them lightly

277
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,898
hold them like that okay this is what makes sense to me now

278
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:17,120
this is my provisional understanding something like this rather than you're just holding on tightly

279
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:24,139
and then here's an excerpt from a poem a short poem by Rosemary traumer

280
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,059
the title of this poem gives it away it says Dear moment that wasn't what I

281
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:36,059
thought it was so here's a little excerpt

282
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:45,000
thank you for blessing me with reality for showing me when I'm guilty of what my friend calls cognitive slippage

283
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:52,519
it's like stuffing a big scoop of Wasabi into my mouth thinking it's guacamole

284
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:59,279
the Mind believes what it wants to believe until it's shown otherwise

285
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:05,640
so this idea right big spoonful of Wasabi is really uncomfortable horse radish

286
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:11,100
that's you know just clears the scientist said it's very uncomfortable to have a mouthful of this especially if

287
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:16,140
you think it's guacamole something smooth and delicious and

288
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:23,279
so it's uh uncomfortable mission that it's uncomfortable

289
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:30,179
but it doesn't mean that we can't do it and it doesn't mean that that's it's not a way to greater and greater freedom and

290
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:37,080
ease not only for ourselves but for others for those people that we are in conflict

291
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:44,399
with so one way to work with conflict is to

292
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:48,860
be still and look upon everything kindly

293
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:56,159
of course to look upon things kindly means that we you know have this warm-heartedness

294
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,278
and sometimes we feel disconnected from our warm-heartedness

295
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:09,059
mindfulness practice supports this loving kindness practice supports our feeling connected both to ourselves and

296
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:13,320
to a sense of warm-heartedness

297
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:21,179
but also to be still I point to are there ways that we can be

298
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:26,460
more aware of our beliefs some of these underlying beliefs that we

299
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:32,159
might have can we be curious and maybe inquire about when we find ourselves in

300
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:38,279
Conflict just even ask ourselves what beliefs am I holding here that puts

301
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:44,820
me in so much conflict why why can't I kind of like hold this with open hands

302
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:50,580
still setting boundaries between appropriate and inappropriate behavior we're not being passive we're not

303
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:55,919
letting people walk all over us but we're not forcing our beliefs on

304
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:00,860
others we're holding them like this as opposed to like this

305
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:07,919
so maybe we could be curious about the beliefs and the opinions that

306
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:13,019
we have why why does that make sense to us

307
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:17,419
what's underneath them what's underlying them

308
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:27,419
because our beliefs are resistant to change and if we don't have this sense of curiosity or this willingness to

309
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:33,480
inquire they'll just stay embedded and they'll just be conflict after

310
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,200
conflict

311
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:47,340
so be still and look upon things kindly as a way to work with conflicts

312
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:53,159
to help become aware of some of these views that we have to help create the conditions for

313
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:59,580
conflicts with others and I'm using this word conflict of course right in a really General way just

314
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:06,299
mild irritation to really just you know giant as big as

315
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:12,599
you can imagine so maybe I'll stop there and then open

316
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:18,500
it up to see if there's some questions or comments

317
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:48,839
foreign by the verse from the dhamapada

318
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:55,260
about only by non-hate the other religion says you have to love

319
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:00,720
thy neighbor and that's a lot to ask can you talk about the difference and

320
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:09,480
why not hating my neighbor is enough yeah yeah and sometimes translators will say

321
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:15,720
call say do this love they will but the Paulie is not hate and I like this very

322
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:23,520
much for the same reason can you imagine why it is why it's uh just not hating is uh

323
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:29,540
good enough okay well

324
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:36,000
that I don't have to come up with the love that somehow by non-hating

325
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:44,099
by putting aside hey setting that aside there's space inside me and the love emerges naturally

326
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:48,980
rather than me having to do it very nice

327
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,200
very nice very nice I heard I appreciate this very much and

328
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:00,720
I would say that's definitely or what it's there but but you know love is uh

329
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,880
is a tall order right this I think often when we hear Like Love Thy Neighbor

330
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:11,160
especially like when there's these when we're having difficulties it feels uh

331
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:18,180
like we can't relate to that it feels like a disconnect like how am I going to get there when I'm over here with this

332
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:24,480
real anger or hatred or something it's harder than that because it's not just love thy neighbor it's love thy neighbor

333
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:29,640
as myself I see yeah so yeah yeah right

334
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:36,540
so so non-hate is ends with this conflict here right

335
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:41,640
so it's not that it's yeah it's just the ending of conflict it's more like

336
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:48,599
honoring and respecting which isn't the same thing as loving it's kind of like okay this is what I just I'm Not In

337
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:56,460
conflict with them as opposed to loving them like myself or thyself yeah

338
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,740
yeah thank you yes back here

339
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:14,040
thank you I think for me the concept of not hating someone

340
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:21,119
what it means to me very deeply and it took me a long time to figure out is hating someone the amount of energy it

341
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:26,339
takes and the amount it takes away from me and my essence

342
00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:33,720
it just is not worth the conflict or the hatred whatever you might call it yeah I'm not even thinking

343
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:41,820
about having a positive love or for that person I just don't want to be depleted

344
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:47,640
anymore yeah and not to be tangled up right when there's a hater then you're tangled up

345
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:53,780
with them in some kind of way and yeah yeah thank you thank you

346
00:37:55,380 --> 00:38:01,980
foreign about your neighbors and

347
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:06,740
said that they that that went on for years

348
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:15,780
something in me just like I'd have sadness yeah

349
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:20,900
did it ever turn out okay and they moved away

350
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:26,460
and in the winter we couldn't hear so well because our windows were closed but in the summer right we have our widows

351
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:31,680
open and we could hear so I don't know maybe they got along better in the winter but I don't know I didn't can

352
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:37,380
hear um I used to drive a cab in San Francisco

353
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:42,660
and once I was driving along and looked out the window

354
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:48,599
if it helps to set the scene it was on Sutter Street around Hyde

355
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:55,740
and going westbound north side of the street and there was two people a man

356
00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:02,579
and a woman walking along side by side and yelling at each other

357
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:09,240
bitterly okay and you can see this was a very sustained thing

358
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:14,280
and I looked at my passenger in the back seat and said

359
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:21,060
that just so completely unnecessary yeah and he he com he agreed right off the

360
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:27,359
bat it's quite something that you remember this right all these years later because

361
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:33,720
they touched something it's kind of like what the Buddha was pointing to you also it touches something when we see this

362
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:39,240
yeah yeah they could just if they're not happy with each other

363
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:47,599
just part and go different ways but for some reason people don't do that

364
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:55,800
he's having to follow on on that summer 1973 I was going on with the

365
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:03,300
woman that lived in an apartment and the apartment above her there was a couple that fought all the time

366
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:10,680
and it turns out the story was they fought all the time so they got divorced

367
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:15,780
and then they missed each other so they got married again and moved in and still

368
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:22,099
fought so it made me think you know there's something

369
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:28,320
you know it's kind of like sometimes people like their patterns

370
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:34,260
so much that it isn't like not having it is worse

371
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:40,140
than having the conflict for some so it's I I think there's

372
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:46,260
certainly a place for compassion yeah yeah and also

373
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:54,060
seeing that it's not just them that certainly there's there's ways in which I seek conflict

374
00:40:54,060 --> 00:41:02,400
not quite not like going to a boxing match but you know there is a I can see myself a

375
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:08,760
tendency leaning towards that occasionally there's a little Zing of energy and it

376
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:14,579
comes with that yeah yeah I could see you know why we do this right yeah

377
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:20,460
thank you Jim 1973 so you remember all these years

378
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:26,700
later also read this yeah well it's just I mean it was so

379
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:32,460
amazing to me that they actually got divorced went

380
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:38,040
apart and then got married again so they could be back together in that same

381
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:44,400
Dynamic and it was like yeah there's there's some valence there there's some yeah

382
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,560
something maybe psychologists have something to say about that but

383
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:57,200
thank you thank you it's like movie stars right attire during this yeah

384
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:03,020
hmm any last comments

385
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,338
I think cater here has a

386
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:18,599
what you're saying makes me think of my family my birth family my mother my

387
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:24,240
sisters an aggressive communication is kind of

388
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:32,099
the norm so I've tended to not spend time with them because I don't like it

389
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:37,560
um but I've I've learned that

390
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:43,680
I've learned to not take it personally it took a lot I've learned that I learned that it's just it really has

391
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:49,980
absolutely nothing to do with me it's how they need to they it's all them and how they need to communicate

392
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:57,780
and sometimes I don't like to speak aggressively but sometimes it's like

393
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:03,000
they don't feel matte or hurt or seen unless you raise your voice yeah yeah

394
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:09,240
you know so sometimes it's like it's just meeting the energy sometimes you know it's like

395
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:15,660
it's like a dance you know it's like an involvement it's like now I know that you see me yeah which is not how I like

396
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:21,720
to be um but I can also see that it's

397
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:27,780
just meeting them right it's just like that's what they need to know

398
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:32,940
oh okay you hear me and you see me and you know and so then there becomes this

399
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:40,440
challenge to be able to communicate in that without actually then it's really easy to to without actually becoming

400
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:46,200
angry right there's no there doesn't have to be any angry right it's just meeting the expression the mode of

401
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:52,140
expression um submitting the energy and not having it

402
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:58,920
to be angry yeah or ill because it's really easy when you get back in that mode for that old habit energy to arise

403
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:07,079
right yeah so it's a it's very interesting dance to just notice how people communicate

404
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:14,700
and then not take it personally and then kind of what is this situation need

405
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:20,339
so I don't avoid it as much I I would really was you know because they're my family they're my birth family and I

406
00:44:20,339 --> 00:44:26,480
don't want to um yeah I've learned well sometimes we need to get together

407
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:33,180
but it's not my personal preference right yeah it's interesting the

408
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:40,640
compelling nature of habit energy thank you thank you

409
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:52,579
wishing you all a wonderful rest of the evening can I
