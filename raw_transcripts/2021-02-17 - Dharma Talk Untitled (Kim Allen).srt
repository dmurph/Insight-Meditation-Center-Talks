1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,520
so a warm welcome to everyone here

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:14,559
as i mentioned earlier diana is away for the evening teaching on retreat so i'm

3
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,680
happy to be here with you this evening my name is kim allen

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,519
i want to talk tonight about thought perhaps in a different way

5
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:34,880
though then you may have heard we definitely use thought all the time

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,480
in daily life but it's also easy in meditation

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:48,000
to see that thought is usually what distracts us in some way we lose our mindfulness

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,559
because we start thinking so then it's easy some people conclude from this that

9
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:02,480
thinking is always bad or that the aim of meditation is somehow to

10
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:09,680
eliminate thinking thinking mind can only be a hindrance

11
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:17,680
but actually that idea is not in line with the buddhist teachings

12
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:26,560
the buddha had a more nuanced view of thought and its role in the normal functioning

13
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,640
as well as in the awakening of the mind there's a place for thought on the path

14
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,159
of development so he identified which kinds of thought

15
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,439
are actually unskillful and unhelpful and he also talked about kinds of

16
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,200
thought that are helpful that are skillful some of them might even be necessary

17
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,479
along the path of liberation so i will talk somewhat about

18
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:03,200
unskillful thought because it's something that we're very familiar with and it's an important

19
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:10,080
thing to uh to have some sense of how to work with but i want to leave plenty of room

20
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,720
to talk about the helpful kinds of thought and conceptuality that we can do

21
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,080
because we don't get to hear about those quite as much and there are a number of them uh

22
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:30,560
described in the buddhist teachings now in the end what you may have heard

23
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,879
from teachers is correct in that the ordinary thinking and conceptualizing mind

24
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:43,120
is a hindrance to freedom at some point and it will be let go

25
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:50,080
maybe we'll even develop some alternatives to it along the path but nonetheless even concepts and

26
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,440
thinking have a function along our path of meditation

27
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:02,319
and in daily life i think we're going to need our whole mind to awaken and so that would include

28
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:08,720
thought so let's look more carefully at what is useful in the thinking mind and what is

29
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:16,000
not so starting with

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,879
how we often experience our mind at least at the beginning of our spiritual development and often for

31
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:28,080
many people at the beginning of a sit all along the path what we experience is

32
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,280
a lot of discursive what's called discursive or obsessive

33
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,440
excessive thought where the mind is going over conversations it's making

34
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:46,560
plans it's worrying about what that person might have meant by what they did yesterday we're sort of

35
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,000
caught up in that and it usually comes with a lot of largely unseen

36
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,599
views about the world and about ourselves and all of that and a lot of this

37
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:03,280
thought is kind of running along habitual patterns most of this kind of thought is not

38
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:10,319
especially original and we've probably thought it before and if we look more carefully we can see

39
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,360
that a lot of it is about myself and is essentially

40
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:23,040
based somehow in wanting or not wanting or not being very clear so this kind of

41
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,199
unhelpful thought which i'm just going to call discursive thinking this is the kind that is

42
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:35,520
um common at the beginning of a sit shall we say and it kind of dominates

43
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:42,400
our mental experience and so because of this thinking it's a bad rap it just sort of gets a blanket statement of

44
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,880
ah this is not useful let it go try not to think try to get concentrated

45
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:55,120
and not do that but with that kind of attitude

46
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,880
if we have that idea that all thought is like that we set up a lot of aversion in the mind

47
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:07,600
and this can actually just further entrench our tendency to think right as soon as we say you know don't

48
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,240
think of a purple elephant that's all you're going to think about right so if you say don't think or stop all those

49
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:21,680
conversations in the mind and get concentrated there's a way in which that's not an effective approach yes

50
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,039
so it's unfortunate because some people can get caught in this aversive dynamic

51
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:34,000
of hating their thoughts for a long time and um but if we look at the early

52
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,280
buddhist texts there's a more nuanced understanding of the thinking mind

53
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:47,120
thinking as i as i said in the guided meditation thinking is what minds do it's a normal function of the mind so

54
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:55,520
this kind of normal ordinary thought that we have sort of top of mind can be skillful or

55
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,800
unskillful it can actually be either one of those so i would say that maybe the initial

56
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,960
task of practice is that if we have a lot of the discursive kind of thought is that we somehow have to

57
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:13,840
reduce that and enhance the skillful part which is no form of right effort

58
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,960
essentially so instead of thinking in terms of let's get rid of all the thought or let's

59
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:26,000
quiet all that down how about if we tried to change the balance so that more of the thought was skillful

60
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,120
and less of it was unskillful that's often a good way to start so we

61
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:39,039
can start to explore this um different kinds of thinking by distinguishing

62
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:45,919
the content of the thought from its qualities let's say so the content

63
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:52,720
is what we're thinking about it's about our friend or that thing that happened yesterday or

64
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:59,440
the problem we have with our work that's the content of the thought but then the qualities have to do more

65
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:05,440
with the energy behind the thought how intense it is uh the manner of the thought what's the

66
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,560
tone of it and the experience of that thinking you know how are we relating to it in some

67
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:17,039
way so that the kinds of thought that are hindering our spiritual practice the ones that i

68
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:22,960
mentioned earlier they have a certain set of qualities that we can identify

69
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,199
um most obviously they're disconnected from present moment awareness discursive

70
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,639
thought is about then and there it's not really about here and now

71
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,800
so they feel kind of distant or vague they're yeah they're not connected

72
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:47,039
secondly they tend to be sticky they they catch the mind and draw it in that's why we get

73
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:54,400
sucked into this kind of discursive thought again and again it has a hook somehow a stickiness to it and then

74
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,759
thirdly the energy of it is usually somewhat driven you know there's a feeling of i've got

75
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,280
to play this out you know i have to play out this conversation i have to think through this problem

76
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:11,840
i have to devise some idea about this i have to figure out why this view is correct

77
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:19,599
there's a sense of um yeah of drivenness to it so that's also useful to know so all of

78
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:25,039
this adds up to seeing oh when we see the qualities of this unskillful thought it

79
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:32,080
becomes clear why we get drawn into it so easily it has a lot of qualities that are going to pull the mind away from a more subtle

80
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,518
experience like the breath or the body so we can understand that yeah it's

81
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,880
going to be hard to turn away from discursive thought so you can not maybe not blame yourself

82
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,320
for that so much so instead of trying to get rid of this kind of thought

83
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,399
i like to talk about reducing the intensity of discursive thought is kind of our

84
00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:00,720
first task in practice if you will there are a lot a lot a lot of methods for this

85
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:07,040
in the in the buddhist teachings it's clear that this has been an issue for people for a long time

86
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:14,640
so again you're not alone if this is something that you experience so it's not a focus of this talk they'll

87
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,320
talk about a lot of methods for working with discursive thought that

88
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:26,560
could be a whole talk in and of itself but i'll name a few of them since it's good to be reminded um

89
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:34,080
so they include first and foremost breath and body awareness that's why we talk about that so much

90
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,680
that's why those are the first instructions i found this to be these to be the best

91
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,360
remedies for discursive thought in fact the buddha says a meditator

92
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,959
should cultivate mindfulness of breathing for cutting off distracting thoughts that's a quote right from

93
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:58,160
suta so the buddha was talking about this quite directly to his disciples

94
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,839
so breath and body are are a good choice because they're always

95
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:09,360
in the present moment they immediately take away that quality of discursive thought

96
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:16,560
that is not in the present moment that vagueness that it has but also really there are other ways

97
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:23,360
that we can reduce the intensity so for example we can use our thinking mind for something else we can start

98
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:30,640
directing the energy into thoughts that are about the present moment and this is the point of noting practice

99
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:37,680
so you may have heard of noting practice where sometimes as we sit we gently name or label

100
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,880
the experiences that we're having oh experience of sadness and experience of

101
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:50,959
pressure experience of heat experience of joy just noting as we go along a little

102
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:56,399
you know simple word that goes with what we're experiencing and that redirects some of the energy

103
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,600
that could have gone into unskillful thought it directs it into thought that's

104
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:08,320
about the present moment it's that simple so it reduces the intensity of that other kind of thought

105
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:15,360
uh techniques like counting the breath are the the same thing we're using our our thinking mind to be thinking about

106
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,720
the present moment and then um you know once we've gained a

107
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,640
little bit of traction we can actually turn mindfulness toward the thinking process itself

108
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:34,880
this is another good way to continue reducing the intensity of discursive thought so we can kind of turn the good part of

109
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,000
of our analytical mind against the part that's trying to pull us away

110
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,560
so we can actually gain some insight about thought by looking in this way we start to for example discern those three

111
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,680
qualities that i talked about earlier the uh the nebulousness the stickiness

112
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:58,639
and the drivenness of unskillful thought all of that can come about as we start

113
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,880
to be able to see thinking with mindfulness

114
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,680
so this means we can start to answer questions like how do i know if a given thought that's

115
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,800
coming in is that one of these discursive or obsessive thoughts that's not useful

116
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:21,200
or or if it's something that would be okay you know more more beneficial to have and we can see

117
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,480
quite clearly that um generally discursive thought just is

118
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,519
directed toward itself it generates more and more discursion and it doesn't ever resolve

119
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:37,120
doesn't quite resolve meaningfully whereas in contrast thoughts that are more skillful

120
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:43,519
it's very easy still to be aware of the body it's pretty easy to breathe through them like i talked about in them

121
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:49,920
in the guided meditation so there are qualities that we can discern immediately as a thought starts to arise

122
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:56,240
as to whether or not it's going to be a discursive one and we should be very careful or if it's a somewhat more skillful

123
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:03,279
thought and we'll talk in a moment more about what kinds of skillful thoughts there are that can arise

124
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,800
so we can start to have just a little bit of wisdom about our thinking we could start to have more

125
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,160
distinction about what kinds of thoughts there are and know that some are useful and some

126
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:20,320
are not so i would say that the sort of initial part of dharma practice and

127
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,800
maybe the initial part of the sit for many people is to start using our analytical mind

128
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:34,160
skillfully in order to reduce the impact of this discursive kind of thought that's that's

129
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,279
vague that's sticky and that's driven

130
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:47,839
but actually we can go one step further and we can start looking at certain kinds of cognition that are

131
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:53,440
actually praised in sutas this is sometimes a revelation for people to realize

132
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,360
that they there are kinds of thoughts that are worthy of developing in their own right so i want to focus now because i think

133
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:06,000
it's rare that i it's spoken well up in dharma talks that thought has spoken well of

134
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,600
so let's let's talk a little bit about skillful thought thoughts that actually help cultivate

135
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,120
the mind so the buddha praised learning

136
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:24,320
quite highly in sutas learning is offered as one of five

137
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:31,040
highly meritorious qualities that we can have that are said to be a form of inner

138
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:37,760
wealth in one suta and in another suta it said that these are qualities that

139
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:44,320
fortify the mind so they literally strengthen it or build it up

140
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:53,600
somehow so here's the five faith or confidence virtue

141
00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:00,160
learning generosity and wisdom it's an interesting list

142
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:07,120
isn't it so we have four qualities that are maybe more common you've heard them in

143
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,480
other lists faith virtue or ethical conduct

144
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:18,320
generosity and wisdom these are qualities that are named all over the texts and

145
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:25,680
we might aspire to be developing those in ourselves but what about this middle one learning

146
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:32,079
what is that and why is that named along alongside virtue so learning is as

147
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:37,680
important as not killing not stealing it's important as giving it's as

148
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,519
important as wisdom so it's quite amazing so what does this

149
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:51,199
mean what is meant here by by learning um the word that's used there

150
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:58,720
in uh in pali is actually a word that means literally what is heard so it has to do with

151
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,639
things that we have that we have heard and you can understand this from the way

152
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:10,000
that things were taught in the buddha's time it wasn't that they had books

153
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,639
most people couldn't even read or write for that matter so if you wanted to hear teachings you

154
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,759
wanted to learn teachings you had to go here a teacher it was about what you could hear

155
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,279
and the opportunity to hear the dharma was very precious actually and so this quality of learning though

156
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,959
was not literally just hearing like i was within earshot and it entered my

157
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:38,639
ears it has to do also with being a little bit more active given that we couldn't take notes we

158
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:44,959
couldn't listen to the recording later we couldn't go consult a book

159
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:51,920
so learning uh and this this thing heard what is heard includes also

160
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:58,000
some sense of active listening so paying attention and kind of taking it in and integrating

161
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,519
it into what we know and it also includes memorizing it to some degree

162
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:10,000
remembering it well not literally memorizing it although that was done but remembering it well enough that you

163
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,000
would be able to use it the next day if you heard a dharma talk and had forgotten it by

164
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,000
the time you walked home it wasn't not as useful as if you could remember something about

165
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,199
it so this quality of learning that was praised is to have a sign of an intelligent

166
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:33,360
interaction with the teachings and that and that is what starts to change our

167
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:41,120
mind what is what starts to develop the mind in a sense so this kind of learning we can still do

168
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,320
you know we do it through listening to dharma talks online through taking notes maybe through reading dharma books

169
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,840
through reading sutas by exposing our mind again and again we may not remember everything

170
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:59,120
so well maybe not as well as they did when there was no other option but nonetheless as we hear and learn and

171
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,799
listen to things [Music] they kind of get into the mind in a way

172
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:11,120
and start to come into our thoughts more often you know teachings will come into our

173
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,240
thoughts i like to tell a story where uh one time

174
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:24,559
i was just in the kitchen doing washing the dishes or something and i i broke a cup and um

175
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:30,559
you know normal enough thing to have happen but immediately what came to mind was uh the quote from

176
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:35,600
ajahn chah where he says oh i enjoy my cup very much but for me

177
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:41,120
the cup is already broken you know indicating an understanding of impermanence but it's

178
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:48,320
you know it's a line that i had heard or read a number of times and when i broke the cup my mind said ah the cup was already

179
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,679
broken so it's just a simple moment where i could have gotten angry or

180
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:59,360
you know said a swear word but instead this thought of the dharma came to mind

181
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:06,080
and that's you know that's one of the fruits of this this learning that's praised and that's a useful kind

182
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,760
of of uh use of the thinking mind the intelligent mind the cognitive mind the linguistic

183
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:17,919
mind all those things that we might associate with thinking which is not which is supposed to be bad

184
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:23,200
but it's not it can be used well there are also many beneficial ways to

185
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,799
use the cognitive mind on the cushion so the buddha for example encourage

186
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:34,400
reflection on various inspiring themes that will

187
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:42,160
invoke confidence and joy so in one of the sutas he he offers six

188
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:48,720
different themes that we could reflect on during sitting and those include the

189
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,840
qualities of the buddha qualities of the dharma the qualities of the sangha

190
00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:00,400
our own virtue our own generosity and the fact that there are beings with

191
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:08,400
well-developed minds in the world so those are the six themes and it's interesting um

192
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:14,720
it's also interesting to note that the where i said beings that have well-developed minds

193
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,320
what we reflect on is the fact that they have those five qualities i just mentioned we reflect

194
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:27,200
that there are beings in the world who have faith virtue learning generosity and wisdom and just knowing that there are people

195
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,400
like that uh can be inspiring and it's skillful to think about that

196
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:39,360
so any of these themes is said to bring about according to the suta inspiration in the meaning inspiration

197
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:45,760
in the dharma and joy connected with the dharma so it's interesting isn't it that

198
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,919
qualities heart qualities like faith like motivation and like joy

199
00:20:51,919 --> 00:21:00,480
can emerge from thought so as an example what is what are these

200
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,320
reflections there are specific words given for how we would reflect on each of these six themes and the one for

201
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:13,120
the for the dharma is like this the dharma is well expounded by the blessed one

202
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:20,480
to be seen here and now timeless inviting verification pertinent

203
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:28,640
to be realized by the wise for themselves so it's six qualities of the dharma and

204
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:34,960
we could just reflect on those even during sitting it's okay to reflect in this particular

205
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,080
way it's kind of like the question i asked what about the dharma

206
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:47,120
touches your heart in the guided meditation so there's a way in which we can use the

207
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:53,039
thinking mind to uplift the heart and it says further in this suture that when we are thinking in

208
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:59,520
this way the mind is headed straight and it doesn't get distracted it's not tangled up with great hatred

209
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:05,440
and delusion and in fact it will go not only toward joy but also eventually toward concentration

210
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,840
which is interesting also if certain forms of reflection can eventually lead to

211
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:17,120
concentration so then we can also

212
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:23,360
look into the cognitive mind's ability to ask questions and explore the dharma in various ways

213
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,559
so i'm talking now about inquiry as a way of clarifying the teachings

214
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:35,760
and also going deeper into our experience so the sutas report cases of meditators

215
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:41,760
sitting in meditation and it will literally say in the suta while the venerable so and so was

216
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:48,400
sitting in meditation a certain train of thought arose in his mind his or her mind

217
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:55,679
and sometimes it will say at that point they went to ask the buddha a question or maybe they continued meditating and

218
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,720
later they went to ask the buddha a question about it so there are times in which

219
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:08,640
thoughts can arise kind of out of our sitting practice that are relevant for the dharma dharma questions related to the dharma

220
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:14,640
or understanding the meaning of the teachings and we don't need to call those unskillful and say oh thinking oh

221
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,760
bad i got distracted from the breath again you know you don't necessarily go off on a long

222
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,960
discursive thought trail about that but you can remember okay my mind came up with the thought

223
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:31,200
about the dharma maybe i'll look into that later maybe i'll ask the teacher about that later um that

224
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,240
that's okay there are thoughts about the dharma that are that can be taken seriously essentially

225
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:43,440
we want to take take it seriously when our mind starts inquiring into the meaning of the dharma

226
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:50,080
so then a more modern inquiry practice is like what we did in the sitting where we can drop in a question

227
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,520
it's not expected that we're going to come up with a clear definitive answer that we could write down and carry

228
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:01,200
around yes i know the answer to that question it's really more intended as a a way to

229
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,400
lead the mind deeper into itself i've noticed when i do those repeating

230
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:12,480
kinds of questions that sometimes the first few times i ask it i get an answer that i kind of

231
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:18,159
already knew kind of a cognitive answer um

232
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:24,480
but then after maybe if i if i say okay thank you and i rest for a moment and ask again

233
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:30,000
i start getting answers that are no longer at the surface level maybe i didn't know some of that maybe i

234
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:37,279
surprised myself oh i didn't realize that that is also touching me about the dharma

235
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:42,880
something else and something else and eventually maybe there's even a kind of a visceral response that doesn't

236
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:49,840
have a word associated with it anymore and then we know that we're that inquiry is leading us deeper into

237
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:55,679
the mind deeper into the heart and it's helping to integrate you know the cognitive mind with the heart with

238
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:01,840
the body and that kind of integration is useful along the path

239
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:11,679
so it is clear i think from this that well-directed thought about the dharma relating to practice

240
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:17,120
has a place on the path but it is true that this is not

241
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,720
sufficient the buddha does say many times that the teachings cannot be fully understood

242
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:30,240
by the cognitive mind i'm going to read two different translations of a passage that's repeated throughout the sutas about this

243
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:36,000
one translation is like this this dhamma is profound peaceful and

244
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:43,760
sublime unattainable by mere reasoning to be experienced by the wise

245
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:50,640
and another translation says this principle is deep hard to see hard to understand

246
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:59,440
peaceful sublime beyond the scope of reason subtle comprehensible to the astute

247
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,200
so we start to get the sense that although there is good thinking along

248
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,400
the path we're going to have to develop other dharma qualities also

249
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:18,480
so the next level of skillful thought if you will is to begin uh directing the attention to

250
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:25,440
stabilize the attention into samadhi into some gathering of the mind

251
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:32,400
so letting go even of what could be called thought and arriving at more just a continuous

252
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:38,960
attention so some of the initial factors that support concentration

253
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:44,880
are qualities that are called applied thought and sustained thought so where we direct the mind it's

254
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,919
interesting that it's called thought but this means directing the mind toward the meditation object

255
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:55,679
so if it's the breath placing the mind on the breath placing attention on the breath or the

256
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:03,440
body for example that act is actually a cognitive act we are intentionally directing the attention

257
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:10,159
but it's a more subtle kind of mental act right than thinking way more subtle than discursive thought which is way off

258
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:17,440
at the sort of top level so we start to see that there's a refinement of how we're using the cognitive mind

259
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:24,000
and it begins to invoke other dharma qualities such as somatic concentration

260
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,279
we can also use thought to cultivate the heart qualities like the brahma viharas

261
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:36,240
that's a word for loving kindness compassion appreciative joy and equanimity these

262
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:43,039
are not exactly thoughts but they are things that can be evoked through repeating phrases which are

263
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:48,320
thoughts through directing the mind to the

264
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:53,760
feeling in the heart you know these are other ways that we use our cognitive mind to cultivate very

265
00:27:53,760 --> 00:28:00,159
skillful qualities on the path that are taking us much deeper than the level of the thinking mind

266
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:06,640
amazingly um thought can even be used to evoke the seven factors of awakening

267
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,000
there's an amazing suta that says that

268
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,520
when one this is about speaking about an advanced meditator

269
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:23,919
dwelling thus withdrawn meditator recollects the dharma and thinks it over

270
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:30,240
it literally says recollects the dharma and thinks it over on that occasion the awakening factor of

271
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:36,080
mindfulness is aroused how about that so for someone who's

272
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:44,159
meditated for a while who has some understanding of how the thinking mind works it's possible to think about the dharma

273
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:51,840
in a way that evokes uh mindfulness wow it's a very surprising suta

274
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:58,000
and very interesting one and it goes on to say that the other factors of awakening can be evoked this way also

275
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,279
so it's quite stunning so i like to say that as

276
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:09,520
as we refine the cognitive mind from discursive thought which we let go of

277
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:14,799
and replace with more skillful thought we then start to cultivate more and more

278
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:20,559
wisdom-related dharma qualities and we come to have what i like to call the mind of dharma

279
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:25,919
where the mind is just operating in a frame where it thinks about the dharma when it breaks a

280
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:34,080
cup where it calls forth the brahma bihar is as needed where it um understands what activity would be

281
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:41,919
ethical in a certain situation our mind starts to become useful to us really functional

282
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:48,960
really beneficial for continuing to walk the path and we can cultivate this kind of mind

283
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:55,440
simply through beginning with skillful thoughts beginning by reducing the intensity of

284
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:02,559
the unskillful thoughts and starting with the skillful ones right up at the surface level from that all of the rest can unfold all

285
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:09,760
the way to the qualities of wisdom insights and awakening but i hope

286
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:16,559
this talk is at least giving you the idea that the thinking mind is not all bad

287
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:22,960
you don't need to get rid of it any more than one needs to get rid of a child in order to become an adult

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:31,039
so it's a natural process and it begins simply with replacing

289
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:38,159
the unskillful side of the discursive mind reducing the intensity and replacing

290
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:45,200
those with more skillful thoughts that will then lead the mind deeper so may your practice bear great fruit

291
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,240
and may you come to love your cognitive mind

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:58,799
