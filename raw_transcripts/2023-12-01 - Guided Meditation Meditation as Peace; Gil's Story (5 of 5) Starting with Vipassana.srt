1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:06,240
warm greetings from meditation Hall here at Insight

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:13,240
Meditation Center uh and I'm delighted to be here and I'm

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:22,119
delighted to in a certain virtual way to be with you all where you are and that

4
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:30,160
um to feel the the net the interconnected net of

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,399
all of us spread around the world I'd love to see a map with um each of us the

6
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:43,559
place we're in and then lines from each of us to everyone else in here sitting

7
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:51,920
here and how those would crisscross and what kind of net that would make so thank you for being

8
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,000
here this morning I was thinking about what used to be called maybe still

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,960
called Russian dolls these uh series of um dolls of

10
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:12,280
different size that if you uh the outer ones you can pull them apart and then the smaller ones are

11
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:19,320
inside and they get smaller and smaller until you get to the smallest one which is uh is whole you can't pull it

12
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:25,479
apart and uh sometimes in uh Buddhist

13
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:31,360
spirituality people can have the sense that we're made up of all these

14
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,720
Parts all these layers and part of practice is to deconstruct them to let

15
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:44,600
them go to quiet them down to uh to settle deeper and deeper in until we can

16
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:52,840
get to some core a core of Peace a core of Freedom some place of deep inner calm

17
00:01:52,840 --> 00:02:01,079
or deep inner sense of wholeness or honesty or Integrity or well-being

18
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,799
that doesn't dismiss or deny or condemn all the other

19
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:13,400
layers it does create a different reference point for understanding the different

20
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:21,760
layers but as practice goes along rather than the the um the goal of practice is to

21
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:30,160
tap into some deep inner place of Peace uh that the peace the freedom the

22
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,760
Joy of practice uh begins be becomes the outermost

23
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,680
doll and uh and so everything is everything is within that the largest

24
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,879
container the largest sphere that holds all the different ways that we are is um

25
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,920
is uh uh Joy or letting go or peace all

26
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:00,120
those things are kind of synonymous and um and so it doesn't mean

27
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,959
that so we we it's kind of like we can be operating on these different layers at the same time there might be a place

28
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:13,159
within us that does feel very sad or hurt or angry or challenged in some

29
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:18,519
way uh but there are these other uh places that could be at the foundation

30
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:24,000
we might feel at the very bottom of it all we might feel a place of peace or it

31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,799
might be that to at some point that that peace at the bottom of deep letting go

32
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:37,120
opens up and it becomes the the largest of the Dolls it's what large a sphere that holds it all and it creates a very

33
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,879
different context for being with the things that are challenging it's almost like the

34
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,920
challenges are no longer challenges they're still may be painful but they

35
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:55,360
are not something that we're identifying with or or uh caught in and not being caught in it we can

36
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:03,519
hold it with greater compassion hold it with greater care and love and and uh and if uh if we are identifying

37
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:13,400
with anything it's with uh that which is peaceful so to assume a meditation

38
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,720
posture and to lower your gaze or close

39
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:28,600
your eyes and if

40
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:35,520
you feel yourself with the largeest sphere that holds it

41
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:42,000
all whatever way you are not trying to look for peace or calm just whatever way

42
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,960
you are right now allow yourself to be present for

43
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:55,440
it be aware of it appreciating that this is the present

44
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,840
moment experience

45
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:06,880
even if you're thinking about the past and future or how you're feeling relates to the past and

46
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:14,759
future for now just appreciate that here and

47
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:18,600
now this is how you

48
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:33,720
are gently taking a

49
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:41,400
few deeper satisfying breaths just deep enough to some degree

50
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:49,960
of satisfaction very modest

51
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,360
satisfaction exhaling a little bit more than

52
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:02,039
usual maybe giving you a better sense of

53
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:05,440
completion in the

54
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
exhale

55
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,120
letting your breathing return to nor

56
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:58,759
normal and for a few rounds of breathing just so you can surf on the

57
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:05,160
breathing or let the movements of breathing massage your

58
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
body

59
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:36,960
and whatever you're thinking

60
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:46,199
about can you lighten up loosen up around it a bit by relaxing

61
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,840
the thinking

62
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:05,360
mind and then take a further

63
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:12,680
step on the exhale to let go of what you're thinking

64
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:18,599
about maybe imagining it drifts away like a thought

65
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
bubble

66
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:52,240
maybe letting go of your thoughts that is also a letting go

67
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,200
into whatever calm or subtleness there is in your

68
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
body

69
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:15,240
whatever is beginning to come or become more settled settling

70
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,440
process let go into

71
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
it

72
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
for

73
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:22,000
if you're holding tight in your fist a

74
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,680
stone and if you let go of it you'd probably drop the

75
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:34,440
stone If instead of letting go of the

76
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,760
stone you let go of the

77
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:50,200
gripping and if you're holding the stone with your palm upward the stone won't

78
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,519
drop it just held lightly in the

79
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:04,760
hand as you let go of thoughts do you let go of anything you can let go

80
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:13,480
of don't let go of it let go of the grip the tension the

81
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
pressure

82
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
for

83
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
for

84
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
for

85
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
for

86
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
for

87
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
for

88
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:57,680
let go gently

89
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:04,440
steadily maybe with every exhale let go let go of any

90
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,639
[Music] holding

91
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:20,320
clinging any way in which you hang on to thoughts or feelings or

92
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,680
ideas any way that you're preoccupied by

93
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,600
anything expectations preference

94
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:38,360
is let go

95
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:45,279
relax lighten up and as you do

96
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:51,319
so let go into whatever calm or

97
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:55,120
peace that might be

98
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
here

99
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,560
however small it might

100
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,519
be

101
00:16:52,639 --> 00:17:00,480
tension grasping clinging pressure

102
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:09,918
are all things that make us smaller limit the range of

103
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:18,160
attention to let go to relax let go

104
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:25,160
into the wider space beyond the edges of your what

105
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:31,600
you're holding on to beyond the edges of what you're

106
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
thinking

107
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:13,679
as if you're stepping into a very big room after being in a very small

108
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:22,159
one with every exhale let go relax

109
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:29,200
into the widest sphere beyond the edges of whatever

110
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:36,080
you're feeling and thinking where there might be some modum

111
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:42,039
of peace and calm that holds it

112
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
all

113
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
for

114
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
e

115
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
for

116
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
for

117
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
for

118
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
for

119
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:32,640
beyond the edges of whatever is troubling

120
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:40,960
you or deep deep down inside at the core of

121
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:48,480
everything might there be a calm or a

122
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,320
peace a place of non-identification

123
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,240
nonreactivity

124
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,880
that helps you to not identify with what troubles

125
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,440
you helps you not identify with what is going

126
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:29,880
well that allows you to be at ease on

127
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,158
troubled by the layer inside which is

128
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,200
troubled without preferences for the layer inside which

129
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,480
has

130
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
preferences

131
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:16,360
in reference to peace

132
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:22,000
calm in reference to that which is beyond the

133
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:30,880
edges of your thoughts edges of your feelings edges of your

134
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:36,159
body let it be the outermost

135
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:43,880
sphere that allows and accept all things

136
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
peacefully

137
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
e

138
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,679
for

139
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,600
for

140
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,600
for

141
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,799
and then as we come to the end of the

142
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:33,320
sitting to take a few moments to let go or to

143
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:42,080
stop whatever you're doing that could be called meditation maybe still keep your eyes

144
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:50,518
closed but allow yourself just to be without anything

145
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:56,519
more without any intentional practice of attention or

146
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:59,519
Focus

147
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:08,440
and if there's anything here that's enjoyable

148
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:15,360
Pleasant let yourself be nourished by

149
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:29,320
that and if and if anything is here here is

150
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:37,399
unpleasant difficult let that be the TR

The Prompt for compassion and love and

152
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:01,240

153
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:09,360
eye turning your gaze outward into your

154
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:17,130
world the Places You'll Be Today people you'll [Music]

155
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:24,360
encounter people you might have communication with people you're likely to read about

156
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:29,320
in the news

157
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,720
or for with whom you receive an

158
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:43,080

159
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:48,159

Peace calm the wide

about is in fact your

friend even the difficult friends and wish them all

166
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:39,799
well may all the people that I encounter today may they be

167
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,760
happy may they be

168
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:51,320
peaceful may they be

00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,159
you

172
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:19,240
so hello and we're here for the fifth talk about

173
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:26,080
um my my story and kind of encountering Buddhism and the plan is to take it up

174
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:34,200
until I um I guess started teaching at here for

175
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:39,679
IMC and then I'll make an announcement the end of this talk about what the plan

176
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:46,760
is for next week that's related so

177
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,840
um so I was ordained at 1982 as a priest

178
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:02,240
as a monk at the San Francisco Zen Center and um I felt very comfortable happy to

179
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:10,279
be um monk uh the monastic lifestyle worked really well for me and I was happy in it

180
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:16,120
and um the Simplicity of that life dedication to practice and the idea of being of

181
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:21,320
service to this world and not service in general but I really wanted to address

182
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:27,720
the suffering of the world as deeply as I could it was a bit of a shock a few

183
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:34,840
months later when the Abbot gathered together all the people who had had monk ordination at the San Francisco Z Center

184
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:40,200
and had decided that he was going to change the name to no longer being monks

185
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:45,519
but now being priests and uh I was stunned like I I

186
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:53,080
didn't want I didn't have no interest in being a priest I thought I was going to be a monk over time I've come to really

187
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:59,440
appreciate this idea of being a priest because it's much more clearly uh

188
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:06,880
involves being in the world uh serving people being involved in lives of people

189
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:15,118
and monk isn't so obviously that and um and so you know now in my as a Zen

190
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:22,560
priest I'm happy enough with it but that was ordained then in 1982 and oddly enough uh within a year

191
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:31,480
by the April or so um there was the that I uh ordained me I had a scandal uh an

192
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:38,158
ethical Scandal it was fairly serious and it took some months for that to work itself out for San Francisco Z Center

193
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:47,320
eventually he uh resigned and left but um uh when I got the news that he was uh

194
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:52,480
uh when people got the news of his scandal of his ethical breach breaches

195
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:58,640
actually then um uh many people felt deeply betrayed deep deeply hurt and uh

196
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:05,280
it was very hard for the community maybe because I'd been the Zen Center for 5 years and I hadn't invested as much as

197
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,560
other people had um I didn't feel so hurt by it in fact I had the opposite

198
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:16,440
expression uh experience and I'll tell you how that happened

199
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:23,079
um the uh somewhere around uh uh little over a year after my ordination so was

200
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:28,599
like in maybe March of February March of 8 4

201
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:33,800
83 um I was beginning to feel that zenen was a little bit too ingrown for me a

202
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:40,599
little bit too self focused maybe or claustrophobic I felt a need for fresh

203
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:47,280
air um I felt I felt happy about my Orin ordination I felt happy about my teacher

204
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,440
and happy about most things but I had this feeling that's that uh that

205
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:59,560
something was a little bit too insular and it was healthy for me to kind of Step out of that insular bubble but that

206
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:06,040
was hard to do back then because there was it was a little bit cultic back then in this in the sense that um there was a

207
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:12,560
feeling like only at zener was the truth really there like Buddhist truth and anybody who left was leaving that truth

208
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:18,040
so it's a little bit hard to leave so I was uh thinking about these things and

209
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:23,640
then I was sitting uh talking with a at sent Center talking with a friend and

210
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:31,240
the first time I told someone this feeling that I had and as I was telling her uh one of the

211
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:36,880
senior priests from Zen Center Senior teachers came over to me and tapped me

212
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:42,960
on the shoulder and says you know uh I'd like to talk to you and when you finish the conversation you can come over to my

213
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:50,560
my room to my apartment so I finished my conversation with my friend and I went over to this priest uh to talk to him

214
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:55,720
and I thought maybe I'd gotten in trouble and uh because no one had ever

215
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:01,240
asked me to like I have to talk talk to you and it was kind of serious kind of

216
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:08,839
request and um instead what happened was he he uh the the news uh of this the

217
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:14,359
ethical breach of the Abbot had not been told by everyone it was only a small group of people who knew and the

218
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:21,319
decision was to go around and tell people individually key people or you know at Zen Center individually before

219
00:37:21,319 --> 00:37:26,720
letting the whole Community know and I was one of those people and a and as he

220
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:33,880
told me I felt delighted because now I was free to leave and I'd been invited

221
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:39,280
by my father was going to work in Japan for a year to come to Japan and I had

222
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:46,079
told them no I don't want to come to Japan because I have um uh I have to you know I have to be

223
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:52,119
practice a tent Center so I called him up and said now I'm ready to go and uh

224
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:59,040
and so then he um so I was free to go to Japan Jaan I went to Japan in order to

225
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:07,119
study Zen and be in the monasteries there and I was there for a while uh uh

226
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:13,880
and there's a lot to tell you stories about Japan but then I went to

227
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:22,000
um I went to um um uh I had to get a new visa for

228
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:29,119
Japan and uh to stay in Japan I had a tourist visa originally and I was going to go spend some months living at a Zen

229
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:35,640
training Monastery so I went to Thailand it was the easiest cheapest way to get a new

230
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:41,960
visa for staying in Japan and uh went to Bangkok and I applied for a Visa and I

231
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:47,599
waited had to wait for the visa to be approved and so I decided to go to I had

232
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:53,920
the address of a little meditation Monastery outside of bankco and I went there and said I'm going to stay here

233
00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:00,680
until the Visa comes and I'm going to ask the Abbott to teach me whatever meditation he has he has and just do do

234
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:06,240
what he says and while I'm here just it turned out to be a Vasa Center I knew

235
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:14,240
almost nothing about vasana it turned out that the way they practiced was to practice all day um and then once a day

236
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:20,040
I would go see the Abbot and it was given a little Hut at the edge of the monastery on top of kind of the swamps

237
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:28,400
it was and um little Hut on stilts and um I I practice for 10 weeks

238
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:34,599
without um getting the Visa and um and then I decided Well I'll just go back to

239
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:43,560
Japan anyway with a tourist visa and um but those 10 weeks was a 10 we uh

240
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:49,240
intensive retreat in Zen practice the longest I done was seven days and to do

241
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:55,680
it for 10 weeks um really made a difference for me and one of the differences was I got much more

242
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:00,760
concentrated in than I ever had in Zen in a different kind of way and in that

243
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:08,160
concentration I touched something very seemingly very deep inside a little kernel of something that uh seemed like

244
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:13,680
the truest place and it became essential for me to

245
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:19,040
touch that place again it wasn't logical or rational it was just this deep kind

246
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:25,880
of feeling deep kind of urge or kind of necessity that I felt and um I did go

247
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:32,839
back to Japan Jaan I finished up the year in Japan living in a Zen Monastery I came back to uh California I

248
00:40:32,839 --> 00:40:40,000
had no money and worked for uh for think about four months I was given free room

249
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:48,319
and board at the San Francisco Zen Center so I could do this and so all the money I had from working was um went to

250
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:55,040
um uh saving up money and I think after those four months I had about $2,000 and then I bought a ticket to go

251
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:00,880
back to Asia this time to go to Burma because I'd learned the practice I had

252
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:09,760
uh I'd been given in Thailand the headquarters for that the source of it was this particular Monastery in Yun

253
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:17,800
Myanmar and um and so um I went there or I tried to go there um but it was very I

254
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:24,920
didn't realize this but actually the Burma was closed when I applied for a Visa so I was waiting for Visa nothing

255
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:31,160
happened uh I went to um the teacher in Burma upand was going to practice in

256
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:38,400
Nepal I practiced with him for a month in Nepal which was very fortuitous because uh people like Joseph Goldstein

257
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:45,119
Sharon salsburg John Travis other people um or came to practice with them as well

258
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:53,160
so that's where I got to meet these wonderful teachers as kind of friends practicing together I practiced in Thailand uh

259
00:41:53,160 --> 00:42:01,640
month longer retweets there waiting for the Visa I finally reapplied and um and then eight months

260
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:08,160
after I've first applied for a Visa I think I um I finally got a visa to Burma

261
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:16,000
I think because Burma finally opened again to let people come Burma only opened it wide enough to allow people to

262
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,400
have t tourist visa uh Not Tourist tourist visas for one week or uh

263
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:27,240
meditation visas for three months I don't know how many countries have meditation visas

264
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:33,520
and um so I went and uh and then I entered into the

265
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:42,119
life of uh the Intensive life uh of intensive Retreats uh in Burma um it was

266
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:48,079
I I meditated for eight months all day long um you know so the longest I'd done

267
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:56,760
before that was those 10 weeks in Thailand and now I did this for eight months and uh that was uh uh one of the

268
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:01,960
highest points in my life um I I uh it

269
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:07,319
was both difficult and something I deeply loved something that was challenging and experienced tremendous

270
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:14,160
amount of joy and um and uh and it was I think I would say

271
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:19,960
it was transformative it kind of shaped me uh in a way that uh continues to this

272
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:25,160
day and so I thought I'd finish this uh

273
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:30,359
Series today up at until a time in which I was going to uh start teaching here at

274
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:38,960
IMC but uh we're running out of time so let me leave you there this kind of a new phase now that um coming to uh Vasa

275
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:45,839
practice and really diving into it in a deep way and uh in a way that

276
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:54,119
then eventually brought me here to teaching at IMC so what we'll do for next week is I

277
00:43:54,119 --> 00:44:01,119
think I'll just continue this story and um and when I finally reach uh um

278
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:06,720
beginning to teach at IMC I thought I would continue uh for however many days

279
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:13,720
that is um to little bit the history of IMC uh not uh because this is also very

280
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:19,599
important because I want to convey that not the Bland history of IMC but rather

281
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:25,440
the values that uh were infused into this community and are here for this

282
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:31,720
place that may be expressed through the history and um in a sense it continues

283
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:38,880
my story because um you know my dedication for now the last 33 years has

284
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:44,480
been IMC and then coincidentally um I was wanted to say

285
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:50,400
that uh um in uh being there the end of the year

286
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,760
I've written the end of a year letter uh for IMC and uh this year I wrote a little

287
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:01,880
different different than I have done in other years where um I've you know uh the end of the year letter usually just

288
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:07,000
talks a little bit about IMC and and it still does that but I wanted to have for

289
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:14,160
the letter to have a little bit of a Dharma purpose as well some a little bit of something memorable Dharma wise um in

290
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:21,119
it so uh if you'd like to read uh imc's end of the year letter and uh maybe help

291
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:27,520
care for IMC that in the way that these end of the year letters usually suggest

292
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:34,400
uh you'll find it on the what's new section of imc's homepage um in the bottom right hand

293
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:45,160
corner there's a little box that says what's new and you go there the items there and you'll see the end of the year letter from Gil and um so thank you very

294
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:50,359
much and I look forward to continue this on

295
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:54,880
Monday
