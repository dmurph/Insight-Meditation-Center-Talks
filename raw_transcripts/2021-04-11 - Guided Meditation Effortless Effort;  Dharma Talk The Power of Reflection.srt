1
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:09,360
good morning or for some of you might

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,920
be afternoon or evening but wherever you are and whatever time

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:22,720
it is even if it's sometime in the future you're listening to this recorded i'm sending

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:29,599
warm wishes your way it's such a wonderful thing to be able

5
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:35,840
to practice together to practice with others for me it is

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:43,280
it's very meaningful so a really warm welcome a warm welcome

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,079
wherever you are

8
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,000
so before we formally

9
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,600
settle in or maybe it's part of the settling in process

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,320
for our meditation it can be really helpful to set our intention

11
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:16,320
why are we practicing so not in a heavy-handed way not in a

12
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:25,040
way that feels oppressive but in a manner that feels it's supportive to just do a

13
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:32,560
brief reflection why are we doing this meditation thing anyway

14
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:44,159
might be something i'm engaging in this practice so that i might discover more freedom

15
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,960
so that i might discover more ease

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,640
so that i might understand myself better so that i might feel better

17
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:08,560
so that i might have a develop cultivate a a refuge a respite

18
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,479
get re-energized in some way

19
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,879
whatever the reason might be it can be helpful to periodically

20
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:30,319
just reflect on that put it into context of why we do this practice

21
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:39,280
and to be sure sometimes it feels too clunky and

22
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,800
awkward to do this reflection and what feels most natural and useful is just to

23
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:53,519
sit and there might be times in which doing this reflection can be a real support

24
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,000
can help bring us to the cushion and when we're on the cushion to help stay

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,280
there so to speak

26
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:13,280
i am engaging in this practice because i

27
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,840
wish to have access to more and more freedom

28
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,360
and then as we begin to get settled

29
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:44,000
just taking a moment to see how the body

30
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:51,280
feels having a general sense of

31
00:03:51,280 --> 00:04:01,840
how you are right now

32
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:15,840
tuning in to the experiences of this moment

33
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:43,840
having the intention to bring awareness to this moment

34
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:57,199
i'm sure as many of you know the body can be a tremendous support

35
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:05,840
for feeling settled tuning in to this moment

36
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:25,759
rather than the memories of the past or fantasies of the future

37
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:33,680
so as you settle in you might notice any sensations that are present

38
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,840
in the body

39
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:04,479
maybe feeling the pressure of the chair the cushion the bench

40
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:11,039
the bed the couch feeling the pressure of whatever it is that you're sitting on

41
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:17,360
against the body or if you're lying down whatever you're

42
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,240
lying on laying on lying on

43
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,360
and getting a sense of how the body feels

44
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:37,680
in general maybe a little bit in particular with the pressure

45
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:49,840
against the body and more in general

46
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:22,720
sometimes we bring a lot of effort and expectation

47
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:30,800
to what we're doing whether it's in our daily life or in our

48
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,000
meditation practice

49
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:45,840
and this kind of effort is often motivated by wanting and striving

50
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:58,160
can we soften any of those kind of movements

51
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,520
wanting striving

52
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:15,680
and practice in a way that feels relaxed

53
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:27,120
a certain amount of ease

54
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:41,839
that feels sustainable

55
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:48,640
and of course this doesn't mean cavalier or half-hearted

56
00:08:51,519 --> 00:09:09,839
but with ease and purpose

57
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:42,240
you might notice the relative ease of simply feeling the pressure points in

58
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,000
the body feeling the chair cushion against the body

59
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,480
simply inclining the mind

60
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:05,839
actually takes very little effort

61
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,480
feeling whatever the hands are touching

62
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:33,839
inclining the mind that direction

63
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:10,000
we might think of awareness

64
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:19,120
as having a receptive quality it's more about receiving

65
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:29,839
the experiences rather than going out and getting them

66
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:25,839
receiving the experiences of breathing

67
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:39,760
feeling the sensations associated with the movement of the

68
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,200
chest or the belly

69
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,000
or the sensations coming in through the

70
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,839
nose

71
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:11,120
in this way we might notice

72
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,839
what we sometimes call effortless effort

73
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:33,519
there's a certain effortlessness and receiving sensations

74
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:44,959
but maybe there's a little bit of effort in setting the intention

75
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:59,839
set in that direction

76
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:08,480
the intention to be aware of the sensations of breathing

77
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:27,839
or perhaps the sensations in the body more generally

78
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:35,279
without grabbing onto them

79
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:55,839
without clinging or pushing away or pulling in

80
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,839
so

81
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:53,039
and it's natural that our minds will wander

82
00:21:53,679 --> 00:22:01,440
we just very simply gently begin again

83
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,600
no need to make it a problem

84
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:17,120
wish it were different chastise ourselves

85
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:27,840
we just begin again

86
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,600
this is part of the art of practice

87
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:19,760
it's just having enough intention

88
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:25,520
a little bit of effort but not too much

89
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,480
to be going a particular direction

90
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:40,799
without a strong sense that i should be there by now

91
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,840
to find the middle way

92
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:02,000
between aimlessness and drivenness

93
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:16,400
between being disconnected

94
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:29,840
and being tightly bound

95
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:43,840
the middle way between no effort whatsoever

96
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:57,840
and extreme effort

97
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,960
and to recognize and appreciate

98
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:28,559
that middle way can be different every moment

99
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:38,320
letting go of the idea that there's one perfect middle way

100
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:53,840
let me just have to find it and then we can relax

101
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:07,840
we're always finding the middle way

102
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,840
allowing the experiences to show

103
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,840
themselves

104
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:27,840
rather than pouncing on them

105
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:31,200
and part of our reflection of why we practice

106
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,559
can be not only to support our own lives

107
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:45,440
finding more freedom finding more ease but the lives of others

108
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:53,120
so that we can be a factor an element of good in this

109
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:58,960
world that we can help others find more ease

110
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,679
more freedom

111
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:09,760
so that we practice for the benefit of all beings

112
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:25,519
everywhere [Music]

113
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,839
so

114
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,440
so again a really warm welcome

115
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:17,838
to everybody wherever you might be whomever you might be

116
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:25,520
so today i'd like to talk a little bit about um this

117
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:31,440
uh there's a brief asuta maybe not talk so much about the sutta

118
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:39,680
itself but something in there that the buddha says and he says there are two powers

119
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:47,680
two powers in some ways that can't even feels powerful to even talk about two powers

120
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:53,680
some of you might know that there's this list of the five powers that is similar to the not similar it's

121
00:35:53,680 --> 00:36:00,240
almost pretty much exactly the same as the five faculties and that's not what i'm talking about

122
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:09,280
and this idea of two powers and we might think of well what is meant by this word power

123
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:17,200
and we could consider it's the ability to do something or to act in a particular way

124
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:23,599
is to have a certain amount of power you might might also think that or the same word

125
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:29,760
strength is there and this word impali bala

126
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,440
that's getting translated as powersome some translators use this word strength

127
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:41,839
two strengths two powers we might also think that uh power or

128
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:49,680
strength is the ability to influence influence ourselves make ourselves get

129
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:55,838
to make ourselves do things or influence others

130
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:03,280
and we might also think of powers like you know something is powerful when it really touches us when

131
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,880
it moves us we often talk about powerful movies books

132
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:16,560
dharma talks when it affects some change or some experience in somebody so

133
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:23,680
tough power is also to maybe touch somebody whether it's ourselves or

134
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:29,920
others and to be sure power can also have

135
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:37,359
negative uses and connotations

136
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:43,280
the oppression of people and justice these terrible things and that's not

137
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:51,599
what i'm talking about the buddha here is talking about power maybe maybe strength is a better word

138
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:57,599
and i was reflecting like what about this word power why why would the buddha talk about

139
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:03,960
power and i thought well maybe it's because it's to counteract this idea of

140
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:10,560
powerlessness sometimes we begin a meditation practice

141
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:18,320
we begin any spiritual practice because we have this feeling of powerlessness in a way

142
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:25,520
that is um takes the wind out of our sails so to speak or maybe we

143
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:32,960
feel stuck and like we can't find our way

144
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:39,440
we can't make ourselves quote unquote do what we know should be done or

145
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,800
something like that so maybe it's an antidote or a counteract something about this feeling

146
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:51,040
of powerlessness maybe also this word power is kind of

147
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:58,079
associated with this the idea the experience of being empowered

148
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:04,079
to feel to experience to have the capacity

149
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:10,640
to affect change to do something to have some agency

150
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:20,400
so the buddha talked about these two powers and what are they so one

151
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:26,839
is the power of reflection and the second is the power of

152
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:32,480
cultivation and sometimes we might think like oh really

153
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:41,040
i was hoping it'd be something a little bit more inspiring than reflection and cultivation but but we might

154
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:48,720
use these two powers these two strengths something like the power of reflection

155
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:54,160
we might consider it something like choosing a trail on a map

156
00:39:54,160 --> 00:40:00,560
a hiking trail that we want to go on and that's the reflection where do i

157
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:05,839
want to go and then while we're on that trail like

158
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:13,760
while we're hiking like to reflect am i on the trail am i on the right trail

159
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:19,599
my for some reason my map reading skills are not the best this is something i have a

160
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:26,078
little difficulty with so i'm often wondering am i on the right trail

161
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:32,720
so just this reflection and then cultivation might be the actual going on

162
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:40,400
the trail the actual walking it a little bit of effort required there

163
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:47,760
so the strengths of reflection and cultivation and where do i want to go and am i going

164
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:54,480
there it's a reflection and the cultivation is just going

165
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:02,400
so i'll just say a few words about the second one cultivation first because i think that this is

166
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:09,119
something that we're familiar with and there's probably been countless dharma talks about

167
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:15,839
cultivation especially in this tradition there's a real emphasis on this sense of

168
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:22,640
development and to be sure that sutas are filled with the buddha talking about to develop

169
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:27,839
and cultivate develop and cultivate our ethical

170
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:33,359
actions our integrity how we show up in the world

171
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:38,800
we can never be too ethical like that doesn't even exist

172
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:45,200
so to reflect on is this the right thing to do

173
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:51,200
what is the right thing to do and to do the right thing

174
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:57,680
so to cultivate to cultivate our sensitivity to ethics and then to do the ethical

175
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:03,040
thing the buddha also talked about the to cultivate

176
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:08,800
having a steady mind that's why we have a meditation practice is to help the

177
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:15,760
mind be steady or settled so that we might see things more clearly

178
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,960
so that we might understand things more clearly

179
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:30,640
and also there's to cultivate a warm heart

180
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:38,319
the brahmavihara practice so that we can increase our capacity

181
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:43,440
with difficulties if we have some brahmaviharas some love

182
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:49,119
some compassion joy happiness when others are happy it's an

183
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:57,200
equanimity some steadiness when things aren't going the way that we expected or

184
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:03,119
even though we might love somebody dearly we of course can't force them to do what we think well is

185
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:07,680
the most helpful so to have some equanimity

186
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:15,200
and more specifically the buddha also talked about cultivating the seven factors of awakening

187
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:20,440
i'm not going to talk about these this morning but many of you know mindfulness

188
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:26,319
investigation energy joy tranquility concentration and

189
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,720
wisdom

190
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:37,920
so in some ways this the power of cultivation

191
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:46,720
for our practice is not that different than how it is for maybe an agricultural

192
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:54,400
simile or agricultural metaphor that we don't

193
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,839
make plants grow they grow themselves

194
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:04,880
but we create the conditions helping them with water

195
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:10,720
with sun fertilizer or a good quality soil

196
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:18,400
so in the same way cultivation is about creating the conditions and

197
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:24,560
recognizing that we don't make these things happen things we just put the conditions in

198
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:30,480
place as best we can as best we can

199
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:38,319
so that's one of the powers of cultivation just to remind you of probably what

200
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:44,319
you've heard in many different dharma talks now i'd like to talk a little bit more about this idea of

201
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:51,359
the power of reflection because sometimes it's easy to be dismissive

202
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:58,800
of this capacity that humans have to reflect

203
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:05,160
so what does it mean to reflect maybe one way to think about it is to put our

204
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:12,640
experience whatever it is that we're having into a larger context

205
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:19,838
and importantly to do it in a warm-hearted way

206
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:27,040
so not only are we putting our experience in a larger context seeing the bigger picture

207
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:32,480
but we're not doing that in such a way that it creates the conditions for us to beat

208
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:37,839
ourselves up we don't want to activate this inner critic or to have this

209
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:44,319
oppressive feeling like i should be this way that should be that way or whatever it

210
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:51,040
might be because this reflection loses its power

211
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:57,280
we could think if it's coupled with this heavy oppressive sense of how things

212
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:03,839
should be but instead can we just have this gentle

213
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:09,040
inquiry this reflection does what i'm doing right now support my

214
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:14,319
life does it support my practice is it

215
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:19,440
going in the direction is it that i want my life and my practice to

216
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:25,040
go not in a heavy-handed and not in a

217
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:32,240
clunky awkward way but just to periodically just

218
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:40,000
check in some practices have this idea of check the attitude

219
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:46,480
so maybe in the same way we can kind of like check in the our attitude often is

220
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:54,079
um has an effect that we don't see if we don't notice it so

221
00:46:54,079 --> 00:47:02,000
of course if we want to eat better

222
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:08,560
more vegetables whatever it might be

223
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:15,280
could just periodically reflect while we're eating opening up that bag of cookies

224
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:21,520
does this is this ref support my life this direction i want to go

225
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:27,680
in the same way if our practice with ethics our practice with studying

226
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:33,599
the mind or cultivation of some warm-heartedness just the way that i'm

227
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:39,839
speaking with others does the way that i'm approaching my meditation practice

228
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:46,000
does this support my life does it support my practice

229
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:56,000
and so one way we can do this is to reflect on our reason for practicing

230
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:03,520
why do we have a meditation practice why do we work on our ethical practice the way we

231
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:07,839
show up in the world interact with others

232
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:16,160
when we know why we're doing something it can be a tremendous support it helps us put it in that bigger context and

233
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:22,720
helps us to know which direction we're going what is the purpose

234
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:31,520
what do you want to experience what do you want to have more of in your

235
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:38,160
life or what would you like to understand better or what would you like to penetrate more

236
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:44,640
deeply or what would you like to open yourself up to or

237
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:51,680
maybe what would you like to touch more intimately in your experiences

238
00:48:54,240 --> 00:49:00,640
again to have this reflection in a way that is in a relaxed easy manner and not in a

239
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:06,240
way that is a disguised inner critic

240
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:11,599
but just have some clarity of the direction we're going

241
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:18,559
and this idea of periodically reflecting of the purpose of why we're doing this

242
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:26,240
there's a story that's told by john c maxwell about a person who sees some bricklayers

243
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:31,760
who are working perhaps you've heard this story and this person goes up to the first

244
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:37,520
brick layer and says what are you doing and the person responds i'm laying

245
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:44,240
bricks okay simple enough and then the person goes up to the

246
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:49,839
second brick layer and asks what are you doing and the second brick layer says i'm putting

247
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:58,960
up a wall okay so a little bit bigger context there's a purpose for what the bricklayer is doing

248
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:05,359
but then the person goes up to the third bricklayer and asks what are you doing and the

249
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:12,160
third bricklayer says i'm building a cathedral

250
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:19,119
even a bigger context than a way that feels inspiring or so we can say that maybe the first

251
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:26,880
bricklayer and it might be completely appropriate at times to just notice i'm just putting

252
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:32,559
one brick here and not have to go the bigger context

253
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:37,920
but just to have this here but there also could be a way in which that feels

254
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:44,160
could be a little bit half-hearted i'm just laying bricks you know without a sense of purpose or a

255
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:49,440
sense of a direction in which they're going it could feel like

256
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:55,520
it's never-ending and it doesn't matter the quality or how i do it

257
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:02,720
to the second bricklayer that's talking about building a wall maybe they have a sense of com they want

258
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:10,319
to have a sense of completion if there's a succinct or defined um

259
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:16,720
objective that they have they can say okay well i'm gonna stay with laying bricks until

260
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:22,000
this wall is built but then the third brick layer this idea

261
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,839
of building a cathedral there's a way in which they the bricklayer might put

262
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:33,040
their whole heart into the practice

263
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:38,960
and that's they feel inspired that they're part of this big beautiful thing that will be of

264
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:45,280
service to others service to themselves can help others

265
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:50,960
connect to the divine perhaps or

266
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:59,359
so to reflect on occasion what is the purpose of what we're doing and to recognize that how we answer it

267
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:04,559
that it might affect the attitude in which we're approaching what we're doing

268
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:10,480
so not only setting the direction in terms of where we're going but also

269
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:15,680
influencing the attitude and then this attitude

270
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:23,440
i'm using this word might whether we're doing it wholeheartedly or maybe we could say

271
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:28,880
whether we're doing it cavalierly or casually or whether we're just bringing ourselves

272
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:36,558
to it and feel inspired and open to the possibilities like this third brick layer

273
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:47,839
so maybe i'll just say that i know this there's a story of somebody

274
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:56,640
who wanted to lose weight a significant amount of weight a lot of weight and this person did

275
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:03,200
and then was sharing with others how he had done it and you know some of

276
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:10,960
his secrets secrets quote unquote and when he was asked uh why he had

277
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:17,359
done it in the first place he tells the story of that he wanted to

278
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:24,160
um fit into a star wars costume like a really serious star wars costume you know one

279
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:29,280
that's like might have actually been used on the star wars set he wanted to be thin enough so that he

280
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:34,880
can fit into one of those uh costumes of a character now i don't remember the

281
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:41,599
character's name and the reason why he wanted to fit into one of those

282
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:48,640
character costumes is because his nephew a young child had cancer

283
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:55,200
and was being treated for cancer and he wanted to show up in this star wars

284
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:02,720
uniform for the birthday party that was coming up for this little boy that had cancer

285
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:11,280
somehow that feels inspiring and we can imagine that it's so much easier to do something that is difficult

286
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:16,480
if we have a purpose and if we're imagining that it could really benefit

287
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:22,559
somebody so this is something that we might use as a support for our own meditation

288
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:27,839
practice because let's be honest sometimes it's not easy to get to the

289
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:33,599
cushion or if we do get to the cushion the mind and the body are

290
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:39,839
feeling restless and it's not so easy to stay on the cushion

291
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:46,000
but we can see we're having a reflection of why we're doing this

292
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:52,559
and to have a the why be something that allows us to have an attitude of open-heartedness

293
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:57,920
wholeheartedness can be really powerful it can be a power

294
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:06,160
to support us in our practice

295
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:14,160
but this idea of a reflection not only can help support

296
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:22,480
why we're doing something but it also can help us with uh discover

297
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:27,599
if we the way that we're practicing is going to help us go the direction we

298
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:33,680
wish to go recognizing that the goal

299
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:40,400
and the means are so interrelated

300
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:47,280
do we have the goal to have more freedom then is the way that we're practicing a

301
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:52,400
way that brings freedom into our practice a certain amount of ease or or is there

302
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:58,240
a constricted sense of i have to do this i should do this

303
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,799
if we if the goal quote-unquote the direction we're

304
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:10,880
heading the purpose is to understand things more clearly

305
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:17,040
understand ourselves then are we meeting each moment with a

306
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:22,400
sense of curiosity and openness oh what's this

307
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:28,880
or do we have a sense of like just noting and going off to go into the next thing because we have

308
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:34,559
to get to understanding and i'm not going to bother with the sensations

309
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:44,720
on the my body with the cushion or the sound or whatever it is

310
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:51,599
so to reflect in the way in which we are practicing and to recognize that the means and the

311
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:58,160
goal are intimately tied together and so it's the manner in which we're

312
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:05,119
practicing supportive so this brings this this that maybe this idea of the art of

313
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:12,720
practice is then coupling these two [Music] notions that is

314
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:19,680
maybe discovering the middle way between having some clarity about why we are practicing the

315
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:27,839
direction we're going and allowing the practice to unfold

316
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:34,799
finding the middle way between having this idea we wanted to go here but not

317
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:42,319
forcing it to go there not making it not white knuckling our way

318
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:49,359
through not using a sledgehammer with our practice but instead creating the conditions in

319
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:55,680
which the practice can unfold so this is really the art of practice is

320
00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:02,400
maybe it's not going the direction that we think we would like it to go that we have set

321
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:07,920
as our purpose but at the same time we could see oh

322
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:13,680
there's some understanding here there's some freedom here there's some ease here

323
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:23,040
and the way it's unfolding i didn't think it was going to unfold this way it wasn't my preference for it to unfold this way

324
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:30,240
but i can bring the direction i want to go into this moment

325
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:38,400
this really is the art of practice of having an intention having a direction

326
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,798
and allowing it to unfold

327
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:51,520
and finding this middle way is something that we do over and over again in practice

328
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:58,480
so we can even reflect on our relationship between this idea of doing i have to make things go a

329
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:06,318
particular way and being quote unquote just allowing things to be

330
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:12,880
you could just do a general reflection which do we feel more comfortable with

331
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:18,960
doing making things happen or being just allowing things and to recognize that

332
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:26,000
practice requires both a certain amount of doing a certain amount of being

333
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:31,280
and are we privileging one over the other or are we not even recognizing

334
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:35,599
that there's times for both

335
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:44,960
so part of our reflection can be is this balance between doing and being

336
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:51,520
i'm using doing and being as these kind of generic words about the amount of effort that we're

337
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:56,559
doing that's being applied or maybe even the amount of self

338
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:03,760
that's uh having a sense of agency of one who is making things happen

339
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:11,200
so that could be another reflection is this balance and our what are our ideas of

340
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:18,720
how practice works quote unquote like what uh propels or moves

341
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:26,839
uh practice forward towards greater and greater ease greater greater free freedom and

342
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:32,559
understanding and to reflect in our conceptions our assumptions

343
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:37,599
about the amount of effort that might be needed

344
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:48,720
and then of course to reflect on the potential and the actual consequences

345
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:56,079
of our actions all of our actions reflection can be enormously powerful if

346
01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:01,520
we are reflecting is this going to cause harm

347
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:08,160
for myself for others for both might this be harmful

348
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:15,920
of course we don't know everything but we can just do a quick reflection

349
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:23,599
is this is there a way in which this might unfold and that it's harmful

350
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:31,359
i think many of us know i've heard this story where the buddha is teaching his son rahula to reflect

351
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:39,680
before during and after every action of body speech and mind

352
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:46,480
is this for harm will it harm myself will it harm others or it will it harm

353
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:53,838
both myself and others and of course if it's going to cause harm we don't do it

354
01:01:54,480 --> 01:02:00,160
and of course there'll be times on which we are mistaken we didn't think it was going to cause

355
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:08,240
harm and then it ends up causing harm and then we make amends as best we can

356
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:14,880
and then move forward so this power of reflection of where

357
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:20,880
we're going this attitude that we have towards going

358
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:27,039
there including our relationship between being and doing this can be such a fruitful

359
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:34,559
place to reflect and to recognize whether we have a preference for one or the other but

360
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:40,559
rather than having to choose like oh i should all have to make things happen or no it's just about allowing

361
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:45,920
can we recognize that part of navigating part of balancing part of finding the

362
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:51,039
middle way is to have a little bit of being a

363
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:58,079
little bit of doing at the right time in the right dose and then of course to reflect

364
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:04,559
on the consequences of any action we might have so when we think about it this way you

365
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:09,599
could see why the buddha talked about the power of reflection can you imagine

366
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:15,200
if there was no reflection none of those considerations it was just

367
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:20,880
mindlessly so to speak doing anything and everything willy-nilly allowing ourselves to be

368
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:26,720
pushed around by our preferences or pushed around by what others are saying

369
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:31,839
or what we're experiencing at that moment

370
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:41,039
so instead the power of reflection and the power of cultivation these two

371
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:48,799
powers that allow our lives and our practice to unfold in a way that

372
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:57,359
not only don't harm ourselves or harm others but might benefit ourselves and benefit others

373
01:03:57,359 --> 01:04:02,960
so that we might be a force of good in this lord in this life and in this

374
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:11,520
world that needs it we need all the good so

375
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:18,319
thank you very much
