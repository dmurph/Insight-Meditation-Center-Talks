1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,480
so greetings from insight meditation center in redwood

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:13,840
city and uh i delight in seeing all the good mornings the greetings on the chat

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,199
and have today especially stands out all the locations the places that you're

4
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:26,240
greeting from so thank you for being here those of you who are

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,399
both present now it's youtube and those maybe who will listen later

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,120
so the craft

7
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,399
of meditation of mindfulness and it begins

8
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:51,600
this uh journey we're on with the mindfulness of breathing and um so i'm taking some time with it

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,360
because it lays the foundation for what follows and also because

10
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:04,400
this is the first time we'll go through the so-called refrain where it lists the insights that come with

11
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,880
well-developed practice and so i want to go through that a little bit slower than we will do later

12
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,240
but for now i want to um go back to this uh these steps to the

13
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,479
breathing a little bit of shorthand there is uh

14
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:29,439
the first is to know your breathing know that you are breathing but then also to know

15
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:35,200
the experience of breathing to recognize it to have a recognition of

16
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,320
the sensations the characteristics the qualities of the breath where you're breathing

17
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,720
what moves what the sensations are and this is not a

18
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:53,280
a probing but rather it's a it's a

19
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,880
very simple recognition of what is obvious and as we stay grounded and become more

20
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:05,119
centered on the breathing what becomes more obvious becomes more subtle and we can start seeing more detail to

21
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:11,280
what's going on and then the instructions are as we do this as we

22
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:20,400
center ourselves on the rhythm of breathing the sensations of breathing to um experience the whole body

23
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:27,120
and uh what i'd like to emphasize today about this whole body aspect

24
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,720
is that um our emotional life the and the life that

25
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:39,120
uh of thoughts and distractions all have an embodied quality or

26
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,840
a root or association and and this this is often thoughts and

27
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,879
emotions often can distract us from being with the breathing

28
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:57,599
but this instructions to breathe in and experience the whole body breathe out and experience the whole body

29
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:04,319
can be inclusive of the very things that make it difficult to be present the things that keep us distracted or caught

30
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,440
up and the way to do that is to recognize

31
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:16,840
what makes it difficult to be present the distracted mind or maybe strong emotions or maybe discomfort in the body

32
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:23,599
pain and then when we experience the whole body experience that as well

33
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:30,480
uh and it might you might just experience it experience it as something mental or something emotional

34
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,159
but you're experiencing with this rhythm of breathing in experiencing the whole

35
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:42,159
body breathing out experiencing the whole body and so the center of gravity

36
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:48,879
is breathing and experiencing the body the center of gravity is not the distracted thoughts

37
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:54,720
the concerns we have and it's not the emotions we have emotions are important but

38
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:02,080
for the purposes of meditation we don't have to make them the center they're included

39
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,239
in the experience of the whole body and it has this wonderful thing of being able to

40
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:14,400
move in and out move through

41
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,000
whatever is challenging for being present and including it as part of being present

42
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,840
rather than letting it be something keeps pulling us away we assimilate it we

43
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:32,560
coordinate ourselves with it we let it cooperate with the efforts to be here

44
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:39,120
so breathing in experiencing the whole body as we breathe in and including how the experience of

45
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,560
breathing might go through or accompany the

46
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,880
thing that makes it difficult and it's particularly useful if what makes it difficult to be present

47
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:57,440
has a physical association a physical manifestation

48
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,720
so if there's a lot of emotions that's chances are there's some place in the body where those motions are

49
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:09,600
centered or most expressed or if there's a lot of thinking there might be some kind of mental

50
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:18,000
some kind of tension somewhere in the body associated with all that thinking in the furrow and the uh the eyebrows or

51
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,479
behind the forehead or in the jaws or all kinds of places

52
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:30,479
and then at some point the last step of this beginning exercise

53
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,520
is to relax relax the bodily constructs

54
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,600
we do this all we take our time with each one there's no hurry through them but

55
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,600
one of the ways to to really get centered is to be inclusive of the very thing

56
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:54,319
that makes it difficult in this way that i'm talking about so

57
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,880
to begin to assume a posture

58
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,319
that gives you some sense of being inclusive

59
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:14,400
that includes all of who you are for some people that means to kind of

60
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:21,199
sit upright and alert a little bit maybe a little bit tall

61
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,560
little my chest open

62
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,520
and to lower your gaze

63
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,039
as you lower your gaze to turn your attention inward

64
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,120
to how your body feels now

65
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,599
and then if it's comfortable gently closing your eyes

66
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,680
and maybe that allows you to feel your body more fully

67
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:11,280
and then taking a few long slow deep breaths three quarters full perhaps

68
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:17,840
then as you breathe in deeply and exhale more fully

69
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:24,000
imagine that you're including everything

70
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,840
within the scope the range of that deep inhale

71
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,960
relaxing everything on the exhale

72
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:45,520
a little bit imagining that you are

73
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:52,720
that your attention can flow out to include everything as

74
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:59,840
you breathe in everything as you breathe out

75
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:18,000
and then letting your breathing return to normal

76
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,080
then whenever there is some tension or holding

77
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,360
wherever there is some compelling emotion

78
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,000
as you breathe in feel that place

79
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,399
as you exhale relax that place

80
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,040
perhaps each time you inhale aware of a different place in

81
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,600
your body

82
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:13,920
the exhale relaxing that place in a sense folding everything

83
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,480
into the breathing

84
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:56,399
and then centering yourself more on the breathing

85
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,399
and now getting to know your breathing better

86
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:17,000
curious about the sensations curious about how breathing occurs now

87
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,720
the sensations that come into play

88
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,639
the rhythm of it the nature of your breathing

89
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:37,680
long or short shallow or deep in the chest or in the belly

90
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:48,800
feeling where there might be holding in the breathing whatever is there

91
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:55,600
just know it simply without worry about

92
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:04,360
evaluating it just letting it be and know it as it is

93
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,600
breathing in experiencing the whole body

94
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:10,720
maybe as if awareness spreads through your body as you breathe in

95
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:20,360
breathing out experiencing the whole body

96
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:28,279
maybe as if the awareness moves back through the body

97
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:55,160
if anything it distracts you from breathing

98
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:02,160
as you breathe in and experience the whole body

99
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:11,680
experience the nature the quality the distraction itself

100
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,639
the movements of the mind the body the emotions

101
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:23,920
breathe in and let the awareness spread and touch the very

102
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,959
place where you're distracted

103
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:41,360
and then breathing in relaxing the bodily formations

104
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,639
breathing out relaxing

105
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:53,440
the holding and tension contractions of your body

106
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:01,679
by breathing in and experiencing the whole body

107
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:07,440
it lets you know feel

108
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,799
where it's possible to become quieter more tranquil

109
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:21,760
maybe spreading a tranquility of body through the body

110
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:32,480
relaxation and tranquility that touches everything

111
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,000
including what is difficult

112
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,919
you

113
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:25,640
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

114
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:35,360
letting your breathing breathing in

115
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:42,399
experiencing the whole world imagine that your awareness spreads from

116
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:47,679
the breathing as you breathe in out into the whole world

117
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:55,759
out beyond yourself beyond the place you're living

118
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:03,440
and then as you exhale that awareness returns here to you

119
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,640
and the scope of your care expands outward with that

120
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:22,799
expanding awareness circles of care out into the world

121
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:32,398
and then it returns to you on the exhale centering you

122
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:39,880
connecting you settling you here

123
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:49,760
with this rhythm of sending your care your love compassion

124
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,360
out into the world as you inhale

125
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:06,159
as your chest expands belly expands as your lungs feel

126
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:11,120
so your care expands outward

127
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:18,320
and as you exhale it all returns back here

128
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,200
centered here on you

129
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:41,679
may all beings be happy

130
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,840
may you be happy

131
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,158
may all beings be safe

132
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:07,200
may you be safe

133
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:21,679
may all beings be peaceful

134
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:30,840
may you be peaceful

135
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,760
may all beings be free

136
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,399
may you be free

137
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:07,200
breathing in and breathing out may we hold each other

138
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,039
in mutual kind regard

139
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:46,240
so today i'm going to continue talking about the so-called refrain

140
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:53,840
of the satipatana the place where the fruit of some of the fruit of

141
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:59,200
mindfulness practice uh occurs where we start having insight we start

142
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:07,840
seeing in a new way and uh it begins by with the line

143
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:15,520
what observes the body in terms of the body internally and what observes the body in terms of

144
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:21,200
the body externally and um and as i've emphasized the word

145
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:28,079
observe is actually uh the fruit of being able being gathered and settled and centered

146
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:34,320
here in the present moment and the the tendency to be distracted and wonder often thought is pretty

147
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:40,638
minimal and i think of it a little bit like a um

148
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:47,200
you know a large bowl and the any marble you drop in the bowl will

149
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:54,398
will you know roll back and forth around the bowl but eventually it will always come and

150
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:59,920
rest at the center and and so the same way that and

151
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:05,200
as we practice attention eventually comes in rests at the center

152
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:11,520
of which is the present moment the sides of this bold where we is not very stable

153
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:17,920
is the future and the past and if we end up on the sides inevitably if we relax

154
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:24,800
we'll come back and rest in the center it takes effort and energy in the mind to be

155
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:30,880
pushing the ball up the sides this way and that way and then if we do

156
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:36,160
the momentum of that ball i will uh the

157
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:42,560
energy of that ball to uh to roll down uh will will you know as it sometimes it

158
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:47,680
takes a little while for it to settle but then eventually it settles in the bottom of the bowl

159
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:54,480
so our attention it settles in the present moment and as it does so then at some point we

160
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:00,800
can simply observe and the knowing and the experiencing isn't as important anymore they still

161
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,000
occur and it's important they occur but we're settling back and more than

162
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,720
movement of awareness is out of observing just watching freely relaxedly

163
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:18,720
um un not entangled or enmeshed in what's happening just kind of seeing

164
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:24,800
it not being for or against anything just just perceiving it

165
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,720
with the mind's eye or the mind's ear if you prefer the the metaphor of hearing

166
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:37,760
or feeling sensing in the body also can be done this way it's uh it's inner way of perceiving

167
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,280
that's deeper than than the direct experience of the senses

168
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:51,200
so this experiencing internally and externally there's one way that i uh interpret this for myself that i'll

169
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,240
share with you and that is that um

170
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:04,960
the external way so-called external is uh to experiencing it uh cognitively

171
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:12,640
so the knowing that's the beginning of the breath meditation knowing the breath is a cognitive experience of recognition

172
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:18,400
so there's the knowing that it's a long breath knowing it's a short breath knowing it's a shallow breath a deep

173
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:24,480
breath knowing it's the breath is fast and slow knowing that there's expansion as we

174
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:30,800
breathe in and contraction as we breathe out knowing there's pressure and as we breathe in the release of that pressure

175
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:37,200
perhaps as we exhale and there's tightening and pulsing and vibration and

176
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:42,480
and all these things are known and that's a little bit of a mental cognitive act to know

177
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,760
um and the knowing you know that you know when you could describe it to someone

178
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:53,760
when you have the words to say oh that was expansion that was contraction

179
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:59,920
that was long that was short and to have those words requires it goes through the cognitive functioning of the

180
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:05,520
mind the recognition and i think of that as a little bit the external

181
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:11,359
kind of uh the internal is to sense and feel

182
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:18,240
the experience of something so for example if i um

183
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:24,800
take my fingers together and maybe press my two fingers my thumb and my first finger together

184
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:30,839
that and i look at it i can recognize that the fingers are

185
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:36,480
touching and and maybe i can recognize that i can see they're pushing against each other

186
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:42,160
and that's the recognition part but as i as i touched my fingers together i

187
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:48,720
feel the warmth i feel the pressure i feel the elasticity of the skin a little

188
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:55,920
bit i feel the hardness and pressure as i push hard

189
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:03,359
and i can recognize those cognitively but it also can feel those sensations

190
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:10,720
and the the feelings are happening within the fingers and that's inside so the experience of

191
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:17,520
the fingers touching can be known two different ways cognitively as a recognition as a

192
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:22,560
knowing that the fingers are touching and knowing that that's

193
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:29,280
pressure knowing that it's warmth that it's elasticity that i'm feeling and

194
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:37,920
and it could also be known uh be i can be aware of it from the inside i can be aware of it

195
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,280
in the location in the fingers where the touching is happening and i can just

196
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:50,880
feel the f from the point of view the finger is how it feels so we have these two ways of knowing

197
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:57,119
to recognize and to feel recognize and experience and the two are closely connected

198
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:03,359
they're mutually supportive they can occur together uh it's not like one or the other

199
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:09,200
and um and there's a kind of a natural kind of going back and forth in the mind

200
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:15,680
between experiencing and knowing knowing and experiencing that when the mind is settled and

201
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:21,440
relaxed is a little bit like the the example i like so much that uh

202
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:27,760
you know please be repair with me it's like watching the river flow by saying on the banks watching the rivers

203
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:33,040
little currents you see maybe little waves you see and

204
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:38,880
and the eyes don't fixate on any one thing because everything is moving

205
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:45,119
and the eyes are moving along with it it turns out that when the eyes are locked

206
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:52,079
there's usually tension in their psychophysical system when the eyes the natural relaxed state

207
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:59,680
eyes kind of flow and move and move around and and uh here and there just kind of they don't not held at a single

208
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:06,640
thing it's actually work to find a little point in front of you and hold your mind there your eyes there

209
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:12,720
fixedly without letting them go but to let the eyes just wander around a thing it doesn't have to be a big thing

210
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:18,400
it could just be a small thing it naturally kind of it moves and round and takes in

211
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:25,040
everything of the thing so um so same watching the river go by

212
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:31,119
that's one of the reasons why it can be relaxing to watch something like that because the eyes naturally will kind of

213
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:37,200
move with everything going therapists sometimes will encourage people when they're stressed

214
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:43,359
or afraid to especially if they're you know locked into it to look around a room and just kind of

215
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:49,760
look at the corners look at lines look when i'm sometimes on the computer a lot like on zoom a lot

216
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:56,319
um i'll start looking at the for a while i'll look at the edge of the monitor just trace the edge of the monitor

217
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:02,720
there's something about just tracing it to a relaxed way that feels relaxing and it kind of loosens up something

218
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:08,319
deeper inside and so the same thing with our our inner

219
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:14,240
awareness our mindfulness that if it's locked in that it's actually kind of tense

220
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:19,440
but a way to get settled and concentrated in a healthy way

221
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:25,280
gathered in and unified is uh there's this kind of very simple

222
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:30,960
it's not exactly willful or intentional but there's natural moving feeling and

223
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:38,480
knowing knowing and feeling and um and there's something about gently relaxedly

224
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,599
allowing each to be mutually supportive to know i'm breathing to feel the

225
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:48,800
breathing to know the in-breath to feel the in-breath to feel the in-breath to know

226
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:54,319
the sensation and it might seem like it's busy work like there's a lot going on but it's

227
00:42:54,319 --> 00:43:00,079
actually recognizing it's probably happening all along you might prioritize one

228
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:07,200
it might be mostly knowing and originally in the beginning like the exercise is it might mostly be feeling sometimes

229
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:12,960
experiencing it but each one includes the other

230
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,079
and so observing the body internally

231
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:25,040
and observing the body externally is to recognize this simple relaxed

232
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:31,040
income in constant constantly changing and shifting modes of awareness

233
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:38,000
sometimes feelings sometimes knowing and that and it's more like recognizing that it's what the mind is doing that

234
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,760
our system is doing that then instructions to do because the instructions are just to

235
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:50,560
observe and so as we open up our perception to what's happening

236
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:56,079
we're also becoming aware not only of what is happening what the what the experience of the body

237
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:03,680
is but they can that it's being known in different modes it's being node no in the mode of

238
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:10,640
knowing recognition in the mode of feeling and if you and then you get to both the best

239
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:15,680
of both of those worlds both of those ways of being they both are profound and

240
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:21,920
meaningful and uh it's important not to prioritize one over the other as being the thing

241
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:27,599
like the way of doing mindfulness but one of them might be the way we get

242
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:34,480
centered and focused so if you learn yourself well enough to know that you get more so focused by the knowing

243
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:39,520
that faculty great go for it if you get more focused by the feeling faculty go

244
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:46,160
for it and if you get more focused by the relaxing quality of this

245
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:51,280
first exercise relaxing the bodily formations go with it but the movement

246
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:57,680
is to go to this come to this place where we can just observe and one of the ways that i found helpful

247
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:02,880
this to observe internally and externally the body

248
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:09,280
is uh to recognize the shifting natural relaxed shifting that goes on

249
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:15,280
um between knowing and experiencing and now it's kind of like sitting at

250
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:20,960
their at the riverbank watching a stream go by just oh look at that it's just

251
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:26,400
this is constantly shifting and moving and and in that way it can be relaxing too

252
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:32,480
because there's no fixation so i hope that made sense if it doesn't

253
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:37,760
make sense maybe it will one day and in the meantime don't worry about it

254
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:44,240
and this first exercise of meditating on the breath

255
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:48,000
is phenomenally um

256
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:59,200
useful it kind of you just keep doing it and it probably keeps opening up and opening up just the simplicity of doing

257
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:04,640
the breath meditation without trying too much the techniques and

258
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:10,640
drawing everything all at once so today is the

259
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:15,920
teaching then is the foundation for the teaching tomorrow and the next step

260
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:22,319
in the refrain and in the meantime maybe through the day you can

261
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:28,880
study a little bit the shifting nature of when you know something cognitively and when you know

262
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:35,200
something experientially and how closely connected they can be if you relax

263
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:41,400
so thank you very much
