1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:07,120
okay so why don't we go ahead and get started it's very nice to see everyone and nice

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,400
to have a chance to be back again with you this week

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:19,039
I know that Gil has started his insight series Who knows how long that one will

4
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:25,600
be right after the samadei series and Shelley talked last week about the

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:32,078
sense bases as kind of a support for doing insight practice Well

6
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:39,760
so this week we're going to take up a series of simileies uh that help shine a light on how the

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:48,239
mind transforms from being timid and distracted to being strong and clear in

8
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:54,160
some way So in a very broad way you could think of it as a journey of what

9
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,840
happens to the mind as it gradually gains more insight and becomes able

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,080
eventually to walk the path on its own And how are we going to talk about that

11
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,840
this week uh we'll look at a series of animal simileies So I'm smiling because

12
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:19,360
I'm kind of delighted by this um prospect that there's a lot of animal similes in the sutas uh the teachings of

13
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:26,880
the Buddha and so uh we'll be going through some of them kind of as a as simileies for this process of the mind

14
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,360
So I'll say more about that after we sit So on that why don't we go ahead and

15
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:41,360
meditate together So allowing yourself to come into

16
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:48,880
a comfortable posture one where you can be upright and also

17
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:58,040
relaxed or if you're lying down where you feel generally straight and balanced

18
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:06,039
And if you're comfortable doing so I invite you to close your eyes

19
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,720
Maybe take a long slow deep breath and really fill the lungs

20
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,239
And then on the exhale just allow the body to settle a little bit more into

21
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:31,920
the posture letting any imbalances or tensions that

22
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,560
are easy to soften just relax out

23
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:48,400
And then it's helpful to connect in with the body at the beginning of a sit So

24
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,680
just noticing the sensations in your face and

25
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:01,840
softening the expression on the face maybe around the eyes

26
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,239
jaw muscles

27
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,519
Softening the eyes and the eye sockets

28
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,599
and down into the shoulders

29
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,080
inviting some release

30
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:43,560
I sometimes imagine my shoulder blades sliding down the back

31
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,640
down through the arms and the hands

32
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,200
And as the shoulders soften a bit you may be able to feel the head kind of

33
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:13,360
uplift The neck gets released somehow

34
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:21,560
That provides a nice kind of upward feeling to the spine

35
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,759
softening in the chest and the heart area

36
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,560
Gently extending down into the belly

37
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:59,840
Inviting the belly to be soft Maybe just one or two layers of it

38
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,800
Even feeling down into the low back

39
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,080
letting that soften a bit

40
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:27,199
And as the belly and the low back both soften the spine which is in between

41
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:34,680
them we really have a chance to feel how balanced that is

42
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:45,479
Seeing if we can find that simple place

43
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,880
where it's easy to be upright

44
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,160
and softening through the hip joints

45
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,479
down into the legs

46
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,720
all the way to the feet

47
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,680
And if there were parts of the body that are they're just in pain today or

48
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:32,560
they're chronically uncomfortable or if there are tensions or even areas

49
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:39,240
of the body that you couldn't feel very well that's all fine

50
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:47,960
Actually the body is fine as it is or just inviting a connection to it

51
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:58,400
Then opening the attention back to the body in general feeling the

52
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,000
posture you're in sitting or lying down Maybe some of you

53
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,639
are even standing

54
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,440
And sensing our simple presence mindfulness

55
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,478
to be here

56
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,919
And one of the simplest and most easeful ways to sit is

57
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,520
to have what's called an anchor

58
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:52,400
And I'll invite a choice of three different possibilities

59
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,400
Many people sit with the breath as the anchor The sensations of in-n-out

60
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:05,879
breathing That's a great choice

61
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:15,440
It's also possible to use more generally the sensations of the body as a anchor

62
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:22,080
Sometimes I sit with the um the feeling of where I'm sitting So all the sort of

63
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,440
all the contact points my seat against the cushion and my feet against the

64
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:34,320
floor wherever my hands are resting those touch points make a very nice meditation

65
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,320
object

66
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:48,240
Or if you prefer you can use sound if the body is not

67
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:55,279
a good choice for you or or not today Just the simple natural sounds that

68
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:03,079
you're hearing coming and going can be a very restful place to put the mind

69
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:13,360
So don't try all three but um choose the breath the body or sounds as a simple

70
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,360
anchor

71
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:49,040
And just see if the mind can naturally tune in

72
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:57,600
All of these objects are gently changing So that can be easy for the mind to

73
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:06,360
find its way to resting with it Little bit of gentle movement feels nice

74
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:27,600
It's very natural that the mind will fall away from the object or become

75
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,880
caught up in some way If you've meditated for more than five

76
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:41,000
minutes you'll know this And I know some of you have meditated for quite a while

77
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,440
But when we notice that of course the mindfulness is already returned

78
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:56,399
And the invitation for this sit is to notice explicitly the feeling of

79
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:02,920
groundedness in being present

80
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,639
It actually feels more easeful more

81
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:15,200
anchored in some way to be present than to be wandering off thinking about

82
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:21,079
tomorrow or what that person said yesterday

83
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:29,200
We might miss the advantages of being present if we

84
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:35,600
don't look for them So it may be subtle at first but notice

85
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:42,200
the clarity the groundedness of mindfulness

86
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:35,639
And I'll also offer a second invitation

87
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:45,560
in addition to perceiving mindfulness as having clarity and groundedness

88
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:55,639
Maybe try out perceiving this feeling as a as an aspect of safety

89
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:03,040
So when the mind and the body are together in the present moment

90
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,560
there's an extra dimension of safety that is not present

91
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:17,560
when the mind is caught up the mind is following its distractions

92
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,920
When the mind is spread out or distracted

93
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,519
it's kind of like when we're when we're carrying

94
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:35,440
a fragile bowl and we've got it in one hand and our

95
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:42,560
hand is wet and we're walking quickly and then

96
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:49,040
we remember oh this is I should be careful with this bowl And so we hold it

97
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:55,120
with both hands close to the body and we walk slowly

98
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,480
and it feels so different

99
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:08,280
So when the mind and the body are together just being mindful of experience

100
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,558
we're holding that bowl safely carefully

101
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,600
Can we sense That

102
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:38,799
When we perceive mindfulness as a form of safety

103
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:45,000
we may naturally enjoy being present

104
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:54,760
Even if what we're present for is a difficult mind state or pain in the body

105
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:02,799
Still there's this sense of yeah but I'm here for it This is the

106
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:08,600
place where I can meet it most skillfully

107
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:17,039
So you may also notice the natural simple

108
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:25,600
ease and enjoyment of being fully with experience

109
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,600
safely

110
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:05,640
And as we move toward the end of this sitting

111
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:13,679
we can notice that mindfulness with its accompanying sense

112
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:21,360
of safety clarity grounded goodness

113
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:29,240
is a way of taking care Taking care with our experience

114
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:38,159
And in a similar way when we are mindful going about our

115
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:44,480
daily life or interacting with other people

116
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:51,200
there's also an element of care that comes when we bring our clear

117
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,919
attention to that

118
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:04,000
If we go through life distracted moving quickly

119
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:10,080
with an attitude of let's just get it done or I wish I weren't having to do

120
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:17,200
this right now or I don't want to interact with this person

121
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,480
All of those things actually endanger us in certain ways

122
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,600
We're more likely to say something we didn't want to say or that is not

123
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,640
helpful We're more likely to

124
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,960
get injured drop something on our foot We're more likely just to not enjoy the

125
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,320
time not feel a sense of well-being or ease

126
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,919
It's not that everything we do we're going to enjoy naturally or that we're

127
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:57,039
every interaction is going to be easy or friendly necessarily But if we're fully

128
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:03,520
present again we're adding that

129
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:09,279
doing it carefully doing it as wisely and as compassionately as is possible in

130
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:17,039
that moment So again there's safety and being present and being willing to stay with

131
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:26,080
things So the invitation is to try that out today and see if if it's the case

132
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:31,919
that there's a sense of refuge

133
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:40,080
safety in being present whether it's pleasant or whether it's unpleasant

134
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,640
Serving ourselves and others in a caring way

135
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:05,710
[Music]

136
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:17,910
[Music]

137
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:30,049
[Music]

138
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:49,760
Okay we'll be talking about a series of

139
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:56,640
animal simileies this week and I've chosen them such that they are meant to

140
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:04,559
represent different stages of the mind's journey from being reactive and caught

141
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:09,600
up to being more wise and strong And

142
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:15,279
this is a a journey that we go on as we undertake mindfulness practice as we

143
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:22,720
develop samati some gathering of the mind and as we have genuine insights not

144
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,000
only into our own life but into the nature of suffering and the end of

145
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,159
suffering And so that means that we'll generally go from

146
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:40,960
weaker animals to stronger animals if you will Don't take it too literally Um

147
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:46,799
we're not insulting the animals that are early in the week Um these simileies

148
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:51,840
that are given by the Buddha are meant to be figurative They're meant to help

149
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:59,600
us reflect on our own minds and our own lives And they also offer teachings in

150
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:05,519
how to practice well and how to understand some of the important aspects

151
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:12,960
of the dharma So today we're going to start with the

152
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:19,279
quail The quail So uh when I was at IRC one

153
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:25,919
spring I frequently saw a quail pair with their chicks and it was quite

154
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:31,360
amazing to me because they had something like 17 of them I couldn't actually

155
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:37,279
quite count them all when they were going by um but I tried and I got close

156
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:44,960
to 17 So I thought about um also about how well protected they would be if they

157
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:51,519
were to stay inside of IRC's fence IRC has a fence a deer fence all the way

158
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:57,039
around it So if they stayed inside there would be no threat from coyotes or foxes

159
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:03,360
or things like that I mean there would still be IRC's cats um maybe hawks but

160
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,640
IRC has a lot of forest So you know overall the sense was that

161
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,760
quailes don't really fly all that well and they do look kind of vulnerable um

162
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:21,679
moving around with a big cluster of tiny chicks So I realized that this um image that's

163
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,960
given in the sutas is pretty accurate then which is that the first of all the

164
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:34,799
quail is portrayed as um physically weak So this is a quote from a a suta

165
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:41,440
Suppose a quail was tied with a vine and was waiting there to be injured caged or

166
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:47,840
killed Would it be right to say that for that quail that vine is weak feeble

167
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:54,000
rotten and insubstantial the Buddha asks this question and the monks say "No no

168
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:01,039
for that quail the vine is a strong firm and stout bond a tie that has not rotted

169
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:10,158
and a heavy yolk." So for a quail even a vine is can be quite a substantial bond

170
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:16,320
And then the analogy is extended um from physical weakness to represent also a

171
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:22,000
certain kind of um lack of mental fortitude Not that we would have that

172
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,079
all the time but you know we have our moments right So it goes on to um liken

173
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:36,720
the quail to a person who wants to practice in a sense or even wants to um

174
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:43,280
ordain Uh but we could just say for lay people to to practice more seriously to

175
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:49,679
have a regular practice but they find that they're not able to give up even things that aren't serving them very

176
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:56,398
well So again um from the suta and I have to apologize a little bit for the

177
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:03,280
um literal language that's used but I'm trusting we since we're on a whole week of simileies we can make that

178
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:10,240
translation in our minds So it says suppose there was a poor man with few

179
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:17,359
possessions and little wealth He had a single broken down hut open to the crows

180
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:24,160
not the best sort And a single broken down couch not the best sort and a

181
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:30,000
single pot for storing grain not the best sort And his relationships were

182
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:37,119
also not the best sort And then he would see a person practicing uh sitting in

183
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:43,520
meditation in the cool shade their hands and feet well washed after eating an

184
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:50,079
alms meal And he would think "Oh the life of practice looks so very pleasant

185
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:56,320
The life looks very healthy If only," and now it uses the monastic image If

186
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:02,400
only I could shave off my hair and beard dress in ochre robes and go forth into

187
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,760
this life of practice But he is not able to give up his broken

188
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:14,400
down hut broken down couch his pot or his poor relationships none of which are

189
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:20,960
the best sort in order to go forth Would it be right to say that for that man

190
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:28,560
those bonds are weak feeble rotten and insubstantial and of course the monks reply "Oh no for that man even those we

191
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:35,119
those not of the best sort things are strong firm and stout bonds."

192
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:40,240
So even if we have possessions or life

193
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:47,200
situations that are not serving us well maybe they're not even healthy for us

194
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,880
if we can't give them up or change them They are real fedters and burdens and

195
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,880
bonds for us So as an extreme example you know people who have addictions of

196
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:04,400
various kinds their bodies are being damaged They're using up their money

197
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:11,440
their relationships are not healthy and yet the nature of addiction is that it's very hard to give up even those things

198
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:17,440
that are that are making life difficult And then you know we may see in

199
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:23,839
ourselves reflections of this Maybe we're stuck in a job that is uh very

200
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:30,960
stressful for us or a living situation that is not easy And sometimes we may

201
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:36,720
even be given a chance to change but we waffle and we hesitate because we're not

202
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:42,160
sure about giving up even this harmful situation just because we have it It

203
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:48,800
happens all the time And this is this is where we start actually in our practice is that we

204
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:54,560
we're clinging to things that are not even supportive for us

205
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:01,359
So we can notice that the English verb to quail

206
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:08,720
means to give way to falter to collapse to cower It's not a very common verb but

207
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:14,400
it is um it is I think the quail was chosen partly because of its resonance

208
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,760
with that English verb You know the the translation of the bird and just saying

209
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:25,520
it's a quail But hang on I've set us up that that we

210
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,800
can now provide some hope There is some hope for the quail given in another suta

211
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,920
There's there are other quail sutas and it starts out with the quail getting in

212
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:41,680
trouble But hang on So this is now from a different suta It's a story The Buddha

213
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:49,440
is actually telling a story And he says "Once in the past a hawk suddenly swooped down and seized a quail And then

214
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:55,200
while the quail was being carried off by the hawk he lamented h we were so

215
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,800
unlucky of so little merit We strayed out of our own resort and into the

216
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:06,640
domain of others if we had stayed in our own resort today in our own ancestral

217
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:12,400
domain This hawk wouldn't have stood a chance against me in a fight So the

218
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:18,160
quail gets caught by the hawk when it's straying from its ancestral domain is

219
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:25,119
actually what the text says And then um the story goes on with the hawk uh kind

220
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:31,680
of mocking the quail a little bit and saying "Well what is your ancestral domain?" And the the quail says "It's a

221
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,960
freshly plowed field covered with clouds of soil." And so the hawk is a little

222
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:44,640
bit arrogant and lets the quail go and um the quail goes back to the field that

223
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,839
is his own ancestral domain And then um

224
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:54,960
the the hawk actually gets a little overconfident and tries to attack the

225
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,880
quail there and ends up um injuring itself and not able to to get the the

226
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:06,000
quail So all that's a little violent sounding but again there's an analogy

227
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:12,240
given where um the quail gets in trouble when it's gone outside the field and the

228
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:19,839
hawk gets in trouble trying to attack the quail in the field Each one has the realm where it kind of belongs

229
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:26,800
And so the Buddha uses this as an analogy for our mind He says if if you

230
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:32,880
don't if you let your mind stray into areas that are not helpful for it He

231
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:38,480
uses the term mara Mara will gain access to those who stray outside their own

232
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,599
resort Mara being the name for the forces of distraction of um unh

233
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:49,280
wholesomeness in the mind And so um

234
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:57,359
so the the Buddha then goes on to say well what is our own ancestral domain you know where can our mind be safe and

235
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:04,480
he says the four establishments of mindfulness So he says here monks a monk dwells or a

236
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:10,560
practitioner dwells contemplating the body in the body ardent clearly aware

237
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:15,839
and mindful having removed covousness covetousness and displeasure in regard

238
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:21,119
to the world A meditator dwells contemplating feelings and feelings mind

239
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:28,160
in mind dharmas and dharmas hardened clearly comprehending and mindful having

240
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:35,920
removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world So we belong in the four foundations of

241
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:42,079
mindfulness and the domain of others is in the realm of distraction in the realm

242
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:50,319
of getting attached to what he actually says the Buddha says is the five chords of sensual pleasure forms cognizable by

243
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:56,400
the eye that are desirable lovely agreeable pleasing and tantalizing And

244
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,760
the same for sounds and smells and tastes and sensations

245
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:09,280
Um so this is a little bit what Shelley talked about last week is when we get caught up in our sense world in a way

246
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:15,280
that is not helpful ways that it's either attached to it grabbing after it

247
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:22,880
or pushing it away Then we are easily subject to forces in the mind that are

248
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:30,480
uncomfortable for us that get us in trouble that by which we say things that are not helpful for relationships

249
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:37,280
Whereas if we stay mindful we stay with our body we stay with the feeling tone

250
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,800
we understand what's happening in our internal world it's so much easier to

251
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:49,520
interact well with our life with ourselves with others And so we have the

252
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:55,359
the quail Um the story of the quail is that uh he was smart enough to realize

253
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:00,800
oh I strayed outside um and I got caught by the hawk but if I

254
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:06,880
had stayed in the field it would have been fine And sure enough the you know he gets detested right because the hawk

255
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:13,119
lets him go into the field and and can't get hold of him So in the same way if we

256
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:20,880
realize oops I was caught up I was caught up in wanting and not wanting and distraction Soon as we realize that if

257
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:27,119
we return to mindfulness we can feel actually how maybe we're still kind of

258
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:35,359
irritated but it's just irritation We just observe oh the mind's irritated right now and we've pulled back into

259
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:41,119
this realm of safety just knowing that Mara's there but we're not caught by

260
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:46,560
Mara So it's good news for us as practitioners

261
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:52,560
Um even if we're new practitioners or if we're not so wise yet uh we're protected

262
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:59,359
by mindfulness practice the Buddha's instructions to keep our attention in these particular realms is really good

263
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:04,560
advice And by the way it doesn't change later when we become more experienced is

264
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:13,839
always just the four foundations of mindfulness all the way through So the quail generally depicted as weak

265
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:21,359
physically mentally prone to being attacked in various ways But if the quail remembers to come back into the

266
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:27,359
ancestral domain of the four foundations of mindfulness then immediately safety

267
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:32,480
is available and we can use this in our everyday life and in our practice on the

268
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:39,520
cushion So this is our foundation for the week is that the quail um when our

269
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:44,960
mo when our mind has moments of being like the quail there is safety available

270
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:52,079
always So I wish you well in your mindfulness practice and we'll go on with another

271
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:57,319
animal tomorrow Thank you
