6
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,700
box in front of me flowing [Music]

7
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:50,579
so good morning and good day um this week the meditation theme that I

8
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:57,300
brought in is that of Stillness and a movement

9
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:04,400
and still Stillness and movement in wider variety of ways

10
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,780
and we'll begin there and so if you like

11
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:19,100
to join me and to take a meditative pasture and please feel free to do that

12
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,979
we'll just take a few moments to set her in

13
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:36,420
maybe a few long deep breaths as you breathe out

14
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,659
arriving Here and Now

15
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,180
entering into this body and mind

16
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,619
maybe the immediate sense of this moment

17
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:14,180
as we settle in is that of a movement

18
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,859
maybe there are dancing energies in the body

19
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,120
movements of the breath

20
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:43,819
movements are the waves of emotions

21
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:06,920
just noticing this mindfulness is already here

22
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:32,159
take a few moments to just welcome [Music] a wide range of movements

23
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,959
in our experiences

24
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:48,680
inviting settling resting down

25
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:08,580
noticing the lower half of the body making contact with the floor

26
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:15,620
chairs or maybe the whole body making contact

27
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,400
if you're lying down

28
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,840
your body is supported by Earth

29
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,020
and there is the Earth element in the body

30
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,320
that is heavy

31
00:04:53,160 --> 00:05:00,900
firm grounded

32
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:18,080
maybe a sense of earthy body resting on Earth

33
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:43,639
right here you may already notice

34
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,100
a kind of a relative a Stillness

35
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,840
with the Earth element in the body

36
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:02,419
steady stable

37
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:09,479
relatively unmoving

38
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,400
there is a Stillness in the body

39
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:28,639
there is a movement in the body

40
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:05,819
and rest your attention the Stillness of the Earth element in

41
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:13,639
the body sitting like a mountain

42
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:24,680
steady quiet

43
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,780
and still

44
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:48,800
maybe the whole body as a sense of resting down

45
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:03,440
relaxed soft

46
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,800
sitting like a mountain

47
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:09,860
the Stillness of the body May highlight the movements

48
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,800
the movements of the Bride

49
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,380
tingling Sensations

50
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,959
vibrations

51
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:37,339
or stations

52
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,880
you can open to receive

53
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:02,180
the movements in the body

54
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,000
as well as the Stillness

55
00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:21,899
as if the wind blows

56
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:25,160
in the mountain

57
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,519
maybe the Torso gently sways

58
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:21,500
belly Rises and the falls

59
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:35,100
you feel the dance of the Stillness

60
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:42,440
I got the movements In This Very body

61
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:16,519
resting in the felt sense of your experience

62
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,019
feeling sensing

63
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,879
Stillness

64
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:40,459
and feeling and sensing

65
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,300
their movements

66
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,680
letting go of stories

67
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,800
ideas

68
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,620
just to this

69
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:08,240
sitting like a tall mountain

70
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:19,340
still quiet

71
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:24,600
meaning this very body there is a natural quality of a

72
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,720
Stillness and the movements

73
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:26,778
by being away with the Stillness and the movements in the body

74
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:34,980
our mind saddles

75
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:38,658
and become quiet

76
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:22,460
if you like to play for the rest of the day this dance of a Stillness and emotions

77
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:29,279
the invitation is to pause

78
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:36,240
maybe throughout the day to notice Stillness

79
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:41,840
and the movements In This Very body

80
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:56,980
[Music]

81
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,679
foreign

82
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:49,620
welcome again everyone I'm so happy to be with you let me make

83
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:57,559
sure I have my recording on here okay I think I'm all good

84
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:04,260
ah so this week

85
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:09,919
I brought a set of Stories of the great

86
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:15,299
women Disciples of the Buddha then

87
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:20,460
and this I guess there's a five women I'm going

88
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:26,640
to bring forth uh this week I came from a wide range of life

89
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,860
situations backgrounds um

90
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:38,220
yeah to each of them are in their own ways of experienced

91
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:43,799
wide range of challenges and losses in their own lives

92
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:50,159
and not only that they also have experienced all kinds of difficulties

93
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,200
and challenges that came from the broader culture and the society that

94
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:01,740
they live in and yet they were

95
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:07,500
not disabled by them or hindered by them

96
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:14,820
and so this heroic women Rose beyond all of the difficulties and challenges and

97
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:24,260
the pain that they experienced and they were transformed by the Dharma

98
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:32,460
and so the first four women I'll be speaking about uh were from the times of the Buddha

99
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:37,740
and they were considered to be awakened individuals

100
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:44,760
and the last one I'll be bringing in is a modern day women disciple

101
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:53,820
and I hope and that this stories would Inspire and uplift Us in some way

102
00:34:53,820 --> 00:35:00,420
that each of us know that um for ourselves that The Liberation is

103
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:08,520
a possible for each of us so the first woman I brought in the

104
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:13,859
story of the pachara and so many of you may have heard of

105
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:19,020
this um but we have patachara statue

106
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:24,060
in IRC and so this is um maybe why I

107
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:30,920
chose to begin with the party so there is a bit of Affinity

108
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:37,400
with the IMC and IRC community

109
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:45,540
statue is sitting in inside Retreat Center our retreat center right now and

110
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:52,220
so for those who go there to meditate um they see this

111
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:02,040
so I like to tell a little story about party Chara's life

112
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:06,740
and her Awakening Journey

113
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:18,900
and there is a collection called an apadana and I will be drawing some of

114
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:25,800
the verses from this palikana collection and this is translated by John Waters

115
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:34,619
and it's called The Legends of the teres teres are senior female Disciples of the

116
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:39,780
Buddha and so they are considered to be Legends um

117
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:46,260
and so patachara was a born out of rather wealthy family Jose he was born

118
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:52,020
into a well-to-do family and as a young woman she fell in love

119
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:58,800
with a servant's boy of her family and in those days

120
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:06,180
um the Casta system is quite strong and we're not supposed to marry an outside

121
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:11,460
of their own Caster system in this um in some ways it's a remaining

122
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:16,920
to be a quite strong system in different parts of the world uh in India

123
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:23,579
particularly even now and so but you know she fell in love as

124
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:30,780
a young woman and they ended up running away from the household a house that she

125
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:36,560
was born into and so they had to leave and

126
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:45,000
lived in some Villages a little far away from katuchara as a home

127
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:53,940
and along the way um she had given a birth to one son and

128
00:37:53,940 --> 00:38:01,440
then with the second one in her womb she's are ready to go back to see their family

129
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:09,599
she's really missing their family and so um but she was recounting this

130
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:16,020
experience and she said my husband was not pleased at this thought

131
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:22,740
and so then when she was on when he was on a journey I snuck out of the house

132
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:28,800
alone to go to savati which is where her

133
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:35,160
family was living and so she decided to go on her own with

134
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:42,119
a second child in her womb and was basically a toddler in her hand

135
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:48,780
and this time running away from her husband had to go back to visit the

136
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:55,079
family but that the husband caught on

137
00:38:55,079 --> 00:39:03,300
um and began to chase after her and in this process her labor pain began

138
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:12,720
to happen and right around that time she recounted that at the time for me to

139
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:20,339
give birth to the second a baby in the womb a massive ring Cloud arose there

140
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:26,280
and then my husband having gone to find the grass even

141
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:33,480
though her husband caught up with the family um pachachara decided not to go back and

142
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:38,700
they continued to go so this ring Cloud came and a ring storm

143
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:45,079
came and the husband went to go find some grass to make some fire and maybe

144
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:53,480
Sheltering some way but he was killed by a poisonous snake

145
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:03,599
and so pachachara said then miserable and helpless

146
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:10,500
in the throats a painful childbirth going toward a relative's house

147
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:18,300
seeing and overflowing stream so having lost a husband you can imagine

148
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:25,740
that uh you know now he has she has a newborn in the hand

149
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:31,700
and a toddler and there's no way going back now

150
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:38,099
but there is this overflowing stream that's right in front of her because of

151
00:40:38,099 --> 00:40:46,200
the ring storm and so she had to carry this newborn across the

152
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:52,380
flowing river while keeping the toddler on the other Riverbank for the time

153
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:58,020
being she couldn't do take both in one shot

154
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:04,859
and then when she had put the baby on the other side and nurse to the baby

155
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:12,480
and ready to come back to the other side of the uh the stream to get the toddler

156
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,900
right in the midstream this is the weather

157
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:26,880
patachara be counted she said I turned and Osprey carried off

158
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:34,020
my wailing baby then the current

159
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:39,359
swept the toddler away my other son

160
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:45,839
what happened what happened here so she put the baby on the other side of

161
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:54,240
the bank but the Osprey saw the baby and dived on and picked up the baby and

162
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:59,940
left the flu away and so she was yelling and screaming and

163
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:07,800
waving I tried to get the baby down but this screaming and yelling the toddler

164
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:15,240
thought oh Mommy was calling me to come so he started walking towards the river

165
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:22,700
towards the flow and then the toddler got swept away

166
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:29,579
this is just a wedding [Music] 24 hours

167
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:34,920
she lost her husband her baby

168
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:39,140
and her toddler just like that

169
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:49,320
and she was overwhelmed or overwhelmed by the grief the loss

170
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:54,720
and so now she had no choice but to go back to

171
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:00,720
sabati to go visit um her family

172
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:10,440
there's no other way now right and yet on the way to go visit uh sabati

173
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:18,599
um people saw her on the way and she inquired about her

174
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:24,660
family and someone told them the whole family

175
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:33,260
was killed because of the rainstorm the last night the house collapsed collapsed

176
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:42,599
her parents and her brother all died

177
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:47,839
with English 24 to 48 hours

178
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:58,980
so she's gone mad I I feel like this is the kind of a pain that

179
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:03,859
The Logical Minds just can't hold

180
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:10,079
it's kind of beyond what our mind can hold

181
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:15,119
and so she's gone mad uh Sheen

182
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:24,060
uh rise sobs and began to wander around uh

183
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:28,520
kind of like a crazy woman

184
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:36,380
and she said I grew pale and the thing helpless

185
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:44,220
this was the and the state of a being she was in

186
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:50,160
the clothes were torn and the people began to throw stuff at

187
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:57,540
her and thinking this is a mad woman and in the midst of this and the Buddha

188
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:06,318
was staying at a sabati the Ananda penticas Monastery right then

189
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:12,780
and she was wandering around and and saw the Buddha

190
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:21,480
far away and this was at the time when uh there's a moment on that

191
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:26,839
some sort of Consciousness came back to her

192
00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:34,319
and um and when she finally saw the Buddha

193
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:41,099
and she began to recount to this whole experience to the Buddha

194
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:49,380
and the Buddha listened to her compassionately at the end of her recount

195
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:53,240
the Buddha said this to her

196
00:45:54,540 --> 00:46:02,400
but little water do the oceans four contain compared with all the tears that one

197
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:09,319
shed by sorrow smitten and by suffering distraught

198
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:14,700
the Buddha put her sorrow and a grief in perspective

199
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:21,839
the ten thousand sorrows and a grief that we experience even the four great

200
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:29,220
oceans couldn't contain at all and so the Buddha continued

201
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:34,500
do not grieve child breathe easily

202
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:43,260
you should look after yourself why uselessly torment yourself

203
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:52,760
there are no sounds to give shelter and there is no shelter with the family

204
00:46:55,560 --> 00:47:04,980
and those words penetrated her mind deeply for her this is uh this was truth

205
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:10,640
she saw how fragile it was

206
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:16,319
and she was relying counting on the Family

207
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:22,619
and the children and the parents one by one

208
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:28,319
was swept away right underneath of her feet

209
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:35,000
and so she knew the impermanence of all things so deeply right there

210
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,500
she experienced the celebrity so right then

211
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:45,260
she knew the truth of Anita

212
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:54,140
in permanence she knew the truth of dukkah

213
00:47:54,300 --> 00:48:03,240
she knew the truth of claiming to dukkha clinging is is Duca

214
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:10,099
and so right then and there was a moment of a transformation for her

215
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:18,260
and so is she entrusted to herself to the Buddha Dharma and the Sangha

216
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:23,760
and that ever since that day she practiced the diligently

217
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:29,160
and this poem that's translated by

218
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:38,520
Franco um speaks to her Awakening experience

219
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:43,800
I like to read this poem from terrigata

220
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:52,920
plowing Fields with plows sowing seeds in the ground

221
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:59,099
caring for children and wife young men getting wealth

222
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:05,400
why is that I battle in virtuous conduct

223
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:11,099
doing the Buddha's instruction not lazy or proud

224
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:18,359
have not attained release having washed my feet

225
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:24,240
I watched the water the foot washing water

226
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:30,720
flowing from High Ground to low with this

227
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:37,980
the Mind concentrated like a thoroughbred horse

228
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:44,040
taking an oil lamp I entered my heart

229
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:50,700
looking over the bed I sat down on the bed

230
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:57,480
taking a needle I pulled out the wick

231
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:02,520
as the flame went out the mind

232
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,599
was freed

233
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:17,520
so this was possible for patachara even after the ocean of the sorrow and a

234
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:26,040
grief well and not only patachara become became

235
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:36,480
awakened as she was known to be the one who taught many other nouns disciples

236
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:46,880
and I'd like to um evoke maybe a sense of inspiration

237
00:50:47,099 --> 00:50:51,020
through patrachara's story

238
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:59,880
and there is a pachara statue in IRC and for those who

239
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:07,920
go to IRC to do the retreat practice maybe wander to the walking hall right

240
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:16,460
now and just stand right in front of Chara for a few moments

241
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:21,500
may this uplift all of us

242
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:29,058
May Awakening be a possibility for all beings

243
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,839
thank you everyone

244
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:42,920
and we will continue tomorrow with another story
