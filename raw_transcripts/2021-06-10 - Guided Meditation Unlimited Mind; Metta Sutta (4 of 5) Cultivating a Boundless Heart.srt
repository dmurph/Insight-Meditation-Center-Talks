1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:08,639
warm greetings from imce in redwood city california

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:14,240
and we're here

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,800
maybe also to enjoy the light show that will happen in this time of year as the sun goes up we have these very big

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,240
windows here and there's a this time of year that for a few minutes the

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,800
sun gets very intense through that windows and so uh right now that's clear and a

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,360
little while maybe it'll be a little bit too strong and then it'll get

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:47,200
changed keeps changing the light show so um so changes our minds

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,680
and uh probably our minds can be sometimes more changeable than

9
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:00,879
the changing patterns of the sunlight on the wall and and uh and maybe you can marvel like

10
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:06,320
your own mind and all the if you marvel at the changing nature of the mind and

11
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,600
the amazing things and thoughts and impulses that arise in the mind and

12
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,600
kind of be amazed that you even have a mind as opposed to getting caught by what's

13
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,520
in the mind or preoccupied what's in the mind

14
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:30,479
one of the descriptions of a mind that is imbued

15
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:38,840
fully imbued with metta with loving-kindness is that it becomes unlimited

16
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,439
boundless and what this means in part is that the mind is not caught or

17
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,479
trapped in anything so if we are fully preoccupied with

18
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,520
something we might not notice anything else

19
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,560
we go about even looking for something in our home that's lost

20
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:07,600
we might not notice other things just we're just looking for that particular thing or we're preoccupied with some task and

21
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,879
we don't hear that don't notice the other people

22
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:19,920
around or their needs or their situation and and the same thing we notice in meditation that the mind can be

23
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,360
preoccupied with things with thoughts with desires with aversions

24
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:32,160
and everything gets kind of narrow constricted kind of organized the mind around that

25
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,840
particular thing and then in the buddhist language the mind then has been limited by that

26
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,599
has been bounded by that concern that

27
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:49,040
preoccupation and the idea is to begin to free the

28
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:56,400
mind from its narrowness from its uh limitations from his preoccupations

29
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,680
and start experiencing something in the mind that feels more unlimited more expansive and open and um

30
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,400
and a little bit paradoxically that it's possible to uh to get involved with mindfulness or

31
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,480
breathing in such a way that the breathing we become preoccupied with the breathing and we're limited by it

32
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:23,920
constricted by it some people who find that mindfulness of breathing doesn't work for them is because

33
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:30,640
the only way they know maybe how to focus on it is in a way that limits them or constricts the mind or

34
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,959
or it ties us up in some way the um but the idea is that as we use the ma

35
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:43,920
the breathing as a way to free the mind from all its limitations all its preoccupations

36
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,440
not add another preoccupation so to find a way to engage in the mind that

37
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:56,319
in the breathing that has a softness to it openness to it a receptivity to it

38
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:02,560
it's kind of like welcoming the breathing into the openness of the mind rather than constricting the mind to

39
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,680
zero in on the breathing and as we do that the world might get reduced to just

40
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,640
breathing it can be a real pleasure this way absorbing the breathing breathing in a mind that feels unlimited

41
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,079
but is not caught up in all the things of the world around it

42
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:28,160
and the so to have an unlimited mind or

43
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:35,199
unlimited awareness that's not caught by anything is the one of the conditions that

44
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,639
supports uh some of the wholesome qualities of our

45
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,960
hearts and minds and one of those is is kindness is good will is friendliness

46
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:53,040
that sometimes seems to just flow out of that unlimited quality of mind

47
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:00,560
so to take a assume and meditation posture

48
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:09,680
and to spend a little bit of time adjusting your spine adjusting your

49
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,199
chest adjusting whatever you can your torso

50
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:24,080
and your position of your neck and your head so that your body

51
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:30,000
begins to feel like maybe it feels a little bit larger than usual or more

52
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:39,840
ready to be expensive not contracted not crunched in itself or collapsed

53
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,840
then to gently close your eyes

54
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,160
and taking a few deep slow breaths at the beginning

55
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:01,759
can be seen as the beginning of this movement towards expansion now kind of an expanded body is the

56
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,759
torso expands filling with air

57
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:15,759
and then the exhale had time to let go of thoughts preoccupations

58
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,639
activities just being here

59
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,120
expanding on the inhale

60
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:38,880
making room for the expansion by clearing the mind

61
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:49,840
releasing the limitations of the mind as you exhale

62
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:02,479
and then letting your breathing return to normal

63
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:09,039
and there's such a intimate relationship between the body and the mind that

64
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:15,759
it plays out also in the tensions in the body the way the body is

65
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:23,039
held in some ways it's an expression of tension in the mind

66
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:32,720
so as you exhale softening relaxing the shoulders

67
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:45,840
releasing the shoulders sometimes can feel like it begins a process of relaxing the mind

68
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:59,840
maybe releasing as you exhale the center of the chest

69
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:13,840
relaxing the chest

70
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,440
and to relax your belly

71
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:30,240
soften and as you whatever softening you can do in your belly

72
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:41,839
maybe allow it to be a softening of the mind as well

73
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:55,839
and then also a relaxing softening of the face

74
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:05,360
and in the softening of the muscles of the face maybe it sends a reassuring signal

75
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:13,519
to the mind that it doesn't have to work it doesn't have to do so much

76
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:23,839
it's okay to put down concerns preoccupations

77
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,839
doings

78
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,080
and then before now before settling in and breathing

79
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,240
check in with yourself and see if there is any

80
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:16,640
see if there is any preoccupations in the mind

81
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:32,079
that can be felt as a limitation as a narrowing of the mind or

82
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:38,399
or being pulled into something particular

83
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:47,680
thoughts fantasies ideas

84
00:10:47,680 --> 00:11:01,839
that limit your connection to an openness and a res wider receptivity

85
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,040
and then perhaps you can relax the thinking mind

86
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:15,839
relax the thinking muscle

87
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,839
and then settling into your breathing

88
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:43,839
settled on your breathing not fixated on your breathing

89
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,320
as you exhale

90
00:11:52,639 --> 00:12:01,200
to let go of your thoughts and let go of any kind of tight

91
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:11,839
contracted effort

92
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:32,959
as you inhale perhaps using that as an occasion to have the

93
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:39,839
awareness be receptive open

94
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:48,000
wide in the open wideness of awareness

95
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,839
to receive the inhale

96
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:07,680
and when you find yourself wandering off in thought notice that in a wholesome way

97
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:17,839
but notice whatever way it limits you limits the field of attention

98
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,320
or involves a narrowing or a

99
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,839
or a preoccupation

100
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,920
and if you can let go of it see if you can let go of it into a more open

101
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:45,360
receptive state quiet peaceful

102
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:59,839
into which you can allow the experience of breathing

103
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:39,840
relaxing the constrictions of the mind in the heart

104
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:53,840
and then in that relaxation you receive the inhale

105
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:07,840
relax with the exhale

106
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:06,080
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

107
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:11,919
perhaps you can consider these last few minutes of the meditation

108
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:18,080
as kind of a private time and that what you do in this privacy of

109
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:24,000
your own meditation only you need to know

110
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:32,399
so with that sense of maybe kind of privacy maybe it's easier to open your awareness

111
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:40,080
open your heart to make room for all beings

112
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,600
to make room for others to come into your awareness

113
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,880
meaning that you're not preoccupied by something or fixated on some aspect of the

114
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:59,919
relationship to others or some some fear or annoyance

115
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:06,880
some defensiveness but for these minutes to open up wide

116
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:14,960
and make lots of room infinite room for others to be in your awareness

117
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:22,480
in your regard and nothing more is asked of you from

118
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:29,919
this moment than just simply making room at the end of the meditation you can let

119
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:36,720
them go and not hold them anymore in your mind or your heart if you want

120
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,520
and perhaps in this kind of open receptive mode

121
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:52,000
including people in your heart and your mind perhaps in your privacy of your mind you

122
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,640
can also

123
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,960
have good will for them

124
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,760
a kind regard

125
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:15,520
a generosity of spirit that wishes them well

126
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:27,120
imagines themselves them well and wishing it for them

127
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,000
and perhaps

128
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:41,279
coming out of the meditation perhaps you can in that openness

129
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:48,399
goodness of the heart aspire

130
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,559
that your meditation practice in whatever way known or not or unknown intentional or

131
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,278
unintentional

132
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:09,520
has benefit for the world around you that it's one of the ways that

133
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:15,120
we live for the welfare and happiness of others

134
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:22,720
may all beings be happy

135
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,398
may all beings

136
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:37,200
be safe may all beings be peaceful

137
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,559
and may all beings everywhere be free

138
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:53,600
and may the open expansiveness of our hearts and minds

139
00:30:53,600 --> 00:31:05,840
contribute to that possibility

140
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,159
so then this is the fourth talk

141
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:28,158
on the meta sutta the discourse on loving-kindness and

142
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:38,080
the first talk i said there was dividing into four parts and maybe maybe we are but uh it's also

143
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:44,398
i'll do five talks so the next section of it

144
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:53,360
is about the cultivation of lovingkindness so first is kind of the the

145
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:59,919
the the wholesome qualities of heart and mind that we cultivate on the

146
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:05,519
path to liberation and then it's the wish having this wish

147
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:14,240
the wish doesn't have to be with these words but wish that for all beings to be happy and safe

148
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:20,960
and then to really get to the bottom to work with our aversion our anger

149
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,880
our resentments because these limit us these are a narrowing of the scope of

150
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:33,200
the mind and awareness it involves a preoccupation to be angry and resentful

151
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:39,840
and when they're preoccupied there's not room for really taking in the world taking in

152
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,640
others in an open-hearted open-minded way

153
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:52,159
and then with that as a foundation then the practice of this of this

154
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:57,440
discourse on loving-kindness goes on to emphasize the cultivating

155
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:04,640
uh a boundless heart cultivating and developing with loving-kindness cultivating an

156
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:11,600
unlimited heart or mind and um so it's not just simply having

157
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:17,840
wishes and simply having the you're saying phrases over and over again it's not really the point of loving

158
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:25,200
kindness but the phrases are there to support and help if we do them if they help to create

159
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:33,519
this uh open awareness this openness of heart this ability to be wide

160
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:39,600
to include others into our awareness without contracting or narrowing or

161
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:46,000
resisting without getting caught up in desires and aversions and fears

162
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:54,000
a very simple state of mind that's there that's open and available to really absorb or take in or receive

163
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,440
the experience but so open so boundless in a sense

164
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:05,600
that uh it doesn't stick with us it doesn't the others don't kind of

165
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:12,320
almost like more transparent and things just go right through us not because we're dismissing them but

166
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:20,079
because it's the limitations of the mind the way that we uh uh contract and and

167
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:26,560
get preoccupied that are sticky and we get caught in the the world of

168
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:32,480
other people in our world of our reactions and moving to the mind that's free

169
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,839
is a mind that is not has no stickiness in it so things just kind of are fully

170
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:44,720
experienced but they also in a sense go through or don't stick anywhere

171
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:51,280
so this is called an unlimited mind or heart a boundless heart and mind

172
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:57,280
and so this next section then goes like this and uh on youtube you'll see it in the

173
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:03,839
description of this episode that's on the underneath the video if you click on show more you scroll

174
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:11,359
down and you'll see this fourth part of the metasuta

175
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,520
as a mother would risk her life

176
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:23,920
to protect her child her only child so towards all beings should one

177
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:30,000
cultivate a boundless heart with loving kindness for the whole world

178
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,400
should one cultivate a boundless heart above below and all around without

179
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:43,680
obstructions without hate and without ill will so for some people it's a

180
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:49,920
touching metaphor this idea of a mother with a single child going to the extent of protecting the

181
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,599
child um at the risk of her own life uh

182
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:03,119
you know that it involves a kind of non-self-preoccupation and when i was a

183
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:10,240
parent of young children especially it felt was much more acute than where uh it just i didn't feel so

184
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:16,240
important i was willing to put aside all kinds of personal needs because it just seemed like the

185
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:22,960
importance of this child this little baby couldn't take care of itself was so much more important and there was

186
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:30,240
this uh wonderful feeling a healthy feeling uh most of the time in this kind of just

187
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:38,079
giving myself over giving myself you know up in a certain kind of way for the welfare of this other person and

188
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:43,440
um and uh in some ways i when it was done well i felt that you know

189
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,560
it wasn't because i was trying to benefit myself but i could feel this was really good

190
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:53,599
when i did it uh in a ways that were unhealthy then it would come back and bite me and

191
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:59,520
it would you know didn't really work but this idea of a parent protecting

192
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,720
their child now it isn't that we're supposed to risk our lives protect

193
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:10,720
all other beings in this text at least but rather it's that kind of letting go of self

194
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:16,560
this boundless this is lots of space for doing the inclusive of others in our

195
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:22,240
hearts that that we're cultivating

196
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:27,440
in doing loving-kindness practice we're developing not only through loving-kindness but i think through

197
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:34,160
the path of liberation is a path that we're in the mind the heart is no longer as

198
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:42,640
i've been saying today limited contracted preoccupied um resistant shut down closed off

199
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:48,720
it's just completely open and receptive and and like a open window the wind can wind

200
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:55,119
can just go right through or the kids baseball that they're playing outside won't break the

201
00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:02,160
glass because it just goes right through and so

202
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:08,000
to cultivate that and cultivate as a very powerful word because it doesn't mean that we're

203
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:14,800
supposed to do it automatically and that you're bad if you don't it means that there's practice you practice

204
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:21,200
it you practice and practice and practice this is what we're working towards and

205
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:26,400
and it's not and more we practice the more we're moving in this direction

206
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:32,560
if the practice has a quality to it or parts of it is

207
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:38,880
this openness is this relaxing this receptivity this not getting tight and not getting forceful

208
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:45,119
not getting all kinds of unwholesome movements of needing and wanting and expecting and

209
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:50,640
pushing away but rather it really has a quality that as we do the practice

210
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:58,800
something is opening something is releasing something's making more room there's more and more room for things

211
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:04,960
when people become mature in buddhist practice their mind has lots of room

212
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:12,800
for things infinite room and sometimes you can feel that spaciousness in others because their

213
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:18,400
mind doesn't move as much you don't you don't find them you don't see the mind jumping around or you

214
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:26,880
don't see the agitation or the restlessness or the or the deflecting or the turning away

215
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,960
there's an openness and a quiet a willing just be there in a kind of open stillness

216
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:39,200
in that maturity with loving kindness for the whole world

217
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:45,280
should one cultivate a boundless heart so this is the you know the upper reaches of

218
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:51,119
real loving kindness certainly in the privacy of our meditation

219
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:57,040
alone it's easy to love everyone or relatively easy to love everyone and to

220
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:02,960
feel like universal love is a great thing but it's when we really run into people and are working with

221
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:09,680
people and and engaging in people and sharing lives with people that the idea of loving all beings

222
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:15,440
sometimes just gets lost and it gets you know recedes from importance because of the drama and the

223
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,960
preoccupations and the importance and the irritation and the injustice of whatever

224
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,318
is happening in the moment with

225
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:31,359
and so the idea of cultivating a boundless heart

226
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:36,480
with loving kindness for the whole world is the direction we're going

227
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,400
but to do that is not only learning how to let go a lot but it's also learning how to be wise

228
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:49,440
and have street smarts about how that is expressed and how to live in this world that's so complicated and difficult

229
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:55,760
and how to live it and live it in a safe way in a wise way and in a so

230
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:01,119
that we can have this boundless loving kindness um we don't want to do boundless loving

231
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:06,800
kindness and be naive in a certain kind of way easily

232
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:13,920
victimized by what goes on around us cultivate a boundless heart with loving

233
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:19,040
kindness for the whole world should one cultivate a boundless heart above

234
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:25,599
below and all around without obstruction without hate and without the ill will so this

235
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:30,720
obstructions ways and mind is limited the the two that are really

236
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:38,400
big in relationship to our capacity for love is hate and ill will big words

237
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:44,560
but they have a very they can have very subtle manifestations and sometimes it's the

238
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:50,160
subtlest manifestations that are really the cutting edge the growing edge of our practice

239
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:58,480
so even the subtle ways we don't overlook we don't um say doesn't matter

240
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:06,240
and you know or you know just easier just to go ahead and do it and and but you know even the subtlest forms

241
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:12,640
of hate and ill will to find out how to live without those obstructions without

242
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:20,160
those limitations so cultivating a boundless heart above below and all around

243
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:26,640
uh uh some people experience this as a kind of irradiance

244
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:32,640
a glow a warmth some people has a sense of light that's not really light but that's the

245
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:39,200
closest the clarity the openness that feels like it's a radiating light and

246
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:45,680
and this idea of radiance loving kindness is based on the idea of

247
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:51,520
an intention but that intention doesn't have to be a mental exercise we keep saying words of

248
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:58,880
may all beings be happy the words are can be useful but uh as a practice as the

249
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:05,040
heart gets more and more boundless it becomes more of a glow more of a

250
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:13,040
clarity more of a openness that we can feel that goes out in all directions 360

251
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:18,560
degrees all around is the attention it's not focused narrowly on something and

252
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:24,480
only that but it's opened up 360 degrees with the kindness with the goodwill with

253
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:31,920
the friendliness with the radiance this glow of kindness above below and all around

254
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:40,160
it's phenomenal the human capacity to dwell in love to dwell in

255
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:45,599
good will to dwell in kindness and friendliness it's

256
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:52,480
phenomenal that we can kind of have that be the predominant mood the predominant field of attention

257
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:58,079
the predominant flow of concern that we have

258
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:05,520
and and to be integrated and harmonized and all of us kind of all of us kind of centered in

259
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:11,920
in meta is a phenomenal capacity that we should be

260
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:18,000
born this way to have this capacity is just fantastic and it's a capacity we can cultivate and

261
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,119
develop and grow and sometimes it's done intentionally doing

262
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:28,880
meta practice and sometimes it's a byproduct of just doing mindfulness practice

263
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:35,680
as a mindfulness frees us from the limitations of the mind we can begin to recognize

264
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:42,319
that in fact living in our hearts waiting for us has been love has been

265
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:47,599
good will and then it's a matter of making more space for it

266
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:52,640
just as you make space for more people in your heart you make more space in your heart

267
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:58,240
for your love so thank you and then we also have one more talk on

268
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:05,839
this tomorrow
