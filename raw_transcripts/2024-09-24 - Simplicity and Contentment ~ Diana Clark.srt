1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:06,720
good evening welcome

2
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:15,679
welcome so tonight I'd like to talk a little bit about um something that I

3
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:22,119
often I'm pointing to in indirect ways or multiple ways and here's yet maybe

4
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:28,960
another way this has some overlap of some other teachings I've been

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,079
doing but this idea of that this um

6
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,239
possibility of this deep sense of not

7
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,520
being agitated this comforting sense of not

8
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,280
being agitated and there's like so many ways in which we're agitated without

9
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,039
really even noticing it in fact we might just think that's just the normal way of

10
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:02,559
being but it's so common just to have this sense of like there's got to be

11
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:08,240
something better let me go find it you know this like whatever it is you know

12
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,759
like yeah okay whatever is happening yeah where's this this something better

13
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:20,439
that's in the next moment maybe we're not even sure what exactly it is that we're looking for we

14
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:26,079
just have this sense that whatever we're experiencing right now it ain't it that

15
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:31,560
somehow you know doesn't measure up to some of the ideas that we have

16
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:38,399
about what practice is about what happiness is about what uh peace and

17
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:44,560
well-being is about whatever we're experiencing now we often have this

18
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,840
feeling that uh it's not here and

19
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,479
implicit in that is this agitation that might be so familiar that we don't even

20
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:04,159
notice it and it's not until we maybe have some deep meditative experiences or

21
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:10,599
something that that we start to recognize like oh wow compared to that amount of Stillness I see how the way

22
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:16,280
that I'm moving through the world and walking around has has this uh sense of

23
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,760
tumbling forward all the time or tumbling into or distracting or

24
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:29,400
diverting ourselves or our attention all the time so the Buddhist teachings they do

25
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:37,319
point to there's like this deep uh sense this deep meaningful sense of

26
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:41,879
okayness which does not sound

27
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:49,440
glamorous kind of sounds like what you know okayness but there's a way in which we

28
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:56,200
can understand this as maybe as a different type of happiness because when we use this word

29
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:02,519
happiness not in the Buddhist sense but just in the usual way that we think about this there's

30
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:09,120
often this happiness is associated with uh getting what one wants that that's

31
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,640
that's that'll make us happy so part of this agitation is just be able to get what we want whether that's a material

32
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:21,200
object or some experience or something

33
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,920
something but instead there's this type of Happiness that's we might say that's

34
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:33,760
a contentment and it's really different than the happiness that uh we often is

35
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:40,120
spoken about in um contemporary times these days about getting what you want

36
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:46,480
whereas contentment is about not wanting it's about not

37
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,799
wanting because have you noticed that as soon as you get something that you want you know how long does that

38
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:59,040
last not very long right and then then there's the next thing like just because

39
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:06,799
you have this fantastic perfect cup of coffee very satisfying it's really great

40
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,120
you're going to want another one soon right the next day or whatever it's not

41
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:19,000
like we finally get satisfied as soon as we get things that we want it's not like oh I never need to have ice cream

42
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,040
again I never need to you know have a new phone or you know whatever I might

43
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:31,160
be so this contentment that's being pointed to is instead just this the not

44
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:38,400
wanting which is pointing to the absence of a sense of lack no longer having a sense of you

45
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:45,320
know something's missing I need more and so to clarify this contentment

46
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,919
it's not a sense of complacency or it's not a sense of just

47
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:57,639
tolerating or resignation or it's not a sense of like okay I guess I'll be I'll

48
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:02,919
be okay with this because I can't get what I really want okay I'll be okay

49
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:08,960
with this and nor is it just like passively accepting everything that's here kind of

50
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:15,720
like a way in that we can be like disconnected from our experience and like okay yeah this is fine and it's

51
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:23,280
fine because we're kind of disconnected we've like uh in tumed ourselves a little bit uh kind of surrounded

52
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:30,400
ourselves with this cottony kind of uh bumper so that thing bounce off us or

53
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:36,160
something like this and then I want to say also that

54
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:44,520
contentment um I can feel like a booby prize can feel like yeah okay if I can't

55
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:52,039
have the fireworks knock your socks off kind of experience okay I guess I have

56
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,520
contentment and more specifically if you have this idea that like you really um

57
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:04,240
want to have something like you just this strong sense of lacking that you need things this whole notion of

58
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:11,080
contentment can be horrifying like what no no no no I don't want to get rid of this sense of there

59
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:19,160
needs to be something more and there's a way in which without our even noticing it we could have this just sense of

60
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:25,440
inadequacy we could have this sense of being insufficient in some

61
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,599
way and so there's a way that wanting more not only does it distract us from

62
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:37,599
this terrible feeling of inadequacy but it also kind of like uh

63
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:42,759
gives up something to a promise of yeah yeah yeah okay this

64
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:48,360
feeling is going to go away as soon as I get something so this contentment is

65
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,919
like putting aside the way of getting something it's horrifying because then

66
00:06:53,919 --> 00:07:01,560
we have to put away the idea that I'll be fine later just as soon as I get

67
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:09,039
something attain something achieve something do something stop doing something something like that that can

68
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:15,319
be scary like wait you mean this current version of

69
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:21,240
myself can be okay this can be really like having to

70
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,479
put aside the self-improvement project and say no no no I'm fine just

71
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:32,560
this way can feel uncomfortable in itself so instead we're just tumbling forward into

72
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,199
this always looking or maybe you know different people and different seasons

73
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:43,479
of life and maybe have different intensities maybe you're not somebody that's feeling like okay I got to get

74
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:49,520
more maybe it's more like get away from me this kind of

75
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,720
feeling and if we have this we're accustomed to like grumbling and

76
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:01,199
complaining like this shouldn't be like that and that shouldn't be like this and I got to fix this world World fix this

77
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:07,120
environment then this idea of contentment can feel like a failure like

78
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:15,479
oh but everything's still you know it's not perfect out there in a sense of contentment of just

79
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:21,919
saying well things are okay but if we're filled with aversion

80
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:28,159
towards people them those people over there that are making all the problems

81
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:33,760
them you know them if we have kind of like that sense then

82
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:40,320
maybe there's a way like no no no I can't be content because then that lets those people off the hook and they

83
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,000
shouldn't be let off the hook they need to be fly right and shape up and do what

84
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,519
they should do and maybe it's hard to put down those ideas maybe there's a way

85
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:59,959
in which we're kind of identified not kind of we are identified with there's us over here or doing what's right right

86
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:07,560
and there's them over there who are doing what's not right it can be hard to put that

87
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,600
down it can be hard to kind of put down the way that we kind of like bolster

88
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:19,000
ourselves up that we're us over here on the right side so we can learn something about

89
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,399
ourselves about how much we dislike this idea of contentment like yeah okay it

90
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,880
sounds good Diana but later we'll do it later some other time

91
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:36,440
that's certainly how I thought about it like oh yeah okay but first I have to fix this and take care of that achieve

92
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:43,200
this you know there this kind of this list of things so part of the teachings of

93
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,680
course is that uh I'm saying of course because this shows up in so many different

94
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:54,519
ways is that uh what supports contentment are you know certain causes

95
00:09:54,519 --> 00:10:00,640
and conditions of course it's not like just you know contentment arises out of

96
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:07,440
magic nothing arises out of magic there's things that flow for a

97
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,920
reason and so what are some of these things that can support contentment like maybe right now there might be this

98
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:20,279
sense of H okay this deep sense of contentment this deep sense of nothing's

99
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:26,959
wrong everything's just fine nothing needs to happen nothing and if something

100
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,560
happens that's okay too so there are some of these conditions

101
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:38,800
that support that and what are some of these conditions well maybe I'll say something

102
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:45,079
like this um something that I appreciate about the Buddhist teachings is like we're not being asked to just adopt a

103
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:50,560
bunch of beliefs here just you know believe this and you'll be fine don't

104
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,040
ask too many questions just believe this instead there's a real encouragement for

105
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:04,920
us to discover for ourselves for us to practice for ourselves to have experiences for

106
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:10,720
ourselves and it takes a certain amount of maybe I'll use this word faith to even like do the practices so you can

107
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:19,040
have the experiences but there's this encouragement to okay for us to find for

108
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:26,880
oursel what are some of the things that lead to contentment what are some of the activities thought patterns that really

109
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:33,800
support a sense of ease support a sense of Freedom support a sense of

110
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,040
well-being so there's this like invitation for us to investigate and to

111
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:46,200
discover for ourselves and I'll give you some

112
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:52,120
hints Simplicity Simplicity supports

113
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:57,480
contentment we can if we think about it kind of makes sense right to just put

114
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:04,320
down some of the agitation that arises when that there's some busyness or too

115
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:10,160
much or agitation or something like this some Simplicity really supports

116
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:18,079
contentment and I'll talk more about that but first I want to share a little poem I'm on the streak with poems these

117
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:25,399
days so here's a a poem by Rosemary traumer it's called

118
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:31,720
ambition it's called ambition I'm a person news you I wouldn't in the past

119
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,880
called I wouldn't have characterized myself this way but now looking back I

120
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:43,279
can see where I've had a lot of ambition or you know I wanted to do

121
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:49,880
something and you know that's works until it doesn't because it seems like there's

122
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:56,160
never an end at least for this person here it seemed like oh it was just one thing after another to U go out there

123
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:03,639
and get and Attain so here's Rosemary trummer's poem called

124
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:16,000
ambition I am so far from the woman I want to be so far from humility and

125
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,160
simplicity I dream of clearing not only the shelves not only the closets but

126
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:26,800
also the cluttered inner rooms that crowd out the

127
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:34,680
Divine every day I search for ways to best meet the day with poems beautiful

128
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:41,399
meals with songs with praise so many ways to be

129
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:48,760
radiant but I suspect all the day wants is for me to

130
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:56,759
meet it and all that comes into my path with kindness and

131
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:02,959
spaciousness in my effort to be good good to be whole I make it so difficult

132
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:10,399
this life the day doesn't seem to hold my exuberance against me it shows up as

133
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,590
always generous as a new tomorrow quiet as

134
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:21,199
[Music] Dawn so I appreciate in this poem this

135
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:26,560
opening line I am so far from the woman I want to be just kind of what I'm

136
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:33,959
pointing to this sense of however I am is not enough not good

137
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:39,800
enough in some kind of way and this is like just the

138
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:47,199
opening sense of like whatever I'm doing it's not right and this uh

139
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:52,959
agitation it brings some complications as some of these complications are just

140
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:59,480
because we're trying to distract ourselves from this feeling of it's not quite right

141
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:06,600
and you know that Buddha was pointing to this right to the the truth of Dua and I'd like to say this is Dua this feeling

142
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,600
of whatever I'm doing it's not quite

143
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,880
right and then in this poem Rosemary traumer includes this line every day I

144
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:26,920
search for ways to best meet the day again this like this agitation of

145
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:33,160
searching instead of just being with what the day is

146
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:41,120
offering and she includes in my effort to be good to be whole I make it so

147
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:50,000
difficult this life so she's uh the poet here is recognizing this uh that we

148
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,600
are there maybe this agitation that we we make things more complicated so often

149
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,000
than they need to be this trying to make it be better just

150
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:11,319
ends up complicating so much in obvious ways and not so obvious

151
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:17,519
ways so what was what would it be like to keep things

152
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:23,759
simple keep things simple we could say that uh there's a pow

153
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:31,519
Nama that um is a can be translated as simply licity there's other translations

154
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:39,480
for it as well but we could say it's uh Simplicity and it's a one of the parames

155
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,800
it's one of the um pract one of the qualities to

156
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,279
develop as a support for awakening that's associated that when it

157
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:57,399
uh becomes ripe is really a support for awakening so what does it mean to have

158
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:04,160
Simplicity I'll offer are some things but again the encouragement is just for you to answer this question for yourself

159
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:13,160
what does it mean for you to have some Simplicity what are some of the ways in which your life seems complicated

160
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,240
unnecessarily so one is maybe keeping our external life

161
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:25,520
simple not being too busy this is kind of right it's kind of

162
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,559
a funny thing for me to be saying this because I have spent years very busy

163
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:36,799
doing this and that and the other thing and real you know realizing that there's

164
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:42,880
a it didn't give me the kind of like the space to just allow things to

165
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:50,160
unfold the other day I was in downtown U Redwood City just running an

166
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:57,600
errand and uh went to get into my car the car doesn't

167
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:04,440
start you you know I have triaa call triaa love this

168
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:10,720
organization reliably come and help you with whatever it is that's happening with your car but there was a time in my

169
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:16,720
life I'm like oh no I have a meeting and so it's and such a time and you know how is this going to happen and I to take

170
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:23,360
care of this and get this done but you know I have a little bit more space in my life so I didn't have to get

171
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,799
complicated into like oh my goodness my all these things that I had to do and

172
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:35,039
doesn't mean I'm a bad person because I scheduled things too closely and now I'm going to have to do this you know this

173
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:40,760
all the stories that can happen it's like well I guess I'm going to

174
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:46,559
wait and I'm going to practice a little bit just meditate here in this parking

175
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,720
garage why not the W the weather was okay you know

176
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:57,400
it wasn't like unbearably hot or unbearably cold so so there's this way

177
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:03,000
in which just is there way as much as our life allows us to have some space

178
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,120
not to be too busy because there's a way in which

179
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:13,640
being busy is also just a cover up for this sense of inadequacy that we might

180
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:18,960
have this sense of insufficiency I got to do more I got to do

181
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,760
more so then there's something else about Simplicity is to keep our

182
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:30,679
environment you know clutter free as best we

183
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:36,880
can this way the complications are often that's well I I need this object okay

184
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,919
I'll get this here or oh yeah I need to take care of that and then oh yeah I

185
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:47,320
want to remember to do this but before I do that I have to take care of this and that's so okay so I better keep

186
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:55,080
everything on my desk so I don't forget and this is what happens for me and then my desk ends up with all this stuff and

187
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:00,280
uh starts to feel a little bit overwhelming

188
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:08,640
so there a way to keep our environment simple we don't need so much

189
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,760
stuff as I've mentioned a number of times I've done a lot of retreat practice and for me something that's

190
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:19,400
been really powerful about Retreat practice is just how simple it

191
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:25,640
is you know and I've lived months in just a small little room with just a few

192
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:31,400
things and been very happy you don't have to make so many decisions what am I going to wear well

193
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:38,400
there's not so many choices what am I going to do not so many choices what am I going to eat not so many choices and

194
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:46,240
there's something that there's this sense of Freedom about that it feels like ah turns out to be a

195
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:53,039
relief so Simplicity is you know what we do with our time what we do with our

196
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:58,360
space just something for us to think about how the way that it's not simple

197
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:04,520
is often an expression of this quiet agitation and then it's agitating to see

198
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:09,159
the expression of agitation in those

199
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:17,000
ways and it's also can be interesting to notice like if there's this hesitation like oh I don't want to clean up I can't

200
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,120
clean up or something like this to notice I noticed this recently when I

201
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:27,960
was a cleaning out a closet it's like oh yeah if I really

202
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:33,880
donate this then I'm really acknowledging that I'm no longer

203
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:39,120
the person that's going to do this particular activity that took all this

204
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,200
equipment is that right like but I liked being that person that was doing all

205
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:50,960
that activity that took all that equipment but am I really still that person and it was just kind of something

206
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:58,760
to say like you know no I'm at a different season of my life now and sometimes it's hard to to say nope just

207
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:05,320
is you know my life is going this direction and to say goodbye to yeah you know that was a particular season of my

208
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:10,559
life and now maybe somebody else can use this

209
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:19,760
equipment so what else about Simplicity support simplicities you might notice

210
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,880
that just being present for this

211
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:30,039
moment pretty simple the just feel the pressure

212
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:35,400
against the body and what you're sitting on pretty

213
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:42,400
straightforward feel our feet on the ground it doesn't have to be

214
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:50,080
complicated our practice can be about being embodied partly because it interrupts

215
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,880
the momentum of all the mind it just because this is where all the complications are right the lack of

216
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:01,640
contentment it's in the mind the body is just doing what bodies

217
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:07,880
do it's the mind that's putting on top of an experience saying this isn't

218
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:13,200
okay this has to be different The Experience itself is just the

219
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:19,919
experience it might be uncomfortable it might be very

220
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:26,520
uncomfortable but this is what it means to have a human body means that sometimes it's

221
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:33,880
uncomfortable and the mind likes put on top oh no no no no this is going to this is terrible what does this mean and I

222
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:40,880
have to you know maybe there's a long uh story associated with it if only that

223
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:47,520
thing didn't happen before if only I had remembered to do this or now I have

224
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:53,880
people are going to if I adjust my posture then I'm not going to look like I'm a good meditator and but I need to

225
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:59,400
adjust my posture and but maybe my knee's going to fall off if I don't or

226
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:08,440
you know whatever it might be so what is it to just be

227
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,720
embodied and one way to think about this is to

228
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:19,919
just be present for our bodies when we're moving more specifically when we're

229
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:25,840
walking this is something that we do you know those of us who can walk if you

230
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:35,880
can't walk the other ways in which you're mobile or if you're not mobile the ways that uh you are able to move in

231
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:43,960
some kind of way whatever movement one does is can we bring mindfulness to the

232
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:51,840
experience of moving it doesn't have to be anything like takes additional time and it can

233
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:58,600
start with walking it can start with uh feeling the like how the body feels as

234
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:04,120
it moves through space and this is like such a vague thing to say as the body

235
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:09,720
feels as it moves through space like what does that mean and the invitation

236
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:15,679
here is to discover for yourself what does it feel like to be

237
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:21,159
moving cuz so often we're not present when we're moving because the mind is on

238
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:27,799
where we're going I got to go to the kitchen to make sure all the contents in there are just

239
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:33,000
fine all the contents in the refrigerator are still there sometimes

240
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,960
that feels like I'm like opening up the refrigerator like now why am I doing this close it

241
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:46,640
again so this can be really helpful if you are walking noticing the pressure on

242
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:52,520
the bottom of the feet notice maybe the uh feeling of

243
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:58,919
clothing moving against the body any times that you're moving this doesn't mean doing anything

244
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:07,840
slowly we're just doing it at the same time but just doing it in a more embodied way sensitive way being tuned

245
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:13,080
into the experience that we're having it

246
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:20,480
might be very mundane it might be boring seemingly but it turns out to be really

247
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:27,480
interesting and there it brings a sense of aliveness to our experience to really be

248
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:35,760
embodied instead of a sense of Life passing Us by we start to feel like we're really

249
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:43,480
present so is this way that we can just be with the

250
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:49,480
Simplicity of the moment of having a

251
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:56,200
body and maybe I want to say that I'm not saying that you have to be mindful

252
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:01,919
for every step that you take for the remainder of your life I'm just saying

253
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:09,640
just start with one step a few steps and set this as an intention maybe the five

254
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:14,799
steps that it takes to go down the hall to the bathroom or

255
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:22,000
something like this it's this turns out to be simple

256
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,880
that maybe the difficult part is just remembering to do it but we can remember it the more often we do it so just an

257
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,480
encouragement to just be embodied for movement however you're

258
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:41,200
moving and then as a support for Simplicity it's also a support to look

259
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:47,320
about to look at well what is making it not be simple what is complicated like

260
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:53,240
what's complications and if we really look at

261
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:58,480
it as I said earlier it's about what's actually happening in the mind

262
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,679
the mind is making things complicated there's this notice we could

263
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:11,240
feel into when there's these extra elaborations Beyond just the bodily

264
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:18,279
experience the way that there the thinking has like expanded into um this

265
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:25,240
uh Buddhist word that I really like papancha maybe some of you have heard this maybe

266
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:31,960
papancha it's just just I just like to say it Poncha it just means that like

267
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:37,600
elaboration and just kind of going on and on and on in thoughts this idea of

268
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:43,720
like oh okay well as soon as I get home I got to remember that um to make my

269
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:49,000
lunch for tomorrow and what should I have tomorrow well there's peanut butter and jelly yeah but I had that last week

270
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,000
and you know peanut butter this person over here said that they like creamy peanut butter but then chunky is really

271
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,799
better I'm sure it is and oh yeah the bread you know just how we just start to go on

272
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:08,519
and so there's this way that there's ordinary thinking that's

273
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:14,640
just an ordinary part of life but then there's this extra kind of like the the

274
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:20,720
elaboration that we're doing and sometimes we do need to elaborate we need to solve a problem we need to plan

275
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:27,600
we need to figure things out that is part of our ordinary lives and so part of this practice is

276
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:34,000
noticing when have we slipped into what's extra when have we

277
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,519
rehearsed you know for the fifth 50th 500th

278
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:45,960
time that conversation we're going to have the next time we see that person or the thing that we're trying to remember

279
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:51,679
just saying it over and over again or replaying how that person didn't treat

280
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,679
us respectfully or something like that

281
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:04,880
so just to notice when we're lost in thought and a thought that's just feels

282
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:10,919
like it's just ongoing and then in a simple relaxed

283
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:17,519
wave just to come back to the B embodied experience much like we're doing in a

284
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:22,799
meditation practice but this in daily life is just a relaxed easy kind of

285
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:29,240
flowing with what's going without this pressure of having to stay on the

286
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:36,320
object it's more just an encouragement to feel embodied and if you're embodied you also

287
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:43,200
notice what does the body feel like when the mind is busy with papancha you'll

288
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:49,679
start to feel this kind of like slight maybe like this tightness or this agitation sometimes there can be this uh

289
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:54,158
leaning forward that happens with the

290
00:30:56,279 --> 00:31:01,840
Pancha so maybe there's this I'll summarized by an

291
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:09,159
end here with this there's this invitation in this practice of what it's pointing to is this greater ease and

292
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:16,639
Peace and Freedom and contentment this ending of things this

293
00:31:16,639 --> 00:31:24,039
idea of things need to be different this ending of wanting something different to

294
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:29,159
be this subtle sense of agitation

295
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:35,480
and then a support for this contentment is Simplicity and then we could just think

296
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:40,799
for ourselves discover for ourselves what does that mean for all of

297
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:48,720
us maybe it's uh letting go of that idea of was it inbox of

298
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:55,240
zero and not getting agitated maybe just choosing to about the number of emails that were in the Inbox and do something

299
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:02,399
skillful with them but uh you know not uh feeling agitated by them or maybe

300
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:08,000
it's wor looking at your environment and saying you know maybe I can tidy up here

301
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,559
when we do a meditation Retreats online maybe some of you have attended

302
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:18,960
them but um we even like put a time for people to straighten up their practice

303
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:24,559
area just because we recognize it's really a way to kind of like honor and

304
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:30,399
respect your experience like okay I'm just going to make a space here that's going to be where I practice and I'm

305
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:36,080
going to be intentional about it so Simplicity can be with our

306
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:44,760
physical things external things out there but it also can be and a support for it can be being

307
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:51,240
embodied which turns out to be pretty simple and then of course not being

308
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:57,840
embodied is being lost in thought which papancha so can we notice when we're

309
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:04,919
lost in thought and instead come just be to the Simplicity of the body which supports this sense of contentment this

310
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:11,760
sense of peace and ease and well-being then maybe I'll close with uh

311
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,039
reading this poem

312
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:26,600
again poem is ambition by Rosemary trummer I am so far from the woman I

313
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:32,760
want to be so far from humility and

314
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:37,960
simplicity I dream of clearing not only the shelves not only the closets but

315
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:44,480
also the cluttered inner rooms that crowd out the

316
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:52,080
Divine every day I search for ways to best meet the day with poems beautiful

317
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:59,120
meals with songs with praise so many ways to be ra

318
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:08,158
but I suspect all the day wants is for me to meet it and and all that comes

319
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:15,398
into my path with kindness with spaciousness in my effort to be good to

320
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:23,079
be whole I make it so difficult this life the day doesn't seem to hold my

321
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:30,200
exuberance against me it shows up as always generous as a new tomorrow quiet

322
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:37,358
as Dawn so thank you and now I'll open it

323
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:41,638
up for some questions and comments

324
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,760
thanks I think we have a comment back

325
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:03,079
here so isn't a c amount of wanting healthy I mean why else would we deal with graduate school um you know things

326
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:09,280
like that things that I mean you know have to go to graduate school but you don't even have to go to college but

327
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:15,160
isn't there a certain amount of wanting in life healthy yeah so this is part of the art

328
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:20,240
of practice is to recognize what is the healthy wanting and what is the wanting

329
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:25,480
that's coming out of a sense of inadequacy what is the going to graduate

330
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:31,640
school going to college or whatever it might be um a sense of yeah this is the next right thing to do and somehow it

331
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:37,599
just comes from a sense of happiness and ease as opposed to like oh I got to

332
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:44,000
prove myself and here's one way to prove myself or something like that but I mean college is so stressful I mean it was

333
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,920
for me anyway you know just dealing with the deadlines and the papers and the test and you have to I had to really

334
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:56,280
push myself to even stay I mean so if it seems like if I didn't want it I might have just oh what the heck I'll just you

335
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:02,280
know drop out yeah I I can see this is part of the um

336
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:08,079
maybe one's life is to recognize okay what effort is even though it's uncomfortable is worth enduring and

337
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:14,400
finding a way and what effort isn't and this is so much about I would say kind of our life is figuring out what is

338
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:20,920
worth uh putting that effort for yeah yeah and what isn't and often in college

339
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:27,800
you know we're young at that age and uh we kind of are just often doing it because Society are supporting us maybe

340
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:34,599
it's a good thing turns out to be a good thing but um as we kind of like mature in our lives and mature in spiritual

341
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:42,319
life we can uh be more sensitive to like what is what's really being born out of

342
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:50,760
uh a love for what is and what's being born out of trying to just make myself

343
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:58,920
feel better instead of and not addressing the underlying sense of inadequacy or something like that

344
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:06,519
yeah thank you anybody else have a comment or

345
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,920
question thanks going off of that question you you mentioned that it's

346
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:23,680
it's up to the practice use the practice to identify what is something that you'd

347
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:29,400
like to achieve for your own sake versus because of an in in adequacies so with

348
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:35,760
what you said how do you use the practice to be able to identify that like through meditation like at a

349
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:43,319
microscopic level in this inside tradition how do you use the practice to identify that yeah get familiar with

350
00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:49,160
what agitation feels like just like in all the gross and subtle ways you know

351
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:57,200
the obvious and subtle ways and then just start to notice like oh yeah this is agitating this isn't and and then

352
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:02,560
what has the opposite of agitation would be like ease and getting more um

353
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:08,000
sensitive to like oh yeah this is more easeful and part of how we do that is to

354
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,880
be embodied because often the agitation and the ease is showing up and like

355
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:21,480
whether we're having our shoulders up like this or you know or we maybe our postures were leaning forward uh all the

356
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:28,920
time or or maybe we're kind of like this or something I'm exaggerating to show this but there's a way in which being

357
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:36,240
embodied we can really notice um what what what is seg more agitating and

358
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:42,520
what's more easeful so and then maybe there's

359
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:51,800
um so your question was how can we know which way

360
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:57,240
is what was precisely your question yeah yeah like how do we identify it with

361
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:02,400
with the practice like how how does a practice help us identify those you know

362
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:08,200
when it whether it falls under goals that are healthy versus hey I'm doing this because I feel inadequate like how

363
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:16,480
does a practice help us get to that point yeah so one was sorry so thank you for reminding me uh get really familiar

364
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:22,000
with agitation and its opposite and get familiar with this feeling of inadequacy

365
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,800
if it's there and is there a way that uh we can

366
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:33,359
nurture and honor and respect and take care of that feeling in such a way that

367
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:40,240
it feels seen and that it feels taken care of and so that it can heal itself

368
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:46,839
that it can um I'll use that language heal itself or something like that so that's

369
00:39:46,839 --> 00:39:52,240
the second thing is to you know just get to know like oh yeah here's that

370
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:59,960
familiar feeling that I'm uh not good enough or insufficient or inadequate or whatever words uh that we have for it

371
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:06,640
and um and can we be okay with it because it's not going to go away by just by chasing you know doing more and

372
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:14,160
more more things it's more about uh it's um it's about honoring and respecting

373
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:21,280
it is a way in which it can soften and go away and get integrated as opposed to

374
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:28,200
being something that's quietly pushing us around in our life quietly fueling

375
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:34,280
like so much as that we do and the way that we show up is is this helpful yeah

376
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,440
thank

377
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:51,240
you I might add that this is getting to know that feeling of inadequacy is often

378
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:57,640
precisely what we don't want to do I'll just add that right because so much that

379
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:05,200
distracting and diverting and busyness and all this kind of stuff is a way for us to really not be with that feeling

380
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:11,319
and so you know there's ways in which different ways in which we might

381
00:41:11,319 --> 00:41:17,960
do that one could be in a meditative setting maybe a therapeutic setting is appropriate or I mean there's maybe

382
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:23,960
there's with friends or family or I there's different ways to approach that but I just kind of want to acknowledge

383
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:30,720
I'm just s like I get to know that sense of inadequacy it's it's there's a usually a lot of uh

384
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:37,760
resistance to this lot of resistance for us to get to know

385
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:49,599
that and then maybe I'll just add one more thing you guys don't mind right I'll

386
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:56,640
just do a whole another darat talk here um a number of years ago if it's helpful

387
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:03,079
I did a series on the inner critic um with a happy hour which was

388
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:11,119
something that um happens online Monday through Friday at 6: PM so on uh this

389
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:16,960
YouTube channel and I did I don't know how many 15 20 something like little

390
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:24,960
talks about uh working with the inner critic and it was in the context of using some uh Brahma vajar practice some

391
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:30,040
of the like the heart practices with it so that also can be we can like do

392
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:35,599
particular practices that support some equinity and support having a sense of

393
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:40,760
uh well-being and compassion for some of the difficulties and stuff like that so

394
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:46,920
I'm just offering this that there's some resources out there if people are interested in

395
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:53,119
this I think I did a 7 a.m. series also on the inner critic so you can you can

396
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:59,119
find stuff there's not just me there's lots of people doing stuff on that

397
00:43:04,839 --> 00:43:11,960
okay well may you have an okay

398
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:18,079
evening thank you wishing you all a wonderful night byebye
