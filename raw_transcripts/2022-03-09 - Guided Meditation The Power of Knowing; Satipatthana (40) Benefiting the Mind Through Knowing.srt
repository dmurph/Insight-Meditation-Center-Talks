1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:08,160
so hello everyone my warm greetings and

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,960
my best wishes for all of you for your meditation i hope that

3
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:22,160
you find your meditation to be settling for you beneficial for you

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,560
and that it's inspiring for you to be meditating with uh in community many other people

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,800
meditating at the same time today and

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,559
there are many ways to benefit from meditation for mindfulness meditation one of the

7
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:47,520
ways does not require anything to be any different it doesn't require us to come somehow

8
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,719
become more settled or calm doesn't require us to dispel certain states of mind or ways of

9
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,840
being which are unpleasant to have difficult to have

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,080
but one way is to begin appreciating the simple act of knowing

11
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,880
that it can be so simple innocent and so such a common

12
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,960
part of everyday life to know there's a door when we see a door and a door handle and opening

13
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,720
the door and we know all these things you know myriad things all the time

14
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,840
that but we seldom find the full fruition or full value of

15
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:39,520
a of a clear moment of knowing where knowing something anything at all

16
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:47,040
is a miracle it's an amazing thing that the mind can do that somehow out of the cosmic soup

17
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,560
there evolved living beings that could have concepts ideas

18
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,399
perceptions that can uh then perceptions can be had and

19
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:04,159
moments of cognition can be experienced where we know oh that is a door

20
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:11,120
that's an itch that's an inhale that's an exhale and now it's and as i describe this it

21
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,200
might not still seem such a wonderful thing but as knowing

22
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:24,319
begins to become simplified or purified and the knowing stands out by itself as

23
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:32,160
its own clarity its own kind of where the knowing is independent of what is known

24
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,640
so if someone has uh something that i want and i'm caught up in wanting and i know

25
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,720
what the object is maybe they have ice cream or something and i want the ice cream and

26
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,720
and so i've recognized this ice cream but the wanting kind of is all over the place my mind is swirling with thoughts

27
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,000
about how i can manage to get it but

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,800
and our knowing is often interspersed with or connected with our desires our aversions our confusions all kinds of

29
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,120
things our commentary our history our memory but when knowing it becomes simple

30
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,680
really really simple there's no baggage with it it begins to feel special

31
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,040
there's a kind of peace in it there's a kind of ease in it there's a kind of

32
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,480
freedom to be found in the knowing and this is one of the

33
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,879
kind of inner dimensions of this mindfulness practice that

34
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:39,599
once we once we can appreciate this the practice opens up in a very different way and so rather than needing to change

35
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,799
anything change ourselves it's uh

36
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,080
appreciating more and more knowing what's happening

37
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,760
and so the cliche or the little saying is that the inside practice is less about

38
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,439
having new experiences as it is about seeing in a new way

39
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,480
so this knowing so i'll do a little exercise

40
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,480
about this kind of knowing maybe help you kind of appreciate how simple and

41
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:21,120
clear and it can be and then and of course the meditation will apply that to the mind

42
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,960
so assuming a meditation posture

43
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,600
and gently closing the eyes

44
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,840
and taking a few moments to settle in

45
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,800
quietly whatever way you like taking in some deep breaths

46
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,960
relaxing whatever way that you want to do it

47
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:12,479
and then a little exercise in knowing find a sensation in your body

48
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:19,520
that is pretty neutral it could be sensations of your hand if that's neutral or

49
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,680
maybe there's some contact of your foot to grants against your mat your floor

50
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:32,880
something that's relatively maybe the temperature of your body

51
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:40,800
something that's not particularly pleasant particularly unpleasant something where you can kind of

52
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,478
not have too much of a reaction to

53
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,160
and then let yourself become aware of this sensation

54
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:04,800
notice if there's any attitude of being either for or against it or

55
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,520
questioning and wondering what this exercise is about

56
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:20,319
resisting it or a little bit irritated to do an exercise

57
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,520
or eager to explore it and figure out what's going on here

58
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,919
and see if you can let go of all that maybe in an exhale

59
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,960
relax all the ideas and attitudes about

60
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,199
and instead see if you can know the sensation

61
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:56,919
recognize it in the simplest direct way

62
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:09,000
you don't have to know exactly what it is just approximant is fine

63
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:19,360
and let there be a clear see if you can find a way to clearly recognize

64
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,479
it could be within with the verbal thoughts in your mind it

65
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:30,560
could be a brightening of the inner eye

66
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:41,640
a clear recognition of the sensation where the recognition is its own event

67
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,360
the word door is not the door

68
00:08:53,360 --> 00:09:00,480
it represents the door so for your sensation that you're having

69
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,600
the recognition is not the sensation but it's an amazing

70
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:14,160
event in the mind that the mind would know recognize

71
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:23,279
and see if you can recognize or see or understand

72
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,880
that the act of recognition is distinct

73
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:35,040
from the sensation of course they're related

74
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:41,759
but the sensation does not need to have the recognition to exist

75
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,480
so stay with the sensation maybe breathe with it if it's there or find another

76
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,920
one and see if the knowing

77
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:04,000
the seeing of it can be very very simple

78
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,440
it may be a kind of brightness to it clarity

79
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:16,480
this is what's happening a clarity that doesn't have to have a

80
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,519
before and after ideas of what's going to happen or why

81
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:27,040
it's happening just the event itself

82
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,519
in this moment

83
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:47,120
and now calmly become aware of how your mind is

84
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,000
what's your mind state your mood and the mind

85
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,959
what's your inner life like

86
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,959
and in the radical simplicity

87
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:14,320
recognize in some way what's happening now

88
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,839
for your mind how it is

89
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,839
and recognize it with a kind of independence and clarity

90
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,720
in which you did the sensation

91
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,279
attempt to step back to be free enough that the knowing is

92
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:47,440
not entangled with the mind state it just knows

93
00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:00,320
in a spectrum from contracted to expansive mind

94
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,760
how is your mind more contracted or more expensive or

95
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:13,279
right in the middle or not clear none of the above

96
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,839
recognizing how it is

97
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,560
maybe recognizing the miracle of

98
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,079
knowing anything

99
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:49,839
and when you know your mind state this way with this kind of clear knowing

100
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,839
relaxed and open allowing

101
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:02,920
what happens through the mind state does anything shift

102
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,839
if it does then know the shift

103
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,560
and then we'll continue in silence

104
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:43,839
but as you would go along maybe centering yourself on the breathing

105
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:49,480
from time to time know the state of your mind

106
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:57,440
and see if you can know it with this simple clear way of knowing

107
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:06,320
where the knowing itself is not for or against not trying to do anything or understand

108
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:12,160
anything complicated the knowing is just a recognition

109
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,519
the miracle of recognition

110
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:07,760
knowing the mind as it is taking refuge in the simplicity of

111
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:14,559
knowing knowing is a kind of protection

112
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:22,159
when it protects us from fixing and predicting

113
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,120
wanting and not wanting

114
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,720
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

115
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:59,039
it can be a gift to others to know them and see them clearly

116
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:04,399
without any baggage on our parts without any judgments

117
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:11,760
without any preferences see and know them for who they are as if

118
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:17,760
they're allowed to be that wave just see

119
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,480
sometimes it allows others to see themselves better

120
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:28,840
sometimes it frees people very few people have had a have been

121
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:34,559
seen without the seeing wanting something

122
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:45,840
turning the attention outwards to the world with the gift of seeing

123
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,880
maybe thinking some about some of the people in your life just let them be there

124
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,200
see them

125
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:04,480
i'd like to believe that the clarity of our seeing and knowing

126
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:14,398
is a best channel for our goodwill for our love our care generosity

127
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:27,080
may our knowing of others be the conduit for our love

128
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:34,480
our well-wishing may all beings

129
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:42,880
be happy may all beings be peaceful

130
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,960
may all beings

131
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:56,640
be safe and may all beings everywhere

132
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,960
be free

133
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,299
[Music]

134
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,869
[Music]

135
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:27,390
[Music]

136
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:30,240
so the eighth the third foundation

137
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:38,159
of mindfulness has eight exercises or eight

138
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:44,159
practices that and they're divided into two halves two

139
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:51,120
groups of four each of them the verb the activity just to know the

140
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:58,399
simplicity of knowing these mind states or these ways the minds can be

141
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:05,519
and the first half has a little bit more to do with the minds that

142
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:12,399
is either somehow caught in the world of suffering or is not so much it's the unwholesome

143
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:16,320
mind or in a wholesome mind

144
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,640
in the second so there's a four like that and the last four

145
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:28,399
have to do with more minds and meditation the mind when it starts becoming free

146
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:33,120
and matures in the dharma and grows and develops

147
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:41,360
and that'll be the topic for the next two days tomorrow and friday but for now

148
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:48,559
so that it begins the first four or knowing a mind that has desire has greed

149
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:54,880
that's with greed as a mind with greed mind without greed to know it as being

150
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:02,080
without greed or without desire to know a mind of ill will or aversion

151
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:08,720
as such and to know a mind without aversion as a mind without aversion

152
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,559
it's now a mind that is with delusion or confusion as such

153
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:20,880
and to know a mind that without a confusion or delusion as a mind without

154
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:26,080
confusion delusion those are the first three

155
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:33,039
the fourth one most translators will understand it to be to know something like to know a

156
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:42,240
contracted mind as a contracted mind and a scattered mind as a scattered mind

157
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:49,519
to know a song a shrunken mind a shriveled mind as a

158
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:55,760
chunk as a shriveled mind and a in a scattered mind as a scattered mind

159
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:01,679
and sometimes this is associated with the third and fourth of the hindrances

160
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,880
to know a mind that's kind of sinking into sloth and torpor into dullness

161
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,919
as such and to know a mind which is um

162
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:19,358
kind of scattered and rest from restlessness and anxiety

163
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:24,398
and it makes some sense because um you know that that's what it means the

164
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:30,960
other possibility is that it's uh knowing a not a contracted mind but a collected mind

165
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,638
and a scattered mind but whatever it is the art of it is to just simply know

166
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:42,638
this is how the mind is so contracted and scattered dispersed

167
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:48,480
mind a mind that's afraid can be either way it can be so afraid that it kind of

168
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:54,079
shrinks into itself or it can be so scattered because it's so restless and it's kind of running

169
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:59,520
around and it's we're not really present for ourselves

170
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,960
and this can be very difficult mind states to have but what's happening here is that now

171
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,880
rather than just being part of the mind there's the mind with

172
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:16,079
greed with aversion with delusion now we're talking about a mind that is

173
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:24,240
more globally shrunk and contracted or more globally scattered or dispersed

174
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:32,160
or distracted and jumping around restless and sometimes minds are are that way

175
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:38,240
and um fear in particular uh can have this kind of effect on the

176
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:46,160
mind but all the other things you know all the hindrances can have this effect on the mind but but

177
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:52,720
i find it fascinating to look at my mind and when i get caught up in some mental preoccupation some thought train or

178
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:58,800
something to then when i notice that's happening to notice what's happened to my state of mind

179
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,320
and for me it's like i guess things have gotten kind of uh obscure kind of

180
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:10,720
dark kind of they become contracted my world has gotten kind of narrow and small and i'm pulled into my little

181
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:16,000
concern sometimes if i am

182
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,000
restless or uncertain or anxious about something i could feel that the mind is just

183
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:29,280
spinning and jumping around and can't sit still very much it's like waters on a sizzling hot frying pan it

184
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,400
just jumps around and and it's hard to arrange the mine in or

185
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:41,200
to settle the mine because of how jumpy it is so the fascinating thing about this

186
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:47,839
fourth foundation of mindfulness is it's not giving us advice about what to do when we have minds like

187
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:54,400
this that can be quite uncomfortable all it says is when the meditator

188
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:01,680
knows a contracted mind as a contracted mind knows a dispersed mind a scattered mind

189
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:07,119
has a scattered mind and the fact that it's so radically simple

190
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:12,480
just to know it's hard to trust that it's hard to have confidence that

191
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,520
this is worthwhile doing of course aren't we supposed to fix it and get away with it make it better and

192
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,800
have a different kind of mind and we're not really meditating if the mind is scattered and so we have to kind

193
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:29,839
of get advice about how to breathe deeply or to use an antidote or do something so we

194
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:35,359
fix it there's no fixing it here in this exercise

195
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:41,599
it's simply recognizing as it is and to know this is how the mind is

196
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:47,359
at this point and it helps if the mind is somewhat settled

197
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:54,800
already or has had experiences in practice so we before this so it begins to kind of

198
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:01,280
appreciate the power of knowing appreciate the simplicity of just kind

199
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:06,320
of oh this is how it is this is a contracted mind

200
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:12,960
this is a scattered mind human beings have had contracted and scattered minds for tens of thousands of

201
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:19,280
years and i'm just one more in a long line of people who had minds like this

202
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,320
and i've had maybe many minds like this and and this is how it is now

203
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:31,359
and so this is how it is now this is my turn maybe everyone has to have a turn

204
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:37,760
with scattered and distracted mind and this is my turn okay so now my job is just to know it to see it

205
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:44,320
and then we fall back on just simplicity of knowing the simplicity of recognition

206
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:50,480
this is how it is this is how it is and um

207
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:57,599
over time as we get into the practice we begin appreciating more and more how powerful it is to know this way

208
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:03,280
how significant it is just no just know this is how it is this is how it is

209
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:10,720
and uh and we find it becomes it un it helps the free the stickiness of the mind

210
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:17,280
we're no longer so sticky with caught in it and involved in it and wanting it to be differently

211
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:23,599
more remarkably as the mind becomes less sticky and we start that itself is settling

212
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:30,160
that itself is calming that itself that no kind of knowing changes the inner ecology of the inner

213
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:36,079
landscape and um begins moving us towards freedom

214
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:44,000
which is the uh this the um the next set the the other half of this

215
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,280
first third foundation of mindfulness is um a set of four

216
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:55,920
exercises that describes or starts helps us kind of then be on the path to freedom and

217
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,520
liberation these are kind of like this states of mind that begin opening up in meditation

218
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:06,960
states of mind that can open up and grow out of this radically simple act of

219
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:12,960
knowing and uh it's kind of phenomenal to watch it happen to be present and just know

220
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:19,200
something know the mind state know the mind state and then see how the mind changes

221
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:25,599
in the wake of that clear and simple knowing so um

222
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:31,440
the primary thing i wanted to emphasize today is this how powerful and significant the

223
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:39,839
simplest act of knowing can be and i would like to encourage you for the next 24 hours to go about your day

224
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:45,599
and see if you can experiment with knowing things as they occur in the

225
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:51,440
simplicity of the moment not impatient for the next moment not needing it to be different not trying to

226
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:58,079
run away not having a big agenda but see how simple and complete

227
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:03,359
and free and clarifying and liberating or brightening

228
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:09,359
it can be to simply know oh this is how it is and it kind of means a little bit you

229
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:15,520
kind of allow the knowing to sink in allow the knowing to be registered like you make room for the knowing give

230
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:21,520
yourself time to know and this is my time silly but it's like simple as

231
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:29,200
coming to a door that's a door driving the light is red

232
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:36,400
standing in the line in the supermarket knowing i'm standing in a line

233
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:43,280
and then and then experiment all kinds of places and see how what effect this has on you and how you what impact it

234
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:50,480
has to practice this radical simplicity that has time for the recognition

235
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:57,520
and then tomorrow the next day we'll do these more liberating states of mind

236
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:04,920
that are in this third foundation so thank you very much
