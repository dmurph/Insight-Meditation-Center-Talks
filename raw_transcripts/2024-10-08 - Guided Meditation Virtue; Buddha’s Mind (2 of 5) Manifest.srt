1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,760
so the um the meditations this week will

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:16,920
be pointing toward various wholesome qualities in our experience and those ones that we have

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,439
might have something to do with the attributes of the Buddha that we are exploring this

4
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:30,519
week so these various wholesome qualities are a sound basis for

5
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:35,559
beginning our meditation and also for deliberate

6
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:43,719
reflection in Buddhist practice we're meant to let the good register on our

7
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:51,079
body heart mind uh the Buddha knew that our heart needs that and that it is

8
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:57,680
possible to do that without any conceit or UNH wholesomeness coming in now those

9
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,840
things could come in if we build ourselves up in some way

10
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:10,040
or um grasp onto these qualities or something but it's also possible to do

11
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:18,000
it in a very simple um easeful uh Happy kind of way and it's not too hard to

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,240
land on that with some practice so the Buddha very much encouraged this registering of the

13
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:33,320
good so today we'll bring in a a brief reflection or recollection of our virtue

14
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:39,680
Our intention and ability to have wholesome speech and action in the way

15
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:47,479
that we are in the world and it's always tricky uh as a teacher to use that word

16
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:54,200
Virtue or ethics or ethical conduct um because it tends to bring up

17
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:00,399
in people you know all the times that we didn't do that or all the ways in which

18
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,240
we feel like we're not there yet or something and so I want to say very

19
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:13,280
clearly that the the point of the reflection is not to bring in a comprehensive assessment and make a

20
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,840
chart and have a plan for how to improve it's what I said earlier it's a

21
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,599
registering of the good on the heart and everyone who's here who is interested in

22
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:34,200
the Dharma and who has come to a a sit and a talk like this has quite a bit of

23
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:40,040
good manifesting in them so uh we're going to touch into that to the degree

24
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:45,800
that we can and then we'll um and we'll we'll continue to explore that in the in

25
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:53,440
the talk later so finding a posture that is

26
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,760
upright and relaxed it's also okay to be lying down

27
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:08,040
but just have a straight great straightness to the body in some way so that our posture is

28
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:14,239
dignified sometimes it's said to be Noble that the word doesn't work you can

29
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:20,480
choose dignity some degree of self-respect

30
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:27,400
there confidence and bringing the attention

31
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:33,760
inward closing the eyes if that's appropriate

32
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,760
for you allowing yourself to settle back and

33
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:46,239
rest down sometimes with the computer we can

34
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:52,560
lean forward toward it so we can balance our

35
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,799
posture maybe even tuning in to the place where you're sitting or standing

36
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:05,840
or lying down and finding a place of balance on those contact points so

37
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:13,159
letting yourself settle into the the place that feels easeful and balanced

38
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:20,680
where there's not so much effort to be sitting in a upright

39
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,880
posture for me it feels like there's kind of

40
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:33,919
a like a bowl shape around the position I'm sitting in and I can settle into the

41
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,000
bottom of the bowl where it's easy to to

42
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:49,560
rest and then maybe on the next out breath softening the

43
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,320
body just letting it settle into this

44
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,680
posture mental we can in a sense accept

45
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:11,720
the support of what we're sitting on sometimes there's a habit of trying

46
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:19,039
to hold ourselves up by ourselves like a bootstrap kind of

47
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:25,800
approach and um it's also nice to just let yourself be

48
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:33,199
supported by the chair or the cushion or the floor that you're lying

49
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:40,840
on and ultimately the Earth and feel that

50
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:51,880
rest I find when I do that there's almost a response in myself of of uplift

51
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:58,280
it's like oh I know that the base I'm sitting on is stable and so the body has

52
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:05,919
some lightness and r R is up it's a nice balanced

53
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:16,160
feeling softening the eyes and the eye sockets and the

54
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:23,160
jaw shoulders the

55
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:31,319
belly the legs places where we tend to brace a bit

56
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:37,759
just inviting inviting some ease it's fine if there's still some

57
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,400
tension or if you have pain in your body

58
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:52,319
today that's all fine softening the mind

59
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:08,039
and now we'll invite the skillful use of the thinking mind the mental

60
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:14,160
function to bring to mind the intention that we

61
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,240
carry of non-harming to whatever degree that

62
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,840
feels present for you I know it's there to some

63
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:31,360
degree and um we're not racking up all the moments we miss or little areas

64
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,000
where we're not sure about that generally speaking we're walking

65
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,159
through the world not intending for and send into that feeling in the

66
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:49,039
heart the body even the

67
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,440
mind can you touch that

68
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,080
feeling it may not be easy to describe there may not be words that go

69
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,560
with it but is there kind of a

70
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,680
feeling for me is kind of a gentleness to it and there's also a

71
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:30,240
Clarity that comes when I connect with that nothing specific but it's like the

72
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,240
the air clears around me a

73
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:43,399
bit and maybe as you breathe breathing that feeling through

74
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:49,920
the body if that if that makes sense and can be

75
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,440
done softening the face

76
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:08,120
feeling any sense of goodness

77
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:16,480
Beauty Health that goes with this

78
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:24,000
feeling kind of a

79
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:33,160
gem and then further uh you can bring to mind some moment

80
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:40,920
where you manifested this through an act of kindness or a

81
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:47,519
Restraint of some comment that wouldn't have been

82
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:56,000
useful no need for a long story but more just the

83
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,519
moment feeling into that moment with that person if there was someone else or

84
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,720
an

85
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,600
animal if nothing truly nothing is coming to mind for you you can imagine

86
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:22,640
when you witnessed it in someone else and noticed oh that was a nice

87
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,120
thing that they

88
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:35,399
did feel the energetic effect of that on the world on

89
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:49,560
you now just taking a a breath and on the out breath letting that reflection

90
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:55,959
go returning to the present moment sense of your body

91
00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:04,240
sitting or whatever posture and the presence of

92
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:14,000
mindfulness knowing this moment as it's unfolding tuning into the body and the

93
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:22,279
mind noticing any after effect of that reflection in the heart or the emotions

94
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:28,000
or the mood and then connecting in with the

95
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,120
breath simple flow of Life In This Moment

96
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,760
breathing in breathing

97
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:56,480
out if there's any feeling of ease or [Music]

98
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,199
calm allowing that to settle into the

99
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,759
body and just flowing along that

100
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:19,279
way letting practice continue to unfold for for a

101
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
bit

102
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
e

103
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
e

104
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

105
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

106
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
e

107
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

108
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

109
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,920
e e

110
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,839
if the mind wanders off into thought or

111
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:17,559
story concerns or memories which it

112
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:23,839
will when mindfulness re arises and we

113
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:30,120
remember that we're meditating we can bring to mind that

114
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:36,760
that momentum to come back to the present moment and stay with the

115
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:44,720
practice is also a manifestation of our goodness we've cultivated that

116
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:53,960
momentum to remember to return and to reorient so we can have some

117
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,559
happiness at this goodness and then continuing on letting the practice

118
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:02,360
continue to

119
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
unfold

120
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

121
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

122
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

123
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

124
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

125
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

126
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

127
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

128
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,480
e e

129
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:40,760
is there a way in which your appreciation of

130
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:46,200
and commitment to nonharming are

131
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:56,559
manifesting at this moment can we feel perhaps a softness in

132
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,640
our connection to the the

133
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:07,720
body or a way in which when the Mind

134
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:14,080
brings forth a harsh voice just see that with mindfulness

135
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,480
okay there's that

136
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:29,279
one or a way in which we deliberately speak to ourself with with

137
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,880
kindness or with

138
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:41,840
respect even when we're not acting quote unquote out in the

139
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:48,760
world there's a way to be with experience in a nonharming

140
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:57,080
way notice which aspects of that are present for you right now and appreciate

141
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
them

142
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

143
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,278
e e

144
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:48,279
so we've spent some time during this sit connecting in with the feelings

145
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:56,159
associated with virtue with nonharming with meeting experience in an

146
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,240
ethical kind way

147
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:08,760
might there be a way in which the understanding or the direct

148
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:16,240
knowledge that we've gained from that can serve us as we move out into our

149
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,000
lives for the rest of the day or the

150
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:28,720
evening we carry with us an inner understanding of oh this is what

151
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:36,559
it feels like to have this clarity about nonharming could I carry that into an

152
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:44,360
interaction or situation of driving or writing an email or even preparing a

153
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:50,320
meal reading a book something fairly simple or something

154
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:57,000
challenging this inner reference point of knowing how virtue feels for us

155
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,240
inside helps us to Be steady in

156
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,799
manifesting that in our speech and our

157
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:13,279
actions and that will help us to stay

158
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:19,880
balanced and it helps others they can see it they can feel it even if it's not

159
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:25,200
conscious for them there's a way in which they

160
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:35,158
will just have an intuitive sense that oh this this feels good this feels

161
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:41,360
safe this feels non-confrontational non-c

162
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:46,919
contentious it doesn't mean every interaction will go well

163
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:53,080
but it will go as well as it could based on the total conditions if that's what

164
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:59,000
we're able to [Music] bring so wishing

165
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,880
intending that our care for ourselves and World

166
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:11,360
Can Be steady in us and brought forth in the coming hours and

167
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:20,919
days such that others may also find this in themselves and experience the safety

168
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:26,799
and the ease happiness and peace that

169
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:32,398
come from from this beautiful heart quality of

170
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:42,039
virtue may all beings discover happiness peace and

171
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:49,840
freedom right in the midst of daily life

172
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:34,799
so the this week we are going through nine qualities that

173
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:41,880
are used in a practice called the recollection of the Buddha and their

174
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:49,559
epithets or attributes names or qualities of the Buddha uh that are

175
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:55,360
meant uh to be touched into with our mental qualities we're actually meant to

176
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:02,519
kind of reflect on them and turn them over in our mind mind uh with I'm saying three three

177
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:08,799
purposes to uplift and Inspire to see aspects of them in

178
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:16,880
ourselves in some degree in ourselves and also to uh touch into practical ways

179
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:22,559
that we can use them to inform our daily life practice that's the hope as we go

180
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:28,399
through each of these I um I remembered uh as I was

181
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:37,320
thinking about this topic that there was a time when I was on Retreat long ago one of my first Retreats that um Gil was

182
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:44,720
one of the teachers and when he would arrive to to teach he would um bow to

183
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:51,279
the to the Buddha Rupa that was on the stage and then he would sit down and one

184
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:56,679
of the other students on the retreat asked during one of the Q&A sessions you

185
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:04,919
know why do you do that that what are you doing and um Gil said oh it's mostly

186
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:10,039
gratitude and appreciation um and sometimes a little

187
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:16,159
reflection here any kind of motion to his heart area and he said it very

188
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:22,639
humbly you know he wasn't saying I'm like I'm you know I'm the Buddha but he's like mostly gratitude and

189
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:31,279
appreciation but sometimes a little reflection here and that worth a bow to him so I I

190
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:39,559
think we're you know we're meant to see some aspects of the Buddha in ourselves so there are these nine or

191
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:46,399
technically 10 but only nine are used in the practice um attributes I think I

192
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:51,440
mentioned just briefly yesterday that the poly word for them is the Buddha

193
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:57,880
gunas um and I don't know if that's such a great sounding word but that's the

194
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:05,200
poly word the Buddha gunas and yesterday we did AR and S

195
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:12,760
buo um which were about being fully wholesome and today we'll do two more we

196
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:18,519
go through two more of them so the first I'd like to talk about

197
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:25,279
is um the poly is V Char

198
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:31,360
Sano and what that means is is accomplished in knowledge and

199
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:37,679
conduct Sano is accomplished via is knowledge like the

200
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:44,919
opposite of aicha ignorance and charana is um actually it means kind of to walk

201
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:52,840
around but it's meant to uh refer to our conduct how we are in the way we act and

202
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:58,360
literally move in the world so it's one thing to have

203
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:05,960
liberating Insight internally and it's another to fully manifest it and apply

204
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:11,560
it in the world and the Buddha did that completely such that he was always

205
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:17,158
consistent his understanding internally and his way of being in the world were

206
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:25,200
always in sync and always fully liberated let's say so the

207
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:30,638
knowledge here refers to the liberating understanding of how not to get caught

208
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:36,638
in any experience so um whatever was happening for the budha you know he

209
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:43,040
still went around the world and encountered people who asked him questions and he had to deal with food

210
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:49,000
and you know animals and sleeping and all the things that we do as humans but

211
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,560
all that that came in he had full understanding of how not to get caught up in whatever was happening so there

212
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:01,480
wasn't reactivity in his mind mind and so as a result he was free in the way

213
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:09,200
that he could act and speak which made him fully safe fully skillful in how he

214
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:15,079
was um and we're meant really

215
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:21,040
to to tune into this in our world to the degree that we can so we're meant to

216
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:27,800
notice and be inspired by and some texts even say imitate the goodness that we

217
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:35,240
see happening around us it's good to attune ourselves to that um so Gil Tells

218
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:40,280
a Story one time when he was living at tasahara of looking out his window and

219
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:48,000
seeing the head cook walk across the courtyard you know just going to the kitchen to start work for the day and

220
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:55,680
there was but there was something about the way that he was walking um very present clear on what he was doing not

221
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:02,640
rushing not caught up or worried oh my gosh I've got to get to the kitchen it was just doing you know just doing that

222
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,920
that was the next thing to be done and Gil as an early practitioner felt very

223
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:13,640
inspired by this oh it's possible just to be in the world in a straightforward

224
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:21,359
direct deliberate way unhurried way and you know you may know

225
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:27,760
practitioners like that or we've seen people doing that on Retreat or have Med

226
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:34,040
ation Center and you realize oh huh there's something about the way

227
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:42,119
they're they are that feels wholesome looks looks um worth emulating in some

228
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:48,560
way there is a suta that says that uh lay people should look to other lay

229
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:54,079
people who have four qualities virtue

230
00:36:54,079 --> 00:37:01,599
generosity faith and wisdom and to the degree that we can emulate those

231
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:06,720
qualities and I like the way it says it it's the framing of the language is a

232
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:13,079
little bit careful such that it's not expected that we know people who are accomplished in all four of those at the

233
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:18,319
same time or all the time but we may know somebody who is seems to be

234
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:24,000
particularly accomplished in one of them and you know we think of that oh yeah

235
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,839
you know that person is often consistently generous and we just think of them that way so the encouragement is

236
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:36,800
well great if you if you admire that in them try to be like that try to do more

237
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:42,359
of that yourself not that we're going to become them or put them on a pedestal or

238
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:47,560
anything but we can uh absorb the good qualities around us and bring those

239
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:54,079
forth in ourselves I once had a friend who was very dedicated to the protection of

240
00:37:54,079 --> 00:38:00,760
animals that was her work and um so she was very attuned to animals always uh

241
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:09,079
when I was with her I would notice more animals I'd notice the birds chirping I would notice you know the praying mantis

242
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:16,079
on the plant we were going by um we were walking we were near the ocean one time

243
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:24,440
and she pointed out all these otter and you know fish and things that I might not have seen um just below the surface

244
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:31,839
she could say oh look look you can see a little Shadow there it was great and so I realized oh right so we easily attune

245
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:37,760
to what um comes forth in other people and of course that can happen with the

246
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:44,760
UN wholesome as well we have to be careful but if we have this care in our heart for what is ethical what is

247
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:54,319
virtuous what is wholesome we we're more likely to see that and then we can learn to resonate with it so you may find that

248
00:38:54,319 --> 00:39:01,040
as you do this um you start to be able to do things that are different I mean

249
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:06,560
we can deliberately emulate certain things in a conscious way but often just

250
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:13,160
being around somebody who has those qualities we will see them come forth in us and we'll realize oh I just I just

251
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:19,000
did something differently than I normally would have and this can give us a deeper

252
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:25,560
understanding of what's called ethics you know we usually from

253
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:32,119
various ways that we've been brought up tend to see it as prescriptive this is a list of things

254
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:42,440
that you need to do or live up to or try to be rules or precepts of some kind um

255
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:47,599
but actually there's another side to ethics which is that it is descriptive

256
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:53,440
also it describes somebody who has a commitment to non-harming they are going

257
00:39:53,440 --> 00:40:00,760
to be those ways and so so we can start to see that it deepens our understanding

258
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:08,760
of what's meant by virtue maybe it comes from

259
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:14,040
within so that leads us to the next

260
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:19,839
quality excuse me um which is sugato

261
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:30,720
sugato and literally um Sue means good or well it's positive um prefix and Gat

262
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:36,240
means gone so it means something like well gone which isn't a great literal

263
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:45,079
translation uh sometimes it's translated as the happy one the Buddha was the happy one um we could say a little bit

264
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:54,359
more casually that the Buddha has gone happy he's gone happy like some people go crazy but U he's gone happy and um it

265
00:40:54,359 --> 00:41:00,480
has very much to do with well-being you know the well-being that comes from the

266
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:08,359
wholesomeness from the manifesting of goodness who wouldn't be happy doing

267
00:41:08,359 --> 00:41:13,720
that and um you know in the Buddha it's more deep it's that the the piece of

268
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:20,480
nibana is always present for him he always has access to that um we don't

269
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:26,359
always but nonetheless there is a happiness that comes from our connection

270
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:31,680
to goodness and it's really good to tune into that um there's a

271
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:38,119
story um where the monks arrive in a Brahman Village intending to go to the

272
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:43,280
well to get water but the brahmans are not very friendly in this town and they

273
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,400
fill the well with grass and chaff so that the water can't be accessed and the

274
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:54,160
Buddha asks Ananda his attendant to go fetch in water and Ananda explains the

275
00:41:54,160 --> 00:42:00,200
situation I can't the the well has been filled and the Buddha says well go get me water

276
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:05,599
from the well and Ananda says again no it it's not possible so the Buddha says

277
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:13,359
a third time go to the well and get water so Nanda gives up and goes and he

278
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:18,599
as he approaches the well this is one of those mythical mythical Stories the well

279
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:26,319
throws up all the grass and chaff and stands filled to the brim with pure clean water and nand is very impressed

280
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:33,559
by this and gets some water and takes it back to the Buddha and says wow how amazing that this could happen here's

281
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:40,400
water to drink and the Buddha says again remember this is mythology he says what

282
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:46,040
use is there for a well if there is water everywhere when Cravings root is

283
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:51,440
severed what should one go about seeking so this is not literal the

284
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:56,880
Buddha's body still needs physical water but he's making a Dharma point that it's

285
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:02,640
Poss possible to find peace anywhere under any conditions freedom is not a

286
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:10,800
place that we go or that we need to go um it's right here and if we have

287
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:18,240
this understanding that there's always a wholesome thread that we can follow we have enough wholesomeness in us to meet

288
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:23,839
any situation it's like there's water everywhere everything can be the path

289
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:29,160
nothing can block us from having a wholesome moment in sense and what's

290
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:34,520
interesting about this Su by the way is when the Anand comes back and he says

291
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:41,240
drink the water he says um drink the water lord drink the water

292
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:48,800
sugata it's the same word sugat very rarely is the Buddha addressed as sugat

293
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:54,839
sugat by somebody else so I found that interesting that when I was I actually

294
00:43:54,839 --> 00:44:00,839
was reflecting on this um finding water everywhere quality and this suta came to

295
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:07,480
mind and when I looked it up it has the word sugat in it so you know what about

296
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:14,720
for us since we're not always in contact with niana well we can as I implied a

297
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:20,880
moment ago we can learn to see in a given situation a thread of ease that we can

298
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:26,640
follow uh a way that we can be with it that is wholesome so this is easy when

299
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:32,599
conditions are Pleasant and agreeable like listening to a Dhat for example but

300
00:44:32,599 --> 00:44:40,200
maybe they're not maybe we're in a tough conversation with somebody or somebody has just done something that is you know

301
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:46,920
terrible in our view is there or our mind is misbehaving it's like we're

302
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:53,760
depressed or angry or so know sad in some way or we've experienced a loss so

303
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:59,119
the dharm practice says even those moments are part of the path if we can

304
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:05,319
bring in just the simple calm awareness this is how it is that's enough to make

305
00:45:05,319 --> 00:45:12,200
the moment wholesome to know wow my mind is really caught up right now wow I'm

306
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:18,359
really distracted wow I just I just missed the moment on that one and but if

307
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:23,520
we know it we've reestablished wholesomeness there's water

308
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:28,960
everywhere every moment can be the darkness

309
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:36,520
so one phrase maybe that you could use in practice that's commonly said in the

310
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:43,920
sutas is I see you Mara I see you Mara so it's okay when the mind has UNH

311
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:49,079
wholesomeness in it as long as we see it it's not what we wanted at this moment

312
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:57,359
but seeing it is good enough I see you Mar so these two qualities that we at

313
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:04,960
today V Charo and sub relate to the Buddha manifesting his

314
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:11,960
pure mind um it's true that this list of nine by the way doesn't break up neatly into

315
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:17,800
sets of two so I'm you know putting on my structure a little bit but I think it works pretty well you can see as the

316
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:23,200
week goes on so we'll say that today is about manifesting the the Purity and the

317
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:31,800
goodness which leads to Wholesome happiness which is a happiness way of being and um see if so see if you can

318
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:38,599
notice today the manifestation of wholesomeness which we do quite often without realizing the moments of

319
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:44,240
goodness and can you find some happiness in that soak in that if you will to

320
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:51,079
bring in the water image be happy about it the more soaked we are in our own

321
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:57,400
goodness and our willingness to be present and do the best we can with our mind

322
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:02,800
the better we're able to see actually how the mind is working and how the

323
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:09,160
world is working knowing in seeing things as they are is a fruit of

324
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:14,359
goodness and happiness that's what we'll talk about more

325
00:47:14,359 --> 00:47:19,920
tomorrow so please come back if that's of interest and otherwise have a

326
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:25,000
beautiful wholesome day thank you
