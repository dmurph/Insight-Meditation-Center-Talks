1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,480
so

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,280
i thought that before kind of going

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,360
further with anapanasati with this

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,920
practice of mindfulness of breathing

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,760
to kind of kind of start over again in a

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,800
little bit way

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,520
if maybe a little different way and stay

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,199
more with the basic

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,800
most basic aspect of the practice

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,240
and over these weeks that i've been

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,640
doing this i've offered a variety of

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,360
maybe subtly different ways of being

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,079
with the breath

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,239
and breathing and different ways

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,360
different little different little

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,840
different each time

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,000
and it isn't that you have to remember

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
all those ways and

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,800
and but rather maybe some of them

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,719
work for you inspire you in some way

21
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,120
and it can be a basis of how you

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,399
practice and so

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,280
the wider range that i give perhaps the

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,079
more likely you'll find something

25
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,760
and maybe you'll piece together parts of

26
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,760
it the subtle different ways of

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,600
being with the breathing and work with

28
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,840
the breathing and the meditation and

29
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,080
breath

30
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,960
um and i also wanted to kind of just

31
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,200
stay real basic today rather rather than

32
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,600
moving

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,119
further along the steps um as i said

34
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,799
yesterday in some ways as we're going

35
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,400
through slowly in some ways we're going

36
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,320
through it very fast and

37
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,000
you know maybe it would be ideal to

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
spend a year going through the steps

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,920
and so

40
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,479
it's on monday you know we'll start then

41
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,640
a little bit further and the next

42
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,439
stages of the next steps of it are quite

43
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,640
fascinating or very

44
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,240
very significant for this working with

45
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,880
this meditation practice but before we

46
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,079
go on that way

47
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,040
i wanted to um um

48
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,920
uh maybe take some questions from you

49
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,960
we've been doing this

50
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,360
breath meditation now for a few weeks

51
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,040
and maybe it'd be nice if you had a

52
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,479
chance a few of you had a chance to ask

53
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,239
some questions and

54
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,520
if you can put them in the chat and then

55
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,360
i'll try to respond and maybe

56
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,760
the questions that i pick out of the

57
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,640
chat

58
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,040
hopefully they are relevant for many of

59
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,599
you and be interesting to kind of

60
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,440
have some this interesting for me to get

61
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,879
some feedback or some

62
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,319
hearing about learning a little bit

63
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,200
about the kind of questions you have or

64
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,440
challenges you have with it or joys you

65
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,319
have with it or something

66
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,959
and the um

67
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,480
and the ways you know there are a lot of

68
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,400
chat questions uh

69
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,640
sometimes i can't really follow them in

70
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,319
order and they're in place because they

71
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,319
passed by so quickly and

72
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,879
i i try to do a little bit that way but

73
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,400
maybe we can think of it more as i'm

74
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,000
pulling questions out of the hat

75
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,239
then doing it in sequence

76
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,400
and

77
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,319
so someone said i experienced

78
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,959
anxiety um and um

79
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,640
there's no question but it's interesting

80
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,040
that anxiety

81
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,360
is a i think it comes from a greek word

82
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,560
to choke

83
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,560
and like choke to not really be able to

84
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,159
breathe fully in

85
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,040
so this kind of working the edge of

86
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,280
where the breathing is held or resisted

87
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,480
or

88
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,840
it sometimes can be helpful with anxiety

89
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,840
kind of expanding it relaxing that

90
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,239
how can this help with the severe

91
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,080
chronic pain

92
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,799
the um it might not help i mean i

93
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,720
i can't promise you that this will help

94
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,560
but there are plenty of people who find

95
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,200
that

96
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,560
um breath meditation helps can help with

97
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,120
severe pain uh certainly i've had lots

98
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,959
of severe pain in meditation but not

99
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,239
chronic

100
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,680
but certainly severe at times and

101
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,080
one of the surprises is to discover that

102
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,760
it's possible to feel joy

103
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,400
and pain at the same time it's possible

104
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,360
to have become

105
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,599
and feel pain at the same time it's kind

106
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,879
of like two different sides two

107
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,639
different parts different aspects of the

108
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,680
of our being and often if we identify

109
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,519
too much with the pain or we

110
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,560
too preoccupied with it or too caught up

111
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,080
in it

112
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,880
then that influences kind of the inner

113
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,880
state of how we are

114
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,120
but if we don't identify two with it or

115
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,960
aren't too preoccupied with it it's

116
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,360
there

117
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,560
we don't ignore it um but um

118
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,360
then their inner interstate inner state

119
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,120
of our emotional state our mood and all

120
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,160
that

121
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,320
doesn't have to be tied to it and so the

122
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,199
interstate can be

123
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,440
peaceful or calm and that doesn't

124
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,600
necessarily make the pain go away

125
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,000
but it creates a different context for

126
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,520
being with the pain

127
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,800
so that the pain isn't the primary

128
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,639
influence on us but there's some

129
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,080
other something inside which is an

130
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,680
influence that might actually influence

131
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,560
the pain in some way

132
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,639
i've also when i've had severe pain

133
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,360
and meditation or in life i sometimes

134
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,600
have um

135
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,600
just breathe through it and around the

136
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,039
place of pain

137
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,639
and it depends a little bit probably

138
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,479
what kind of pain it is

139
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,440
but sometimes uh just breathing through

140
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,080
it and

141
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,120
and and or with it i don't identify with

142
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,320
it so much and just

143
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,160
little sense of relaxation little sense

144
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,560
of something releases then and

145
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,240
if nothing what releases is that my

146
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,280
preoccupation with it

147
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,880
there's much more to be said about pain

148
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,639
but for now

149
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,880
have you experienced all 16 sure

150
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,400
and sometimes i've experienced them

151
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,560
sequentially one to the other usually

152
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,320
but sometimes it's more random you know

153
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,680
sit down to meditate

154
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,080
and i find myself some points different

155
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,039
points of the

156
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,680
of the steps or i'll jump ahead or seems

157
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,199
like i go through it quickly and

158
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,639
and one of the steps becomes more the

159
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,800
predominant one for the day

160
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,000
and so so you know

161
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,319
but yeah um

162
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,479
oh what does it mean when the body

163
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,880
disappears and there's no question mark

164
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,600
so

165
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,039
that's already disappeared too

166
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,960
generally when the body disappears in

167
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,280
meditation it means we're concentrated

168
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,280
it means the the thinking mind has

169
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,520
become quiet quiet enough

170
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,319
that that we're not conceptualizing

171
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,759
about the body

172
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,759
it turns out that it's a little hard to

173
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,120
imagine you know if you have never

174
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,319
experienced it

175
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,240
but it turns out that a lot of the ways

176
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,479
in which we experience the body

177
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,479
is mediated through our thoughts and

178
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:47,520
ideas

179
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,039
through the activity of the mind that

180
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,120
constructs the body

181
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,560
and so

182
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,400
so for example with eyesight from seeing

183
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,720
we have all these little photon light

184
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,680
particles

185
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,440
travel into the eye they get turned

186
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,440
upside down in the eye

187
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,440
and go against the retina and um

188
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,120
and then there's these electrical

189
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,560
signals the nerves that

190
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,039
send these signals up into the brain and

191
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,240
then the brain

192
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,280
reconstructs the signals

193
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,840
into something which is a simile of the

194
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,240
world out there the world that was seen

195
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,560
and sometimes that reconstruction is not

196
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,440
accurate

197
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,000
as when you know you see a twig on the

198
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,960
ground and you

199
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,000
first you see it as a snake and um

200
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
or i've seen people the distance in a

201
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,440
crowd strangers

202
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,280
but uh for a moment i thought it was a

203
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,960
friend of mine because there was enough

204
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,080
similarity

205
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,000
and then i filled in the blank to kind

206
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,440
of see my friend and then i looked more

207
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,840
carefully no it's not my friend

208
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,639
so the reconstruction process is is an

209
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,639
activity the mind does

210
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,039
as the mind gets calmer it's not

211
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,039
reconstructing so much

212
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,080
and as it doesn't reconstruct it doesn't

213
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,840
it's not taking the signals or doesn't

214
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,080
have the signals from the body

215
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,639
to reconstruct and it just and it feels

216
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,360
like the body is disappearing

217
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,919
and sometimes it disappears entirely and

218
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:14,879
i've actually

219
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,440
sometimes thought you know had to open

220
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,120
my eyes in meditation to make sure that

221
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,800
i was still here because

222
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,560
it just felt so you know empty

223
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,039
sometimes there's an intermediate stage

224
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,160
where um

225
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,000
we're still the mind is still

226
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,680
reconstructing

227
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,479
uh sensations but it's not really doing

228
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,080
it accurately anymore

229
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,000
and so sometimes people's uh in

230
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,919
meditations they'll feel really like

231
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,440
they get elongated like they're about to

232
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,120
touch the ceiling or they feel really

233
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,080
squat

234
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,440
their hands feel like they're getting

235
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,880
really big usually it's not particularly

236
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,399
you know you know you know

237
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,640
unusual it's just kind of little

238
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,160
perceptual distortion

239
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,640
and it's usually a particular stage and

240
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,600
when people go d

241
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,440
just it also doesn't last for too long

242
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,200
and and then after a while

243
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,880
the capacity to settle and get more

244
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,640
concentrated settles in and

245
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,480
and that perceptual distortion stops

246
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,120
um

247
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,640
is it important to follow the steps in

248
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,080
order

249
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,959
like i just said no sometimes it's

250
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,800
helpful to do so because it if

251
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,279
it can't help the concentration just

252
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,480
you're on task

253
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,880
and you're just going to do it and

254
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,959
sometimes it's not to do it on tasks and

255
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,399
do a technique and kind of follow

256
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,800
something makes the mind too busy

257
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,160
and um and sometimes what happens is we

258
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,760
start with the first one we just start

259
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,120
with breath meditation and getting

260
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,480
settled in

261
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,720
and then rather than following this you

262
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,360
know implying and following the steps

263
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,640
exactly we are we're recognizing as we

264
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,000
deepen the practice

265
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
we recognize the steps we recognize

266
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,200
where we are

267
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,360
and because we can recognize it maybe it

268
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,560
becomes a little fuller

269
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,320
and we can let it become fuller and more

270
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,200
complete and then it just on its own

271
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,959
it moves into the next step into the

272
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,440
next step and i prefer that way rather

273
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,360
than kind of intentionally moving ahead

274
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:09,839
when

275
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,920
you know it's a time to move ahead now

276
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,399
it's more like you do your practice and

277
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,519
you just kind of allow it to unfold

278
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,600
in its own way and sometimes it jumps

279
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,040
around it doesn't have to be the same

280
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,920
linear steps

281
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,720
how to work with controlling breath this

282
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,600
is really common

283
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,800
the i think the

284
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,560
the most useful thing to do is um

285
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,640
uh not worry about it and

286
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,440
don't be bothered by it allow yourself

287
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,200
to have a controlled breath

288
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,800
and and you can cultivate just a strong

289
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,360
mindfulness and concentration with a

290
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,240
controlled breath

291
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,040
with the breath that's not controlled

292
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,240
it's not the breath that

293
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,320
is the main issue it's really the main

294
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,000
issues the quality of the attention you

295
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,200
bring

296
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,800
also if you're not bothered with it

297
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,519
you're more likely to get out of its way

298
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,959
when we're bothered by a controlled

299
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,040
breath we actually in some subtle way

300
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,720
reinforce it and it makes it more

301
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,079
difficult to let go

302
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,000
also it can be very interesting to

303
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,920
become a connoisseur of the controlled

304
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,720
breath

305
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,040
just be content to have a control breath

306
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,959
and then get to know it really well like

307
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,880
where exactly is the sense of control

308
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,120
where's the tightness the resistance

309
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,920
the pushing what are the emotions that

310
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,880
are connected to it

311
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,959
are there anything anything emotional

312
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,640
any beliefs connected to it

313
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,720
just really get to know it inside and

314
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,959
out and sometimes that really getting to

315
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,079
know it

316
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,680
sometimes is a little trick because

317
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,000
after a while focusing on that way

318
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,360
directly

319
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,480
kind of disarms the control and

320
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,920
sometimes you discover something

321
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,120
interesting that needs to be

322
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,839
relaxed and released then then becomes

323
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:54,880
easier to

324
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,120
to to do it so that's one of the things

325
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,880
i would do

326
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,320
another thing that i've done you know

327
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,160
i've done so much of this over the years

328
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,120
that i've

329
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,720
depending on times i've done different

330
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,959
things sometimes with that when i had a

331
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,480
controlled breath

332
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,120
i imagine that uh i was bringing my

333
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,000
attention

334
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,839
uh from the back forward like going in

335
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,040
through the back door

336
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,200
my back rib cage and just feeling it in

337
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,560
the back ribcage where there's very

338
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,079
little sense of control in the back

339
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,120
ribcage

340
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,360
and i felt the breath there for a while

341
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,160
and then that

342
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,320
kind of relax the control in the front

343
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,519
and then i slowly

344
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,079
move my attention forward gingerly

345
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,360
without kind of

346
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,320
triggering the control

347
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,839
um

348
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,200
i have a challenge in the out breath

349
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,560
smaller

350
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,320
and belly tight your suggestion

351
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,480
observing the end of the in-breath

352
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,720
at the end of the out breath is helpful

353
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,560
since i

354
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,279
do get anxious there so any thoughts

355
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,839
about that

356
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,440
i think a little bit same as with the

357
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,680
control you know it's very

358
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,079
very significant just simply to

359
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,760
recognize and observe what we're

360
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,279
actually doing

361
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,240
and and there's a tendency when we see

362
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,600
something about ourselves

363
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,680
to have judgments or reactions or think

364
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,959
it should be different

365
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,720
but don't underestimate how very

366
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,000
significant is that you're just

367
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,079
observing it and seeing it

368
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,399
and it might be all you need to do and

369
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,639
i've had all kinds of ways in which you

370
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,440
know i've been anxious or

371
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,120
tight in my breathing controlling my

372
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,000
breathing all kinds of things about it

373
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,240
that i just allowed myself to feel it

374
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,120
know it

375
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,199
and there's continued with the breathing

376
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,800
kind of like the breathing is just a

377
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,240
massage for it

378
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,480
and i find it interesting that as a

379
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,600
massage

380
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,079
some point in the in-breath is more like

381
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,760
the

382
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,519
the heart of the massage and then like

383
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,680
pushing it and then relaxing

384
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,279
sometimes the top of the in-breath

385
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,800
sometimes the end of the out breath

386
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,279
depends what's going on and just kind of

387
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:07,839
like

388
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,000
be with the rhythm be and and find a way

389
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,760
to be really content like you're in it

390
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,199
for the long term like

391
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,920
you're not trying to fix it you're not

392
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,240
you know pre-concerned about it

393
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,680
not just okay just recognize oh i'm

394
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,920
you know it's uh it's unpleasant it's

395
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,880
tight it's

396
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,440
controlled there's anxiety and i just

397
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,399
breathe with it

398
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,079
you know and and we're going to be

399
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,160
friends and just breathe and breathe

400
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,920
and that kind of attitude sometimes is a

401
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,360
very effective way

402
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,440
to over time the things just settle

403
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,680
without us being involved in

404
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,279
all kinds of mental uh preoccupations

405
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,040
and that often just kind of

406
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,720
stir it up even more sometimes

407
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,519
yes let's do another zoom soon to chat

408
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,360
with sangha yeah we'll do it

409
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,240
maybe we can do it next week it depends

410
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,360
a little bit about

411
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,000
you know it depends whether i have time

412
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,320
and right now i have

413
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:13,440
a number of um

414
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,120
it thinks i'm having to take care of my

415
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,199
life that makes it a little harder

416
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,800
any idea for trauma survivors and

417
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,720
disassociation sometimes

418
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,279
i may think i'm concentrated maybe i'm

419
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,360
disassociated

420
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,759
yeah i mean certainly

421
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,279
trauma survivors have their own path and

422
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,279
and the care that's needed for breath

423
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,920
meditation and for meditation in general

424
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,160
and it's a it's a noble path it's a

425
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,079
dignified path for

426
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,000
people who've had trauma to work through

427
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,199
and work with

428
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,920
their trauma in meditation and and all

429
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,720
that

430
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,399
but it often needs a little different

431
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,920
kind of attention than

432
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,320
uh the kind of the basic usual you know

433
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,440
instructions that i would give

434
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,240
the

435
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,079
the you know it usually uh what's really

436
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,639
good is a lot of compassion and a lot of

437
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,600
care a lot of generosity to oneself and

438
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,720
a lot of patience with it all

439
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,839
and and permission to not have to go

440
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,240
headlong into the trauma or the fear or

441
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:22,880
something

442
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,920
it's fine to be at the edges of it and

443
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,519
and and it's fine to avoid it if

444
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,120
or it's fine to breathe with it without

445
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,680
fixing it or doing anything with it

446
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,680
so you can find exactly or to pull out

447
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,360
when trauma responses arises in

448
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,680
meditation a very helpful skill to

449
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,720
develop

450
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,839
is to kind of end the meditation or kind

451
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:46,480
of

452
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,720
come out of that state and revive

453
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,399
oneself or come back to normal a little

454
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,199
bit

455
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,759
and develop that skill so there's

456
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,880
confidence that

457
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,759
as you go into it that you if you ever

458
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,360
if you really wanted to you could come

459
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,160
out

460
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,320
so at some point if you want to explore

461
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,640
and go further with the sensations of

462
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,520
trauma

463
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,000
that you do so with a lot of confidence

464
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,600
at a moment's notice you can pull

465
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,760
yourself out

466
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,438
and and maybe there is disassociation

467
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,918
and sometimes you know it's not it's not

468
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:18,558
there's not a

469
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,280
you know it's not a it's not nothing you

470
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,600
know

471
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,720
not a crime to be disassociated uh so

472
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,240
it's okay to within reason and um

473
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,960
and so if it just happens in meditation

474
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,240
maybe it also has an

475
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,840
helpful function sometimes there's a

476
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,320
break or there is a kind of relaxation

477
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:36,720
that

478
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,960
can happen with some disassociation so

479
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,039
not to be in a hurry to make it wrong to

480
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,400
do that

481
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,799
and then but if it starts being a

482
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,000
problem or you suspect

483
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,520
that it is a problem then

484
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,400
you know the really the focus focus on

485
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,600
the body

486
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,440
i find is one way to kind of work

487
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,799
through disassociation because

488
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,480
dissociation is very

489
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,960
more often than not i associated with

490
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,160
not being connected to the body

491
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,240
and so

492
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,960
and then getting professional help i

493
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,400
think is good if you really think it's a

494
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,320
big issue it's really good to

495
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,760
find a professional help there are now

496
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,679
in some areas you know therapists who

497
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,280
know about

498
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,360
mindfulness and buddhism and meditation

499
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,200
and you know that can be particularly

500
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,120
helpful

501
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,160
for people meditating

502
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,480
um

503
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,520
after the 16th step this would be the

504
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,520
last one after the 16 steps would you

505
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:37,919
make

506
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,480
letting go the next theme yeah that that

507
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,240
certainly can be uh

508
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,240
the um but we'll see it letting go is

509
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,480
built into the anapanasati

510
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,120
and so next week we'll get to the end of

511
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,480
each tetrad

512
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,880
there is some quality of letting go in

513
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,559
the family of letting go

514
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,480
and so um we'll see next week when we

515
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,080
get to the eighth step that

516
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,360
has letting go and the first step

517
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,840
uh the end the first tetrad is relaxing

518
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,520
or tranquilizing

519
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,679
the bodily formations and that's that's

520
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,440
in the family of letting go

521
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,039
and so at the end of each tetrad there's

522
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,720
a letting go kind of

523
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,799
quality so we'll do some of that here

524
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,120
well thank you for your questions and

525
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,039
i'll read the rest of the questions and

526
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,400
so i get some sense of your concerns and

527
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,840
and i appreciate this chance to

528
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,960
be this way with you and i look forward

529
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,200
to uh

530
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,400
next week and continuing on this process

531
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,840
thank you very much
