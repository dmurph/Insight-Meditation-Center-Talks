1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:11,920
hello everyone and today this week we're very much

2
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,520
here to experience our body at least that's what the

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,640
instructions for for this section of the discourse on the

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,560
for foundation of mindfulness what this section is about and

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,239
one of the things we're contending with as we

6
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:42,000
bring mindfulness to the body is a tendency of thinking to take us away from the body

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,440
and i found i found it helpful sometimes to think about thinking to consider thinking

8
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:54,239
uh my my thoughts to be a little bit like thought bubbles in a cartoon in the comics it was floating above the

9
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,480
head and the reason i find that sometimes useful is sometimes it's very clear

10
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,080
that when i notice that i'm thinking or have been involved in thinking that i'm not really connected to my body

11
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,720
very much there's not any sense of embodied presence embodied attention

12
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,759
and that when i then settle into my body it's a richer certainly more embodied

13
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:26,799
experience of myself but also it becomes more three-dimensional

14
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,960
whereas thinking by itself is one-dimensional or two-dimensional

15
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,320
it's kind of flat even though the what we think about might be exciting and

16
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,320
emotionally evocative and all kinds of things there's some way in which the embodied

17
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:51,360
life feels richer or more valuable and so whereas this first foundation of

18
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,560
mindfulness is uh becoming has to do with becoming embodied

19
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,560
so um to when we're sitting today

20
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:11,680
you might study a little bit the difference before you

21
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,520
between being preoccupied in thoughts when you notice you are that way notice

22
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,959
what it's quality of the mind the body the quality of your experiences

23
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:29,920
when you are so involved in your thinking that you're not connected to your body

24
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:36,879
and then but then when you switch modes and come into your body through the breathing and settling what's that like

25
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:43,440
how's that different the image i like to use myself

26
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,360
in those kind times when i get preoccupied in thoughts is that i'm

27
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:57,440
now i'm going to dip back into my body like i would dip myself into a refreshing pool of water

28
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,120
that or a warm pool of water if it's a cold winter weather right now

29
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:10,400
so dipping myself into a wonderful pool of water and as i'm just kind of like

30
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,840
settling myself into the water of the body the

31
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,920
the and that image of settling in and to water

32
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,159
is very nice for me and helps me kind of settle into my body a bit more

33
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,239
so taking a meditation posture

34
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,120
and

35
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,720
taking a little bit of time with the posture

36
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,400
knowing that mindfulness of posture is one of the practices of mindfulness

37
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:01,000
mindfulness begins as we attend to our posture

38
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,480
perhaps making a many small adjustments just to get aligned and

39
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,439
get everything just right

40
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,720
closing the eyes

41
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:29,040
and noticing the degree to which you're involved in thinking

42
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,440
is there a lot of energy in your thinking right now

43
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,040
and if there is feel that energy feel the activation

44
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,560
that's connected to thinking

45
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,240
feel that activation physically what does it feel like in

46
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,600
your body is there tension or pressure

47
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:10,919
is there agitation physical agitation some part of your body that's connected to thinking

48
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,800
and then as you breathe maybe breathing a little bit more deeply than usual

49
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,240
breathe into the place that's activated breathe into the place where thinking

50
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:34,960
predominates and as you exhale relax the thinking mind

51
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,120
as you exhale calm the mind

52
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,600
maybe slowing your thinking down a little bit

53
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,080
or lowering the volume

54
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,800
if you think more in images maybe you can imagine the images are

55
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:15,280
further away from you projected into space

56
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,840
at a distance so you're not so involved

57
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,479
then taking a few longer deeper breaths on the exhale

58
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:44,600
settle into your body as you exhale

59
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,280
exhale and relax into the body

60
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,800
breathing in and breathing out

61
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:17,840
establishing yourself in the physical sensations of breathing

62
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:26,000
and maybe the ways in which they are the sensations

63
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,840
come and go with the rhythm of breathing in and out

64
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,160
so

65
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,840
and then coming to the end of the sitting

66
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,320
dedicating this meditation

67
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,000
the effort you made dedicating the

68
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,919
practice for every breath that you were present

69
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:16,640
for dedicating it to for the welfare and happiness of others

70
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:23,840
and yourself dedicating it for the well-being of this

71
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:29,799
world including yourself

72
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:37,679
may all beings be happy including yourself

73
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:45,840
may all beings be safe including yourself

74
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:51,200
may all beings be peaceful including

75
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,840
you may all beings be

76
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:01,760
free may you be free

77
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:08,240
each of us is as important as the every other person in this world

78
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:16,000
when we dedicate the what the merit the benefits of practice may be all inclusive

79
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,039
for self and others self and others for this whole world

80
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:26,600
may this whole world be happy

81
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,278
thank you

82
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:06,880
so we're spending time these days with mindfulness of activities

83
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:14,080
so that overlaps quite a bit with what's called mindfulness in daily life

84
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:20,480
and the list of things be mindful of in the text we're going through

85
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:27,440
is quite extensive and uh when i was in japan practicing

86
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:33,919
there then monastery they had a

87
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:40,960
practice called gatas they would recite gatas four line verses

88
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:47,919
that they would and we were given all these verses like a little book of verses to memorize

89
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:55,440
and uh before we were going to eat before we were going to shower wash our hands go to the bathroom

90
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:01,360
all these kind of sit put on the clothes there all these ordinary activities we did we did

91
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:07,279
and the idea was to recite these four verses that you memorized they were specific for each one

92
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:14,159
and it was an aspiration verse may i as i as i do this activity may i

93
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:19,600
and it was always as far as i remember all of them had to do with um

94
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:27,519
dedicating it for the welfare of everyone benefiting everyone from this

95
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:33,760
when i was at the here in california at the sahara zen monastery they used a little bit of that

96
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:41,679
and mostly it was when we go to the baths they had these natural hot springs that were that piped water into the baths and so

97
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:48,480
it was kind of lovely place to go and shower and then bathe in and but there was an altar as you entered

98
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:54,000
and you would bow to the altar and you'd recite the four line verse that was

99
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,120
written on above the altar and um

100
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:04,240
and it was i remember exactly how it went but it went something like

101
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:11,440
as i enter the bath with all beings you know something like cleaning

102
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:17,279
myself inside and out uh or something yeah i remember now i don't

103
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:22,720
remember but uh it was a little bit and but you would recite this and so

104
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:31,279
the the we have one at the irc or retreat center that was written a few years ago

105
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:37,200
and i'll read it to you that i have here

106
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:42,960
it had to do with hand washing because it's so important when 40 people are living together and

107
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:50,240
touching the same utensils serving food and all that everyone washes their hands before we use the buffet table and serve ourselves

108
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:56,159
but to really emphasize the value of it and we have this little verse that's posted on the

109
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:03,440
cleaning my hands i clean my heart and mind cleaning my heart and mind i clean the

110
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:10,240
world for others and uh if you memorize these kinds of verses

111
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:15,599
and when you do something it takes a certain amount of attention and time to do it

112
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:22,240
you're preparing yourself for it you're in you're funneling your attention your energy

113
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:29,040
your and your time to do the activity you're doing so you you don't think do things in a

114
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:34,480
hurry when you recite a four-line verse before you do it

115
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:40,638
and so the so uh by doing this in design monastery

116
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:46,398
it was a training and learning how to take your time slow down don't be in a hurry just do

117
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:51,520
the thing you're doing when you're doing it kind of the idea of when do when you're

118
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:57,118
doing something just do it when walking just walk when eating just walk

119
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:02,960
and um and uh i thought i would read one that um

120
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,640
do i have it here i know i don't have it here maybe tomorrow um

121
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:14,960
by tiknot han tignan is a whole little book with these kinds of gatas four line verses

122
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:22,079
and um so um the um

123
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,760
what i'm trying to convey here is um when you're practicing mindfulness and activities

124
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:34,560
don't do things in a hurry it doesn't necessarily mean you have to slow down

125
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:41,680
but you can do things fast sometimes without hurrying hurrying is being ahead of yourself it's

126
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:47,599
propelling yourself through kind of through something or to the other side of it as quickly as you

127
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:53,359
can whereas mindfulness is meant to be being there for the activity

128
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:59,200
if it needs to be done quickly then be fully there in the as its surrender to the activity

129
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:05,839
i was a fast order cook for a while after being in the monastery and what i learned the monastery about how

130
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:11,839
surrendering to each activity be really present for it um i learned to do in the kind of a fast

131
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:16,880
or a cook i was i would just that's all i did was the dance of spinning and

132
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:22,400
turning and cooking many dishes at once and that's the only thing i did was all

133
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,440
that i kind of surrendered to that dance and i would usually leave

134
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:35,280
my job feeling more concentrated than when i entered because of how i gave myself over to it

135
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,560
so giving yourself over to the activity without a hurry

136
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:45,760
and uh for to to live a mindful life to live a life where there's some

137
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:52,400
momentum where for mindfulness to grow and enhance our life grow in our life

138
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:58,000
it really is uh valuable to start bringing a

139
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,200
good quality attention to what we're doing when we're doing it in the present moment

140
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,520
so i'll go through these this list with again

141
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:15,839
acts in full awareness when going forward and returning

142
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:20,960
so if does it go someplace you have to go

143
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:26,880
to the bathroom and come back if you have to go to the kitchen to get something come back if you have to go to the bookcase to get something and come

144
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,880
back that's a time where if you want

145
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,320
can be your meditation time that's a time for

146
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:44,000
cultivating your capacity for awareness it's not just to be aware of what you're

147
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,359
doing which is valuable but it's also what we're trying to do here with this sati

148
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:54,400
patana this four foundations for mindfulness

149
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:00,880
is to do these activities so that awareness becomes stronger present moment

150
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:06,000
awareness becomes more second nature then it is something you have to remind yourself to do

151
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,839
so there's both for the purpose of being present and for the purpose of enhancing and developing

152
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:16,560
awareness it's like a muscle awareness and you can develop it

153
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:23,200
uh when acts in full awareness when flexing and extending one's limbs

154
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:28,480
and so if you're going to reach for something in thailand

155
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,680
i don't know if it's still there but there was a school of the pasuna school of insight meditation

156
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,800
that relied on not the breathing but rather

157
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:44,000
you know in breathing you're watching maybe the movements of the belly as it comes and goes

158
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,240
in this school you um you watched your arm as you moved it you

159
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:57,280
would lift your arm put it down to the side lift the arm up put it down to the side

160
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:03,520
and you'd be very focused and concentrated on the sensations of that movement and the mind may get concentrated a lot

161
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:10,400
of calm would develop and and for some people this movement of the arm was easier to track

162
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:16,480
than the breathing and you know eventually the people who did it a lot became concentrated there and with a

163
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:23,520
concentration they would develop the further uh steps of the pipasana

164
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:30,240
so uh bending and extending one's limbs

165
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:35,920
wearing one's uh robes and carrying one's bowl so

166
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:41,119
wearing one's clothes so putting on one clothes wearing them

167
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:49,200
in the for the monastics uh being mindful of your robes is important because one of the minor rules you can

168
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:54,240
violate is um you know monks wear kind of a skirt and

169
00:39:54,240 --> 00:40:01,520
then a outer robe over the skirt and the big outer robe extends down to the edges of the skirt

170
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:07,200
and and the robe has the bottom of the skirt the hem has to be lined up

171
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:13,280
parallel to the bottom of your skirt and uh if you don't do that then

172
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:19,119
it's a little violation and so the um so you have to be very these

173
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:24,720
robes that monks wear you know take take certain amount of mindfulness to keep them just right so you have to be

174
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:31,920
attentive to your clothes and i when i was a monastic i loved i i was surprised by this but i came to like

175
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:37,599
this a lot quite a bit because it was a call to constantly be mindful

176
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:44,319
constantly be attentive here and rather than seeing it as a nuisance i saw it as a kind of way of staying relaxed not

177
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:50,160
rushing ahead and not getting complicated just staying present

178
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,920
one acts in full awareness when eating drinking consuming food and tasting

179
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:01,440
the word for tasting apparently is not exactly tasting but more like savoring

180
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:08,800
so certainly you don't want to be attached to it but to be really present to feel and sense the taste

181
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:14,720
and there's a part of a lore of buddhism or part of the records

182
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:19,839
from the ancient commentaries is that a lot of practitioners became

183
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:25,520
enlightened while they were eating so something about the detailed attention

184
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:30,720
and the first kind of opening real opening kind of

185
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:36,319
experience i had in buddhist practice occurred while i was sipping a cup of tea

186
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:42,240
so the idea that these simple things can be really powerful

187
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:49,359
if we're really present for them and really give ourselves over to it sense it and be with it

188
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:56,960
um full awareness when defecating and urinating sometimes it's said to be

189
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:04,319
a kind of you know a really good poop is kind of like i'm

190
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:15,280
you know a minor nibbana niner minor awakening so really be present for

191
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:21,920
these bodily functions that we do every day and when walking standing sitting

192
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:28,079
falling asleep waking up talking and keeping silent i find it very

193
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:34,880
nice when i go to bed at night to be present for the experience of being there and

194
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:40,160
relaxing my body being mindful and checking in and and letting go of any any stresses

195
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:45,760
that's easy enough to let go of and just be their present and my teachers in burma they wanted us

196
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:52,160
to be aware right up to the moment of sleep and actually be able to know if you fall asleep on the in-breath

197
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:57,920
and the out-breath i tried i tried that for a long time and it's something i've never been able to do so i've given up

198
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:03,040
on that and then to be present when we wake up and to know if you woke up on the end

199
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:08,800
breath and the out breath also something i've never been able to do and

200
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:15,760
but then to wake up and then us begin the mindfulness as soon as we remember

201
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:23,680
so what i try to convey today is is how valuable it is to practice in

202
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:28,880
activities it's both valuable because it gives a heightened attention to what we're doing

203
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:35,280
which is nice but also it's a way of strengthening developing our capacity

204
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:41,920
for mindfulness capacity for awareness and that these activities that we do that's listed in this text each of them

205
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:47,599
is quite quite valuable and has a lot of potential even potential for

206
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:52,880
realization for waking up drinking uh you know drinking eating our food

207
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,920
drinking tea going to the bathroom all these things you know you don't want

208
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:04,960
you want to be present for them because who knows maybe today

209
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:10,400
the active some activity you're doing today is the activity that's going to be really

210
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:16,800
dharmically significant for you for your practice really significant and you don't want to miss it you don't want

211
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:23,920
to have glossed over it and um so but we don't know which one it

212
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:30,640
is so maybe be careful today with all your activities and who knows which one will bear some

213
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:37,160
wonderful fruit so um
