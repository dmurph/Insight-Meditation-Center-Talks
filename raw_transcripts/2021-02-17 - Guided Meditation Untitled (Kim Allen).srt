1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,799
okay so we'll go ahead and get started

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,480
um my name is kim allen and i've been

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,599
teaching at

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,639
imc for a while diana

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,519
is teaching a retreat this evening at

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,199
insight retreat center

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,599
so i'll be stepping in for her

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,279
so why don't we go ahead and begin as

9
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:26,240
usual with

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,599
a guided meditation

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,960
so allowing yourself to

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,079
settle in to

13
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,878
have a sense of arriving

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,719
maybe taking a long slow deep breath

15
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,719
just allowing the body and mind to

16
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:59,840
settle on the out breath

17
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,000
if you're comfortable doing so you can

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,040
close your eyes

19
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,960
just gently feeling the body

20
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,560
in the sitting posture

21
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:27,840
upright and also relaxed

22
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,640
so we allow the attention to come inward

23
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,680
you can begin to connect in with

24
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,320
the body

25
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:55,360
inviting ease through the body

26
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,320
so softening the muscles of the face

27
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,479
around the eyes around the mouth

28
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,399
relaxing the eyes and the eye sockets

29
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,720
releasing any tension in the jaw

30
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,920
down through the neck

31
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,599
letting the shoulders gently drop

32
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,840
relax soften

33
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,560
down into the chest area

34
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,840
the belly

35
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,519
letting the belly be round soft

36
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,280
all these places where we tend to hold

37
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,840
tension

38
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,640
letting go of any bracing in the legs

39
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,159
and extending awareness all the way into

40
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:47,840
the hands and the feet

41
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,120
inviting softness and ease

42
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,840
through the body

43
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,000
and then similarly we can invite ease in

44
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,639
the mind

45
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,320
so we bring in a gentle awareness

46
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,840
mindfulness of our experience

47
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,919
in a very simple way

48
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,280
even if parts of the body or the mind

49
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,520
are not at ease

50
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,280
we can be at ease with that

51
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:57,840
offering simple attention

52
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,960
often we will notice that there are

53
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,440
thoughts in the mind

54
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,720
thinking going on

55
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,280
it can be so easy to

56
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,080
wish that the thinking weren't there or

57
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,160
to

58
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,800
feel somehow that the thinking is

59
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,160
getting in the way

60
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,840
of meditation

61
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,759
if only my mind weren't thinking

62
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,840
then i could have a peaceful sitting

63
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,600
but this very wishing for it not to be

64
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,919
there

65
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:30,240
as a way of also being agitating for the

66
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,800
mind so

67
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,840
perhaps beginning this sit with the idea

68
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,720
that thinking

69
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,919
is not the enemy

70
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,240
actually thinking is very normal

71
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:03,840
that's what minds do

72
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,080
so perhaps seeing the thinking as a

73
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,960
natural

74
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,479
process when we notice it

75
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:30,400
ah there it is again

76
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,520
gently letting go

77
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:44,240
and knowing knowing the thought

78
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,240
it's enough to be mindful that there is

79
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,840
thinking

80
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,680
even a simple thought like thinking is

81
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,800
what minds do

82
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,319
or thinking is natural

83
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:27,840
it's a thought but it's a beneficial one

84
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:41,039
actually not all thought is unskillful

85
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,320
so continuing to rest the mind and the

86
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:55,839
body the breath

87
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,080
i'm seeing any thought that arises

88
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:09,839
simply as natural

89
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,680
it may be that simply having this

90
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,040
less aversive view of thought

91
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:33,839
already reduces its intensity

92
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,560
and even when the mind gets caught up

93
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,560
as soon as we realize that

94
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:01,839
just recognizing that thought is normal

95
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,079
perhaps adding a good thought about

96
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,839
the fact that we're sitting here

97
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,839
meditating

98
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,959
i'm returning to the breath of the body

99
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,040
no sense of diminishment of our

100
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,680
meditation

101
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,920
sitting with the normal flow of mind and

102
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,480
body

103
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:57,839
is meditation

104
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,920
you

105
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,160
as our connection to the breath and the

106
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,560
body

107
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,120
becomes even a little bit more

108
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,240
continuous

109
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,839
as we sit

110
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,360
it may become possible to

111
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,560
breathe through any thoughts

112
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,839
that arise in the mind

113
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,560
we sense the feelings of the breath

114
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,839
even while the thought is there

115
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,560
like wind blowing through

116
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:13,839
a cloth that's out on a line drying

117
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,160
thought is there and the breath just

118
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:27,839
passes through it in and out

119
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,160
another way of seeing it is to imagine

120
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:44,959
the breath

121
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,959
or the body in the foreground

122
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,160
and any thoughts

123
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,800
other such movements of mind to be in

124
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,680
the background

125
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,800
still somewhat there but just in the

126
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,839
background

127
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,600
just gently favoring the present moment

128
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,319
experience

129
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:31,040
and letting the thoughts ripple in the

130
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,839
background

131
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,159
from time to time

132
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,559
checking in again with the body

133
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,039
softening any tension that may have

134
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,600
built up

135
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,240
allowing the breath to flow

136
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,200
throughout the body

137
00:20:51,760 --> 00:21:03,840
and even through the thoughts that arise

138
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,400
imagining that we could relax the

139
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:31,840
thinking muscle

140
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,960
and in the last five minutes of our

141
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,240
meditation together

142
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,060
i will offer a reflection

143
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:30,119
[Music]

144
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,880
question

145
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,000
the aim is not to

146
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,880
think about it

147
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,120
but more like when we drop a

148
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,039
stone down into a well

149
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,000
a sound will come back

150
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,840
and we just let that ripple through

151
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,240
the body the heart the mind

152
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:15,840
and then go back to the silence

153
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,090
so i'll ask the question

154
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:23,919
[Music]

155
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,880
let me just see what comes back listen

156
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,360
to it

157
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,120
but let it pass by and then i will ask

158
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:43,840
the question again

159
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:51,120
what about the dharma

160
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:57,840
touches my heart

161
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,640
what about the dharma

162
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,840
touches my heart

163
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,080
perhaps the answer was

164
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,520
simple perhaps it was different first

165
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,400
and second time

166
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,559
perhaps it had no words and was just a

167
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,600
feeling

168
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,840
or a body sensation

169
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,440
these reflections are

170
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,960
a skillful use of the

171
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:49,840
thinking mind the mind with language

172
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,399
and once more

173
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,039
what about the dharma

174
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:17,840
touches my heart

175
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,080
you
