1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:09,559
hello and welcome to our meditation session

2
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:14,799
and and this week we're focusing

3
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:21,480
on what hinders our ability to be mindful present steady in our

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,640
practice and today the topic is the second hindrance uh which is a verion

5
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,680
it's usually translated into English and are are kind of Buddhist scene as

6
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:39,760
aversion though the poly word uh more accurately means ill will so it contains

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,160
a certain degree of hostility in it so it's more than simply not wanting

8
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:51,520
something but rather it's uh pushing something away or pulling away in a way

9
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:58,600
that is is uh hostile or uh has animosity in it towards

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:04,640
whatever is going on and uh and to understand this

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:11,159
better uh we can distinguish uh two kinds of

12
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:19,600
averting two ways of saying no one is with love and the other is

13
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:30,720
with hatred and uh one is with um Goodwill or kindness or

14
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,119
well-wishing and the other is with uh wishing uh ill for something or someone

15
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:43,040
another is with hostility uh with uh some some degree of

16
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,840
animosity and the difference between these is huge and how it can feel inside us is

17
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,360
different that when there's a feeling of of uh

18
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,479
free free free Loving Feeling a love that's

19
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:07,399
doesn't contain clinging as part of it doesn't uh there's no compulsion in the

20
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:14,680
love it's just a generosity love which is generous it can be a strong no to

21
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:23,000
something and uh when it's uh when the know is hostile it comes with tension

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,040
with strain with a closing down with tightening of the fist in the heart or

23
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:36,480
the mind let alone the physical hand and uh and to be able to feel the

24
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:43,519
difference one is nurturing nourishing one is uh might be energizing but it's

25
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:49,599
energy which is draining energy which is uh uh contains uh irritation or

26
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:57,080
suffering as part of it and so for this meditation I would like to suggest that

27
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:03,360
um uh you learn to say no during the meditation

28
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:10,360
lovingly and learn how you say no in a way that is the opposite of

29
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:16,720
love the opposite of well-wishing or care kindness

30
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:23,080
generosity so uh a loving way of saying no is to see that your mind begins going

31
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:29,799
into certain trains of thought which you know you've done before maybe it's resentment about

32
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:36,080
someone and you've done this many many times before uh same kinds of thoughts and you

33
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,239
see that they are don't serve you at all maybe even they're harmful for you and

34
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:46,599
you lovingly say no not going to have those

35
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:53,159
thoughts you are involved in certain preoccupations that involves

36
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:58,519
hostility and you say lovingly no this is not the time for that I'm not going

37
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:05,439
to do that and um uh on the other hand there might

38
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,760
be some thoughts you have or some experiences you have maybe your knee

39
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:19,239
hurts maybe your your breathing is not quite what it wanted to be your uncomfortable in some way and you have a

40
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:25,840
kind of a a stressful strain full aversion to it there's a some modum of

41
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:33,280
ill will or or hostility or animosity or um irritation

42
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:40,600
annoyance that's contained in the no not another uh you know aching knee no you

43
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:49,400
know let's get rid of it this is terrible and and there's kind of a sense of anger in it in that ill will that

44
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,479
know and so see if you can see that difference and if you

45
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,759
can um lovingly say no to the hostility

46
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,960
meaning don't give into it don't pick it up don't participate in it even if it

47
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,960
keeps moving through you step away and see it clearly for what it is and to

48
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,680
make this distinction between a healthy no appropriate no

49
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,080
that's loving and you kind of enjoy doing it even though you know just enjoy

50
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:30,800
it because it comes from love it comes from knowing what's best and uh and

51
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:38,440
distinguishing distinguishing that with that which is not healthy that's harmful even and um and keep choosing the

52
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:47,400
healthy no and apply it to your meditation watch your mind watch what you're involved in

53
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:57,080
and if it's not a healthy engagement with waking up being present in a mindful clear clean

54
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,400
way maybe you say no but lovingly

55
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:08,039
kindly in a way that maybe even inspires you to say no like oh this is caring for

56
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:15,840
me this is knowing what's best this is moving in a good direction and if your whole mental

57
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:22,639
physical system says no with hostility See Clearly that's the

58
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,840
case and especially if it involves trains of

59
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:37,120
thought so may this support you to be

60
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,400
present saying lovingly no to whatever takes you away from being present here

61
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:49,160
and now awake clear steady in the

62
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,800
moment so gently closing your

63
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:01,400
eyes feeling your body your body breathing

64
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,400
breathing and perhaps

65
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:16,638
saying a friendly kind warmhearted

66
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:24,280
yes yes to being here and present in this body in this

67
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:32,560
experience yes to being mindful being aware here

68
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:41,080
and now and lovingly without

69
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:48,560
demands without hostility no not

70
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,879
now for thoughts that take you

71
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,319
away and so we'll sit quietly

72
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240

for

107
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:24,320
being here and now here in your

108
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,360
body is there something within you

109
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:35,400
that welcomes you with a yes yes be

110
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:43,720
here in the breathing in the body in the

111
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,600
awareness and whatever takes you

112
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:59,440
away from what is good in the body mind heart right now gently

113
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,559
lovingly say no not

114
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
now

115
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,760
and as we come to the end of this

116
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:51,640
sitting letting go gently

117
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:59,039
lovingly for everything that takes you away from being here in your

118
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:06,120
body aware open

119
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:17,919
receptive here with some whatever degree of calm or

120
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,720
stability that might have

121
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:33,039
developed and is there something

122
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:44,158
here that's appropriate to say yes to a

123
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:53,158
yes to awareness being here this

124
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,600
way

125
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:08,039
and is there now a clear sense

126
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:16,720
of a Kind no that lets you that lets go or steps

127
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:22,000
away from participating in things which are not

128
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:29,520
healthy or useful for you

129
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:40,799
and in this way your orientation can

130
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:45,639
be towards not making things

131
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:50,759
worse and instead to make things

132
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:59,159
better and as we come to the end of the sitting to

133
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:04,760
imagine being in the world of people and

134
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:08,960
activities with this

135
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:15,120
orientation don't make the situation

136
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:22,480
worse if you can make it

137
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:31,440
better and at least with your Good Will and your

138
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:37,279
kindness at least with the wisdom that knows to say

139
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:41,120
no to making it

140
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:52,760
worse may all beings be

141
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:59,398
happy may all beings be safe

142
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,159
may all beings be

143
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:10,399
peaceful may all beings be

144
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:23,690
[Music]

145
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:29,320
free thank you

146
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,240
e

147
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:50,600
so hello on this second uh day five days of doing discussing the

148
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:57,039
hindrances and this is building on the introduction to meditation series that

149
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:04,399
just just finished with the idea that once you have the basic practice

150
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:13,360
basic instructions for mindfulness practice that one of the really important next steps is to understand

151
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:20,080
what interferes or hinders your mindfulness practice and

152
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:26,639
that uh and that does two things it helps to settle the things that

153
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:32,519
interfere so it's easier to be present and and wonderfully what it does you

154
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:40,159
learn the art of making what uh hinders uh our mindfulness our

155
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:46,320
steadiness our calm to whatever that is to make it the object of awareness the

156
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:55,000
object of mindfulness and anything that can be made the object of mindfulness can be um uh can be related

157
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:01,320
to peacefully can be related to without clinging or

158
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:09,480
hostility and the Beautiful and inspiring thing at least for me of this mindfulness practice that whatever you

159
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,760
can be mindful of there's a the possibility of finding freedom in

160
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:20,159
relationship to it and to find be able to find Freedom anything that in the

161
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:28,080
world of experience means that freedom can be all-encompassing 360°

162
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,200
freedom and uh it's not an aloofness it's not a

163
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:40,240
disconnection it's in some sense it's the opposite it's it's uh it's learning

164
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:46,200
how to not to be entangled so that we can be connected with warmth with

165
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:52,919
kindness with love with Good Will to ourselves and to the world around

166
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:59,039
us so but that's an ideal that's maybe the direction we're going and so one of

167
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:05,440
the things we need to learn is how to turn the attention mindfulness to uh the

168
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:14,799
ways that we are aversive and um the ways in which we have ill will or irritation hostility

169
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:19,880
annoyance uh towards uh ourselves towards our experience towards other

170
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:26,240
people towards the world itself and um and generally in English

171
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:31,399
the word of verion um represents some form of

172
00:33:31,399 --> 00:33:39,039
hostility or anger or um some degree or other and um like you want to get rid of

173
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:44,399
something in a in a um hostile way

174
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:51,159
and and um and some people uh will walk through the world with an attitude of

175
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:57,000
that kind of hostility of ill will they're looking to find they're looking for what is wrong they're looking for

176
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,080
what is uh what to be critical of and angry about they're looking they're

177
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:08,878
they're it's almost like a atmosphere of aversion they walking through with walking in the world with and some

178
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:14,720
people it's something that comes up periodically maybe periodically good part of the day but it's not an

179
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:21,358
overarching attitude by which we're living and um and it can be quite strong

180
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:27,079
certain events can give arise to anger in such that way that we're really um

181
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:33,000
feeling you a lot of animosity towards someone else or some situation and

182
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,320
um and it could be uh some of us sometimes have C certain degree of

183
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:44,480
animosity or ill will or I don't know if that's exactly the right word but uh

184
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:50,760
there's certainly stress and strain and anger and um eyes that have darts in

185
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:57,200
them towards uh our our our computers when they're not or the technology or

186
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:04,119
what we're trying to do there we can't figure it out and um so it doesn't it's not it's sometimes in adate objects too

187
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:10,680
that we have this with assigning blame criticism elsewhere

188
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:19,240
so these things exist for human beings and the radical art that we're doing here in mindfulness is to fold this into

189
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:26,359
our mindfulness meaning this too we're going to be aware of but not aware of it

190
00:35:26,359 --> 00:35:33,040
to anticipate but to be aware as if we're stepping back away from it one

191
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:39,160
step turning around and looking it at it and saying I see you this is aversion

192
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:44,520
this is hostility this is uh uh um you

193
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:51,200
know um the darts of the eyes that are going out to uh to kind of stare at

194
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:56,960
something and indicate you know you are you know I'm angry with you this is how

195
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:04,480
it is this is how the tension in the body builds up but we look at it and we look at it

196
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:10,200
with kindness we look at it with freedom with non-reactivity with without being

197
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:15,280
caught in its grip and aversion wanting to get rid of something or wanting to

198
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:23,599
get away from it because it's so terrible um can be uh a um a tremendous

199
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:30,640
stress and strain it can be a kind of um causing harm even to ourselves and it

200
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:36,160
might not seem that way because what's happening might be like this is this is

201
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:43,960
really uncomfortable for me that I'm being hardened by it but sometimes that's true but sometimes it's our

202
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:51,599
reactivity our values our fear our um Pride that is being made

203
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:56,920
uncomfortable that makes us want to or our desires are not being met and and so

204
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:04,359
somehow so sometimes we have attached to desires desires aren't being fulfilled something THS it and so now we're angry

205
00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:12,040
at what thoughts or desires all present an entanglement there is a healthy form of

206
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:18,599
aversion there is a healthy way of saying no that arises out of love and if

207
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:26,280
the word love is too sweet too Grand then uh arises out of Good Will arises

208
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:32,680
out of a friendliness a generosity of spirit arises out of wanting the best for

209
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:42,839
everyone concerned and um arises out of a goodness or uh or Rises out of wisdom

210
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:49,960
that of you say no uh I'm not going to be involved with the version that way I'm not going to be

211
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:57,160
involved in those thoughts or at least no I don't condone this I'm not

212
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:03,319
I don't want to invest myself in this might be a I might might might not be able to stop having those thoughts but I

213
00:38:03,319 --> 00:38:11,119
don't have to be those thoughts I don't have to fall into them and believe them or um you know and so but that's can be

214
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:19,680
down with love when there's something that needs to be say we say no in the world like say no to some other person

215
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:27,119
for what they're doing uh can that be done with love as opposed to with hostility and aversion what are we

216
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:32,640
trying to accomplish when we are aversive what are we trying to accomplish when we have

217
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:39,119
hostility and animosity is it simply to protect ourselves and to push the other person

218
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:44,480
away is it to uh retribution to somehow

219
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,760
cause them to feel uncomfortable for them to get the message and to to cower

220
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:56,119
or feel hurt or to um uh be a little more submissive or what is it that we're

221
00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:02,640
trying to to do in the aversive and is it necessary is there a

222
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:08,119
better way is there a better way to say no is

223
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:14,800
there a way of saying no that doesn't break the connection doesn't fracture

224
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:21,040
relationships doesn't um uh diminish other people or see them only through

225
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:26,960
the lens of how they are wrong to us but rather see them

226
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:34,839
as valuable people as people that it's possible to have a warm kind friendly

227
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:41,680
relationship to if they would allow it but we say no with

228
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:48,560
confidence but know that keeps the door open and know that clearly shows that

229
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:55,280
we're willing to be in relationship if they um if they um

230
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,680
change if they are different different but they feel that the no is not angry

231
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:07,560
it's not hostile and um so this is not necessar this is not

232
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:13,319
easy to do but uh the Dharma practice is a

233
00:40:13,319 --> 00:40:19,560
Dharma of saying yes to whatever

234
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:26,680
supports freedom in US say yes to whatever helps the nourish the yes

235
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:32,680
qualities of who we are to come forth in the world and sometimes that

236
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:40,760
yes requires us to say no to certain things and um no I'm not going to be

237
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:46,119
hostile no I'm not going to um uh scare

238
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:55,119
this person with my anger I'm not going no I'm not going to shut my the person down um with anger in such a way that um

239
00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:00,880
diminishes them or shut T them up yes I'd like to be present yes I'd like to

240
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:06,040
say no in a way that um respects

241
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:13,119
them where I get care for myself appropriately but it also haven't shut

242
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:18,400
this person out of my heart it's easier said than

243
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:24,720
done but it can be learned and it can be learned by

244
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:29,920
anybody uh in way that we can take care of

245
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:37,720
ourselves Dharma practice is a practice of taking care of ourselves and so in the process of doing

246
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:44,760
it we learn how to say no to making things

247
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,440
worse and if we get our way by being angry hostile to

248
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:57,839
somebody or something uh chances are in the bigger picture of things we're making the the whole thing

249
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:03,680
worse how do we take care of ourselves and others how do we take care

250
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:11,599
of things uh uh so they're better this is the art of Dharma practice and so the

251
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:16,680
simplest formulation of this that you little slogan you can take with you is

252
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:22,400
don't make it worse if what you're going to say is going to make the situation worse don't

253
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:29,000
do it and rather make it

254
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:35,280
better and over time with dmer practice we learn become wiser and

255
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:41,319
wiser what the nature of worse is the full implications of what we do

256
00:42:41,319 --> 00:42:46,880
and how it comes back at us and and affects us and and uh in our

257
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:54,079
relationships and over time we also learn what makes it better and uh and to learn to say no to

258
00:42:54,079 --> 00:43:01,280
making it worse can be an acto of love not an act of hostility to

259
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:08,800
say yes to making it better does not have to be greed does not have to be

260
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:14,040
clinging um but it in the in the bigger picture

261
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:19,800
this yes to what that makes it better is a yes that leaves us more free and

262
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:27,319
protected in a certain way in a good way so um

263
00:43:27,319 --> 00:43:32,880
so may you today uh explore your

264
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:38,480
relationship to this General category that fit what what fits under this

265
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:45,680
General category that I'm calling no when you have no attitude to

266
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:50,839
anything can that can you avoid making it worse can you avoid that hostility in

267
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:56,880
that no and if it's necessary to say no can you explore

268
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:05,240
how do you do it with love with Good Will and uh and if this is the way you

269
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:11,520
learn to become wise about the second hindrance the hindrance of

270
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:18,440
aversion uh it'll be time really well spent thank

271
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,920
you
