1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,960
so hello everyone welcome

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:12,679
and as an introduction to today's meditation

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,840
it's as if we have two bodies two physical

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:29,039
bodies that we one that's the body we have when we're not

5
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:36,399
mindful the other when we are mindful of the body

6
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:43,680
we have two minds two thinking minds

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,000
one when we are not mindful not aware of what we're thinking

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,440
and one that is when we're aware when we're mindful

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,480
we have two emotional bodies when we're not aware of our emotions and

10
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,880
when we're aware of emotions we have two

11
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:16,400
faculties of intentionality of motivation of purpose

12
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,479
of desire and there's one that when we're aware

13
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,680
and one when we're not aware it's a world of difference it's

14
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,840
almost as if we live in two worlds we live in a world when we're not aware of the world

15
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,759
it's lost in our thoughts and we live in a different world when we're aware

16
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:47,280
and this idea that we live in there's there's two there's these these uh being aware and not being aware

17
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,479
is so radically different it's like two different worlds

18
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:59,119
different causes and conditions come into play when we're not aware

19
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:05,759
than when we are aware it's almost as if we have two selves that which we who we are and how we

20
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,280
behave and exist when we're not aware and when we are aware

21
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,280
and so a huge part of buddhist practice of sativatana the main part of it

22
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:25,120
is to live a life that is aware as we do this meditation

23
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:37,519
see if you can you can see the difference between what's happening

24
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:45,040
when you're not aware maybe you realize it afterwards and when you are aware

25
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:51,440
and let the awareness be and not be something that you have to work at

26
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:58,239
maybe you have to work at remembering to be aware maybe you have to work to come back

27
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,280
to awareness maybe you have to work at at um

28
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,760
hanging in there with it letting go of the distractions

29
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,599
but don't let awareness be work let awareness be something you

30
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:21,519
allow to be there and sometimes you're aware of the body

31
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,879
sometimes the feelings sometimes mind states emotions

32
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:33,360
sometimes the mental processes and purposes desires aversions

33
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,360
aspirations sometimes sounds

34
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,840
all kinds of things so you see if you can see the difference

35
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:52,879
between when you're aware in a relaxed way almost effortless way

36
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:58,000
and when you're not aware at all and in between that is the practice of

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,400
coming back of waking up of letting go but you're waking up and letting go into

38
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,760
something which is easy effortless just to know what's happening in the

39
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,799
simplest possible way

40
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,880
so we'll sit quietly and i hope you enjoy

41
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,160
the world of awareness

42
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,560
so

43
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,519
so

44
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,519
so

45
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,480
so

46
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,840
um

47
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:01,200
when you come into awareness

48
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:10,320
how do things change that's different

49
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,399
if they don't come into awareness

50
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:22,559
thinking when it comes into awareness emotions

51
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,960
body experiences

52
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,520
so

53
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,240
so

54
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,600
so

55
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,278
and as we come to the end of the sitting

56
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,480
there's a world of difference

57
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:49,600
when we're with other people and we're

58
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:57,039
aware clearly openly a sense of presence really present for

59
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:03,039
someone versus not being aware

60
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:08,960
or not being aware of how we're abiding in our thoughts our

61
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,159
judgments our anxieties our expectations

62
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:21,840
all kinds of ways in which simple awareness is complicated when we're with other people

63
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:35,440
and there is the world a difference between having all these complications in our

64
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,559
relationship to other people present as we're with them

65
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,799
and being away and not know it

66
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:53,840
and then being aware of it wearing being aware of how we are and

67
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:59,600
the unnecessary complications we make not to judge it but

68
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,320
simply to be aware to know that that's happening

69
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,120
it's a different world when we trust awareness

70
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:21,200
the awareness that protects us from rushing ahead and

71
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:27,880
believing and doing the things that maybe are not so healthy

72
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:37,440
and to what we learn in meditation mindfulness meditation

73
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:45,039
may be something we bring with us into the world of other people

74
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:50,919
so that we know how to be present for others with real awareness

75
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:54,559
uncomplicated awareness

76
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,760
so that when the people we're with are distressed

77
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:08,960
we are not distressed but we're there present understanding how they are

78
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:15,200
empathic when others are

79
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:23,039
grieving let us be present aware kindly openly understandingly

80
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:28,080
and not be caught in the web of sadness and grief

81
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:36,000
to remember to be aware when the people with are dying

82
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:44,640
to have learned the ability to be present aware an uncomplicated way fully there

83
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:50,799
is a gift may it be that this practice that

84
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:57,919
sativatana that we do may we bring it into the world

85
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:05,919
so that we can love the world care for the world you see wisely the world

86
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:13,039
and be protected from the

87
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:21,120
inner tendencies we have that make things more difficult and

88
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:27,919
harmful may we through practice of awareness

89
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:33,320
be a source of welfare and happiness for the world

90
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,279
so

91
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:05,279
thank you so hello and

92
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:13,200
we come to the final talk now over 70 talks on

93
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:19,360
the sati patana and it's a practice

94
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:26,960
this is the practice of mindfulness by which we're cultivating and developing a heightened capacity for awareness

95
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:33,200
i like i like myself the language of lucid awareness clear awareness

96
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,320
that's available and present for us as we go through our life

97
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:46,399
the in this text there are 13 exercises

98
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:52,559
that we've gone through bit by bit and and the relationship between the

99
00:31:52,559 --> 00:32:00,240
exercises and the awareness that's being developed is similar to

100
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:09,120
the idea of running if someone says i run

101
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:15,279
i'm running or something oh it doesn't tell you much about what what that's about

102
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:21,440
it's possible they're running for exercise

103
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,480
it's possible they're running to catch the bus

104
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:33,200
it's possible they're running from the police just telling them they're running doesn't say much

105
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:39,200
but if you tell them if they tell you that they're training they're running

106
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,799
in training as their training program and running then you get a clear sense of the

107
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:50,000
running now it's an exercise it's a protocol they're following

108
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:57,360
they're probably doing sprints and long distance and exercising strengthening and uh you know all kinds of things you

109
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:02,960
might be doing if you're training to run like trying to run for a race or something

110
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:09,440
and so there's a lot of things you do but what you're learning is developing your capacity for running

111
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,880
until the running becomes you know i mean we it feel can feel effortless at some point if you're

112
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:20,080
really in the flow of running even though a lot of energy is being expended

113
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:25,679
and we can feel like you're abiding in the running and running just kind of like looks like we're being carried

114
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:31,440
along with it whereas in the beginning of training it was hard and you had to apply yourself

115
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:37,679
and there was resistance to it so the same thing the 13 exercises is

116
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:43,200
the training in awareness and they involve other kinds of

117
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,480
you know other things training exercises we do and

118
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,679
areas of practicing and a lot of that training has to do with knowing recognition of

119
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:59,039
what's there and and as the recognition grows

120
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:04,880
then awareness develops and that awareness can be stay with you for a while

121
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,878
sometimes it might stay for a few seconds sometimes it might stay for a few minutes sometimes a few hours sometimes

122
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:16,000
longer you really feel like now there's the awareness is kind of for a while

123
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,839
ever present or continuously present for a period of time and

124
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:28,480
and that awareness makes a world of difference you might still be

125
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:35,118
have all kinds of inner challenges and you might have fear and desire and anger and

126
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:42,878
attachments of all kinds but the art of awareness is like a now we have a like a separate

127
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:49,040
place to abide in it's like your whole house is is dirty

128
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,158
but the living room is clean and from living room you can see all the rooms

129
00:34:54,159 --> 00:35:00,320
but you're not disturbed by it because you've learned that you can clean the living room and there's no need to dirty

130
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,359
the living room by being upset by what's in the other rooms but with time you'll

131
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:12,240
go there and and clean them up and take care of it you know how to do it now so we have this awareness and there's

132
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:18,079
actually a kind of a of um of a relaxed feeling

133
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:24,560
about our shortcomings uh it doesn't mean we indulge in them it doesn't mean that we

134
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:30,800
celebrate them and just kind of barrel ahead with them but it means that we don't criticize

135
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:36,400
ourselves or upset over ourselves or um are burdened by our shortcomings of

136
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:42,079
course we have shortcomings court their desires and attachments that's what we're working with that's

137
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:47,359
where we're training and developing more and more this capacity for awareness

138
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:54,480
but as the awareness gets stronger at some point this point it becomes clear

139
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,760
that that is the best alternative that's the better place to be in awareness

140
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:05,440
and being aware of everything else that tends to shift everything else towards health

141
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:12,400
that tends to shift things in a skillful healthy way it makes room for healthy mind states

142
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:18,400
and motivations and wisdom to occur when awareness begins to be present in

143
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,520
an open relaxed way we know how to be aware of what's happening

144
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:28,960
and um at some point that oh satypation doing the practice doing the practice at

145
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:35,119
some point doing this satipatana practice the awareness becomes so

146
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:42,000
um clear that we say it's kind of like an aha moment oh

147
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,760
now i know what this practice is about now i know kind of something about freedom

148
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:53,520
now i know about not getting caught in anything including my shortcomings i don't have to be

149
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,720
drowned by them or upset with them it just that's what the mind is doing

150
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:07,280
and now i know there's and there's this place of freedom this place of open awareness this place of lucid awareness

151
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:12,960
that uh we know that it really makes an impression for me for the first time like wow

152
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,640
this is fantastic the um and then

153
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:25,520
that's a confirmation of the practice of sati patana that said oh this practice kind of

154
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:31,200
brought this about this clear lucid awareness this freedom of awareness

155
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:36,720
and now that's what sati patana is about is to cultivate and develop

156
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:43,520
this strong sense of awareness the strong awareness and and then

157
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:50,240
after that clarity um tendency is that a person is more

158
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:57,520
ethical but there's no guarantee but the tendency is because this field of awareness is so wholesome it lets us

159
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:04,880
see and feel the impact that our inner behavior has and our external behavior what we do and

160
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,079
we can feel how we're diminished by unethical behavior

161
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:16,320
and how we're kind of enhanced by ethical behavior so the tendency to start being more interested in being

162
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:23,200
ethical and not causing harm in the world or any kind of eventually any kind at all

163
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:30,160
once this kind of clarity this aha moment happens and now i know what the practice is about now i know something

164
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:35,599
about it then the practice of satipattana doesn't

165
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:42,560
change it becomes the same practice we do the same thing again and again

166
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,920
though now there's a reference point for it this little this clarity of awareness

167
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:53,920
it becomes easier to do we can fall back into awareness more clearly or some qualities

168
00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:01,119
characteristics of this lucid awareness might be with us all the time even though it's not always there strongly

169
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:09,040
and then the practice develops and then at some point this experience of aha and freedom of awareness

170
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:14,320
comes to full maturation and in this tradition you talk about full

171
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:21,200
awakening full enlightenment and um and

172
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:26,960
you know the i don't i've never met anyone i know that had that full awakening full

173
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,079
enlightenment i've been a lot around a lot of wonderful buddhist teachers

174
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:39,040
but i know that that's a possibility that's a direction we can go once you have enough practice and enough aha this

175
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:45,520
works this is what it's about then you can you have a clear sense it's just other rooms in the house

176
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:51,680
and it's possible to clean it all out someone can do that for themselves no doubt about it

177
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:56,720
and whether but it's a big task and so whether

178
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:03,119
there are people in the modern world that you can meet who've done that it's an open question it's hard to know

179
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:09,040
but but doesn't matter so much for oneself because one knows this is the direction we're going there's no other

180
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:16,079
thing to do the buddha said that once you become fully awakened

181
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:21,920
then the practice of satina becomes the same

182
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:28,560
for the buddha that's a person who practice who is fully awakened continues to practice satipatana

183
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:34,560
maybe it isn't so much exercise anymore but rather it's a kind of a way of being

184
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,240
but he's still exactly the same instructions are given for people who are fully awakened

185
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:46,400
so whether we're new to practice and you're developing the practice in

186
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,520
satipatana whether we know what the practice is about

187
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,960
which is the when a person becomes called a trainee

188
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:03,760
sometimes it's referred to as stream entry um then after that it's the same practice

189
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:10,560
and if you become fully awakened it's the same practice jack cornfield has this title of a book

190
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:16,079
called you know after the ex after the ecstasy the laundry um

191
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:22,480
the uh another way another thing that from this what i'm teaching here today from the from the buddha he said he

192
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,359
would you know his title of his book would be um

193
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:35,040
before awakening after partial awakening

194
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:41,440
sati patana after a full awakening satipatana and that

195
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:48,880
this is the practice for a lifetime there's no end to it it's always we're doing it and it's not a burden it's not

196
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:54,079
a doesn't feel like a work it just becomes more and more natural becomes who we are

197
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:59,680
and it becomes trusting living an awareness more than anything else living and being

198
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:06,319
present for experience and and the alternative to not be aware

199
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:13,359
is clearly not as good not as wonderful not as enjoyable and not as helpful for the

200
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:18,960
world because to know something about freedom from attachments and clinging

201
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:25,280
then uh we know what other people are uh what's up what's possible for other

202
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:31,359
people what their potential is and then we can somehow support that

203
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:37,760
and and just like uh so if you follow this path

204
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:44,560
to the freedom freedom from clinging to lucid awareness

205
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:50,160
you're being supported fully that's the most wonderful thing you can do for yourself and

206
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:56,079
you become a model you become a exemplar and you become someone who can

207
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:02,079
recognize and support that possibility for other people that other people too can

208
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:08,800
attain more and more freedom in a deep way rather than having to accommodate

209
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:15,760
suffering put up with suffering assuage suffering with

210
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:21,680
compassion and self-care which is a wonderful thing to do but to limit be limited by that

211
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:27,280
is to be limited to open up into this world of freedom a full awareness

212
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:33,040
everybody has that potential and it's a game changer

213
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:40,319
but it doesn't change sati patana sati patana sutta satibata practice the

214
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:46,560
training of it before awakening and after awakening

215
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:51,359
after sati patana more sativatana

216
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:58,400
so thank you for this and i hope that

217
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:04,079
the joy of awareness the joy of mindfulness becomes

218
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:09,200
your joy and that it's contagious
