1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:07,120
welcome everyone welcome nice to see you all and to

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,680
practice

3
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:20,439
together so tonight I wanted to talk a little bit about some attitudes that we might bring

4
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:27,439
to practice that might uh unknowingly have a big impact like some of these attitudes we

5
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:34,239
might we might not even know that we have them and yet their influence is really

6
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:41,120
great not only in our practice but in our life but we can see them and maybe

7
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,000
work with them in a particular way with our meditation

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,680
practice and one attitude in particular is one that would like I want to say of

9
00:00:52,680 --> 00:01:00,280
course we have it kind like living in these uh Modern Times And that is we might have this

10
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,560
mindset or this idea that it's so important that we're always making

11
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:14,360
progress we have to be like moving forward we have this idea that uh we

12
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:21,240
have to always always be improving or moving closer and closer to achieving

13
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,640
something or have to be advancing or developing or getting better and you

14
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:34,240
know all this things you kind of get this idea right the sense of like okay we have to be going forward of course we have this

15
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,040
idea of course we do I mean our kind of like there's a

16
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:47,960
developmental model right just like human development is that as we age in theory we're maturing and

17
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:54,960
getting wiser and wiser and learning things but not only that that we have

18
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:02,680
kind of a um society that kind of promotes that and how many podcasts and

19
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,920
YouTube videos are about how to fix yourself or be more productive or how

20
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,840
many apps are all about uh this kind of thing right it's such a and then

21
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,239
certainly that um when I was working in Corporate America you know there was a

22
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,519
with the people that reported to me we have a little developmental plan for them here's are the some of the things

23
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:31,080
to work on if you wanted to get a promotion here's what to do you know this type of stuff

24
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,640
right of course we bring that to our meditation practice

25
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:43,959
too but that only works until it

26
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:49,000
doesn't and it actually doesn't work nearly as well as we think it should or

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,560
ought to or we often like are bringing this idea so we may think that somehow like

28
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:03,400
when we're meditating somehow we should be like making things

29
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,680
happen this sense of you know movement or progress or like you know it's

30
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:14,680
certainly I'm getting better or learning something or something's going to be different now

31
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:20,200
or this sense of well even if I'm not like making things happen then I should

32
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:26,040
have some kind of special experience because I'm sitting down to

33
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:33,720
meditate and whatever medit type of meditation practice you do here primarily we do or teach about uh

34
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:40,799
mindfulness we might have this feeling well because I'm doing this mindfulness practice something special should happen

35
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,080
even if we're not even clear what this special thing should be it should be

36
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,799
special or maybe we have the idea maybe it's not even clear clearly articulated

37
00:03:52,799 --> 00:04:00,560
in our minds but we have this idea whatever it is it shouldn't always be how it was before like it should be

38
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:07,599
different or you know somehow the sense of easier or something not not like the

39
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:13,560
last time not having anything difficult or

40
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:22,040
uncomfortable but here's what's happening here's what happens and this is really subtle this is partly why I

41
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:28,400
mentioned that we can see in our meditation practi is often we can't see it in our daily

42
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,320
life but if if we have this expectation this attitude of we should

43
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:43,960
always be making progress then that introduces this subtle little bit of

44
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:50,680
agitation whatever is happening right now it's not quite good

45
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,280
enough we have to be better there has to be this way and

46
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:03,080
somehow it has to be uh different than how it it was was before and there's can be this sense of yeah well this isn't

47
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,880
good enough I should be progressing whatever it is we're

48
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,479
experiencing so often we there's this subtle little sense of yeah okay whatever but what's

49
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:19,840
next or are we there yet am I there

50
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:26,240
yet this little subtle agitation that is kind of like uh even

51
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:33,319
the we're always like looking to what's next and like okay there's to be something better or something or I

52
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:39,080
should be whatever is going to happen next and this subtle little agitation

53
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:48,199
just really shows up in so many different ways that we don't even notice it in fact it might even be so prevalent

54
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:54,440
in our experience we don't even notice it or we think that's of course it's

55
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:01,080
there I can't be with this present moment don't be ridiculous Diana

56
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:08,599
there's this way which we always need to be thinking about the next thing or somehow have this expectation that it

57
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:16,080
should be better or we should be moving forward or we should be making progress or something like this and we might say

58
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,360
this agitation is a subtle form of

59
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,840
disappointment oh this again even if it's a little bit better than

60
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:33,400
before I still don't feel like I'm completely awakened I'm not a Buddha

61
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:39,800
yet so there's this little you know subtle form of

62
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:45,960
disappointment and what is disappointment disappointment arises when our expectations aren't met but

63
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:52,800
what are expectations one way we might consider

64
00:06:52,800 --> 00:07:01,520
expectations is that we come up with a scenario in our mind

65
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:08,280
100% in our minds it only exists in our minds the

66
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:13,400
same way that we have that fleeting thought like oh those are nice shoes or

67
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:20,639
oh yeah maybe I'll have a sandwich for breakfast or lunch or you know these are just thoughts right that just arise and

68
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:28,639
pass away and how many thoughts do we have throughout the day countless but some of those thoughts are

69
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:35,440
about what should happen What should happen we've painted

70
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:41,080
a scenario 100% in the mind it's based on you know experience

71
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:47,840
so we're not crazy having this but still it is 100% in our minds it has the same

72
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:54,560
substance the same durability the same

73
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,840
um fleetingness or lack of substantiality

74
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:06,800
has the same thoughts of oh you have to remember to pick up milk when I get

75
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,800
home why is that person driving so slowly what's I wonder if my favorite

76
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:22,319
podcast has a new episode right these are just all these thoughts that we have expectations are our having a

77
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,800
thought and then transposing it onto the

78
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,839
experience there's What's happen happening with the body

79
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:38,279
experiences feelings in the body like Sensations in the body

80
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:44,200
emotions there's that what's happening and then on top of it is something

81
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:50,880
that's just got cooked up in our minds and there's a

82
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,240
gap of course there's a gap like how could there not be a gap we never like

83
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:02,839
100% you know know exactly how everything's going to be everything's always a little bit different and this

84
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:11,040
Gap is this where this sense of agitation or the sense of disappointment comes from because not only do we have

85
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,959
this thought that uh how the present moment should

86
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:22,640
be accompanying that thought is the idea and there should be no gap between

87
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,000
what's actually happening and the thoughts we have about

88
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,480
it then this in some ways there's this uh sense that well

89
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:43,200
somehow our experience should change to match what's in our

90
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,279
minds and there's this agitation when it doesn't

91
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:57,040
happen this is one way in which we my think about this

92
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:03,680
is that the truth is is what's happening is what's happening

93
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:10,760
the the experience that we have in the body right now the pressure of the chair or the cushion against the body the

94
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:16,000
sounds of my voice or whatever sounds the visual things that we're saying

95
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,600
that's what's happening also there's this thoughts in the mind but there's a way in which

96
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:30,640
without our really being aware of it we have this expectation

97
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,160
that things should match what's in our minds and when they're not there's a

98
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:42,639
sense of agitation so our experiences they won't

99
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:47,880
change at that moment is that moment it's the experience as it is of course

100
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:53,079
it's going to change the next moment but it's not going to change to precisely

101
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:58,240
much our expectation it's not going to change to

102
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:04,360
make that subtle sense of agitation go away it's not going to change to protect

103
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:10,200
us from the feeling of disappointment or maybe it's not disappointment maybe it's

104
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:17,639
frustration maybe it's impatience maybe it's anger that arises when what's in

105
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:21,720
our mind doesn't match our present moment

106
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:29,120
experience for example not too long ago I was uh driving in the East Bay and I

107
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:35,200
had this expectation for how long it should take me to get to where I was

108
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:42,160
going and as it happened that the whole entire freeway um Highway 680 was closed

109
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:48,839
uh was a couple of weeks ago I guess they were doing some I don't actually know what they were doing my assumption

110
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:56,120
is there were some planned construction so it was closed for the entire weekend well we the traffic was very

111
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:01,920
different than I expected and so just because I had this sense of

112
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:07,399
like okay it should take this long but in fact it's really taking much longer

113
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:12,720
it's not going to change right it's not going to take me any faster to get there just because I had the

114
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:19,399
idea and my saying this seems silly but it's funny how sometimes we

115
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:26,519
have this idea if I get angry enough maybe it'll change if I get emotional enough maybe it'll change if I'm

116
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:33,800
disappointed enough if I complain enough we have this idea that somehow like

117
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:40,519
strong emotions or any emotion is somehow required or appropriate or

118
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:46,120
necessary when we feel this gap between what's actually happening in our idea

119
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:52,120
about what's happening doesn't matter what emotions

120
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:58,639
we have it's still going to be exactly how it is maybe now there will be emotions with

121
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:04,440
what's happening happening but it doesn't make it move to meet our

122
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:11,480
expectations this is such an interesting thing to think about like how we somehow

123
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,600
want things to be different and meditation is a place

124
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:24,920
where we can look at this and explore it and play with it and like and work with

125
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:30,560
it because not only these things like about you know how long it takes to get

126
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:37,079
somewhere but we also might have expectations really giant expectations that show up in our lives and that bring

127
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:42,800
some agitation to the quality of Our Lives for example we might have an

128
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:49,199
expectation that somebody else is going to make us happy or it's going

129
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:54,839
to heal us or is going to make us feel

130
00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:00,680
whole whether that's somebody else is a intimate relationship a psychotherapist

131
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:07,000
a spiritual teacher a good friend whatever it is we might have this

132
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,399
idea that somebody else is going to solve some of the whatever we feel like

133
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:19,839
needs to be solved or heal whatever we feel like needs to be healed and this

134
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:25,959
expectation is not often explicit like most often it's hidden

135
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:31,800
underneath a a number of layers like so many of the expectations that we

136
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:38,519
have and maybe we might say of course we have this expectation too how

137
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:46,600
many what is it romantic comedy movies or romance novels or how many uh just

138
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:52,279
you know fairy tales or something kind of like support this

139
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:58,079
idea and I think all of us have had relationships that don't meet our

140
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:04,320
expectations and sometimes that's you know okay and

141
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:10,320
we work with it and we mature and we grow and sometimes it's not sometimes it

142
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:17,079
turns into be something that's uh really stressful in our lives stressful for us

143
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:24,800
and maybe stressful for the other person or maybe stressful if we have to rearrange our life in some kind of

144
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:31,759
way so this idea of the expectations we have the kind of like the attitudes that

145
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:39,120
we have to so many things in life just leads to this agitation that can be

146
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:46,360
really obvious or really subtle about this kind of disappointment that this

147
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:51,800
present moment isn't precisely how I thought it should

148
00:15:51,800 --> 00:16:00,440
be so this practice this practice of mindfulness is teaching us like how can

149
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:07,440
we cultivate the conditions so there can be the arising

150
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,560
of an unagitated heart create the conditions in which there can be some

151
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:20,040
ease and no longer this expectation or if there are expectations

152
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:25,959
no longer any agitation about noticing when the Gap is

153
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:34,120
there and it turns out that this is so much what practice is about we don't talk about this explicitly a

154
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:40,680
lot we just emphasize you know come back to the present moment come back to the present moment but one of the reasons

155
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:46,560
some of the power of mindfulness practice is that this repeatedly

156
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:52,440
returning again and again to whatever is the present moment

157
00:16:52,440 --> 00:17:01,120
independent of uh whether it uh is what we want that's what we expected but just

158
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:10,000
to come back to the truth of the experience then somehow the thoughts we

159
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,240
had about it stop being as important they stop being as

160
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:22,400
authoritative it's like okay yeah that's just the mind doing what the Mind

161
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:29,760
does but this moment is like this so there's this way that just returning

162
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:36,720
again and again and again to the present moment experience is this way that the the

163
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,600
agitation of the present moment not meeting our experience just kind of like

164
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:48,280
softens and goes away and this is so much what about

165
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:54,480
mindfulness practice is about is being able to bring all of

166
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:01,799
ourselves to whatever is happening maybe we could even say

167
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:08,039
especially if it doesn't meet our expectations because in this gap between

168
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:15,640
what's actually happening in our expectations this room is where there's a lot of strong emotions and we can slip

169
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:20,679
into losing Touch of our wisest versions of ourselves

170
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:27,760
or with anger or frustration or sadness or disappointment or whatever it might

171
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,799
be so there's this way that mindfulness

172
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:39,120
practice is about seeing things as they really

173
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:46,400
are not about getting anywhere and so often we might use it

174
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:52,960
that we have this sense that uh you know we want to use it to support us and make

175
00:18:52,960 --> 00:19:00,720
our lives better and it can and it will

176
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:06,880
and part of the way it makes our lives better is to help us more and more to be

177
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:15,120
with what's actually happening what's actually here what's

178
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,200
the experience even if it's

179
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:25,840
uncomfortable even if it's exactly what we didn't

180
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:34,840
want the truth is it's there and there's there's a way in which our trying to wish it otherwise just leads to a life

181
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:41,159
of agitation a lot of agitation because mindfulness practice

182
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:46,440
is about seeing things as they seeing things as they really are not so much

183
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:52,200
about getting somewhere but instead to recognize and

184
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,760
allow whatever is

185
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:02,679
arising if you have moments of great

186
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:07,880
irritation maybe because your expectations weren't being met but with

187
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:14,240
mindfulness practice you're learning how to be present with that

188
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:21,880
irritation oh irritation feels like this restlessness in the legs perhaps or

189
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:30,039
for me sometimes I get restlessness in my arms I'll be sitting here quietly but there's like this energy in the arm

190
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:36,840
or maybe there's this way of uh this sense of irritation is feels like um

191
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:42,960
some tightening in the throat sometimes there can be or clenching of the jaw

192
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,480
these are subtle bodily experiences this irritation but while we're in meditation

193
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:56,600
we can just notice oh yeah medit irritation is like

194
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:02,520
this and we take the next breath as best we can we come back to

195
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:09,799
the sensations of breathing and we have this sense like okay I have this container until the

196
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:17,840
timer goes off until the bell rings I guess I'm just going to be with

197
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,400
irritation and then as we get practice with being with these uncomfortable

198
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:33,880
Sensations the problem drains out of those situations yes

199
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:40,799
irritation feels like this it's uncomfortable and it's not a

200
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:48,080
problem just imagine what your life would be like with all the uncomfortableness is that we encounter

201
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:55,400
in just having a human body and just being in this Society what if the

202
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:00,520
uncomfortableness wasn't a problem

203
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,760
it's just

204
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:12,840
uncomfortable it's quite something to think about that like we can with this Pro with this

205
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:18,720
practice we are increasing our capacity to be with uncomfortableness but how

206
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:25,279
many times are we agitated or doing things thoughtlessly or with a whole

207
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:30,520
bunch of emotion behind it simply because we're uncomfortable

208
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,919
able so meditation is not about trying to get

209
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:43,039
anywhere else it's about allowing yourself to be

210
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:50,480
exactly where you are as you are and as we do that the expectations

211
00:22:50,480 --> 00:23:00,440
just kind of melt away as that Gap goes away the expectations go away

212
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:10,039
and there's this way that I mean I um allowing ourselves to be just as we are

213
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:16,120
allows us to be more open to others as well allowing others to be the way that

214
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:21,960
they are and I'm not saying that uh we have

215
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:29,480
to accept absolutely everything and there aren't injustices in the world I am not saying that

216
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:35,960
I am saying that we can bring our wisest versions of ourselves if we can stay in

217
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:41,240
the uncomfortableness because we have

218
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:48,559
aspirations of course we do we want to make positive change we want to make positive change in ourselves and in the

219
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:56,039
world we want to make things different we want to improve our lives improve other people's lives improve the world

220
00:23:56,039 --> 00:24:04,440
of course we want to do that so I'm not saying that we have to give up all of our aspirations of or goals

221
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:10,039
about uh what's possible and directions we want to go

222
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:17,400
I'm not saying that because to improve the lot of the

223
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:24,120
world is appropriate it's part of what to practice enables us to do and it's a

224
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:31,760
very real possibility but it turns out that just

225
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:37,000
by sitting and being with

226
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:45,080
ourselves whether it's comfortable or uncomfortable in this small but not

227
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:50,640
insignificant way you already have made a

228
00:24:52,720 --> 00:25:00,679
difference you've decreased the amount of agitation in yourself and in the

229
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:07,080
world you've decreased the amount of discomfort

230
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:14,360
or maybe I'm using this word agitation just this you know the frustration or anger or

231
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:20,360
impatience just by being with your experience

232
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:27,320
wholeheartedly recognizing and allowing it to be there

233
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:32,000
and the Paradox

234
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:38,399
is that by being with things how they

235
00:25:38,399 --> 00:25:45,240
are is how we change the world is how we change

236
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:52,159
ourselves this is a paradox because of course we have this idea that no no no I the things I have

237
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:58,000
to like do things but there's this way that if we

238
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,120
get out of our own way and we give ourselves over to the present moment and

239
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:12,559
Trust in this recognizing and allowing without pursuing anything at

240
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:21,600
all the sense that nothing needs to happen it's very

241
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,960
counterintuitive but when we start up when we give up this sense that we're

242
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:35,200
trying to make something special that is something

243
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:43,760
special trying stopping putting down this idea that things have to be different letting go of wanting

244
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:50,480
something better instead to just be

245
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:57,240
here then we can maybe realize that something special is already

246
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:03,240
occurring it's our life that's

247
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:09,159
occurring it's the present moment that's occurring it's our capacity to meet

248
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:15,799
what's arising with some openness and clear-headedness

249
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:21,240
open-heartedness be able to meet with what's just arising and that turns out

250
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:28,480
to be quite special and people respond to this we

251
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,640
respond to it ourselves but people around us respond they notice oh this

252
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:39,159
person's like actually here and present and not busy with themselves but can

253
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:44,640
meet with what's arising don't underestimate how this how powerful and

254
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,799
transformative this can be partly it's powerful because it's not easy because

255
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:55,960
most people are so used to being distracted and busy with themselves that they aren't meeting others but when

256
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:02,200
somebody is actually pray present with what's actually happening and meeting

257
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:08,679
others with what's actually happening there it has an

258
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:18,640
impact in our hearts and in the hearts of others so there's a one way to describe

259
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:24,480
this which I first heard on a retreat uh years and years ago and it had a such a

260
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,880
big impact on me back then so maybe like this talk so far we

261
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:35,360
could summarize it like this we have this idea that we want to get to point

262
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:41,600
B maybe we're not even clear what point B is it's just something there better

263
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,960
whatever's going to happen next and how to get to point

264
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,559
B I'll tell you exactly how to get to point B to what's

265
00:28:52,559 --> 00:29:00,039
better be completely at Point a

266
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:08,360
that's how you get to point B and this is like a paradox or

267
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:13,480
counterintuitive or something that maybe you just need to practice with or

268
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:18,960
explore rather than just listen to somebody like me say

269
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:26,080
this but can we put aside or can we let go or soften

270
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:31,760
this attitude of oh there's got to be something better and maybe it begins by

271
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:37,240
just recognizing by how often this shows up in our lives I mean we can see it in

272
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:46,158
a more subtle way in our meditation practice but probably it shows up in you know not subtle ways in our

273
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:53,159
life so the attitude that we're bringing are we bringing this attitude of well

274
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:58,360
there's got to be something better or it should be progressing or developing or I

275
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:04,720
need to be somewhere else or just this natural sense that we bring to so much of our

276
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:11,159
life can we notice that attitude and gently investigate

277
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:19,919
it and maybe it shows up in a really obvious way in your meditation practice like being really ambitious and striving

278
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:28,480
and and pushing really hard and so to instead to recognize is

279
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:36,720
this balance or Paradox or counterintuitive about to have the goal

280
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:44,720
being to not have that goal or something like this

281
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:52,480
right this way and just to maybe to recognize can we have this

282
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:59,679
sense of having an aspiration having a sense of what's

283
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:07,039
possible for us and for the world and at the same time just to be simply with

284
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:14,919
what is not abandoning our

285
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:20,559
aspirations but noticing how that creates some agitation I I'm always

286
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:26,519
doing this with my hands I'm touching my fingers because it kind of feels like that this like this rubbing or something

287
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:32,480
like this so showing up and being present for

288
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:39,519
what's really here is a way that can help us get there

289
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:46,600
wherever there is thank

290
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:52,679
you in order to get to point B just be completely at Point

291
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:59,519
a so now I'd like to open it up to see if there are some questions or comments

292
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,440
anybody would like to

293
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:16,679
make it's sort of an observation but one of the things I kept word that kept coming to my mind that you you didn't

294
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:22,639
use is control uh because I find in my

295
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:30,480
practice in my life that if I have the illusion of control everything's okay

296
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:36,639
but it's the loss of control that uh is really hard for us to deal

297
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:41,960
with I would agree 100% the loss of control and I would say

298
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:48,559
even well maybe I like I think I might do a whole talk on this but maybe I'll just kind of say a few things

299
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:56,279
here is there much is there much worse than the feeling of complete

300
00:32:56,279 --> 00:33:02,120
helplessness complete helplessness so we like to perpetuate

301
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:07,639
this idea of being in control but we're not in control as much

302
00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:13,279
as we think we are and that's very uncomfortable when we realize that but I

303
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:19,200
think you're pointing to something that's really powerful and important yeah thank

304
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,480
you over there and then we'll go to here first we'll have you here first and then

305
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:33,720
yes do go there and then we'll come to you okay yeah um I was just wondering so

306
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,799
I think you had just said to get to point B just be completely present in point

307
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:45,519
a but what do you trust in to get to point B and I know this is probably the

308
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:51,159
Paradox uh but it's maybe also kind of in line with your question about control

309
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:56,519
um it's like what do you put your faith in

310
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:03,840
yeah yeah cuz right if we could control things we wouldn't have ever have this gap between

311
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:09,320
our expectations and our experien we have this we envisioned it we have this

312
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:14,638
idea exactly how it should be and it's usually not that so if we really could

313
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:20,320
control things there would not be this Gap so what is I think this is an

314
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,520
excellent question so what do we put our trust in if we're not if we can't control and make things

315
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:30,760
happen then what what do we have confidence in how do things happen what

316
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:38,079
do we have faith in this is a great question and it would be great if I had a really simple answer for

317
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:45,638
you that would make you feel better and that we could all go home and like oh okay well at least I have that but uh I

318
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:53,118
think part of uh this practice not I think I know part of this practice is

319
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:59,640
really deeply experiencing that we don't control as much as we do and that being

320
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:05,440
okay and in fact it being a little bit of a relief cuz that's another source of

321
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,839
agitation trying to control everything it's

322
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,599
exhausting thank

323
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:28,320
you thanks for the Liston um and when you were talking about the

324
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:38,320
Gap is that all the emotions that we are dealing with I mean the metaphor for traffic we

325
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:44,160
can apply it to everything that we deal with in life

326
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:50,920
and then the emotions that is not aligned with the expectation

327
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:56,119
and or um doesn't meet the expectation then

328
00:35:56,119 --> 00:36:07,119
we have to deal with all these kind of frustration and all of it

329
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:16,960
so can we can we put it in this category in this box that it's the emotion

330
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:25,599
dealing with our thought thinking and then observe it and let it

331
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,960
go some it's um out of my

332
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:37,200
practice I feel like when I'm

333
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:46,480
um I I catch myself with all these emotions that I don't like to have and

334
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:52,280
my only solution is to be silence

335
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:58,720
and maybe breathing and then um feel the

336
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:05,560
looking I mean thinking of my blessings in life and but the emotion is still

337
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:13,400
there it's less so can that Gap

338
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:18,480
is emotions we deal in the we have in

339
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:25,319
life I'm not sure that I understand your question so you're asking is are are are

340
00:37:25,319 --> 00:37:31,240
the emotions we experience due to this Gap between what our thinking is and what we're actually experiencing yeah

341
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:39,400
what experiencing is through our emotion right frustration and

342
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:45,760
um angry or and would that

343
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:54,960
be I I feel like I like to look at it as dealing with all sorts of emotions that

344
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:02,440
come up for me and I have to I and I'm conscious of it and I'm

345
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:07,880
aware of it and deal with

346
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:13,800
it so there's I I so the of course

347
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:19,280
emotions arise when there's this when we have this experience and then you were saying like sometimes the experience is

348
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,560
the emotions and then how do we be with that how do we be with just like emotions is that part of what you're

349
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:31,720
saying yeah yeah that's this is a great uh question and so uh there's a few

350
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:37,319
things and um I've given some talks on this but uh I can say just really

351
00:38:37,319 --> 00:38:42,400
briefly recognize oh there's a an

352
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:49,359
emotion that's happening and as best you can allow it oh I feel

353
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:54,800
angry and then instead of piling on I shouldn't feel angry and I shouldn't not

354
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:02,480
feel that I should not feel angry but said like okay here's angry feel it in the body instead of the

355
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:10,599
thoughts feel it in the body anger often has heat kind of like a flushing like this and this energy coming up and maybe

356
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:15,640
like you know wanting to move or something like this and

357
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:24,760
then we then I'll say te's apart so r a f t recognize allow feel in the body and

358
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:30,359
tease apart what's actually happening from your reaction to what's

359
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:36,319
happening and then if that feels like way too complicated like all these steps to be with

360
00:39:36,319 --> 00:39:42,119
emotions uh some things is very simple feel your feet on the

361
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:49,280
ground and bring your attention to the breath in a relaxed easy way as best you

362
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,680
can as best you can that's the key instead of beating ourselves up that we

363
00:39:54,680 --> 00:40:01,880
should be able to handle or be with whatever emotion So yeah thank you you're welcome you're

364
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:10,359
welcome you want to send it over to um I think like what comes up for me

365
00:40:10,359 --> 00:40:16,960
with being in point a and being fully in point a um is kind of like how we

366
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:24,560
practice or how we hope to practice empathy with other people like whenever um you know a friend or your partner or

367
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:30,960
your um family memb has come to you and like confide it you about like their problems um typically we want to have

368
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:37,119
like control right we want to like oh you should do this you should like uh um do that or like stop thinking about it

369
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:42,839
or whatever but being fully in the moment with that loved one or the person

370
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:48,520
that we care about um is so powerful to your point like they feel it right like

371
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:55,440
that you're just there with them not trying to like fix them but just like being there and I think like that by

372
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:02,880
being there fully with them not trying like solve everything or like control everything um might be like what they

373
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:10,000
would need to like get to point B and if I'm just kind of like thinking about how if we can extend that level of empathy

374
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,160
to ourselves which sometimes actually might be harder than extending that empathy to other people that we love

375
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:23,400
it's like maybe that's a way that I'm kind of like interpreting what what this talk today is do that resonate yeah yeah

376
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:29,960
that's very nice and that's a very uh wise way to do that sometimes we have this sense of like um well how

377
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:36,200
do I help take care of myself and we're like well you know how to take care of others do the same thing for yourself

378
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,838
yeah thank you thank

379
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:48,160
you oh I had four or five things just want to burst out of me this was

380
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:55,160
um um I think it's a really important point you just subtle

381
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:02,119
corrosive chronic sort of dissatisfaction or that difference between our expectation and

382
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:08,839
reality and that's a really good concept to have I hope I can remember remember

383
00:42:08,839 --> 00:42:14,040
it and um I came to mind was I think it was a punk song during the 80s or

384
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:19,200
something somebody kept saying is that all there is and it's kind of the refrain of the song

385
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:25,559
and I think that sort of you seem to be pointing at that as kind of a mental

386
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:32,160
condition um and then I I guess I wanted to know it well first of all when you were

387
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:39,119
saying tease like what is h you sort of you're discriminating between like what's happening and what you our

388
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:48,000
reaction reaction maybe we're mad that we're mad yes it's sort of a second order frustration or something um that's

389
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,520
a really I never really understood the teas part before so that was it helped

390
00:42:53,520 --> 00:43:00,839
anyway Illuminating and then finally uh when you're aware that you have like an

391
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:07,480
experience or emotion coming up in your meditation or actually even just think about like the the perceptions of our

392
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:14,079
body the weight on the floor things like that how verbal are you in that

393
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:20,640
awareness like are you sort of narrating your experience that seems kind of um

394
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:27,200
tiresome I don't know but or do you is there a a best practice in that like you

395
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:32,680
sort of do some of it and let it go or does that a useful question yeah this

396
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:39,400
is a good question so often it depends on how agitated one is so if there's

397
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:47,480
just a subtle sense of agitation then there's just a mind there's a way in which the mind can just feel without Nar

398
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:54,160
without putting a label or a concept or a note on it just feeling the pressure without saying pressure just noticing

399
00:43:54,160 --> 00:44:00,760
the sensations or what whatever it might be but if the mind is like really edgy I

400
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:06,640
can't believe they did that I'm going to say they don't want BL you know like then it might be really helpful to say

401
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:12,480
in the mind pressure and then just because that's a way to bring the Mind back and then zo the mind will go again

402
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:19,280
and like this and then like okay inhale like and to say these words in the mind

403
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:26,760
as a little way as a support to help bring the Mind back and then the mind will eventually kind of calm down like

404
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:33,359
this reping the agitation with yes yeah giving the Mind something to do yeah and

405
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:38,880
I want to say I love this word corrosive that you use I think that's such a great word kind of I was using the word

406
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:44,839
agitation but corrosive is a good word thank you I love this how we kind of crowd Source some of the information

407
00:44:44,839 --> 00:44:50,400
here these talks that seem like that just so powerfully undermines like our

408
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,880
well-being yes and our sense of well-being yeah

409
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:01,800
yeah okay so I think we're uh at the end of

410
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:07,720
our time together so thank you very much um I'll stay up here if you um somebody would like to come up and have some

411
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:13,720
questions otherwise I wish you a lovely rest of the evening thank

412
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:17,119
you
