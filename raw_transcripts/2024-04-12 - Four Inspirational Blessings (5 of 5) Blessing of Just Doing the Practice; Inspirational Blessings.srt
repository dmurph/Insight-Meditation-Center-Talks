1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:08,639
so good day to all of you those of you who've been here for a

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:14,200
few minutes and those that are just joining now just settling in

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:23,560
welcome we'll go ahead and get started so finding a posture for

4
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:31,480
meditation maybe taking a long slow deep breath and slowly letting it

5
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:38,200
out just connecting with being here with your intention

6
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:45,480
to do this sitting together and close your eyes if it's comfortable to do

7
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:51,960
so that's encouraged and just tune in to the sense

8
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,199
of the body in the sitting posture the meditation

9
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,680
posture inviting whatever ease is available to

10
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,040
you right now in the

11
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:23,759
body often there's more available than we think can deliberately bring attention

12
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:31,200
to areas that we tend to habitually hold and just soften so softening the

13
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,799
muscles of the face around the eyes around the forehead the

14
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,240
jaw all the little muscles on the

15
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,438
scalp the eyes in the eye

16
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:01,398
sockets and then lowering the attention down into the body

17
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:09,239
often we keep our energy up High having a feeling of settling down

18
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:16,400
into the shoulder area chest and

19
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:23,599
back relaxing the arms

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,519
and on the in breath allowing the back to straighten in a relaxed

21
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:46,120
way I find as the muscles of my back release it actually wants to go upward

22
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,360
as if I were holding it in a slumped

23
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,879
position takes effort to

24
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,239
slum it's often the

25
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:14,000
belly down into the hips and the legs and all the way to the

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,280
feet allowing the body to take the form of Simply being

27
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:28,959
here however that looks and feels to you right now

28
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:42,000
and there may be pain or tiredness in the body and that's okay too that's just

29
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,760
part of the present moment part of what we're present

30
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:04,239
for and I'm going to invite today just one brief reflection to bring

31
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:10,319
in and that is to turn the attention deliberately

32
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,359
to something that's inspiring or motivating for you related to your

33
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:22,240
practice why do you practice why are we

34
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:30,080
sitting it could be just right now today or it could be something some

35
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:37,919
bigger picture a larger longer term motivation whatever feels right is

36
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:44,479
fine something it's somewhat

37
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:51,280
inspiring I know someone who imagines that by sitting there

38
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,240
walking in the footsteps of the Buddha doing what he did to walk the

39
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,840
path to Awakening

40
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:09,520
or it could be as simple as I'm calming down so I can go to

41
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,560
work the good mindset

42
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:27,000
today but let that sense of what matters to you infuse your being in some

43
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:37,080
way perhaps breathing it in or just opening the mind to

44
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,400
it see what that does in the

45
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,720
body and now letting that deliberate reflection

46
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:01,120
go and turning to practice

47
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:09,520
for today I'll invite you to tune into experience in some way that works for

48
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:19,039
you do you usually use the breath the body an open kind of awareness or

49
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:23,599
meta sensing what

50
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,720
practice will be most beneficial right now

51
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:38,199
I do recommend choosing something kind of simple not one with a lot of steps that

52
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:44,680
you go through perhaps the breath if you're

53
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,360
unsure just settling on the breath

54
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,960
and the other invitation is to

55
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:28,800
consider just bring in the inclination of mind that what you're

56
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:37,160
doing in this simple practice is planting good seeds for the

57
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:43,919
future is planting seeds for the very thing that is motivating and

58
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:54,479
inspiring there may not be an obvious connection between feeling the sensations of the breath right now and

59
00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:01,039
something larger for your life but I'm going to invite the trust

60
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:07,400
that there is the simple goodness of doing this

61
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:15,159
practice does move us toward our deepest aspirations

62
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:49,080
sometimes we can move into a heaviness or obligation about

63
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:58,079
practice got to do this or another extreme is that we grasp

64
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:04,480
on to practice going to achieve something through doing

65
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:14,920
this and in a totally different space is simply doing

66
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:22,760
it out of its pure goodness and the

67
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:28,800
inspiration and really eventually knowledge that it does move us in a good

68
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:35,760
direction there's kind of a blessing associated with just doing the

69
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:39,519
practice

70
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,519
simply and we'll feel

71
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
that

72
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

73
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240

e e

76
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:56,279
if the Mind begins to slip away from practice the present

77
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:03,959
moment simply reuning realigning if it slips into doing too

78
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:12,079
much or doing too little re evoking that sense

79
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:19,600
of simple goodness and joy and just doing the

80
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,480
practice just being

81
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:31,120
here knowing that it's the best thing to do with this moment

82
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

83
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040

e e

97
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,880
returning to

98
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:23,640
Simplicity and the deep rest that's

99
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:29,880
possible with a heart that is simple

100
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:37,440
regardless of what's happening in the body the mind the external

101
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,679
world there's a way that the heart can be

102
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,760
simple knowing that just meeting this

103
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,320
moment is moving us along the

104
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
path

105
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

106
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

107
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

108
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

109
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,278
e e

110
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:31,120
and in the last few minutes of this

111
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:39,559
meditation perhaps reconnecting with the

112
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:48,679
body the body in this space where you're

113
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:58,480
sitting so bringing in again the awareness of the way place

114
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:06,520
where you are sense of yourself in this

115
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:13,399
meditation situated in time there will be something after this just allowing

116
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:20,720
the mind to bring in more normal elements of

117
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:29,200
Consciousness and as you do so reconnecting with this sense of of

118
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:36,760
inspiration or [Music] aspiration and the simple blessing of

119
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,559
just doing the

120
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:54,600
practice and is there a way in which being in touch with that Simplicity and

121
00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:01,240
that truthfulness about your own spiritual practice is there a

122
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:07,880
way that can support you today going forward or this

123
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:15,880
evening with the people that you're interacting with with the things you need to

124
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:22,880
do if there might be challenges that are [Music]

125
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:29,600
unexpected could it be that just having some

126
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:36,760
connection to this inspiration that you

127
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:44,279
carry could give you more options in situations like that doesn't have to be

128
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:51,159
something that we bring in like an identity or we're carrying it in a heavy

129
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:58,399
way but just maybe touching into it in our heart

130
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:04,799
even as most of our attention is on our life as it only

131
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:13,840
is one more way that the practice supports others as well as ourselves

132
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:56,240
there were only four items on our list for this week not neglecting wisdom

133
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:02,360
preserving truth cultivating relinquishment and training for

134
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,398
peace what shall we talk about

135
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,799
today well let's start with the story that frames the teaching where the

136
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:18,080
Buddha names these four practices and it's from the majima

137
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:24,279
number 140 and it features a monk named puku

138
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:29,919
Sati the commentaries say that he was a king gave up his kingdom in order to

139
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:36,320
ordain and live a simple spiritual life but even without that detail it's

140
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:43,640
an interesting story what it says in the suta so the Buddha is traveling

141
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:50,600
apparently by himself and he asks a Potter if he can spend the night in his

142
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:57,480
workshop and the Potter says it is not inconvenient for me venerable sir but

143
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:03,120
there is a homeless one already staying there if he agrees then stay as long as

144
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:10,919
you like and the one who's already there is pusti and so the Buddha goes to him and

145
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:16,720
politely asks if it's okay to share the workshop for that night and pus Sati

146
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:22,399
says that will be fine now puku Sati is a was a follower

147
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:28,399
of the Buddha but he had never met the Buddha and he didn't recognize him so

148
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:34,639
remember in this era there were no videos no Zoom no YouTube no pictures

149
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:39,960
even to look at right so if you hadn't met somebody in person you didn't know

150
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:47,360
what they looked like so they're both there at opposite ends of the Potter's

151
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:55,559
workshop and the Buddha spends most of the night sitting in meditation and basati does that also the

152
00:31:55,559 --> 00:32:00,760
Buddha notices and he has the the thought oh this Clansman conducts

153
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:06,320
himself in a way that inspires confidence suppose I were to question

154
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:12,919
him so he asks pukas Sati who his teacher is and pukas Sati says it's the

155
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:18,240
Buddha and the buas asks him if he has ever met this person that he follows or

156
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:24,960
would recognize him and fukusa says no and so the Buddha thinks H this

157
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:32,480
Clansman has gone forth from the home life into home under me suppose I were to teach him the

158
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:39,440
dhama so I think it's kind of nice that the Buddha didn't try to teach him until he knew that he was a follower first he

159
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,840
asks that so then you know now that he's decided all right pukas Sati is a

160
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:50,240
follower I'm going to teach him the Dharma he gives a long Dharma talk that

161
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:56,760
includes the teaching on these four foundations that support an awakened person and he goes on for a long long

162
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:02,240
time and he's very um kind of detailed and he he speaks quite profoundly he's actually speaking

163
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:08,200
about nibana some of the time and um so pus Sati I'm I'm

164
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:15,039
imagining this now it doesn't quite say this in the suta but I'm imagining his eyes getting bigger and bigger and he

165
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:20,760
realizes oh my gosh this is the Buddha and so um when the teaching is

166
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:27,120
over he bows deeply and he um I'm paraphrasing what he says he says I'm so

167
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:33,799
sorry I didn't recognize you and so then they have this nice connection right and

168
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:39,639
of course it also says that the Buddha realized that basati had a

169
00:33:39,639 --> 00:33:46,000
very mature mind and could could understand a teaching like that and um

170
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:54,799
sure enough he has some some Awakening from that so that's the part I wanted to share um because maybe one way to read

171
00:33:54,799 --> 00:34:02,120
this story or understand the relevance of this story is that we don't always recognize the

172
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:09,200
Dharma you know things come up in our practice and we may not see what a great blessing they are or we may not see how

173
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:15,960
they're actually the fruit of our own wholesomeness or that they're supporting the deepening of our

174
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:22,079
goodness and we don't always know what's going on in our practice while it's

175
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:27,878
happening so I want to mention then another teaching that includes these

176
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:32,960
same four items and this is the teaching that's called the four inspirational

177
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:38,118
blessings which is the title of this week's series even though that's not

178
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:44,240
those words are not in the suta that we're talking about so there's a Buddhist another Buddhist teaching where

179
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:51,800
the earliest version of it we have is in Sanskrit and then it was later translated in tibetan so into Tibetan so

180
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:58,200
it's still used in the Tibetan tradition and it describes what gives rise to

181
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:03,599
helpful or wholesome actions in our lives that's what the teaching is about

182
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:09,320
and it calls those things that give rise to helpful actions in our lives the four

183
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:15,160
inspirational blessings and they are the blessing of Truth the blessing of

184
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:20,400
Letting Go the blessing of utter peace and the blessing of

185
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:26,640
wisdom and when I heard that teaching something tripped in my mind and I kept kind of lingering with it and then I

186
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:33,920
realized oh that's the same set of four from the poly Canon from maim Manaya 140

187
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:41,640
we talked about these in a different order I've talked about them in the order they are in M40 which is wisdom

188
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:47,640
truth Letting Go peace and here they've just taken the wisdom and stuck it on

189
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:53,839
the on the end so truth Letting Go peace and wisdom but it's the same

190
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:59,839
list um so the this other teaching is things

191
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:06,319
that give rise to helpful or wholesome actions in in our lives and so they're called

192
00:36:06,319 --> 00:36:11,560
blessings but seeing how this list of four has persisted across Buddhist

193
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:19,400
history even when they're given a somewhat different context it gives me some real inspiration and respect for

194
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:25,280
this set of four for me this says it's it's an important teaching and in my own

195
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:33,839
practice I have considered these for quite deeply I remember one Retreat where I

196
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:41,400
just wrote down the phrases not neglect wisdom preserve truth cultivate relinquishment and train for peace and I

197
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:49,880
kind of put it out on the table where I could see it regularly and I just kind of let them uh Infuse The Retreat and

198
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:59,520
deepen on their own and I found that in so many cases one or the other of them was really relevant was coming up

199
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:07,520
so returning to hukus Sati in the PO story in fact that he didn't recognize

200
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:13,240
the Buddha we may not recognize certain aspects of the Dharma until we've

201
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:19,280
already experience them so maybe there is one more blessing

202
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:26,200
which is the blessing of just doing the practice just doing it we just do it

203
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:32,800
sincerely as best we can and someday we may find ourselves in the

204
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:40,079
presence of the Buddha we discover that he's right there Sharing The Potter's workshop with us

205
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:45,560
very close by

206
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:52,119
so how did these four speak to your practice or how are they living in you

207
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:57,560
after talking through them this week doing practices

208
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:04,000
that relate to them or invoke each one and it's not that there needs to be

209
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:10,920
any huge profound realization or shift but just an invitation to let them keep

210
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:18,839
living in your heart and to trust that whichever one sort of sticks in your

211
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:25,920
mind that's probably the one that's important for you right now you don't have to figure it out you

212
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,920
don't even have to understand exactly how it's all working

213
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:39,640
but part of the beauty and Trust of the path is that the mind is attuned to what

214
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:45,760
it needs and that things will self-correct over time and new things will come in at

215
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:52,440
the right time this path

216
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:58,760
somehow moves between activity and passivity

217
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:07,200
the the good side of both of those let's say the good side of both of those so sometimes we need to do things and

218
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:14,960
sometimes it's better if we don't so just check in among these

219
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:21,000
four truth and letting go and peace and

220
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:27,560
wisdom which one speaking to you at this moment

221
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:38,720
yeah it feels complete so thank you for this

222
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:45,040
week and may your practice continue to evolve in a beautiful

223
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:53,119
way just keep sitting in the Potter's Workshop thank you
