1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:08,559
all right so formally hello and welcome to happy hour lovely to be with you to practice

2
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:16,240
together very much looking forward to our practice together dear sangha so

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:23,920
so for today's practice um [Music] i'd like to invite us to consider

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,519
the cultivation of metta the planting seeds of kindness

5
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:35,040
good will [Music] for ourselves for others

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,160
basically planting these seeds as

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,800
as the biggest gift perhaps that we can give to the world maybe not

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,000
the biggest maybe i don't want to set it up so big but as has

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,079
a uh as a gift of our presence as a gift you know we are passing we're passing

10
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:07,119
through this earth our lifetime is is a flash relative

11
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:13,280
to the cosmic time scale so of course for many of us our work in the

12
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,880
world is important maybe children maybe relatives etc we all have different ways

13
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:25,680
that we engage and and give our gifts to the world what if we also consider

14
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:33,759
planting the seeds of meta offering offering kindness in whatever shape or

15
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:39,040
form it shows up both for ourselves this person who is me

16
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:45,360
as well as for others other beings as as an expression

17
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:52,640
of our gift as as a big gift that we can give

18
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,159
not just say the work we do maybe the books we write the companies we create

19
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:04,399
whatever it might be but but how we do it how these things are done how we

20
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,599
interact with people how we interact with ourselves with this person who is

21
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:16,480
us um whom we are the guardian of the only guardian of

22
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:23,040
really the care of this person who is me has been entrusted

23
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,720
to me so so not just what we do

24
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,800
but how we do it and actually the how the how

25
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:41,120
in the world being the bigger gift being leaving a lasting impression

26
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,200
on people on loved ones on people we know and people we don't we don't know

27
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:54,640
so so that how that that gift of generosity of kindness towards ourselves

28
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,840
and others to consider that so

29
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,959
i offer that for our reflection and

30
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,400
for guided meditation i will invite us with

31
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:17,840
some invitations for planting seeds and can whatever happens if you find that

32
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,280
this mind this body is achy is sleepy is distracted

33
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:30,879
different thoughts arise the opposite of meta arises as long as you have kindness

34
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:37,120
as long as you show kindness towards what is arising you are planting seeds

35
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,040
of metta so even if even if

36
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,720
say self-judgment arises if you're kind of sweetheart you're being

37
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,799
you're being very judgmental you're having a hard time right now you're having a hard day hard evening

38
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:01,920
you turn towards that even self-judgment even if you turn towards it with kindness you are

39
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,360
planting the seeds of meta this how that i'm talking about this way

40
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,879
of being in the world this big gift that this legacy

41
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:19,759
that we create these reverberations that we create for ourselves and for others

42
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:26,000
through each act of mind and in buddhism

43
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,560
thoughts are considered actions of the mind the sixth sense doors the sixth one

44
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:39,440
the five are the regular five that we know and the sixth one being the mind door

45
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:45,120
thinking recreating all the other senses in the mind

46
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,360
so i think i've said enough to set the stage for our practice tonight so

47
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,440
so with that i'd like to invite us now to

48
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,759

49

straight or to lie down to stand see what your body needs

50
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:17,039

51
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:22,840

and your upper legs releasing

86
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,760
the weight onto the earth

87
00:09:51,519 --> 00:10:00,360
the knees the lower legs and feet

88
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,360
as if any holding is offered to the earth as a

89
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,959
weight dropping dropping the weight of your

90
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:22,920
legs or your sit bones

91
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:43,839

92
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:50,320
to breathe because the breath breathes you

93
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,760
you've been breathing all this time

94
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:03,680
no need to make it complicated into a project

95
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:15,240
just let it happen as it has been happening simply notice that the breathing

96
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,560
is occurring

97
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:32,000
any thoughts arise it's okay no problem

98
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,560

102
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:18,480
you may need to release thoughts smilingly a hundred times

103
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:24,800
do it with kindness to yourself and the thoughts

104
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:33,399
planting scenes of kindness one bird at a time

105
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:27,320
and for the sake of our practice tonight today

106
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:38,199
let there be an extra dose of kindness

107
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,320
for whatever the mind notices if it's the breath

108
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:57,560
the abdomen can it be received with kindness with appreciation

109
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,120
graciously

110
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:12,800
if your awareness is holding turns to

111
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:19,360
the body sensation maybe an ache or pain

112
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,519
can it massage with your thought

113
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:31,279
with your mind can the sensation be massaged with kindness

114
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,600
with care

115
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,800
if a thought or entanglement arises

116
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,010
maybe you think of a person [Music]

117
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:58,160
or a project or something can there be extra kindness

118
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:04,480
maybe a smile maybe a little blessing of meta

119
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:13,120
friendliness before you release the bird

120
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,880
bird by bird whatever arises

121
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:25,759
kindness towards all these birds that arise that land

122
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,519
in your sphere of awareness

123
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,880
awareness spacious like the sky

124
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,800
birds of sensation birds of thought

125
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,480
maybe even the breath as a bird

126
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:22,120
smilingly offering seeds of kindness to the birds

127
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:16,320
especially if there are any challenges in your heart and your mind

128
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,130
extra kindness care soothing

129
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:27,209
[Music]

130
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,720
offered

131
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,840
you were doing your best

132
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,520
all the birds are doing their best

133
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:44,400
if anything could have been different it would have been

134
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,280
and the causes and conditions are like this

135
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:59,840
can we be kind to what is to whatever is showing up

136
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,559
just as it is yourself included

137
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:43,919
kindness it's also an empowerment

138
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,919
see if you can notice feel the empowerment

139
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,840
the strength of kindness in your heart

140
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,120
as a gift

141
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,200
and then sharing kindness care good will

142
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:38,200
not only is there an empowerment that we feel in our heart

143
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:48,799
but it's a gift that in giving [Music]

144
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,480
we receive ourselves

145
00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:00,720
the goodness of it

146
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,880
radiating radiating kindness

147
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:25,559
goodness to whatever rises this fear of awareness

148
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:30,720
and as we offer kindness radiate kindness

149
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,919
opening our heart

150
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:49,120
to whomever arises whoever shows up as a guest

151
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,320
friends family neutral people people we have challenges

152
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,320
with

153
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:10,320
there are human beings just like me who want to be happy they don't want to

154
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,320
suffer

155
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:26,000
offering friendliness maybe a smile

156
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,960
neighborliness

157
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:42,320
may you be well may all of us be well

158
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:58,398
see what's easy whatever comes easy

159
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:08,919
to your body to your heart to your mind let your body be relaxed at ease

160
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:44,960
and i like to make another invitation feel free to explore this if it works

161
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,840
for you

162
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,000
if kindness were

163
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,840
like light shimmering light

164
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:10,519
as you offered it to the world to others to yourself

165
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:22,159
shimmering light that brings goodness brings sucker brings care

166
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:28,919
whomever it touches whatever it touches

167
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:38,518
whatever it shines upon whoever whomever it shines upon

168
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:50,559
brings gladness goodness it's an offering as a gift

169
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,399
again not attached to outcomes it's just an offering

170
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,159
it's a cultivation of our heart

171
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:08,480
now what if you imagined your whole body

172
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,039
drenched in kindness

173
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:21,600
shining with this light

174
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:27,440
this shimmering light and you offer yourself to the world

175
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:32,559
if your judgmental mind gets in the way oh i'm not that good i'm not that kind

176
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:38,919
it's okay let that go for now we're just exploring

177
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:47,600
imagine imagine for just a moment that you are the light you are the gift

178
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:53,519
of kindness you offer yourself up

179
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:59,760
wherever you are needed wherever this body this heart this mind

180
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:07,000
is needed you offer yourself up without hesitation

181
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:16,079
offer your skills your goodness your time

182
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:21,480
your heart you are the gift

183
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,159
let yourself be the gift you are the good

184
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:50,480
in ways you we

185
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,638
cannot fathom of ourselves

186
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,640
making ourselves the gift of kindness

187
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,599
of goodness onto the world

188
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,119
the light that shines

189
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,720
the light that shines

190
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,000
without preference

191
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,599
unconditionally

192
00:35:54,560 --> 00:36:00,480
as we bring this practice period or close

193
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:12,320
whatever rose or did not arise during this practice period

194
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:18,560
if there was sleepiness distractedness present not a problem

195
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:26,200
offer kindness to whatever rose offer kindness to yourself

196
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:32,720
trusting that even if there was there is one moment of kindness

197
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:38,480
goodness that's good enough

198
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,960
offering seeds planting seeds

199
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:52,160
and collectively [Music] we share we offer to the world our goodness

200
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:59,440
from this practice may all beings everywhere all beings

201
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:06,960

230
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:32,160
yourself as a gift onto the world how did that go was there a moment that actually

231
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:39,839
that practice lit up for you or was there a lot of lot of judgment oh no

232
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:47,280
not me curious what happened you're willing to share

233
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,000
it's all good

234
00:40:53,119 --> 00:41:02,560
silence is fine too i see claire's hand claire

235
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:11,599
thank you nikki that was actually the part of the meditation that i appreciated the most

236
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:16,800
um it's a practice that i've been observing for a number of years

237
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:23,280
and it was interesting i i was approached this week by a woman who's roughly in my age range very

238
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,319
accomplished but not as accomplished as her friends in her eyes

239
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:34,400
and i was trying to explain to her that the joy of living came from giving my skills away

240
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:41,200
not taking and i couldn't get through to her i felt so bad because she's very lonely and

241
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:46,319
very unhappy because she sees herself as a failure

242
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:51,839
and we're not failures if we give what we've got yeah well

243
00:41:51,839 --> 00:42:00,000
you know it changes the whole dynamic yeah absolutely well said claire well said

244
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,920
it's it's not about getting it's about giving yes and we're all we have so much to

245
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:12,240
give every single one of us yeah our time our attention our resources

246
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:20,240
thank you claire beautifully said thank you lovely mark please

247
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:29,440
to my surprise i was able to get into that final

248
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:36,160
image of of just being light and goodness

249
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:41,920
towards everything and towards everything that that i might touch i've been

250
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:49,839
sitting with a meditation of jack cornfields for the last couple of months where

251
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:56,640
he ends up saying you can send out compassion

252
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:01,680
love and blessings in every direction now and that's how i've been starting my

253
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:07,599
day every day for about the last 90 days and your

254
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:13,680

270
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:58,079
a couple of times i think it reminded me of you know a biological uh

271
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:05,680
thing called bioluminescence right i think i've seen a couple of people who

272
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:12,480
were just overflowing with compassion and kindness and it seemed to my eyes

273
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,839
like they were glowing yeah yeah yeah that's exactly right yeah

274
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:26,880
it's beautiful image we appreciate you bringing that in yeah that's sweet by you luminescence exactly yeah maybe

275
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:34,640
i'll suggest that next time the guided meditation for those who have seen that that's lovely thank you

276
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:40,560
yeah it's great so so the time has come for the invitation as we've been

277
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:49,280
spreading as we've been shining um kindness in our heart space in our quiet

278
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:55,119
heart space what if we actually open our eyes and be in relationship with others

279
00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:01,520
with a couple of other human beings who also are here to cultivate their hearts and kindness

280
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:08,160
and so in small groups will be roughly of size three the invitation is to share

281
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:14,640
just one nugget if you have five things to say from say the guided meditation just share one nugget from your

282
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:20,079
experience again speaking just from your experience and then the next person will offer a

283
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:25,920
nugget or will be silent they can say pass just holding kind space for the

284
