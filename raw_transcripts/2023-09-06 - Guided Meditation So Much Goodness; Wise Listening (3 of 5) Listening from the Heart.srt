1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:09,059
hello everyone welcome and for this morning I'd like to begin

2
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:17,699
with a parts of a poem by Walt Whitman wonderful poem for that has a lot of uh

3
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:22,859
speaks I think in many ways parts of it to our practice

4
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:29,460
This song is called song of the open road and the part that I'll read to introduce

5
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,360
are sitting is uh he writes

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,920
I inhale droughts of space

7
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:50,340
the East and the West are mine the North and the South are mine

8
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,600
I am larger better than I thought

9
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:03,379
I did not know I held so much goodness

10
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,420
all seems beautiful to me

11
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,720
so to inhale space

12
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,659
all around us is in a sense Infinite Space

13
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:27,140
and to bring that into ourselves as we sit

14
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,659
and as we exhale let it all expand outwards to fill all

15
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:44,880
of space awareness spacious spacious awareness inside

16
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,438
spacious awareness outside

17
00:01:51,060 --> 00:02:01,280
he writes elsewhere just before in the long poem about loosening up all that holds him

18
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:09,539
all the ways that were held are cling or grave let it loosen and then he talks about

19
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:15,599
space and we'll see later that this uh this

20
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:21,180
the context of also talking about listening listening to others listening

21
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,900
well letting go

22
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:33,200
so there's no holding on to

23
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:41,420
definitions and constructions and

24
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:49,560
ways in which we put boundaries in lines around ourselves

25
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:57,319
and our life and then to discover that we're better than we thought

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,060
behold so much goodness and everything is beautiful

27
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,040
so to assume a meditation posture

28
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:18,599
and maybe you can adjust your posture

29
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:25,500
so it's a posture that gives you some access

30
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:31,040
or might approximate giving you access

31
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:40,340
to your own goodness into your beauty

32
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,260
to the beauty all around

33
00:03:53,640 --> 00:04:00,620
and in caring for your posture your body

34
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:08,220
to gently close your eyes and feel this body as if you've never

35
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,439
felt it before as if it's the very first time that you

36
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,760
are sensing

37
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,000
sensing more fully

38
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:32,639
sensing and caring for the body and one expression of caring is to relax

39
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:40,698
to soften the body the tensions of the body

40
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:26,419
softening around any tension that doesn't want to relax it's okay

41
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:32,160
to be tense if it's difficult to Let It Go

42
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:39,120
being okay sitting here with it feeling your body

43
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,280
maybe feeling the global body

44
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,960
in whatever way that's easy

45
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:11,300
breathing in space as you inhale

46
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:19,740
in a sense as we inhale the toward the chest ribcage lungs expand

47
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,919
and in a sense there's more space within that's created

48
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:44,300
and as we inhale in the chest expands belly expands

49
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,800
we expand into the space around us

50
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:07,199
and that has your exhale perhaps relaxing into the space that

51
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,800
surrounds you

52
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:23,120
a releasing of fixed ideas of yourself of your body

53
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,580
loosening up the line between you and the space around you

54
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:38,539
the line between your thoughts and the space around your thoughts

55
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:13,139
as you exhale softening the thinking mind

56
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:16,139
relaxing

57
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:40,380
we often don't know how much goodness is within us

58
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:47,180
because we're telling ourselves stories and ideas of the opposite

59
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:59,279
to relax those stories those ideas sitting here gently breathing in space

60
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,899
relaxing into space

61
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:12,839
trusting for these few minutes that you are better than you ever could

62
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:15,620
have imagined

63
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:27,620
that there's more goodness within than you ever could have known

64
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:44,120
and as you breathe out Here and Now

65
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:52,279
maybe all things can be beautiful

66
00:09:54,180 --> 00:10:02,360
not least because we stopped the stories and ideas that they are otherwise

67
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:30,740
letting go letting go of the chatter of thinking

68
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:34,519
judging wanting

69
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:42,259
perhaps so you can listen deeply Within

70
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:50,120
when we let go of trying to be good

71
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:56,779
but listen with a quiet mind

72
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:04,519
you might discover there's more goodness within than you ever could have imagined

73
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,539
let go and listen deeply

74
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:21,178
tenderly

75
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:14,480
foreign

76
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,100
to listen well

77
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:21,559
is to know how to quiet

78
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:29,400
the voices inside the ideas the desires

79
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:35,520
that interfere with an open listening

80
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,980
maybe a listening from the heart

81
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:55,340
a listening that's not trying to control things

82
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,600
fix things

83
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:18,139
listening that where we listen to our own heart

84
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:26,778
to our own depths quietly and non-judgmentally

85
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:47,520
and then to listen to others not through the filter of our desires or

86
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:55,100
our fears our resentments and annoyances

87
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:03,080
but to listen from the quiet heart

88
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:15,360
and if we listen from the heart we might be able to listen

89
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,220
to the hearts of others

90
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:29,460
to listen to what's deeper within them than their

91
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:34,278
words they say the behaviors they do

92
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:08,840
to listen in such a way that we are connected

93
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:13,100
with each other's hearts

94
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,140
and from there

95
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:39,299
to offer to the world our our good will

96
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:46,760
our well-wishing May It Be

97
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:54,380
that what we learn through meditation

98
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:02,340
serves us to live a life that promotes the welfare

99
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:08,840
and happiness of everyone our self-included

100
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:14,659
may all beings be happy

101
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:20,360
may all beings be safe

102
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,658
may all beings be peaceful

103
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:32,120
may all beings be free

104
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,860
foreign

105
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:49,200
[Music]

106
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,360
thank you

107
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:05,039
so good morning hello on this Wednesday morning and

108
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:11,700
the third talk on wise listening

109
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:16,740
I could just as well maybe call it a um

110
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:23,039
caring listening with care but why is listening

111
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:28,320
and there's a story in the ramayana one of the great Classics of Indian

112
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:36,539
literature and religion of Rama uh going for a walk Walking in the

113
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:41,820
forest and Rama Hears A Very faint voice

114
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:46,919
and he can't quite hear what it is but he's listening and getting very quiet

115
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:52,080
very still maybe if he stands still so he can listen to that what's this voice

116
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:57,419
he hears in the forest and he still can't quite hear what it's

117
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:03,720
saying but after a while he gets some sense of from where it's the voice is coming

118
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:11,340
and it guides him to to walk in that direction it kind of follows the voice listens and as he gets closer to the

119
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:16,679
source he begins hearing what the voice is saying

120
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:23,039
and it's saying his name Rama Rama

121
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:29,279
and so he listens and he goes closer and closer finally it comes to this very

122
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:37,220
large Boulder and uh and it seems like the voice is coming from inside the boulder

123
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:45,299
and uh and so then he puts he gently puts his hand and touches the boulder

124
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:51,899
at which point the boulder kind of dissolves and there's a

125
00:32:51,899 --> 00:33:00,299
a woman emerges out of that Boulder

126
00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:06,360
and uh and they agreed and they somehow I don't know how the story goes beyond

127
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:11,940
that but in a sense he meets himself

128
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:18,240
that part of himself which is petrified that's locked in that's frozen that's

129
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:26,100
hidden and lost to him even himself and so this idea that there is some if

130
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:32,640
you listen care if we know how to listen or the equivalent is to send sort of

131
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:40,380
feel where the listening is not through the filter of our desires filters of our

132
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:46,559
uh ideas of self and the conceits we have about how terrible we are or how

133
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:53,419
wonderful we are or how you know that Define and limit ourselves

134
00:33:53,419 --> 00:34:00,380
that there's no hindrances in the listening there's no aversion no

135
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:07,320
agitation and no spinning of stories and and bringing along the luggage of the

136
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:13,679
past the memories but just to learn how to listen the peaceful quiet Deep Way

137
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,898
not even listening with the ears but listening with the whole body or listening with a heart

138
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:24,720
and there is within us something that is calling us maybe not

139
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:30,118
with our name but uh for the language of the Buddha it's the Dharma

140
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:36,500
that's coming here come here come here I think

141
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:45,720
invites us to come invites us to investigate and so come and see come and see

142
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:52,080
so if you listen to this kind of sometimes very subtle voice that's within this message from within

143
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:59,040
and then follow it to get closer to it sense it until we can do the equivalent of

144
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:06,000
putting our hands gently on it the image that I like is the idea of cupping our hands together and coming

145
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:13,079
underneath and just holding what's there with support sometimes what's deep inside is fear

146
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:18,720
sometimes it's sorrow sometimes it's hurt just to hold it

147
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:27,540
gently um and uh and um and then whatever is petrified

148
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:34,260
whatever is Frozen whatever um is locked within has a chance to

149
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:40,920
dissolve and um and so here we have a story of listening deeply

150
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:47,579
listening and hearing and listen going along with what we're hearing and um

151
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:54,900
and so uh the role of listening some people will say that uh listening

152
00:35:54,900 --> 00:36:00,300
requires some degree of letting go of control you know if we don't like what we're

153
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:07,619
seeing we can close our eyes and we can look away to you know in a sense maybe we can't do

154
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:13,460
the same thing with the ears um we can't you know you can put I guess you guys guess you can put uh

155
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:20,520
earplugs in cover your ears but uh the um

156
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:28,920
the ears are just more kind of open to what's there and uh so to uh you'll control what you

157
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:35,099
hear there's a loss letting go of control of a certain type when we and that's a part of the

158
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:41,280
challenge of really good listening is the the balance between the control to

159
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,440
listen and the letting go of control of what we're hearing

160
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:52,339
and if we're listening to ourselves in a deep way the same kind of balance of

161
00:36:52,339 --> 00:36:59,160
having enough control of ourselves to be able to really listen but in such a way that we're letting go

162
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:04,619
of control of what we're listening to that we allow what's listening what

163
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:10,800
we're listening sensing feeling to show itself and so

164
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:16,079
um this is where this wonderful poem by Walt Whitman

165
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:23,040
uh much of it is wonderful I think and called a song of the open road

166
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,380
and um so um

167
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:34,640
uh so here in the kind of the middle of the long poem

168
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:41,280
I'll start from this sentence from this hour

169
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:47,579
Freedom with an exclamation mark so from this hour

170
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:53,760
freedom from this hour I ordain myself loosened

171
00:37:53,760 --> 00:38:00,720
of limits and imaginary lines listening to others

172
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:07,500
and considering well what they say pausing

173
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:13,859
searching receiving contemplating

174
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:19,500
gently but with undeniable will

175
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:25,859
divesting myself of the holes that would hold me

176
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:32,460
I inhale droughts of space the East and the West are mined and the

177
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:37,680
north and south are mine I am larger better

178
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:44,760
than I thought I did not know I held so much goodness

179
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:49,220
all seems beautiful to me

180
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:54,900
so there here we have this wonderful combination of letting go of

181
00:38:54,900 --> 00:39:02,040
here he's called it holds attachments letting go of control even at the same

182
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:08,400
time a very clear sense of being in charge of oneself first he makes this very strong

183
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:13,619
statement that it's kind of like a promise or a state assertion that from

184
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:19,200
now on I'm going to be free and how we can say that with confidence

185
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,960
and because you can't just make yourself free of course but I think that he's seen something

186
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,060
inside of himself some capacity not to hold himself

187
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:35,220
uh not to not to uh

188
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:42,859
hold himself in bondage not to keep himself from his only inner freedom

189
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:50,640
and I ordained myself loosened of limits and imaginary lines this is a great out

190
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:57,079
of Buddhism that we limit ourselves with our thoughts our constructs the the

191
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:04,079
imaginary lines definitions that we use to understand ourselves the world around us and people

192
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:10,020
and um and then he's going to listen to others so he's not saying the result of his

193
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:16,740
freedom he's thinking he could do whatever he wants overriding people and not caring for them the first thing he

194
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:22,619
says he's going to do with his freedom is to listen to others

195
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:30,540
and considering well what they say I hear this to be wishing to God to be

196
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:37,680
giving them the benefit of the doubt and listen well what listening well means for me is you want to listen below their

197
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,839
words you want to listen even below the surface emotions that's driving their

198
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:48,180
words listen to either their goodness that's deep inside

199
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:53,820
listen to the pain which is deep inside listen to that potential for goodness

200
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:59,940
and Freedom From Pain that's deep inside everyone everyone listen to that so that

201
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:07,760
in the listening you may be beginning to awaken that possibility of freedom in them

202
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:14,400
so first thing with this Freedom he says is that he's going to listen to others pausing searching receiving

203
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:20,339
contemplating and divesting himself of what holds that

204
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:25,440
would hold me and for then after the you know after

205
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:32,880
listening then he talks about just Infinite Space becoming everything becoming large and spacious

206
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:40,560
when he's let go of what holds him his attachments then there's a feeling of expansiveness

207
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:46,200
and I am larger and better than I thought I did not know I held so much goodness

208
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:50,838
imagine listening to others

209
00:41:52,880 --> 00:42:00,720
you know where you know that they are better than they've ever thought so the third guideline for speaking that

210
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:06,300
Buddha gave is speak in a way that goes right to the heart

211
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:11,460
touches other people's hearts touches your own heart

212
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:17,640
so with listening listen from the heart lifts it in a way that touches the

213
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:24,960
hearts of others listen in a way that you have let go of your attachments so you can be attuned

214
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:31,619
to the possibility potential for freedom and peace and happiness that others have

215
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:38,160
because if we're only reacting to the surface to their anger to their bitterness to

216
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:45,359
their complaints to their fears their anxieties we don't want to deny those and not see

217
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:50,640
it and not understand that but if we only listen to that we kind of

218
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:56,640
stay at that level it might even reinforce that that's all that's all that counts that's

219
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:03,000
all there is but if you can listen to what's deeper listen in a way that touches their

220
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:10,500
hearts listen from a way that you're listening from your heart from your capacity for a

221
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:17,359
deeper tenderness a deeper love a deeper care and maybe then you can begin

222
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:23,960
doing the work that Walt Whitman says pausing searching receiving

223
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:29,599
contemplating that maybe allows you to be attuned to how

224
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:36,060
they are larger better than you think but also they're better

225
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:41,460
than they thought ever thought that maybe you discover

226
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:49,200
that they hold a lot of goodness but maybe your gift is you see that they

227
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:55,200
hold more goodness than they ever realized and you appreciate that you appreciate them

228
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:00,660
that's what allows this affirming of the goodness of others is recognizing it's

229
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:05,819
amazing what that makes room for and allows to happen and come forth that

230
00:44:05,819 --> 00:44:11,099
will not come forth if we remain in our reactivity to them or in our trying to

231
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:16,800
control them or fix them so to listen well

232
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:24,480
to listen to what calls you in the forest

233
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:30,540
deep inside and to listen to what's deep inside in

234
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:36,599
the forest of others may we all listen to each other well

235
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:43,640
and in that listening bring forth the best in all of us thank you
