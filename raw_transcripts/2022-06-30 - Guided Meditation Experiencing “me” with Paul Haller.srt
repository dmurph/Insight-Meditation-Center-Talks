1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:12,280
give up from quiet cloudy san francisco morning

2
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,880
it has occurred to me over the years of practicing meditation

3
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:35,680
that we can never remind ourselves too often of just how

4
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,239
the process of mindfulness works

5
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,239
phil did you get those messages that the video is not working

6
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:08,439
it's enabled now okay okay

7
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,799
so the process of how mindfulness engages our human consciousness

8
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,400
we can't remind ourselves too often just how that is

9
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,759
the the usual way of being it's me

10
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,759
in my world it's so um persistent

11
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,840
that and it's just as an assumption we make

12
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,159
and mindfulness is to bring attention to me

13
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:09,200
and my world but not to

14
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,760
change it into what it should be that the outrageous proposition of

15
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:24,000
mindfulness is that just how it is it is the ground of awareness

16
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,200
is is the content of awareness you know there is within us

17
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,480
i think through our deep dedication to practice

18
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,080
a strong impulse to curate it to manage it

19
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,440
to influence it in a way that's more

20
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,840
appropriate of course more appropriate is according

21
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:01,040
to me whatever our being constructs as appropriate

22
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,120
there's a teaching that persists in many schools of buddhism that say the

23
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:15,440
awakened are awakened to the workings of karmic mind

24
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:23,120
so this is our teacher the very karmic conditioning

25
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:29,920
that constructs me and my world and interacts with it

26
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,080
and approves and disapproves and has the full range of feelings and memories and

27
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,200
associations around it this is

28
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:50,560
this is what's being offered in the practice of awareness

29
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00,920
so with that in mind to simply notice

30
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:14,400
now liz mind this morning or this afternoon wherever time zone

31
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,680
how is mine now

32
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:30,320
and as you open in that way can you can you

33
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:36,479
can you notice a shift from

34
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:44,000
me constructing something to experiencing me

35
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,360
the shift from the mind that has an agenda

36
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,840
to awareness of that mind

37
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,600
and sometimes we initiate that will be

38
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,000
just by attending to the content

39
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,840
noting acknowledging

40
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,800
and as we do that to notice

41
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,599
is there any impulse to curate

42
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,919
to nudge it over to how it should be

43
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:54,638
i'd suggest you this morning to let it be the wild and beautiful thing that it is

44
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:04,759
how amazing that in this moment we are the product of a lifetime

45
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:13,759
actually through the product of a stream of lifetimes

46
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,440
we're a product of our environment

47
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,880
of the experiences that have shaped us

48
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,600
here is crystallized into me

49
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,159
what is me right now

50
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,919
what's happening in mind what's happening in the realm of

51
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,560
emotions

52
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:07,919
and can it be drawn into body can it be embodied

53
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:20,440
can it be noticed as it reverberates through physical beings

54
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:50,160
and as it happens this mind

55
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,879
conjuring up whatever it conjures up

56
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,440
can we allow it can we breathe it in

57
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,680
can we allow it to be just what it is

58
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:37,360
and can we notice the disposition of allowance

59
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,719
allowing what is to be experienced

60
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,360
experiencing the experience

61
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,640
me being me

62
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:02,279
expressing being moment by moment

63
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,920
embodying the experience that's happening

64
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:30,200
breathing it in and releasing it with the exhale

65
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:23,039
can mind be allowed to be exactly what it is

66
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,640
can then be held in awareness

67
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:38,880
embodying in here and now whatever

68
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,840
appears in consciousness

69
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,589
[Music]

70
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,559
um

71
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:24,339
[Music]

72
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:50,320
if i may ask could you hear the reverberation of the bell this morning

73
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:56,840
no ah someone sent me a message telling me how

74
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:01,600
to alter the sound but

75
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:09,720
apparently i didn't register it correctly

76
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,200
i'll try again tomorrow

77
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,960
this radical proposition that's implicit in

78
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:34,320
the awakened are awakened by karmic consciousness

79
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:45,840
there's a formulation in buddhism about the nature of consciousness

80
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:52,080
it has three categories the first one is

81
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:57,120
discriminative mind the mind that thinks and judges and

82
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:03,039
concludes and then the second one is

83
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:09,279
literally the sanskrit word is which means heart

84
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:16,000
it's like the emotional the feeling the way in which water rises

85
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:25,679
has we as the phrase i've been using we take it personally you know it becomes

86
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,640
an involvement in me and the world according to me

87
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:38,158
and then the third my consciousness is

88
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,080
the realm of experience

89
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,320
what is the realm of experiencing well

90
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:59,840
it's the functioning of chitta and the functioning of pradaya the

91
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,039
functioning of discriminating mind and the functioning

92
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:10,320
of feeling mind psychological mind however you want to

93
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,039
describe it

94
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:21,840
and so the very practice of mindfulness is simply

95
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:28,000
attending to the thinking and the feeling

96
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:35,519
and coming into contact with the experiential

97
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:41,440
level of being in the early sutras it says

98
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,880
that this experiential is where the learning

99
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:53,679
of what is happens that each of us

100
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:59,880
is a miraculous expression of being

101
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:07,039
and it's offered to us as a way as a context

102
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:14,159
to be aware of you know i've been quoting that

103
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:21,440
statement by martin luther king the challenging experiences

104
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:27,600
can be instructive educational was the word he used

105
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:33,919
and they can also be transformative

106
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:41,519
as we live in this world according to me

107
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:47,760
and me according to me as we live within its confines

108
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:56,240
there's a construct of being there's a construct of what is there's

109
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:02,720
even a construct of what's happening in the moment and the more we invite

110
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,080
the experiencing the more that's illuminated

111
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:16,159
the more it becomes evident me being me becomes more evident and as it

112
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:21,519
does it becomes educational

113
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:31,519
and it invites a a greater be a being beyond just

114
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:38,960
the be the world according to me maybe to put it a little poetically we

115
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:47,279
could say it's a shift from the world according to me to me according to the world

116
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:58,399
and the interface is what's being experienced moment by moment

117
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,679
and this is the great intrigue and challenge of mindfulness

118
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:18,480
yesterday i offered this illustration of myself in a meeting you know

119
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:24,960
in watching that impulse the

120
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,878
subtle reactiveness or maybe not so subtle reactiveness

121
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:36,560
when something when i heard that something was had been

122
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:43,119
arranged in a way that was disappointing to me

123
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,440
well let's cancel it

124
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:58,800
it's me and my world would like things to fit more within my

125
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:05,839
agendas my preferences and then as we see that

126
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,559
we see it and in a way we see through it

127
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:21,440
oh that's me in my world trying to

128
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,280
corral this vast endless existence

129
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:32,960
into the way i would like it to be

130
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,920
not to condemn ourselves for such thoughts and feelings

131
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:48,079
but more to be instructed by the awakened

132
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,839
awakened to karmic consciousness

133
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:05,838
and can we hold that with benevolence

134
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,480
okay can we let there be within our being in

135
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:20,560
evolution oh yes

136
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:27,200
indeed i do have preferences i do have ways of seeing things

137
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:33,040
and yes they are self-centered however

138
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:38,720
i can still invite into my way of being

139
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:45,680
an ever-growing re-calibration

140
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,800
of what it is to be

141
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,960
a burdensome for others if i just go around trying to insist

142
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,160
the world should always be the way i want it

143
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:09,839
and how human it is that when it's not the way i want it

144
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:18,480
it disturbs me and that's how it is for everyone

145
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:24,560
but it's not the way we want it it's disturbing it's challenging

146
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:32,560
it's upsetting why not

147
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:40,799
and when we see it it's like we're inviting

148
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:48,680
a deep sanity into being and a deep compassion

149
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,279
indeed isn't this the way we're made

150
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:03,520
isn't this how our neurology works how our psychology works

151
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,440
how our somatic being works

152
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:17,680
isn't this complex organism of being a human subject to these

153
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:26,800
impulses and can we sit and practice awareness

154
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:34,240
with a willingness and an attentiveness of being

155
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:41,040
this this interplay

156
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:46,079
of all being through

157
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,240
this particular being that i am

158
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:00,800
as we enter the world can we appreciate and allow

159
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:05,759
that everybody else is having their version of it too

160
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:15,440
can we dance together you know can we collaborate can we collude

161
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:21,040
can we support each other can we offer our patience

162
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:25,839
and our empathy to others

163
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,960
can we offer them to ourselves

164
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:38,960
as we experience the moment's version

165
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,839
of this interplay being

166
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,960
can we open to its teaching

167
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:58,400
and its teaching will be the world according to me

168
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:05,520
and the me according to me and the preferences and the versions

169
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:12,078
that are em embedded in both of those

170
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,640
that's the ground of awakening

171
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:29,359
or whether someone praises us or insults us or delights us or frustrates us

172
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:33,160
that's the grind of

173
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,640
and then for each of us to discover

174
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:49,279
how to stay close to that sensibility

175
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:56,559
how to keep referencing it

176
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:07,280
and to remind ourselves that complex and amazing as the human

177
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:14,480
condition is in another way it's fragile

178
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,559
it's asking for a reassurance

179
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:28,960
it's asking for a wise compassion

180
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:37,040
so as we open up to the workings of yourself

181
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:43,920
it's very very helpful if we bring that compassion

182
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:50,800
that skillfulness and that wisdom and part of the heritage of our practice

183
00:41:50,800 --> 00:42:00,200
our buddhist practices at embodying helps to create stability

184
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:12,880
there's a teaching that says that when we meditate that would be practice

185
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:20,480
mindfulness it it offers us a kind of protection

186
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:28,839
from the excesses that we're capable of it offers us a kind of support

187
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,800
so we offer a kind of benevolence to ourselves

188
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:42,318
we offer ourselves a support

189
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:49,040
a reassurance a trust

190
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:55,760
and it's not that we offer these things just in the level of

191
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:02,240
thinking although we that's a very helpful way to engage them

192
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,400
but if we can embody it as well

193
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,520
if the core of our being

194
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,800
can find a reassurance and often that's

195
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:25,680
how the body is contracting in the breath how they're contracting

196
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,078
or expanding

197
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:40,599
and then there's a way we can do something similar with our attitude and disposition

198
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,760
okay this is how it is

199
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:58,319
can that statement can it have

200
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:01,680
a tenderness to it

201
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:11,039
but when it's pleasant can we soak up appreciation

202
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:21,119
and when it's unpleasant can we watch

203
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:27,040
how that ripples through us can we have compassion

204
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,560
in the ways we contract

205
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:40,640
we have an empathy for others in the ways they contract

206
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:54,559
so each day this is

207
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:02,079
for some reason the word that comes to mind is the prayer of our practice

208
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,960
this is the aspiration of

209
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:14,078
what we carry out into the world to discover

210
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:23,040
the new day this way of being that's invited to go beyond

211
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:28,240
me and mine in my world

212
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:37,280
may this day bring you lots of moments

213
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:42,680
of awakening thank you
