1
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,939
foreign

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:18,359
and can you hear me okay wonderful and uh

3
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,939
I guess a little bit to our social distancing but I like the number we have here it's kind

4
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:29,220
of cozy today I wish we were all kind of sitting closer together and

5
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:35,960
don't I guess we don't have to move I'm just I'm sharing it not as an idea that to sit closer together but rather

6
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,280
to express my kind of my warmth or my coziness that we're here together this

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,800
way and so thank you for being here but maybe in

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,340
order to feel a little bit of that maybe we can go around the room and you can say your names if you're willing with

9
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,600
the mic so I can hear it

10
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:11,060
I'm Sage yeah my name is Jim

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:19,220
my name my name is sveta I'm Nancy

12
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:29,479
Sally hi my name is Abhishek

13
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,700
hi I'm Jeff

14
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:45,079
I'm Andre hi I'm Catherine

15
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:53,298
I am Janus hi I'm April

16
00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:00,299
hi I'm Kathy I'm malvika

17
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:06,420
and keep the mic there you turn maybe turn off Alpha thank you all very much this uh

18
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:12,840
just kind of I would remember the name so well but it was um

19
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,239
just as a way of kind of coming together and our voices a little bit

20
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,660
in down through the centuries and religious circles people would chant together or

21
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:30,959
sing together and sharing of voices and breathing breathing and sound and

22
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,300
everything kind of begins to meld and something think deeper melts deep inside

23
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:42,660
and I think the same thing happens when people meditate together maybe it's not so quick or so obvious

24
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:48,540
but it's remarkable to um the kind of inner sensibility or

25
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:54,420
their ins in the inner kind of sharing of a certain kind of

26
00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:01,200
purpose a certain kind of sense set of values a certain set of

27
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,920
of uh awareness that kind of is born in meditation and then to do that together

28
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,680
in other with other people nearby um I think for every each person that

29
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,280
the whole experience is different but it's also something we share something that happens in community

30
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:28,080
and it's very valuable part of all this and um and maybe that could be a good

31
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,400
introduction to the theme of what I want to talk about today and that is

32
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,959
some some words about the ethics in Buddhism and particularly the five

33
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:46,739
precepts and um I think it's kind of natural it feels

34
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:52,620
much more natural to living in Epic living an ethical way where you live careful about the impact we have in

35
00:03:52,620 --> 00:04:00,239
others so we don't hurt them when we're in community when we have a shared life together and and so if you

36
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:06,480
sit and meditate people or share some kind of something that's kind of intimate and close where maybe you're

37
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,239
touched Yourself by the opening the relaxation the the inner kind of sense

38
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:19,440
of connection just so maybe a little more calm or Freedom or something that you have and to share that with others you know

39
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,960
is a remarkable thing and probably you don't want to kind of just walk up

40
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:31,320
to someone here and just kind of you know swear angrily at them they just

41
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:36,660
it would feel kind of a little bit like feel kind of off I think

42
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:42,320
or try to kill them or steal from them and they might have better shoes than you

43
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,520
and uh you know so you need to go home with them instead um

44
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,979
many years ago when we were in Palo Alto a lot of people used to have Birkenstocks then much more than now and

45
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:59,220
so I had them and one evening there was somehow three different pairs that ended

46
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:06,918
up on three different people's feet and I ended up with better Birkenstocks

47
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:13,380
I tried to find the owner but that never happened but anyway so you know we tend to kind

48
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:18,680
of have a different feeling and relationship with each other like this and then imagine that this sensibility

49
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:24,000
of how we are maybe sometimes not saying we have it here today completely the way

50
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,880
I'm saying it but you know some sensibility of kind of sense of connectivity and sensitivity and

51
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:36,479
appreciation and with meditation sometimes we kind of tend to see people as beautiful

52
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:42,180
that's kind of wonderful and um so we begin discovering it in

53
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:47,940
kind of in this kind of environment and imagine if we start seeing everyone in the world that way

54
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:55,199
you kind of walk you you you kind of that becomes more your default for how to see people and be

55
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:02,280
with people rather than default being fear thinking about people or or hostility

56
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:09,300
and because blaming you know people are somehow um you know at fault

57
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:17,160
they're not behaving properly and all kinds of things anyway so this idea that ethics would

58
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:22,800
come from some uh wouldn't come from a rule like you should do a certain way

59
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,740
and let me tell you all the good reasons why you should be ethical but rather it's our comings because

60
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:34,740
we're we're somehow we're changing inside there's an interchange of perception

61
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:43,259
change of disposition a change of sensitivity change of values and so that becomes

62
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:48,419
something that we want to protect or something when we live by or Care by or something

63
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:54,120
and so the precepts then don't become rules to live by

64
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,160
the Epic can be seen as protections to

65
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:07,139
um that keep us in that state there they are ways of living that

66
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:13,800
um protect us from falling back into the

67
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:20,639
opposite way where we might have hostility where we might have anxiety and close up where we

68
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,660
might have greed predominator desire is predominant that we were not so attuned

69
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:35,819
to others and not attuned to ourselves and so um but if it's Attunement

70
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:42,780
then you know you there's something here that's valuable to protect

71
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:48,139
there's something here that is precious and valuable

72
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,699
so um you know if you I don't know if you have this I've had this at home

73
00:07:53,699 --> 00:08:01,560
a drawer full of electronic wires and I don't know you know how they end

74
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:08,220
up in this way but they're like this big knot the mess of wires

75
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:16,139
and it takes a while to sort them out and put them out and change you know get them all kind of free from each other so

76
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:22,860
they can use them easily later on and that usually I think people don't say well I did the work that's great now

77
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:29,460
they're easy to use and then you just bump them throw them back in the drawer I mean it's kind of silly right there's

78
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:36,000
a kind of instant you don't so we do all this work to untangle all the wires in our hearts and our minds

79
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,180
our complicated entanglements with people and ourselves and our history and our memories and our hurts and our

80
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:48,600
vengeances and our our hopes and aspirations I mean it's like that drawer in there is like

81
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:55,700
pretty and then we sit and meditate then we undo all those Tangles it's worthwhile

82
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:01,800
not losing and not putting it all back in the drawer and getting it all and not only putting back a door we put it in

83
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:07,620
the washing machine laughs you know it's a worthwhile kind of

84
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:13,200
protecting it a little better so in this practice after a while we have a clear sense

85
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,360
a kind of matter-of-fact sense a practical sense there's something really

86
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:25,440
great going on here and this wonderful thing we're tapping into this is worth protecting this is

87
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,660
It's Worth kind of keeping it this way so from that point of view

88
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:37,620
these five precepts that we have the ethical precepts are ways of

89
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:43,920
protecting ourselves from losing something important

90
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:50,519
and their way of protecting our community from losing something important the

91
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:57,240
Community Connection the respect for each other they care for each other some deeper more attuned way of living with

92
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:04,320
each other and um so the five precepts that

93
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:10,740
um you know I probably most of you live with most of them but the world doesn't

94
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,899
all you have to do is read the news news and you know the world doesn't live this way

95
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:22,200
but there's um so not killing and so this is a this is like the number

96
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:28,380
one Cardinal the precept in Buddhism and that doesn't just mean don't kill other

97
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:35,040
human beings but live a non-harming life be careful ideally you wouldn't kill any

98
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,100
animals any pests any insects you would be really careful with that

99
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:47,040
and you know where the line is between what you feel like you have to do to protect yourself

100
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:53,040
you know I mean some of us will take antibiotics so that's kind of you know

101
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:59,519
can we kill those poor bacteria before they kill us but uh you know where does that line go

102
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:06,000
where we feel like that's I can't allow that to live because that crosses the line for me that is too

103
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,300
difficult but what I've seen in meditation circles is that as people meditate the line gets

104
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:19,320
or the line around what's is okay to kill it gets smaller and smaller smaller smaller thing

105
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:25,440
and so much other people will not only not kill insects or little animals

106
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,019
they'll go out of their way to protect them I've known people who like

107
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:37,500
when there's a lot of people a place where there's like cars or bicycles something going after a fog and there's

108
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:44,519
all these slugs on the sidewalk and the people who go and kind of help the Slugs out of the sidewalk or

109
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:51,720
out of the road because they know otherwise they get squashed so you know is that silly to do that

110
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:58,740
it's not silly for the people the person who's doing it they're feeling attuned and some something very important and

111
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:05,779
it's not silly for the slug who's going to survive so this idea of not killing

112
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:11,700
not as a punitive rule not as a moralistic

113
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:19,620
commandment but rather a rising out of a desire to stay true to something that's

114
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:27,300
being born something that's been awake awoken something we've tapped into of course I don't want to harm someone

115
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:34,339
if you find that you want to hurt someone and punch them out something

116
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:39,720
the recommendation is you stop and take a good look at what's going on

117
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:45,720
if you take enough time to pause and check yourself out you probably find

118
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,760
You've Lost That Attunement You've Lost That connection to something that's very

119
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:55,860
valuable and important that way of being a value a disposition

120
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,899
all kinds of things that is some of the most beautiful ways a human being can live

121
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:06,060
in Buddhism we can't we use that when we use the word wealth we're not referring

122
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:12,000
to a wealthy person as someone who has a lot of money from the Buddhist point of view of what some wealthy people are

123
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,959
really poor because they don't have that Attunement they don't have that disposition they don't have that access to something that

124
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:25,440
that is um you know quite beautiful they're living with anxiety

125
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:32,459
Sophie if you want to punch someone out or you want to kill them they pest because we think it's bothering us

126
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:38,160
to stop and take a good look and see are you still attuned are you still coming from the place that you want to live

127
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,260
from because you know this that's where it really is good way of living

128
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:48,839
to get lost in stress is to get lost in entanglement while the

129
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:55,440
wire is all messed up again and sometimes it can take a while to do the untangling

130
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:02,220
the second precept is that's all the other precepts are kind of extensions of the first not harming

131
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:09,060
the second precept is not to take what is not given and you probably know this that the

132
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:15,240
reason it's worded this way rather than don't steal is that it's a two reasons

133
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,820
it's a it's a higher bar you have to be real it isn't that simply

134
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:27,240
you take something you have to wait until it's given before you use it even

135
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:34,139
so that there's real care about possession we'll care about generosity we don't care about understanding and uh

136
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:41,100
and exchange and friendship and you know the communication between people

137
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:47,399
and so you wouldn't take anything unless it's clearly been offered even if

138
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:54,060
uh sometimes if even if I think it's being offered but then you kind of wait and see you

139
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:59,160
know is it really being offered um food you know that someone has then

140
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:04,199
there's often a common thing for Buddhists to do is is if you go to someone's house on the coffee table

141
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:10,139
there's some kind of snack kind of the Assumption is that that's already being offered because that's

142
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:17,120
otherwise why would they have it there but some practitioners would simply not touch it when you know

143
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:23,519
until there's a clear oh please have some is that silly

144
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:30,300
have that kind of care what it does is it it conveys that you're a trustable person

145
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:36,480
you can trust me you can trust me with your things there was a at our Retreat Center some

146
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,579
years ago five six years ago someone

147
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:47,940
um dropped their wallet in the community hall floor and they so they they just put it next

148
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:54,899
to the Buddha at the altar there and uh because no one you know no one opened it no one I think it was they

149
00:15:54,899 --> 00:16:00,899
felt it was a safe place no one's going to take it there so they just left it there and some few days later the person

150
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:07,320
who lost the wallet realized it and were looking for it and there it was they hadn't moved 40 people living

151
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:14,760
together in a wallet you know it's right in the center of the building everyone to see and I think everyone kind of appreciated

152
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:20,100
this was a safe place this was a community people you can trust they're not going to take what is not given it's

153
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:26,220
like okay it's okay to leave it there I mean that's kind of remarkable in our society where do you find 40 people

154
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:33,260
where you have that level of trust especially if you've been strangers you know didn't know each other before

155
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:38,279
so they said you know cultivating trust and you know trust trusting between

156
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:46,139
people and helping everyone feel safe and then there's uh not harming others

157
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:52,100
with sexuality so not engaging in sexual misconduct

158
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:59,220
this is so much suffering in this world around sexuality I mean some of the

159
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:04,438
suffering you know one event the suffering can last over the rest of a

160
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:11,819
lifetime and it isn't just sex that that's so painful sometimes and what goes on but

161
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:17,819
sex that conveys power and aggression and and forcefulness and and violence

162
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:24,120
and and objectification and self-gratification conceit there's so

163
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:30,960
many things that can happen that make it askew sexuality sometimes can be phenomenally

164
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:37,320
selfish without really being attuned to someone else and it can be phenomenally selfless it

165
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:44,940
can be for beautiful expression of care for someone else so this is so and we don't even know

166
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:51,559
I've had to counsel people who were involved in

167
00:17:52,020 --> 00:18:00,780
causing harm with their sexuality and um and they've insisted it was consensual

168
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:06,900
but what it what they didn't know on the surface it was but what they didn't know was their partner

169
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:14,100
had had a very abusive history and so it couldn't say no

170
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:19,700
and and then the impact of sexuality

171
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:27,240
touched these deep places of wounding and Earth and fear that was not there on the surface and so

172
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:35,539
so how do you stay attuned to not cause harm with sex with our sexual Energies even sometimes uh

173
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:42,600
I've known I've known people who feel felt somehow violated just by how people looked at them because of the sexual

174
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:48,679
energy that goes on which makes Society the world uncomfortable

175
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:55,140
I was kind of a little bit horrified when I was 18.

176
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:01,860
and kind of what it meant to be a woman in some societies because I had long blonde hair that went

177
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:09,299
down halfway down my my torso and I was

178
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:15,000
so at some point I was I've been in a cross-country trip and um

179
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,340
it wasn't the United States another country and um and I was driving along on the

180
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:27,179
freeway every car that passed me that had demanded it turned to look at me

181
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:32,940
because in that country back then long blonde hair was very unusual to have for

182
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:37,980
men and um this was like 19

183
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:45,200
70 I think and um and so um

184
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:50,700
72 so so um but I was like wow is this what women

185
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:58,380
happens to women every person looks at them every man is is that kind of challenging

186
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:04,140
and um so is this doesn't this fit a little bit into that third precept of

187
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:09,840
of uh you know not abusing sexuality isn't that going to be some way that's

188
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,179
going to cause some people to live in fear or distress or to shut down or hide

189
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:21,059
away or do something so it's such a sensitive thing so to be

190
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:27,780
careful with this is such an important part of protecting something that's so valuable

191
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:34,559
not and at some point also with practice as we practice more deeply we feel how fragile or how vulnerable

192
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:42,440
this kind of inner disposition of openness and care and sensitivity and freedom can be

193
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:49,320
that we want to protect other people for having that as well we don't want other people to have their hearts closed

194
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:54,780
I had my heart closed when I was 15 and or a teenager a number of times where I

195
00:20:54,780 --> 00:21:00,600
just felt like a door just you know closed because of what happened to me

196
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,760
and it took sometimes years took this practice sometimes too that I did to

197
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,120
have that finally have the trust to be open that up again

198
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:17,760
so the same thing can be true with a fourth precept not to lie

199
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:25,620
to lie is ruins Trust causes people to feel afraid if it's the

200
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:31,200
Betrayed some people again will close up and say well if I'm betrayed in that

201
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:37,580
kind of lie I don't know who to trust so I'll just keep to myself and not open up

202
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:43,440
it can cause a lot of harm to people to go around lying

203
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:49,200
and it it undermines the level of trust that we can have in society and with

204
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,320
each other and so to have a high

205
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,658
sensitivity in high care for being truthful

206
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,340
and and to be truthful in caring ways

207
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:10,679
there are people who use truth as a weapon that that doesn't feel good

208
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:16,980
people use truth carelessly and say things what's true so it's okay to say it

209
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:22,679
and that's why the first pre-step is so important you want to you know if you speak you want to speak in ways that

210
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:27,960
doesn't cause harm and the strict meeting of the first precept not to kill

211
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:33,780
can be used metaphorically that a line can can something can die in other

212
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:41,340
people if they uh if they receive they hear you know live a lie or notice some

213
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:46,399
someone lied in some powerful way on them and they feel betrayed

214
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:55,860
but more importantly for people who do mindfulness meditation mindfulness meditation is a practice of

215
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:01,320
truth-telling to oneself I like to think of that mindfulness out loud is being

216
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:09,720
honest and saying you know honestly what's happening so if you're not if you lie you're doing

217
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:15,240
the very opposite of what we're trying to do in this practice even if you know your line you're

218
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:21,659
mindfully lying you're still a part of you is going against the grain of mindfulness and the kind of clarity of

219
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:27,419
practice so if you're serious about this practice why would you lie it's the very thing

220
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:35,658
you're trying not to do you're trying to actually you know you know live a truthful life even if it's only to yourself

221
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:40,860
and then the fifth one is is to avoid intoxication

222
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:46,380
and this one's a little bit more it's a little bit ambiguous because

223
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:51,480
um and in the Buddhist tradition kind of recognizes it kind of stands out as an

224
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:57,000
anomaly compared to the other four so it doesn't quite fit in the same category

225
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,280
and and so for example I don't remember exactly the ancient language but it's

226
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:07,980
kind of like they say the first four are referred to as being a kind of

227
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:15,659
corruption or impurity but they never say that about the fifth one not drinking not getting intoxicated

228
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:21,840
and I think the reason for that is best there's no explanation for why this is the case but one of the best reasons for

229
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,740
that is that it's possible to intoxicate oneself

230
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:34,679
um uh alone without it having to have an impact on

231
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:41,700
anyone else there's no harm being caught being wished on someone else there's no harm

232
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:47,640
being wished on oneself there's no um there's no

233
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:53,659
um sometimes actually it's the opposite there's something inside of us that's trying to protect ourselves or or

234
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:59,340
protect ourselves from Despair and anger and pain and and try to you know escape

235
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:05,280
the difficulties in life it is a kind of caretaking sometimes that people are doing

236
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:10,340
and um and also because uh there's uh

237
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:17,400
there's you know taking small dosages that some people are used medicinally or

238
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:24,120
something it doesn't really cause people to get intoxicated so are we really supposed to avoid all all intoxicating

239
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:31,400
drinks for example and for Buddhist monastics they're actually allowed to have alcohol

240
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:39,559
in food provided that they can't taste it

241
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:45,900
and and only if someone offers that the food to them they can't go make their own food and

242
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:51,659
put in and um so uh you know the the

243
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:58,100
you know it's you know it's only in very rare circumstance but that can happen

244
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:03,980
so um um

245
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:10,039
but the uh again there's so much amazing

246
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:15,659
astounding amount of suffering that happens in our societies because of

247
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:22,080
intoxication people die I mean every day there's probably I

248
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:28,020
don't know lots and lots of people are dying from overdosing drugs somehow from alcoholism

249
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:33,179
it's phenomenal the destroyed families the children I I

250
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:38,760
hear all these stories of people growing up with alcoholic parents who are raging

251
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:45,059
parents when they're drunk and the impact that has in the children is is dramatic and that also can last for a

252
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:51,659
lifetime if they don't find some way to heal from it so to um

253
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:57,500
uh if we live this kind of meditative life

254
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:05,279
and that's the emphasis here for today's talk then I think we would feel or sense or

255
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:10,799
be concerned with the impact our life has on the world and the impact Our

256
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:16,559
Lives has on ourselves and the deleterious impact of

257
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:22,620
breaking the five precepts both for others and for for us doing

258
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:31,559
them is such that we're destroying the very kind of inner life that we're

259
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:38,940
cultivating and Awakening through this practice so what we're cultivating here The

260
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:44,159
Awakening here is in fact worth protecting

261
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:49,260
is in fact something is worth kind of safeguarding

262
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:55,919
and a powerful way of safeguarding it is to live by these five precepts to have a

263
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:01,260
very high commitment to them and so be very careful

264
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:08,039
and what you'll find if you do this is that there's a kind of

265
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:13,500
you know you know I think most of you I'm probably all of you in most ways are

266
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:20,880
probably very ethical then what happens we get more and more sensitive to nuances just that we never

267
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:27,840
thought about before so for example exaggeration is that a kind of lie

268
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:36,059
and then if you look why am I exaggerating because that's what we do we always ask why why why why am I exaggerating

269
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:42,059
and sometimes it's not very something to be proud of why we exaggerate

270
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:48,419
we're trying to build ourselves up and say no I went to the best restaurant in town why did we why do we want to tell

271
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:53,700
people that because we wanted we made a good choice We want to see that show people we've

272
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:58,940
you know but a good wonderful person we are because we had the best or something

273
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:06,140
or some people exaggerate because say what because they

274
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:12,840
I don't know if you all kinds of reasons that are not necessarily so healthy

275
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,940
so it isn't that we accept you know there's a requirement to stop at

276
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:24,659
um exaggerating it just says you know what is what's their request what's the inspiration

277
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:30,840
that comes out of this inner life that gets born from

278
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:38,460
meditation if we ask our hearts after meditation what's your what's your request part

279
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:44,520
how should I live I doubt the heart's going to say about the kill

280
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:50,399
or break the precepts it's the opposite the hearts the hearts request is to live

281
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:56,460
a good life is to live a life that lets that heart sing and be happy and

282
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:03,299
safe and contented and so in this practice

283
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:10,260
there comes at various times in the practice where we discover something has been born something has been awakened in

284
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:16,860
US that becomes a treasure and that treasure is something we want

285
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:22,500
to care for we don't want to cling to it

286
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:28,200
certainly though there's a lot worse things to do to cling to honesty

287
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:34,919
so don't worry about it if that's what you're clinging to um the

288
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:40,919
but uh you don't want to cling to it or you don't want to uh use the precepts as

289
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:47,880
a way of being angry with ourselves disappointing or feeling bad about ourselves there's

290
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:53,159
an art to using this precepts not as a way to measure ourselves and that we

291
00:30:53,159 --> 00:31:00,899
didn't live up to our standards but rather to always live with the idea I'm going to try to do better

292
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:06,600
I didn't do as well as I maybe hoped I could feel the impact on me and I'm

293
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:12,360
going to so I hope I'm committed I'm aspire to let's do better here let's now

294
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:18,299
start over again find a new way today wake up tomorrow morning and I'll see what I can do to do

295
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:27,179
better rather than wake up the next morning and kind of be ground down by the self-criticism that can happen

296
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:32,640
because that's kind of coming out of this beautiful place that we have inside

297
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:39,600
and the more this beautiful awakened feelings and sensibilities Attunement occurs Within

298
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:47,279
the more treasure we have the more reference point we have that then guides us for how we want to live our life

299
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:54,120
and so it's not just a way a way to feel through meditation it's a way to live as

300
00:31:54,120 --> 00:32:00,720
well and finally this kind of a commitment to

301
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:07,320
practicing with the ethical precepts is a significant way

302
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:15,000
of helping the mindfulness practice touch all kinds of difficult places in

303
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,220
our lives and our hearts and our minds to to help reveal where mindfulness

304
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:26,940
should go so we can understand ourselves better and work through things it's a fantastic thing

305
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:33,240
so um to have something to we have something to safeguard

306
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:38,460
so what do you think of this this that's kind of the main point I wanted to make today

307
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:43,679
we have something to safeguard when we do this practice and I was wondering if some of you would

308
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:51,240
maybe be willing to say some words if you have discovered something that was worth safeguarding that's coming from

309
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:59,580
this practice and uh and so then share some of your ideas on this

310
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:03,080
topic anybody

311
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:28,880
sometimes it's dangerous not to speak because

312
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:35,880
I could call on you but I think actually oh you want to say

313
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,320
something sure great

314
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:50,580
um so I I can't imagine not safeguarding all of them in some way

315
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:55,759
or another but I will say it's complicated

316
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:01,100
it can be just so complicated

317
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:09,658
but is there some reference point inside you oh I feel like I I have a barometer

318
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:17,040
in my body I feel like I have a barometer because there's a level of

319
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:23,638
sandwich and how does that uh barometer show itself is it doing you know my my

320
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:30,540
shoulders rise my flywheel goes faster and it's like my body

321
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:35,878
speaks to me when I'm what would you call it crossing a line

322
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:42,440
Maybe Crossing online great great thank you that was nice to hear

323
00:34:54,359 --> 00:35:01,200
yeah um I know for me before I started this practice

324
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:08,640
um yeah I just think back and it's it's quite a transformation of

325
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:14,599
just uh five six years ago

326
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:20,220
um so yeah just have become

327
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:27,180
much more sensitive to um causing harm

328
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:30,440
and so it's

329
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,800
yeah it's just I'm just so grateful to to have this practice because it

330
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:43,820
the more I practice the more I want to live ethically by the precepts and

331
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:51,079
be careful with my actions thank you

332
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:06,000
hi um there's uh somebody who caused me a lot

333
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,500
of pain a few years ago and um

334
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:19,560
and that I spent a long time working through it and I

335
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:26,700
I just I just decided that I I can't I don't want to and I can't live this

336
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:33,680
life with any hate in my heart for anyone and um

337
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:39,240
yeah I mean I I feel like um

338
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:45,119
I feel like I don't have hate in my heart for this person anymore not to say that it wasn't there once

339
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:51,240
um and I don't I can't really explain how that happened but um yeah I think it's

340
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:57,200
it's because of the practice very nice thank you

341
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:09,680
I'm noticing that I'm becoming very very sensitive to

342
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:16,079
concealing the truth to it's about the the fourth precept

343
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:21,359
that I sometimes don't even know like don't

344
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:28,079
know what I'm hiding exactly but I kind of this this like in a barometer

345
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:34,320
oh something is there and

346
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:42,420
and also I'm noticing um something completely different

347
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:49,760
um sensitivity to like when I'm buying food and there's a lot of plastic

348
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:55,820
uh riping so I just feel uncomfortable so

349
00:37:55,820 --> 00:38:01,619
uh more and more uncomfortable so so what part of what grows is not just

350
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:06,839
necessarily inner beauty and treasures but inner discomfort yeah and that's

351
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:12,180
valuable too that's it can be a treasure it protects us from

352
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:18,260
doing something that we don't want to do thank you

353
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:25,640
so thank you those are wonderful comments is that enough and even unless someone else would like I'd love to

354
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:31,520
so thank you so um

355
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:40,200
and I don't know if some of you might be new to this all this so if this seems kind of strange

356
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:47,820
um the practice those bare wonderful fruits

357
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:54,660
and one of the wonderful fruits is uh an in strong interest even a commitment to

358
00:38:54,660 --> 00:39:02,359
living an ethical life not because you're supposed to but because it's the hearts request

359
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:09,200
may your heart guide you so thank you
