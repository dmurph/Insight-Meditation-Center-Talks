1
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,280
so good day

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,080
and it's a happy occasion to be here with you all and

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,439
have the opportunity to meditate together and for me to teach it's a privilege and

4
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:45,280
i appreciate the opportunity thank you and um we have this

5
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:52,320
wondrous wonderful mind chitta ci tta

6
00:00:52,320 --> 00:01:00,559
that begins to stand out and highlight the calmer the the mind becomes

7
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:10,159
so when the mind is agitated it means it's caught up in its concerns its preoccupations its

8
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:17,439
agitation it's um and uh often then it's the more agitated

9
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:24,840
the mind is the more it's swirling around in its thoughts ideas

10
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,479
feelings and it's the subset it's a particular aspects of the mind that the

11
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,600
mind is focusing on thinking for example or emotions

12
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:43,680
ideas memories and what we're doing as we switch to being mindful of the mind is to

13
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,159
no longer have the preferential attention to

14
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,600
particular corners of the mind particular activities of the mind

15
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,960
and so as the activities of the mind get quieter and calmer

16
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,640
what's available then in highlight and over time as meditation deepens it

17
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,640
becomes stronger and stronger is there's becomes a felt sense

18
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:20,160
of the mind as a whole and exactly what that is is not so you know so important

19
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,959
what's important is your own way of experiencing it some people might prefer to use the word

20
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:35,360
awareness to represent the mind as a whole the the total gestalt of how things are

21
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:42,879
operating the the the sum

22
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:49,200
the total is greater than the sum of the parts so there's something that

23
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,400
marvelous that happens as we open up more widely and fully to the mind

24
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,680
and in this early tradition there's sometimes sometimes his mind stands out so much in

25
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,680
highlight that it's anthropomorphized and thermopromorphism sometimes seen as

26
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,040
a person as if a person can talk to their mind or work with the mind

27
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:20,000
train the mind it's never seen as the self and this movement of selfing of

28
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,120
positing feelings sensing itself and this early tradition is seen as just another form of mental activity

29
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:34,319
that can also be calmed down put to rest and as it does so that also frees up the

30
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,599
space for feeling the mind as a whole

31
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:46,879
or sometimes it's called the state of the mind or the mood inner mood the general mood of in our

32
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,879
mentality or the heart mind and it begins to shift

33
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:59,439
the orientation of how we live our life and rather than focusing on the

34
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:07,360
particular concerns we have it gives us the opportunity to care for and i love this word care

35
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:14,159
compassionately care for lovingly care for the quality of the mind or the quality

36
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:21,280
of the heart the quality of this inner life that we have that's what's the gestalt the totality of it

37
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,040
that here in the tradition is called chitta mind and we can

38
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,160
begin settling the mind opening the mind

39
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,600
pleasing the mind bringing joy happiness to the mind

40
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:44,560
and liberating the mind and it's such a phenomenally satisfying thing to switch

41
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,400
from the details and concerns of our life to the present moment experience of mind

42
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:57,040
and caring for that so with that as an introduction

43
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,720
i will take a assume a meditation posture

44
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,479
and gently close your eyes

45
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,479
and with the eyes closed and feeling your

46
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:24,320
body from the inside out taking a few long slow deep breaths

47
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:31,199
deep deep breaths really as if you haven't breathed for a while and finally you get to really fill yourself

48
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,360
with oxygen and then exhale a delightful long

49
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,599
exhale ah here you are

50
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:53,840
here you are breathing in and breathing out

51
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:06,000
and then letting your breathing return to normal for a few minutes few moments and just

52
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,160
sit here and feel your body maybe those deep breaths have had a

53
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,638
influence effect on your body

54
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:24,000
maybe its body is a little more there's more sensations to feel

55
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:35,840
maybe you want to adjust your posture a little bit more

56
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:46,879
and then we'll do a little breathing exercise

57
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:55,280
that maybe will help the deeper relaxation maybe at relaxation deep inside

58
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:02,400
the heart the mind the cheetah

59
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,720
so it involves taking a deeper breath but only about three

60
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,479
quarters full but only as far as as comfortable

61
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:22,160
and then when you get to the top of that that particular in-breath hold the in-breath a little bit don't

62
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:29,039
exhale right away and hold it for as long as it's comfortable

63
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:37,840
and then as you release it as you begin the exhale see if that occasion can be one of a

64
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,280
deep relaxation letting go it's almost like the holding

65
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:50,000
of the breath heightens the awareness of your body your insides

66
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,039
that there's more available to relax as you exhale

67
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:03,360
so taking a three-quarters comfortable deep in-breath holding it as long as

68
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:13,840
it's comfortable and then exhaling with a deep relaxation

69
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:27,840
and it might be that the exhales can be longer than usual

70
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:44,800
maybe as you exhale you also relax the mind itself

71
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:55,839
softening opening expanding the mind

72
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,480
and even if you can't relax the mind

73
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,200
as you exhale feel whatever softness that's in the mind

74
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,600
feel whatever transparent boundaries

75
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,639
there is to the mind

76
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:41,680
and if it's comfortable continue a little bit longer and now at the end of the exhale

77
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:51,839
pause a bit just as long as it's comfortable before you inhale

78
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:59,760
so there's a rhythm of inhaling pausing exhaling

79
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,040
pausing that brings a heightened awareness to

80
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:12,800
your body and mind and a greater ability to relax

81
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:19,839
settle in

82
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:39,120
and then let your breathing now return to normal no special effort to pause or hold

83
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:47,839
and take a few moments to feel and sense your body again

84
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,959
and if there you are some memory areas of your body you can easily relax

85
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,720
so softening around the face

86
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:28,800
releasing the shoulders softening the

87
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,279
belly

88
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:49,519
and if the relaxing you've done settling in you've done brings any sensations of pleasure

89
00:11:53,839 --> 00:12:00,560
or well-being breathe with a pleasure breathe with a

90
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:06,720
sense of well-being the tingling the warmth

91
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,720
the glow the

92
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:25,839
dancing energy

93
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:39,600
and allow the thinking mind to become quieter

94
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:48,480
letting go of thoughts so you can have more energy more attention to feel

95
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:56,000
the body breathing with the well-being

96
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:07,839
that might be here however small it might be

97
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:30,880
and you might become aware of how the mind attention is predisposed

98
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,279
to focus on particular things concerns preoccupations

99
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:46,480
and if so then you're experiencing a limited aspect of your whole

100
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,839
wondrous mind

101
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:02,639
without necessarily letting go of your concerns can you expand your awareness to include

102
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:10,639
more of your interior life more of your quality of inner life your mind your

103
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:17,839
heart this state of your mind state of your inner being

104
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:29,839
something that inclusive because everything that happens happens

105
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:45,600
within the mind

106
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:58,639
and then breathe with the mind breathe through it

107
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:05,199
almost as if each inhale fills the mind with the sensations of

108
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:11,839
inhale each exhale relaxes

109
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:27,839
and expands the mind settles it

110
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:51,120
becoming aware of the global mind the global sense of in the

111
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:58,720
state of mind mood of the mind

112
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:12,799
the quality of the mind over all

113
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:17,440
it could include the space of the mind

114
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,919
the space that the mind fills

115
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,399
so you're not focusing on any particular part of the mind

116
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,369
[Music]

117
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,960
a state which has no

118
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,840
boundaries

119
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,520
and if it has a location this mind of yours

120
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:11,919
chances are that there's a little feeling of contraction or gathering together

121
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,200
that gives that feeling

122
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:23,360
as you exhale relax that gathering together

123
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:30,960
soften let the mind rest

124
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,840
out into the vast space all around

125
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:45,760
mind with no walls no boundaries

126
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,840
mind that involves no conscious effort

127
00:23:52,240 --> 00:24:05,840
that is just there here

128
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,840
um

129
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:07,519
if there is suffering suffering has a

130
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:14,158
location the mind

131
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:23,360
includes all that is beyond the edges of that suffering

132
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,120
that's wider bigger

133
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,360
and to relax outward beyond the

134
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,840
suffering that whatever suffering there is

135
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,278
is held in this wide field

136
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:55,440
of open mind open awareness that has no

137
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,000
edges

138
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:11,919
breathing in outward breathing

139
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:18,000
that goes outwards towards the edges beyond the edges

140
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,039
all inclusive

141
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,120
wide broad open

142
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:49,840
resting into the open space

143
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,200
and as we come to the end of the sitting

144
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:16,880
with whatever way that you can rest in open space

145
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:25,200
without the mind getting quickly fixated or preoccupied on any particular thing

146
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,399
just open and receptive allowing things just to flow

147
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:38,080
through you nothing stops nothing is held onto

148
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:47,600
and staying that way the best you can bring to mind

149
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:53,520
some person that you might encounter today

150
00:28:55,279 --> 00:29:02,480
personally or through some medium of communication phone or computer

151
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:15,200
and imagine that you are quietly allowing that person to exist

152
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:20,559
as they are without you fixating on it and anything

153
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:28,480
as if they too can be held in the vast open mind

154
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:39,120
in that way providing them to get providing them with a gift

155
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:45,360
that they can be just the way they are without any interference from you with

156
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:50,159
your desires aversions agendas

157
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:59,039
reactions allowing someone to be themselves

158
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:09,840
in the vast open space of your mind

159
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:18,480
and in doing so imagining that you're doing so does that give you a different

160
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:25,600
reference point for good will for love

161
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:37,840
friendliness care even respect for this other person

162
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:50,240
and if it does no maybe wish them well

163
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,158
may this person be happy

164
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,320
may this person be safe

165
