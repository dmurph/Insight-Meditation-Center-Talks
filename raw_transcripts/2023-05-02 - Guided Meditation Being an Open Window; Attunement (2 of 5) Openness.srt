1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:08,400
so hello everyone hello from

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,099
Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City

3
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,099
and

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:28,460
it feels kind of homey to be here sitting here

5
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,380
so meditation

6
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:46,140
there's a lot of different languages and metaphors or ideas that support people in meditation

7
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:52,200
it's nice to have a range of different options because at different times different

8
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:58,218
times in a person's life different ways of practicing are relevant

9
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,760
there's a strong tendency here in the West for many meditation teachers to use

10
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,840
languages the language that has to do with being receptive receptivity to experience

11
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:20,400
and that's maybe because uh being assertive or being actively

12
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,580
going out to to have an experience to look at experience to address something what's

13
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:32,040
happening sometimes can feel like too much strain and too much work and too much

14
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,799
expectations and agendas involved and the idea of being receptive is to

15
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:44,400
drop agendas and and not to kind of assert the self but allow just things to

16
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:52,439
unfold and arise and we can kind of settle back in meditation just let things come and approach us

17
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:58,159
and um and then there's another uh kind of

18
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:04,020
approach that's neither kind of going towards or addressing or focusing on

19
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,660
something versus stepping back and letting something come to us

20
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:17,879
and that is the notion of being open and open is neither assertive nor

21
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:24,360
receptive neither going out to address to focus on an experience but

22
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:31,500
also it's not receiving it to be open is like being an Open Door

23
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:37,739
where people and beings and can just freely

24
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:43,319
walk back and forth and the door is untroubled by what happens

25
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:50,220
or like a house with all the windows open and the neighborhood kid who's throwing baseball somehow or others able

26
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:56,400
to throw a about right through the house from through from one open window in one

27
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,360
open window and out the other the back open window and nothing gets hit

28
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,700
nothing gets struck and so there's neither a stance of

29
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:15,360
receptivity nor a stance of going out to address something it's just allowing

30
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,519
things to be but being fully open so whatever happens

31
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:26,700
doesn't it doesn't strike anything it doesn't hit a window doesn't it's not

32
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:33,120
picked up is not just allowed to be without any reference

33
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:40,680
to Me Myself and mine without any reference to stories and what it means and what it means for me

34
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:47,519
and what I have to do and they shouldn't be there or this should be there or

35
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,560
um and there's all these layers and layers of ideas and thoughts and

36
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,959
uh uh Notions of what's right and wrong

37
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:05,099
that the experience can meet as it appears and that's like the window that's closed

38
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:13,920
and the ball hits it or but to just be open and open is like an open window and

39
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:20,820
whatever arises in a sense just passes right through us it doesn't remain it doesn't stay

40
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,860
it's not so we don't have to go out to address anything

41
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:32,040
and we don't have to be set settled back to receive it to let it come here

42
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:37,919
we just kind of are upright we are present

43
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:44,759
we're rooted here there's a kind of a maybe even a dignity and just here

44
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:52,139
present Unapologetic in a certain kind of way undefended for

45
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:59,699
this moments of meditation because of the openness that's so wide

46
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:05,220
that things just pass right through or things don't nothing sticks

47
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:12,020
nothing gets shattered because of that openness

48
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:20,400
so to assume a meditation posture and a posture that expresses some

49
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,080
modicum of dignity uprightness

50
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:32,840
an honorable posture for meditation

51
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,560
an alert posture within which we can relax

52
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:52,400
without losing that uprightness and gently closing the eyes

53
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,418
and taking a few moments to appreciate

54
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:08,240
sitting here on this spot this place at this time

55
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:15,300
they're kind of definitive acknowledgment yes

56
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:21,320
this is the place where I'm meditating

57
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:26,699
feeling the weight of the body against your chair or your cushion or

58
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:30,440
wherever the weight is resting

59
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:41,639
and then with a kind of definitive acknowledgment here you are here I am

60
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:47,039
in this body at this time

61
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,160
to take a few long slow deep breaths

62
00:06:55,979 --> 00:07:03,860
feeling the chest expand the rib cage is move stretch

63
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:12,060
as you inhale the rib cage collapse return

64
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,380
as you exhale

65
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,699
and then letting the breathing return to normal

66
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:38,720
and as you exhale to relax the muscles of your face

67
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:51,000
softening around the eyes there's nothing you have to use your

68
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,060
eyes for when you're meditating the eyes can be take a vacation

69
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,620
eyes resting in the eyeballs

70
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:12,120
some people find it helpful for a few moments to imagine

71
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,699
the eyes are looking backwards and down

72
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:23,000
as a way of helping the eyes relax

73
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:33,860
and the exhale relaxing the shoulders

74
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:44,279
both feeling the softening of the shoulders and or

75
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:48,740
the gentle weight of the shoulders

76
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:57,120
who wait that supports this definitive experience of

77
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,500
being here and now

78
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:12,200
and as you exhale to soften the belly

79
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,380
and then centering yourself on the experience of breathing

80
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,700
being open available

81
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:09,800
to breathing coming and going breathing in and breathing out

82
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,720
like there's a window open

83
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:35,480
and the inhales and exhales flow in and out through that open window

84
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:39,380
feeling the weight of the Torso the solidity of the Torso

85
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,140
that's there together with the movements

86
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,480
of breathing in your body

87
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:14,820
you might as you exhale relax the tension in the thinking mind

88
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:22,380
the agitation or the energy in thinking soften

89
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,640
the thinking mind

90
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:41,519
letting thoughts drift by through an open window

91
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,700
of awareness without being picked up or without

92
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:58,579
them running into anything no judgments no for against

93
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:04,639
no concerns about what you're thinking

94
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,940
allowing the thoughts to strift by

95
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,820
maybe like you're sitting on the edge of a river and you

96
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:25,320
you see how the river flows by

97
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:33,079
whatever floats in the river is floating by no resistance

98
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:41,360
in a sense the river is open to let things pass through

99
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:50,339
allow yourself to be open for breathing

100
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:55,399
sounds thoughts

101
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,920
to let them Flow by

102
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:08,959
an unconcerned with what

103
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:18,139
appears in awareness as if it just is passing by

104
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:21,080
opening the doors of perception

105
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:26,600
opening the mind of the heart

106
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:37,340
no resistance to anything not picking anything up

107
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:47,900
without being for or against whatever appears allowed to

108
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:53,299
flow be the river

109
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,679
be the wind that blows through an open window

110
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:44,000
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

111
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:55,100
to imagine yourself as wide wide open

112
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:03,200
available to experience the whole world

113
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:17,360
[Music] 's door just a door

114
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:26,659
all things occur nothing is met with resistance

115
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:37,278
or with picking it up needing to do anything or be anyone

116
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:43,039
each experience a loud to be itself

117
00:26:53,820 --> 00:27:01,140
and so considering the people in your lives

118
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:06,860
and how letting them be who they are is a form of respect

119
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,760
maybe even a form of love

120
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:23,640
and your ability to be open to them can be an ability to allow them to be as

121
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:29,460
they are not need not needing to fix anyone

122
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:37,320
not needing to get anything from anyone even if it's just for a few moments

123
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,980
a few minutes

124
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:48,799
of allowing each person to be themselves

125
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:57,559
because we're simply open not receptive

126
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:04,640
not addressing the other just allowing all things to be

127
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,059
including yourself

128
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,760
and may it be that such openness

129
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:26,580
can equally be as much as it's open to let things appear

130
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:34,500
it's also an openness to allow the warmth the kindness the friendliness

131
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:42,679
the love in you to flow outward into the world

132
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:51,380
if we are an Open Door things flow in both directions

133
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:57,440
May the best that we have available inside of us

134
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:05,640
be what we offer to the world may we contribute to the happiness and

135
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:12,000
Welfare of the whole world may all beings

136
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:19,460
be happy may all beings be safe

137
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:26,340
may all beings be peaceful

138
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:30,679
and may all beings be free

139
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:44,509
[Music]

140
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:56,179
[Music] thank you

141
00:31:17,899 --> 00:31:25,520
so this is the second talk on the on the topic of Attunement

142
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:31,559
and in other words for this could be Harmony

143
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:38,399
or balance and um and uh it's the topic is a relationship

144
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:45,659
to compassion and our connection to suffering and others and in ourselves

145
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:53,159
and to simply just experience suffering in the world or in ourselves in the usual habit habitual way of doing it

146
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:58,559
might not be in harmony might not be attuned well

147
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:04,020
and it is probably a little bit of a challenge to think about

148
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:10,320
being attuned to suffering but it's uh having just the right level

149
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:18,600
of connection just the right way of being present for it that we're not letting it impact us

150
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:25,679
negatively it doesn't strike the windows in our hearts so that they've shatter

151
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:32,820
and it doesn't we don't kind of close down or resist what's happening

152
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:39,179
and so um and finding ourselves attuned and I like the idea of thinking of it kind of

153
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:44,240
like tuning a guitar string so that the different strings are

154
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:50,460
attuned to each other somehow they exist in the right relationship to each other

155
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:56,279
so that uh when we're encountering suffering we can ask ourselves

156
00:32:56,279 --> 00:33:02,399
how do we tune ourselves how do we establish a useful way of being aware

157
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:07,700
and present and an attitude towards this that's here

158
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:14,159
and I think it's a nice principle to think that every encounter with suffering is different

159
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:20,279
and requires a different Attunement what is this and as soon as we start looking and

160
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:27,299
thinking about Attunement then we're doing something very significant which is we're not just simply a victim of

161
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:34,980
suffering a passive recipient of it but we're actually have some agency part of us is

162
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:43,200
not caught in the suffering but is engaged in looking what's the right balance here how to be present

163
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:51,000
and so um today's concept of Attunement is being

164
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,279
open being open to suffering and in being open then also be open to

165
00:33:56,279 --> 00:34:03,679
compassion as a response but uh to to it involves being mindful

166
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:10,560
uh and modern monitoring ourselves of what the impact is on us when we're in

167
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,599
the presence of suffering do we close down do we resist

168
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,820
do we attack do we get swept up in our thoughts and

169
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:25,919
sometimes people get distracted and they go into fantasy they start predicting

170
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:31,500
the future and and to really understand this is my

171
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:37,858
common habits of when I'm uncomfortable when things are difficult for me and then

172
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:43,560
ask ourselves how can it be I I be attuned and that's different than saying how can

173
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:50,040
it be present for it because sometimes we just present in a way where

174
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:55,980
The Experience strikes us it hits our wounds it it's our our

175
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:02,760
resistance it hits our judgmentalism our self-criticism all kinds of things can just being present can be kind of a

176
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:09,300
little bit and not taking into account what the experience the impact the experience has

177
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:14,940
on us foreign so we're monitoring ourselves

178
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:22,560
and saying how you know given who I am what's happening me with the situation how can I be open to this

179
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,720
open does not mean we you approve open does not mean you don't care

180
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:33,300
but open means that um you're not at first

181
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:38,940
um uh responding to habitual patterns of

182
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:44,339
resistance openness kind of means non-resistance

183
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:50,000
how can I not resist this suffering some of that has comes from the ability

184
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:56,579
to be uncomfortable there is a discomfort the stronger the the suffering is the more uncomfortable

185
00:35:56,579 --> 00:36:01,680
it is and not a few people think they're responding compassionately to something

186
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:10,140
but it's really they're trying to uh make their own discomfort go away and

187
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:19,380
that's not really compassion so to be open to have no resistance to have no need

188
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:26,339
for oneself to change what's going on just to be open

189
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:33,480
it does not mean that we end up being passive it means that this is a preparation

190
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:40,920
for knowing what to do and the doing responding to compassion we wait a while

191
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:46,200
and that that while might just be a few seconds it might be minutes it might be

192
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:52,440
longer depending on the context situation we're in if we're reading about suffering in the

193
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:59,220
news and we're actually not present with someone who is suffering

194
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:05,339
and we feel kind of alarmed and kind of feel something strong

195
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:12,060
um the less we're connected to people and more its ideas and stories

196
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:18,540
the less the more likely we're not open in a clear free way there might be more

197
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:26,820
stories and opinions and judgments that come into play and but what does it mean to be open

198
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:32,700
to be open and allow the experience to touch us and move through us every open

199
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:40,500
to everything how we are as a way of seeing clearly as a way of coming

200
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:47,640
into some ability to be present without the reactivity that is so common

201
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:54,900
when we're in the presence of suffering so non-resistance openness

202
00:37:54,900 --> 00:38:01,140
being open to the experience and that's something that uh

203
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:10,920
maybe it's not easy to understand how to do when the suffering is great but you might look for small areas of

204
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:18,119
things that are difficult or small sufferings that you're in or some other people are in things that don't require immediate

205
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:24,000
action and take the time maybe go sit down and meditate or take some time by yourself

206
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,040
or just take the time to seek okay given

207
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,440
this let's not do anything right now let's not come to any conclusions right

208
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:39,960
now let me just be open to this experience let me be present for it but

209
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:49,200
open like an open window an Open Door so that uh it it kind of let it as as if

210
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:54,240
it just flowing right through you as if you know there's no stopping it no

211
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:02,040
resistance no picking it up nothing to figure out nothing to have to think about in relationship to it just be an

212
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:09,000
open door to it people might not have to know that you're doing this because maybe other people will be

213
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:16,260
confused by this attitude that you have but I'd like to propose this is a

214
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:21,780
phenomenally respectful of others in the suffering in the world

215
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:27,480
to first and foremost be able to meet it with non-resistance

216
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:33,720
meet it without a non-picking upness without getting involved just kind of

217
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:38,839
let it be and make room for it lots of room

218
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:44,540
and as we learn to do this we learn to expand our capacity for discomfort

219
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:52,200
expand our capacity to make room for what's there not so that we can just suffer more

220
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:57,660
but so that we suffer less and are available to see and understand what's

221
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:03,780
happening in deeper ways I have been in situations that there's

222
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:09,900
some difficulty challenge going on suffering around me and I've rushed to judgment and

223
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:15,300
sometimes I've rushed to action only later to discover that what I did was

224
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:21,420
not what was needed if I'd taken time to be open receptive

225
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:28,380
present for it not not resisting it not rushing to

226
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:34,140
action to I would have seen what was needed and I would have known

227
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:39,839
what to do much better so

228
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:45,240
as a continuation of yesterday which was when we're in in challenging times in

229
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:50,280
the presence of suffering and compassion is maybe the healthy

230
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:56,099
response to the situation First Take times to think about it

231
00:40:56,099 --> 00:41:01,320
think well and part of the thinking is to think how's the proper way to be

232
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:10,160
attuned to this and might just being open here open and and

233
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:15,300
non-resisting might that have a role right now

234
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:21,960
and probably has a role more often than not doesn't mean that every single time you

235
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:27,480
need to be have non-resistance and be opened but it's part of the skill it's part of

236
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:33,060
the repertoire of things that we're trying to do as we become attuned

237
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:41,040
coming into a certain kind of harmony with the suffering of the world so that we're in a good position to

238
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:47,220
respond compassionately this is a stepping stone to compassionate action not a rush to

239
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:53,880
compassionate action so um I'd encourage you today

240
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:59,480
to maybe it's a very private practice no one needs to know you're doing it

241
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:05,700
but look for occasions where you can be present for something

242
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:11,940
that's suffering something that's challenging for people some way in which people are having difficulty

243
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:17,640
and see if you can kind of take a few moments a few minutes to just kind of

244
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:24,060
not resist it it's almost like you open your heart wide open spread your arms

245
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:31,320
wide open and say here this can just come right through me

246
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:36,480
isn't it very different than saying here this can land here and I can hold it

247
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:42,480
for this exercise oh here and it goes this can just go right through

248
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:49,200
and uh and in that going through uh maybe you'll come to a wiser better

249
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:54,680
position to understand what yourself and what's happening

250
00:42:54,839 --> 00:43:00,599
so thank you and as we go through these the acronym touch

251
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:07,040
for how to live in a tuned life so thank you
