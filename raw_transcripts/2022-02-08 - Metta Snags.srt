1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:07,920
so really warm welcome really warm welcome again to everybody

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,759
what a pleasure it is to be here practicing with you all

3
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,920
i'm with our friends on online

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,320
so tonight i wanted to say a few words about

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:35,120
i think all of us probably many of us have this experience that the more we practice mindfulness the

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,719
more we practice meditation and

7
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,840
maybe there's something that we learned the hard way that maybe i learned the hard way

8
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:53,360
is that an orientation an attitude a stance

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,800
of kindness is so helpful

10
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,080
i might even say mandatory because right as our meditation practice

11
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,600
we start to see all the little movements of the mind

12
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,680
which we're not so kind to ourselves in which we might not be kind in our

13
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,680
minds to others and then we can just kind of get snagged and

14
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,560
stuck and especially with the unkindnesses towards ourself we can

15
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,920
i can really you know grow and end up really being

16
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,600
so that meditation practice is so uncomfortable and

17
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,320
maybe even unhelpful

18
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,159
so mindfulness i know like uh jack cornfield now he talks about mindfulness he talks about

19
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,600
his loving awareness as this way to emphasize kind of this

20
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:05,280
the warm-hearted quality that's associated with mindfulness practice

21
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,879
and maybe we hear this in drama talks that we should have this

22
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:20,239
maybe non-judgmental we use this kind of language or uh available allowing accepting or

23
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:27,599
something like this to help uh point to this attitude that's so helpful with the

24
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,879
mindfulness practice so today i'd like to talk a little bit

25
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:39,760
about another doorway in another doorway that can really support our meditation

26
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:48,400
practice support our mindfulness practice and that is loving kindness practice

27
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,080
meta practice some people

28
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:01,040
have a lot of resistance have a lot of reluctance pushback

29
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,440
i do not like this practice loving kindness practice it's not uncommon

30
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,760
i certainly did i thought like okay i don't know what that living kindness practice is but it

31
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,959
sounds sappy sentimental

32
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,159
ooey gooey sticky i don't know i just didn't even before i

33
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:30,080
even really had done the practice just the whole idea of it for me felt like okay not not so

34
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,080
interesting

35
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,319
so maybe i'll just say a few words about loving kindness practice here is this

36
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:47,680
it's the uh cultivation of the intention to have some warm-heartedness and i like

37
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,719
this language warm-heartedness because it's kind of vague

38
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,799
and i like it because it's the opposite of cold i mean kind of have an idea what it means to be cold you know to give

39
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:07,040
somebody the cold shoulder or to um be you know off putting that somehow to

40
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:14,799
be cold just to not be welcoming so i like this idea of warm-heartedness

41
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:22,160
warmth or warm-heartedness kind of bringing in the heart quality but maybe we could even just say warmth

42
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:30,400
so loving-kindness practice is not so much that we have to or it's insisted upon that we

43
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,800
generate manufacture engineer create some warm-heartedness

44
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:44,160
but it's more about intentionally creating the conditions in which that might arise

45
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,320
no guarantees that it's going to arise but we create the conditions

46
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,919
with the understanding that giving the heart and the mind i'm making

47
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:01,199
this distinction which might even be artificial but the

48
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:07,199
understanding that the being this psychophysical being

49
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,560
if we can allow it to rest

50
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:20,160
abide in dwell in experience some warm-heartedness

51
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,759
that it just becomes easier and easier to access that warm-heartedness when we

52
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,759
need it it becomes easier and easier for this warm-heartedness to

53
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,840
be a support in all areas of our life not just

54
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:43,199
loving-kindness in fact it's most common that the effects of metapractice

55
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,479
first really show up in one's daily life before they might even show up in your

56
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:55,440
meditation practice you might be doing some meta practice and it might

57
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,639
feel dry and stale and a little bit

58
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:08,240
forced maybe and feel like i don't i don't know why i'm doing this but then you just notice

59
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,360
that you start to be a little bit nicer to the other drivers on the road

60
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,919
you start to be a little bit nicer to the neighbor that doesn't put their garbage cans away and

61
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,759
time or you know whatever it might be

62
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:32,880
probably everybody knows this but i'll just mention that loving kindness practice is kind of done

63
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,960
systematically classically it's done there's lots of different ways you can do it but

64
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:45,440
one way is systematically starting where it's easy and then expanding out to where it's

65
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,759
more and more difficult and it's often not always done with

66
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,360
repeating phrases so don't worry this whole talk is not

67
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,840
going to be about living kindness practice i just wanted to introduce it and

68
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:11,120
and i wanted to talk a little bit about some of why we might have hesitation around it

69
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:19,360
and one particular place which i think it can be really a great support for us in our regular practice

70
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:29,440
i know that um there's some years ago there was this expression no pain no gain

71
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:35,759
and uh right we hear this for like uh physical activities

72
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,960
and i hadn't heard it for a while but then i just heard it today like no pain no gain

73
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,960
and there's so many ways i think that we often bring this idea to all areas of

74
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,160
our lives including our meditation practice

75
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,960
and so there's a way in which we might bring this to thinking that meta practice loving kindness maybe it's not

76
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,080
so useful because it doesn't seem like it's painful enough or

77
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:10,400
it doesn't seem like you know to have this warm-heartedness like what benefit can

78
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,919
that be when we when you hear me say this or it sounds a little bit ridiculous

79
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:24,240
but there might be a way in which in the back of our minds we have this little bit of a an idea about this

80
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:31,599
so that might be one reason why people have this hesitation or reluctance around loving-kindness

81
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:37,200
practice is it might feel too sappy or sentimental or it doesn't feel like it's

82
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:43,200
strenuous enough or difficult enough or something like this but there's another

83
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,560
reason too and that is because sometimes

84
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:56,160
loving-kindness practice when we start it it might bring up a lot of

85
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,720
difficulties from our hearts might bring up a lot of

86
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,640
pain in a way that mindfulness practice doesn't to be sure mindfulness practice

87
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,640
can also but loving-kindness practice might get at some of the

88
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,839
other aspects of our experience and bring up some of these difficulties

89
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:32,000
and to be sure that sometimes what it brings up is the exact opposite of loving kindness

90
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,480
whenever another dharma teacher tells the story of

91
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,959
that uh so now i can't remember if it was this dharma teacher or if they were talking about a practitioner

92
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:51,440
that shared with them but nevertheless the um the person was doing walking

93
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:57,760
meditation and doing with meta practice to kind of repeating the phrases

94
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:05,519
and they found themselves saying these phrases i hate meta

95
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:11,680
i hate meta you don't just kind of this you do just these things kind of

96
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:18,160
floating up right and uh the opposite and then when you realize oh my goodness what's happening i've had similar things

97
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,399
to you happening may you be happy and then beep like i would say like you know some

98
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:31,680
so it's can be surprising and then of course none of us want to think that we have hatred inside of us

99
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:39,200
or ill will or something like this so really doesn't conform with the ways that we want to think about ourselves

100
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,000
so it's can be really uncomfortable

101
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:50,640
and jack cornfield has this expression that i really love i appreciate when he

102
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:56,880
talks about some of the difficulties that might come up with any kind of practice but i'd like to say maybe

103
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:05,279
specifically with meta practice and that is the unfinished business of the heart

104
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,959
so whatever it is some of those pains and difficulties that

105
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,399
are recurring that maybe um are deep in

106
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,000
some ways they show up in so many different uh they manifest they show up in so many

107
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,680
different ways often this could be a sadness or grief

108
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:34,399
or anger or some hatred even

109
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,920
and of course some of this unfinished business of the heart might even show up as some bodily pains

110
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:45,920
maybe we don't recognize it at first but or maybe just part of the difficulties

111
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,959
or bodily pains too you know sitting in meditation it's not

112
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:57,160
the most comfortable certainly at the beginning when one's practice

113
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:06,320
so that's the second reason why sometimes loving kindness practice is we can have a hesitation towards it is

114
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,680
because we might have tried it and unknowingly just the difficulties came

115
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:17,920
up the third reason and there's actually some clinical data

116
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:24,399
on this where they had some group of individuals doing some mindfulness practice and some

117
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:30,240
individuals doing loving kindness practice and asked them you know a whole bunch of questions before during and

118
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,240
after you know these uh being trained to do these different meditation styles and what they learned

119
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,000
was that at the beginning if you were to compare mindfulness

120
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,600
practice and loving-kindness everybody prefers mindfulness because loving kindness feels way too

121
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:54,480
complicated and you have to remember these phrases and who are you going to do it with and you know there's all this

122
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,320
maybe it just seems too busy or it just felt like too much effort

123
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:07,920
but then through i think it was like eight weeks after eight weeks that had uh switched where after having

124
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:14,639
done it for some time everybody preferred loving-kindness practice over mindfulness practice

125
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,240
partly because it felt like you know it was a way to be kind to themselves and

126
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,440
they could feel some shifting happening and the way that they were viewing

127
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:31,600
themselves and others no guarantees right that this is going to happen but i just kind of want to

128
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:39,200
validate if there's something like this initial resistance it just feels too complicated i don't want to do it

129
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,760
so one thing i want to talk about is

130
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:52,000
how is it a maybe how can we work with some of these difficulties that arise with a

131
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,600
loving kindness practice but not only that

132
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,720
how might while we're doing mental practice doing

133
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,320
practicing loving-kindness how might it be especially suited to

134
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:17,320
work with certain types of difficulties that show up in our lives that show up in our mindfulness practice

135
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:26,000
so can we if we're doing mindfulness practice sorry meta practice

136
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,279
the encouragement of course is if we can can we just

137
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:36,320
expand the living kindness to include the difficulty

138
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:44,320
just in the same way that we would with mindfulness right we would just kind of bring whatever that difficulty might be

139
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:51,440
so for example if we're saying phrases may you be happy may you be healthy

140
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:59,120
can we also include the sadness that sometimes arises

141
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:06,959
sometimes when we're wishing people may you be happy what comes to mind is all the times we have not been happy

142
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:12,800
all the times they have not been happy maybe may you be happy and then we start to

143
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:19,279
think and maybe it's just for a flash we start to think like no wonder you're not happy it's so many terrible things are

144
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:25,440
happening and off we go right in this kind of a mindstream

145
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,800
so if we discover that oh yeah there's some sadness

146
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:36,959
can we in some way be acknowledging the sadness but still

147
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:43,839
saying may you be happy may you be healthy safe may you live with ease

148
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:51,440
sometimes with loving-kindness practice there may be a real sense of boredom

149
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:59,199
we're saying these phrases it's the opposite of sadness right which is juicy and feel like we have to work with it

150
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:06,880
and but what if there isn't anything particular happening and instead we're just reciting phrases

151
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,519
having this intention of cultivating loving-kindness

152
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:19,120
can we just be bored be saying these phrases

153
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:26,240
that feels dry sometimes not forcing ourselves not

154
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,759
tightening down and drilling in but can we still may

155
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:37,120
may i be happy maybe we feels like a little bit of suffering then and we can bring a little bit of compassion

156
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:45,279
practice in for ourselves but sometimes there can be some anxiety that

157
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:51,360
arises just thinking about happiness and health

158
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,639
so can we just make space for that while we are

159
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,759
continuing to do phrases is one way we might work with difficulties that are

160
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:08,319
happening this way we let the practice be

161
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:14,480
inclusive instead of kind of like insisting that things

162
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,959
be match our preferences and we're more relaxing or softening in all the ways in

163
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:27,120
which we divide our experiences between this is okay and that isn't okay

164
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:34,080
it's like may you be happy and to notice yeah there's there's sadness also

165
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,320
i'll talk a little bit more about what to do if there's some real sadness but there might if there's some twinge or

166
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:47,200
some um recognition of some grief there

167
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,399
can we allow our loving-kindness practice to be inclusive

168
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,400
so then maybe we can think about our loving-kindness practice be

169
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:05,360
less about befriending ourselves befriending others

170
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,880
and maybe more it's about just befriending each moment

171
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:17,679
and is there a way that we can meet each moment with kindness

172
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:23,280
instead of trying to shove it away or having an aversion or

173
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:29,080
grabbing onto it so tightly whatever it might be

174
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:39,679
so i want to read some words by rosemary trauma

175
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:45,039
she's this i think a very beautiful poet

176
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:51,919
and part of the reason why there's a number of reasons why i like this poem it's very short

177
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:58,160
is that she talks about blue herons and i just love blue herons they have

178
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:04,080
this majesty about them for those of you don't know they're you know they're they're big birds maybe

179
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:10,160
that's what makes them seem so majestic they can be like three or four feet tall and their wingspans are like you know

180
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:16,320
six feet and and i often go walking in a place where

181
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:23,039
i can see them i have an uncle who's

182
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:28,320
lives on the east coast and he's often he's a

183
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,600
professional photographer and he also likes to go for hikes and stuff and whenever he sees a blue hair and he

184
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:39,840
always like sends it because you know it's just there just have this majesty about them

185
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:45,360
so here's this poem by rosemary traumer

186
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:55,039
nudged by hope the heart rises from exhaustion

187
00:19:55,039 --> 00:20:03,679
it's like the great blue heron i saw this morning flying up from a wasteland

188
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:10,159
on broad gray wings with strong slow beats

189
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:15,360
for a moment charged with grace

190
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:21,600
before did you see this heart

191
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,960
it chose to land again bringing all its beauty

192
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:33,679
to the desolate place so we can imagine that it starts here

193
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:39,600
that uh this great blue heron leaves this wasteland like this like there's nothing

194
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:45,600
here it's a wasteland and going up with this kind of graceful way and then

195
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,840
deciding to come back down

196
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,720
i love this idea that some ways like loving kindness practice maybe is like

197
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:03,200
this right this beautiful bird she describes it as bringing all its beauty

198
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:10,000
to this desolate place there might be this wish initially to leave like okay i don't want to be with

199
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,840
this difficulty maybe taking a few beats and then landing again

200
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:26,240
so we keep coming back to the practice whether it's mindfulness or loving

201
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:32,559
kindness but just this idea of keeping coming back

202
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:38,400
increasing our capacity for a living kindness and

203
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,000
i started talking about loving kindness as warm-heartedness and i was appreciating

204
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,360
the vagueness of it but maybe that's even too

205
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:55,360
ambitious warm-heartedness maybe it's helpful and supportive to

206
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:02,640
think about it as not dwelling in aversion

207
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,960
not dwelling in aversion

208
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,240
so maybe it's warm-heartedness maybe we don't even have access to that but to

209
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:20,080
just uh orient the mind in the heart away from ill-will away from aversion a

210
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:26,080
will away from insisting demanding in our minds if not

211
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,080
actually that things be different

212
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:38,559
so bringing all its beauty to this desolate place in this poem

213
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:48,320
it's a way that it transforms the place so that it's no longer desolate so it's no longer bleak it's no longer abandoned

214
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,960
but instead we choose to stay

215
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,480
as best we can as best we can

216
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:08,640
maybe we're a great blue heron and then we turn into a crow that is

217
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,919
crying making sounds and the birds that's is very different and

218
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,880
then maybe we are a great blue heron again i don't know but

219
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:28,000
and to be sure sometimes it's really skillful to drop the loving kindness and to bring

220
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,679
mindfulness to the difficulties but can we meet it with acceptance and

221
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:40,240
kindness maybe this is uh where working with

222
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,360
difficulties while doing loving kindness practice

223
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:52,080
really helps us with this very thing to meet difficulties to meet

224
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:58,400
all the ways in which we might get stuck with some warm-heartedness or not

225
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,520
dwelling in aversion and just having that experience of doing

226
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:10,480
that can help us in our daily life certainly but also in our mindfulness practice

227
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:20,880
so probably all of you know there are these five perennial ways with practice in which our

228
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,480
clarity gets obscured in which there's these forces of distraction or agitation

229
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:34,080
that arise or whether it's in our mindfulness practice or in our meta practice

230
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,600
it's called the five hindrances of kind of like five types of

231
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:47,279
things that get in the way i'll just mention them here i'm not going to talk

232
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:54,000
about all of them but just so that we recognize that oh yeah sensual desire

233
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,880
ill will sloth intorper restlessness doubt

234
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,799
so many of our things that get in the way with like i'm using this

235
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:14,400
language get in the way but that was sometimes we it's not actually in the way it is the practice but we

236
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:22,000
feel like it's something like hindering or not not uh supporting us

237
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,960
and of course these five it's a natural part of every human experience they are

238
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,640
not personal failings when they arise during meditation but

239
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:40,720
how often do we think that when they do arise oh

240
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:49,039
i'm doing something wrong i'm not a very good meditator this meditation practice is not going well

241
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:55,679
probably that person sitting next to me is doing fine but look at me i'm having all this aversion or

242
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:02,000
i'm feeling so restless or whatever it might be

243
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,080
but instead of personal failings can we just see them as part of our practice

244
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:14,559
and there can be a way in which because these will arise during meta meditation as well as

245
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:21,919
mindfulness meditation if there's a way in which we can make it a point oh yeah what meta

246
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:28,720
and i see these hindrances i feel these hindrances arise this is such a great way

247
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:34,400
to practice with hindrances precisely because we might

248
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,679
if we're doing mental practice maybe we're less likely to naturally fall into

249
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:46,559
these ideas of oh i'm a terrible meditator

250
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:53,440
i can't meditate i'm hopeless it can be an opportunity for us to say

251
00:26:53,440 --> 00:27:00,640
i'm a terrible meditator and may i be happy

252
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:06,400
i am hopeless and may i be peaceful

253
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,760
this is terrible i can't do this and may i live with ease

254
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:17,039
so just to fold it in with the phrases that we're saying

255
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:23,760
because part of what meditation practices is to help us i think all of us know this about you know

256
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:30,399
we rewire the brain and it's amazing right how much this

257
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:35,520
inner critic shows up and how much this inner critic telling us that we can't do

258
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:41,039
it we shouldn't even try or everybody else can do it or

259
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:48,559
whatever the however it shows up or whatever words it uses for you

260
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:55,600
and it can be really powerful this inner critic it can really undermine our practice our lives

261
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:03,840
but to work with it while we're doing mata makes it very so much easier to notice

262
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:11,840
the inner critic and to counter the words counter these phrases with

263
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:18,880
when may i be happy so that there's a way it's like oh if this word come if this sentence comes

264
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:24,720
up oh you're a terrible meditator and then to say may i be happy kind of

265
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,880
like takes the the authority out from this idea may i i'm a terrible

266
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:37,360
meditator maybe it helps soften the

267
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,200
the blow so to speak that it might even become familiar that we haven't even noticed

268
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:49,120
but with loving-kindness practice we can start to

269
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:56,720
undo or rewire some of those neural circuits that might be such a habit that we don't

270
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:03,600
even notice a second way in which

271
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:09,760
it can be really helpful and fruitful for our lives and for our meditation practice in general to be working with

272
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:17,279
hindrances to be working with difficulties while we're doing meta practice while we're doing loving kindness practice

273
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:24,240
is because there might be some repeated patterns that we have probably all of us have repeated patterns

274
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:32,000
of difficulties that arise in our lives and of course arise in our meditation

275
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:42,080
and one way to work with these some of these repeated patterns is to just do a very gentle inquiry

276
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:49,600
what is asking for acceptance what is asking for

277
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:55,520
some warm-heartedness what is asking for us to not be dwelling

278
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:01,279
in aversion with regards to it and if we

279
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:06,960
have been practicing loving kindness and have this intention to have this warmth

280
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,559
or to have this openness or spaciousness

281
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:19,039
that might be just be creating the conditions in which it might become clear what is asking for

282
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:26,799
acceptance and to be clear i'm not talking about doing a very like type of archaeological

283
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:33,520
dig or you know discovering exactly what it is that thing that happened when you were 80 years old and

284
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:39,200
you know whatever it might be but there's something about asking the question

285
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:45,360
it's not so much about finding the answer it's about asking the question what is it that's asking for acceptance

286
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:51,919
what is it that's asking for kindness what's asking to be loved to be seen

287
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:57,039
within us so if we if we're in the doing

288
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:03,279
loving-kindness practice there might be a way in which the conditions are such that there might be

289
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:08,640
some new inside some new understanding that becomes available

290
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:16,640
because these repeated patterns they remain because there's some level of resistance right there's something

291
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:23,519
that's not being accepted there's something that we continually are trying to push away or

292
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:30,000
not acknowledge and so in the scheme of

293
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,279
not trying in the scheme of uh practicing kindness

294
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:41,120
that might be just the conditions in which there might be some new understanding

295
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:48,158
and so this also asks you know that this um

296
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:59,880
asking us maybe what's to be asking for acceptance is our fear our judgments our aversions

297
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:06,480
not always easy to see this in ourselves

298
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:13,640
sometimes it doesn't match the image we want to have of ourselves

299
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:20,080
but this process of gentle warm-hearted

300
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:25,279
investigation can be transformative

301
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:31,840
in such a way that maybe there isn't a big shebang and everything gets resolved and we live happily ever

302
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:37,840
after but there can just be a little bit of a shift by

303
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:44,559
having practice some loving kindness to be seeped in that and to ask what's what's

304
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:50,240
need for acceptance there can be a little bit different understanding

305
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:59,200
so maybe one last thing here that i'll talk about with working with difficulties in

306
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:05,200
the context of doing loving-kindness practice is

307
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:11,039
when there are difficulties whether it's emotional difficulties physical ones or

308
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:16,960
whatever ones they are whatever they might be there's a way in which

309
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:22,640
our attention can shrink and the only thing that we notice is

310
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:28,559
what is difficult at that moment if we have this

311
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:35,679
pain in our knee then it just becomes all about can i move my knee now should i wait to

312
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:42,880
move it or it's i shouldn't have uh walked that extra mile this week or

313
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:49,919
i thought i would be better maybe i should call the doctor you know whatever it is there's the all of our attention tends

314
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:57,440
to be about the knee or if it's this repeated patterns i'm talking about some of these emotional ones

315
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:04,799
for example there might be a repeated story i'm just making this up about the divorce of our

316
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:12,560
parents and and over and over about what happened to which child or and when or you know

317
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:19,679
something like this and then we might have this uh maybe this memory or this thought that

318
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:26,878
just shows up repeatedly in the context of a loving-kindness

319
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:32,200
retreat or this shows up is there a way in which we can

320
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:37,760
expand the field of attention earlier i talked about when there's pain

321
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:45,040
in the knee it's always the knee but now i'm talking about maybe there's this thought or this memory so it's more a

322
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:51,598
bodily experience so can we expand it so what do i mean by that

323
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:59,359
this idea with the let's say the story that happens with the divorce of the parents and there's

324
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:05,920
this pain or is or there's this memory that keeps on coming up

325
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:11,200
that's a that's more like a mental event a memory to expand is to say oh how does

326
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:16,800
that feel in the body to bring in something a little bit more

327
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:26,079
than just that difficulty how does this thought feel in the body

328
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:34,079
what is this oh i might recognize oh there's some tightness in the chest and the diaphragm and a

329
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:42,720
lump in the throat and with that just expanding this area

330
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:49,280
of awareness already that has a little bit of a shift so we're not completely consumed

331
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:58,599
with this with uh the memory and with that little bit of shift there's a little bit of space

332
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:05,599
just a little bit of maybe a little more breathing room

333
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:12,880
and then we might also ask ourselves maybe maybe it'll be

334
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,960
skillful maybe not something for you to explore for yourself if it seems like the appropriate thing

335
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:24,160
to do but we can then with this expanding our awareness and

336
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:30,160
now a little bit more space we could ask ourselves is it true

337
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:36,240
and of course we're going to think well yes it's true i'm thinking it so it is true

338
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,359
or we might think well that's kind of rude to ask right there's this

339
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:47,200
of course it's true feeling but again this just kind of dropping in this

340
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:54,560
gentle warm-hearted inquiry makes space for something else to unfold

341
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,599
something else to arise something else to happen

342
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,119
in the context of it when we're doing meta practice

343
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:11,680
this warm-heartedness you know is it true might allow for

344
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:19,200
well part of it's true but maybe not the magnitude or maybe even just the answer

345
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:26,160
is i don't know so there may be a time in which it's not

346
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:32,000
helpful to ask this question is it true but there might be a time in which it is

347
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:39,119
supportive and is wise and so that's all of us to find our way

348
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:45,200
with this but if we find like we're really stuck and if we're doing loving-kindness

349
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:50,720
practice and just find that we can't connect or we can't

350
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,839
do the loving kindness practice this is a way in which we might be able to

351
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:59,280
find a little bit more ease

352
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:07,839
so our difficulties are often found you know in the body the pain in the knee and the mind memories about something

353
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:13,520
that happened emotionally or energetically or something like this but

354
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:19,520
this idea that can we be expand of our awareness can we become aware of another

355
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:25,200
dimension of it of this persistent

356
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,640
visitor we'll use that word visitor so beyond what's the obvious beyond

357
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:36,800
what's the most prominent way it shows up because

358
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:43,599
this release or a shift or a type of letting go only can

359
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:49,839
if we find that we're stuck a release can only happen if we kind of are shifting our

360
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:57,680
way that we are with the difficulty what i mean by that is the way that our stance our perspective

361
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:04,240
and so often the easiest way to do that is to if we find it's a mental thing to

362
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:09,599
go to the body if we find it's a bodily thing well to go maybe to a neutral place in

363
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:14,960
the body or maybe to hearing but to shift a

364
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:21,760
little bit our our awareness what we're bringing to our attention

365
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:32,880
and then of course this expanding our awareness helps us to become a little bit disidentified with whatever it is

366
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:39,119
that's causing the difficulty and that

367
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:45,119
can open up space too recognizing what else is here

368
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:52,079
if we've been practicing some loving kindness there might be might be some of this residual this

369
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:57,200
residue that perfume maybe of some warm-heartedness even if right then

370
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:04,800
we haven't there might have been uh easy access or easier access to that if

371
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:11,920
we had just been practicing it earlier and it might be a way in which

372
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:17,000
that we can orient towards the

373
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,240
warm-heartedness as a way to make space and disidentify with

374
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:29,760
difficulties so tonight i talked a little bit about

375
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:35,839
why there are difficulties even starting a loving kindness practice there's a number of different reasons why people

376
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:41,200
have a hesitation a reluctance to

377
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:46,720
not even do loving-kindness practice and then i talked about

378
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:53,280
some of the ways in which we can work with difficulties while we are doing loving-kindness practice and

379
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:59,200
a way in which it might be um a really fruitful place

380
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:04,880
to work with loving i'm sorry with difficulties of course mindfulness practice is very

381
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:10,319
skillful in a way to do that too but there might be some ways in which

382
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:18,680
in the context of living kindness practice to work with difficulties can be really helpful also

383
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:29,359
there's something about reminding ourselves of

384
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:36,079
the goodness the warm-heartedness that exists in everybody

385
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:43,200
ourselves and in others that can really make it

386
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:49,760
it can be transformative and can be really powerful practice as an alternative to

387
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:55,440
maybe just feeling stuck or feeling like we can't find our way

388
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,720
forward or in a way that doesn't feel like it's supporting our

389
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:07,760
life or our practice so that we can show up for our life and

390
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:14,319
our practice and show up for others in a way that is

391
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:20,160
supportive helpful uplifting

392
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:27,920
so that all of us can find more freedom more ease and more peace

393
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,838
so thank you

394
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:47,760

395
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:54,079

396
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:59,920
volunteer energy i just show up and give a little talk so and and

397
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:06,720
for the website and sometimes we have recorders so i just want to kind of like bow to this whole community

398
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:12,079
sometimes we don't see them all that helps makes this happen

399
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:17,760
and i'll stay up here for a little bit if uh some of you would like to

400
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:24,119
talk or ask a question or something like this but as always thank you
