1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:07,200
so welcome uh welcome all uh

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:14,320
i'm just seeing the the names uh stream stream through

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:23,199
and uh yeah welcome to to all of you welcome to all of you

4
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:29,599
um yeah

5
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:36,239
so here we are again together and

6
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,760
yeah let us uh let us practice together

7
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,240
so finding your your posture

8
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,880
even if it's very familiar finding it again

9
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:15,200
i'm taking a posture that's both supple but strong

10
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:27,640
notes are kind of openness to phenomena

11
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,280
we relax whatever tension

12
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,760
can be relaxed

13
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:15,319
whatever tension remains we allow to remain

14
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,080
our practice is to

15
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,000
to release some of the tendencies we have around

16
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,759
pushing and pulling

17
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,560
pushing and pulling on phenomena

18
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,919
so rather than trying to shape our experience

19
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,560
we just let ourselves be softened by it

20
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:05,240
let the heart be softened by experience

21
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,240
all phenomena converge on feeling

22
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,199
centrality of feeling

23
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:35,839
the urge to fix to adjust the shape

24
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:47,279
the the limits of our equanimity or are felt in

25
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,320
the realm of feeling

26
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:18,079
so we permit phenomena sites and sounds thought and sensation we permit them

27
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:24,000
access to our heart to feeling

28
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,319
we're willing to be impacted

29
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:44,040
we're willing to be still

30
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:53,040
we're willing to be changed by experience

31
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,160
rather than change it

32
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:34,160
it's agitating to try to cobble together

33
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:43,080
a life to cobble together solutions

34
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,720
to cobble together an identity

35
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,799
to get our papers in order

36
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,880
so we stand down

37
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,600
settle back

38
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,080
willing to feel our way through

39
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,440
the flood

40
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,120
of urges

41
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:06,440
urges to shape experience

42
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:23,158
to shape ourselves to shape our life

43
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,009
[Music]

44
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:34,240
when when the the astronauts

45
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:42,320
first walked on the moon they uh they planted an american flag

46
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:49,279
and um and i've always thought that they they really should have planted a flag

47
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:54,559
with an image of the moon right

48
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:59,679
they planted an american flag and

49
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:05,840
we plant flags too we plant flags all over the place

50
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:12,000
and our flag has two letters on it

51
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,519
m [Music] e yeah

52
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:24,880
and we plant flags uh

53
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:31,440
to feel safe to feel good to have reference points

54
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:38,480
but any claimed territory

55
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,360
entails territoriality

56
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:52,480
and as social animals with social needs

57
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:59,600
um we do a lot of flag planting

58
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:06,240
and as social animals with social needs

59
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:12,559
this can turn the world into a kind of stage

60
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:19,360
and there are many dimensions of the self that are are um

61
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:25,840
performative not all dimensions of the self are are a

62
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:32,080
performance but many are and performance is tiring

63
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:40,799
right actors rehearse and summon energy and confront doubts

64
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:49,440
and are concerned about breaking character concerned about being found out

65
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:57,200
stressful so from uh

66
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,799
sociologist uh goffman from almost 70 years ago said

67
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:12,480
uh the world is not of course a stage but the crucial ways in which it isn't

68
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,440
are not easy to specify

69
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:24,720
and goes on to say uh choose your self-presentation carefully for what starts out as a mask

70
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,000
becomes your face

71
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:36,159
in a sense are our performances they're

72
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:41,760
they're an argument yeah in the legal sense they're an argument

73
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:47,200
we're making a case we're making a case for me

74
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:53,919
as valuable in some way and uh

75
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:59,760
that makes sense but um we want to be careful

76
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:07,640
yeah because we we confuse a mask an argument for ourselves

77
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:14,560
and then buddhism takes us deeper and it's not just the mask that's not you

78
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:19,720
but you are not your face either

79
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:28,960
this deep

80
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,638
deep assumption i am me

81
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:40,480
this moment fits into who i was who i will be my

82
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,599
autobiography was a deep

83
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:52,720
felt experienced and

84
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:58,240
yet were directed to the the understanding that uh

85
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:03,760
that clinging to a particular view of self clinging to a particular view of

86
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:09,359
self is very fertile ground for pain

87
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:14,800
for ourselves and others and

88
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,400
many many painful

89
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:27,680
emotional experiences many painful experiences uh they they

90
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:34,560
they serve to illuminate the architecture of self-view

91
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:41,680
yeah this the the the structures the edifice of self-view are illuminated by

92
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:48,000
afflictive emotion by shame by arrogance

93
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,119
by self-righteousness this illuminates

94
00:35:53,119 --> 00:36:00,560
the architecture of self-view and rather than devote ourselves to

95
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:07,200
endlessly making our arguments to curating ourselves

96
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:13,838
we investigate we investigate

97
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:21,040
and maybe find that the

98
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:28,520
the hallmark of of ego is defensiveness

99
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:37,680
is that territoriality we claim territory we become territorial

100
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:45,960
and wherever wherever there is self-identification

101
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,640
there can also be shame

102
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:59,520
and so we look how does this self congeal

103
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,520
how do we make our arguments

104
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:14,160
and at some point in practice we become unconvinced by our autobiography

105
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:20,240
unconvinced by our autobiography and

106
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:26,160
all the familiar stories the familiar milia

107
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:31,599
of me the arrogance the sense of unworthiness

108
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:37,119
the self-hatred all of the style

109
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:43,680
all too familiar tropes in our autobiography this we

110
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:49,520
become alienated from all of it yeah

111
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:57,040
and it's not that we dispute like the conclusions and say no

112
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:02,839
it's it's other than that we just become alienated from the whole

113
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:08,079
realm of self-view

114
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:13,440
and are born into something like

115
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:21,200
wonder and openness and equanimity of course is vital in

116
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:27,520
this it's vital in the process of developing

117
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:34,640
a fluid sense of self it's vital in the process of developing this insight into

118
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:40,920
not self our points of

119
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:48,000
identification the arguments we make wanting to be this resisting that

120
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:55,119
making making the case to ourselves to others this arises as feeling

121
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:02,960
feeling yeah feeling seen feeling too seen

122
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:10,480
not feeling seen feeling misconstrued all of this is acutely painful

123
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:17,920
and our practice is to slowly drain the charge from every egoic

124
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,640
definition

125
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:30,400
and so notions of self arise yeah the cases we want to make they

126
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,760
arise they arise in formal practice we meet them

127
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,599
we meet those arisings with equanimity

128
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:52,480
to to know the emptiness of our identifications is to feel them

129
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:59,520
to feel them to feel the impact of this urge

130
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,560
to be this to be that to prove this to prove that

131
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:10,680
to decorate one's mask to decorate one's face

132
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,640
to curate the self

133
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:28,960
we greet all of these these flows and urges with equanimity

134
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:36,720
and slowly begin to drain the electrical charge from them

135
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:43,839
yeah so the the solidity of identity begins to

136
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:47,440
to soften to melt

137
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:58,720
we grieve anata yeah this teaching on that self we grieve anata before it becomes

138
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:04,800
liberating uh in a sense we have to grieve the three

139
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,720
notebo three characteristics

140
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:14,640
before they become free in

141
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:24,800
no one no one gets to become the person they think they are

142
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:32,560
yeah there's just no place to rest no refuge to be found

143
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:38,880
no identity that provides shelter

144
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:47,240
sense of the heart resting on steady ground

145
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,079
none of this is to turn the ego into a kind of uh

146
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:01,680
inner enemy right where this practice the theme of equanimity

147
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:07,359
is not making an enemy of any experience

148
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,599
and so we don't turn a kind of aggression inwards or go hunting down

149
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:18,880
the sense of self or something like this the self

150
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:24,640
you know these egoic processes their self is a kind of

151
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:31,920
sensitivity you know child like desperate

152
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:37,359
so desperate and it needs love

153
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:42,400
yeah it needs love

154
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:49,760
not aggression yeah and so

155
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:56,560
we give love we offer ourselves love we receive love

156
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:02,720
and we start to

157
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,520
be to be less congealed

158
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:16,000
to have less kind of

159
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:21,760
less and less of an impulse to make our cases

160
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:28,640
and we're really uh

161
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:34,480
we're no longer guarding something that is both

162
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:40,000
precious and incredibly fragile yeah

163
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,839
no longer guarding the sense of the this the fragility the inherent

164
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:52,960
fragility of self that also feels at moments

165
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:59,520
priceless yeah we're no longer safeguarding

166
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:06,640
something that is totally fragile and totally precious

167
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:15,200
and this puts us at ease this opens our heart

168
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:20,799
to many forms of love

169
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:27,839
yeah because uh ownership

170
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:32,160
generates anxiety

171
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:38,800
so i offer this for your your consideration
