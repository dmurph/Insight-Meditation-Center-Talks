whatever busyness planned movement it's all great

30
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:29,459
and yet we intentionally relinquish as we enter into the Sacred Space of our

31
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:38,239
practice it's like taking our shoes off before entering into the temple

32
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:43,680
our proverbial shoes of walking in the world engagement in the

33
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,799
marketplace take that off

34
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:56,840

might seem like a juicy bone thinking about this figuring it out

54
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,399
or sometimes it's a dry bone

55

136
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:55,400
maybe in your heart connect with this being with their Humanity

137
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:01,140
their lives are just as complex and compelling

138
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:06,380
to them as yours is to you

139
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:19,100
the landscape of their mind their heart their lives is just as

140
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:25,260
compelling rich filled with ups and downs

141
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:31,080
it's yours is if you could step into their lives for a

142
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:36,779
moment in your imagination see your see you in that interaction you

143
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:38,960

144
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:54,320
now from this perspective receive your kindness receive your good will

145
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:04,200

and returning the Goodwill wishing you well wishing you well

149
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:43,799
and now shifting perspectives again coming back to your own perspective and appreciating this moment in time this

150
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:47,898
interaction you had with another human being

151
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:57,980
so many interactions like this throughout our day we touch each other's lives

152
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:07,500
perhaps seemingly mundane interactions but not so mundane can we enrich them

153
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,240
with Good Will with kindness

154
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,720
enrich them with kindness with appreciation

155
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,639
with gratitude

156
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:46,380

00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:07,140
to tell the soil to calm the mind to settle

168
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:14,220
first then we turn to practice with what is called a neutral person someone

169
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:22,260
who's a standard for all of humanity and I invited you to

170
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:27,539
to then also shift perspectives at the end from their perspective from your

171
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:33,299
perspective both of you together and also the appreciation of this person

172
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:39,840
touching your life perhaps in a moment as they did if there was an interaction

173
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:45,500
and the sense of gratitude appreciation for so many such interactions we have

174
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:51,899
with so many beings throughout the day throughout our lives and this is one of

175
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:58,799
them where interacting with each other right now by showing up in this Sangha

176
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:05,940
in our practice so as an invitation for engaging women

177
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:13,919
in the breakout groups the invitation is to explore that to take that sense of of

178
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:19,560
the common Humanity to take that into the small groups together

179
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:25,260
we all just want to be happy not suffer we we've all have

180
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:30,419
we all have hopes and dreams and challenges and dukkha and sufferings and

181
00:34:30,419 --> 00:34:35,940
stress it's The Human Condition can we can we

182
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:42,000
bring can we exchange can we get into the space with that sense

183
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,839
and the invitation is if you like you could get into the group just hold

184
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:57,780
presence hold compassionate silent presence you don't have to say anything but it's it's a Sandbox for for the way

185
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:02,880
of interacting so you can so the invitation is to

186
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:09,960
perhaps say something about how this practice was for you maybe there aha there was an aha moment or not maybe

187
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:15,060
it's okay to say I was distracted the whole time that's perfectly fine too not

188
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:21,440
a problem um no right or wrong or you can just offer silence

189
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:29,700
so let's go enough in Reverse alphabetical order and each person has the chance to share

190
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:34,800
maybe just one nugget not too long so that other people will have a chance to

191
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:41,520
share and then they will come back to you I'll come back to you or you'll go around a few times just what was this

192
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:49,020
black practice like for you and I'll do a sharing before you go in I there was a lot of happiness and joy

193
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:56,700
and actually a lot of gratitude came up for me I imagined someone yesterday was a barista at a coffee shop I had not met

194
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:02,099
her so before so she was new and then by really bringing her into my practice

195
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:08,820
there was a sense of gratitude thank you for making that cup of coffee for me it was really good thank you for the time

196
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:15,359
that you spent crafting this decaf cappuccinos lovely thank you

197
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:22,140
so so that's that's one of my practice reports to inspire you with yours so

198
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:29,480
here we go I'm gonna create the rooms take care of yourselves take care of each other here wake up

199
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,079

foreign

201
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:16,220

202
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:23,220
we will wait with kindness for all those who are back already from groups and

203
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:28,980
those who are still in the group

204
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:32,838
and the breakout groups

205
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:48,660
hey the rooms are closed now everybody's back welcome back everyone and we have

206
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:54,060
some time for um or reflections

207
00:45:54,060 --> 00:46:01,440
what uh what aha moments perhaps you had

208
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:08,700
questions complaints realizations especially if you haven't shared in a while in the big

209
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:13,800
group I'd like to invite you to step forward if you have shared please step

210
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:19,859
back make space for those who perhaps haven't been

211
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:26,099
present or raising their hands so not necessarily calling them shy ones

212
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:33,500
but evening out the space with invitations

213
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:42,420
we haven't heard from you in a while would love to hear from you Christine

214
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:52,260
thank you Nikki that was uh it was good for me tonight my group I wanted to say we sat in

215
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:58,619
silence and that's the first time I'd done that in a breakout room but even though we

216
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:05,460
didn't speak there was that sense of um acceptance and gratitude for each other

217
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:12,319
just sitting there tonight so I just want to say to both of them thank you from here

thank you so thank you thank you Christine oh that

219
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:26,880
that moistens my heart that makes me feel very tender or actually with tears in my eyes how sweet

220
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:32,819
to be in this space of sitting in Silence with with kindness for one another and

221
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:39,599
gratitude oh thank you for sharing that oh just makes me so happy hmm

222
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:47,240
thank you Amy Aloha Amy please

223
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:55,500
thank you um yeah I really liked the practice today of the person we know yeah we

224
00:47:55,500 --> 00:48:02,339
don't know it felt slightly less complicated than Sometimes some of the other meant to practices we can be doing

225
00:48:02,339 --> 00:48:09,720
and um and that was actually something on theme I've already been playing with where I've been feeling a little bit of

226
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:14,880
tension when I bring up someone that I really do love and care about just like

227
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:22,260
because there's just little touches of unease or like a moment where they said something and I received it icky or

228
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:28,380
things that um have becoming up and I think I realized today that I want to

229
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:35,160
play with like forgiveness practices around that was like a real nice like moment of realization that I need to

230
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:40,380
maybe pause when we're doing this and if it's not happening then maybe I can send

231
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:45,540
out yeah if it feels okay um to do so like make it become a

232
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:51,660
forgiveness practice then and then I did a little of that and then I was like oh wow I did lighten like I just wanna I

233
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:58,339
feel yeah a shift so yeah

234
00:48:58,339 --> 00:49:04,319
beautiful I I so appreciate the wisdom of what you just shared Amy

235
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:10,740
that oh yeah I noticed Alina a little bit of oh something didn't quite land right I love this person and yet ouch

236
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:18,599
just a little bit of ouch and and oh what if I turn to forgiveness like

237
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:24,599
there's a wisdom inner wisdom that says oh yeah that's the medicine that's needed right now instead of just like oh

238
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:31,920
pushing it away like oh you know you're just being sensitive and it's nothing and oh ouch that went super North right

239
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:37,500
oh yeah and we do that a lot of times we do that we try to just like uh bulldoze

240
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:44,520
our way through difficulty and yet the wisdom the inner wisdom oh what if I turn to forgiveness just forgiveness

241
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:49,680
here just moisten is this this tender

242
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:56,160
um area and oh yes beautiful oh yeah there's a Clarity there's a flow there's like almost as you were describing it's

243
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:01,920
like feel like like there's just a little bit of obstruction obstruction and then oh yeah then there's a flow of

244
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:07,440
metal oh yeah I can now it flows well that's what was needed beautiful I

245
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:13,700
really appreciate how you describe that and one more thing I wanted to highlight is sometimes actually it is

246
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:18,839
easier for the heart to just bring in someone we don't know really well we

247
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:25,319
don't have a history with it's easier for The Meta to flow um and sometimes actually that's easier

248
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:31,980
for some people as a place to start than the easy person because there are no easy persons in in somebody's life so

249
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:39,480
I'm just saying this because you brought it up and it's a great opportunity to mention that yeah starting from neutral

250
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:44,579
is great if if that works better for some people so awesome thank you so much

251
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:51,500
Amy you please

252
00:50:54,059 --> 00:51:01,200
oh you're still muted okay yeah thank you Nick you were wonderful

253
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:07,859
on meditation in in our group we were discussing How uh

254
00:51:07,859 --> 00:51:15,119
we as we go through our day we we meet people who were nice to us and we we've

255
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:20,400
seen better to them and sometimes we meet people who maybe are not so nice or

256
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:27,180
who maybe are jerks and and they don't get so much better and that uh how but

257
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:33,780
how that sort of sets us up or in a position where we decide who gets the

258
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:41,420
medal oh a lot of matter for you uh not so much for you and you you jerk no matter for you

259
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:51,240
mentioned that uh he has he hasn't wrote to live in a world where he feels better

260
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:58,020
for everyone where he is rich people and by the way he it's it I I sorry I'm

261
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:04,920
interrupting you but but uh just feel a little bit of tenderness you know it's best to let let Neil share what he

262
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:13,079
shared himself if he if he you know but it's okay to say someone in the group said blah blah blah but not identify who

263
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:18,660
said it so sorry I'm going to interrupt you and allow Neil if he wants to to share what he shared in the group does

264
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:24,780
that feel okay just at the center in terms of boundaries of what was shared in the group for for specifics to stay

265
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:31,280
in the group but but I appreciate what you said Hugh that was lovely

266
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:40,079
that was so profound that is so profound that oh gosh yeah we keep we deciding

267
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:47,579
and in fact people who are not being very kind probably they're hurting so much oh God because hurt people hurt

268
00:52:47,579 --> 00:52:53,460
people in fact but we're deciding oh you don't need meta in fact the person who's not being very kind

269
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:58,619
is the person who needs the most meta because they're hurting the most so yeah

270
00:52:58,619 --> 00:53:04,619
I so appreciate the the wisdom of what you brought in like yeah it feels like

271
00:53:04,619 --> 00:53:10,980
we're deciding anything else you want I'm gonna invite Neo if there's anything he wants to do and but anything you want

272
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:16,339
to say about your your own observations here yeah yeah

273
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:22,740
um your answer that was was my um uh offering and then someone else in the

274
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:28,859
group said that they felt that they have a right that they were that they deserve

275
00:53:28,859 --> 00:53:36,599
to be uh they have a right to be in love with with everyone and to have a a world

276
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:44,040
full of lovers rather than to live in a world um where with people that
