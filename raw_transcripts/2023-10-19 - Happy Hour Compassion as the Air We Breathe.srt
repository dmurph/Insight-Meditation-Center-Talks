1
00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:07,439
so hello hello and welcome everyone to happy hour lovely to be together in this

2
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:13,559
moment in times and for our practice together I

3
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:21,279
want to invite us to uh to continue to engage with the practice of

4
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:27,480
compassion there can't be enough compassion in the world for ourselves

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:34,040
for others because there's so much suffering in the world bod hurt Hearts

6
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:44,559
hurt there is unfortunately the continuation of of geopolitical

7
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:51,760
situation so much pain and suffering as the Buddha said greed

8
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:58,079
hatred and confusion not knowing any better not knowing that harming each other hating each other doesn't end

9
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:04,119
hatred so let let's continue with the practice of compassion wherever it's

10
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:09,280
called for um couple of days ago we started inside and internally and went

11
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,439
outside and maybe we'll do the same today so

12
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:22,040
so with that invite you to find a position where your body is comfortable

13
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:29,200
enough in this moment in time and if there is discomfort presence

14
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,840
that's okay to can we welcome

15
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:42,320
that can we relax soften with whatever is present in

16
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,600
this

17
00:01:51,759 --> 00:02:01,840
moment inviting our hearts our minds our bodies to relax as much as possible

18
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:10,080
relaxing into around what is with no

19
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,760
agenda

20
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,239
and if thoughts are arising In This

21
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,640
Moment not a problem and yet can we relax them

22
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:01,480
too invite them safety ease can they

23
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:07,200
rest as we invite this body to rest and collect

24
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,680
itself

25
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:52,360
letting the body relax the heart the mind and just

26
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,080
receive the breath in the belly calming

27
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:07,400
soothing s settling settling our minds our hearts can be so

28
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,960
agitated especially when there's pain and

29
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,560
sorrow and settling is not the way to deny pain and sorrow

30
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,919
is a way to establish more stability so we can be with pain and sorrow

31
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:32,600
skillfully with compassion instead of agitation and

32
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:39,639
reactivity so settling settling with each breath No Agenda just to

33
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,639
settle

34
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,479

time

all beings be free including

102
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:15,440
[Music]

103
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:27,799
myself so your practice everyone so the way we explored the

104
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:33,240
practice of compassion this evening this in this

105
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:40,039
session is unlike any time in the past we've explored it it's it's a new way

106
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:46,440
diff different way and

107
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:54,120
um and as I was leading the meditation the different images different teachings

108
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:59,679
came to mind and one of them was

109
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:07,720
how in the jica tales which are the tales of the stories of of how um in

110
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:12,760
many many lifetimes their children's tales of the lifetimes of the Buddha

111
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:18,039
before he became the Buddha many many rebirths that he

112
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:23,200
had um just how he developed these various

113
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:29,279
qualities and each time he would be reborn perhaps as an animal

114
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:35,120
and in one of these Tales I forget what animal he was

115
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:40,600
but again my memory is a little uh unclear but basically there's

116
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:47,399
this story of of him considering or actually offering himself

117
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:54,720
as for food offering his body as food for for

118
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:01,559
uh a uh I think uh lion and lion cubs who were starving so the sense of

119
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:10,080
offering your body like offering your body out of compassion so so in this

120
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:16,159
practice maybe coming up from my own pain in my body the sense of lightess

121
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:22,080
that was coming and feeling light and and Airy what if we we could offer our

122
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:28,640
bodies our our bodies is air that others breathed and brought them comfort and

123
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:36,640
care so this transformation of our wish to bring comfort and sucker as our us

124
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:42,559
transforming ourselves into this agent that goes around you know this air that

125
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:48,880
hugs people and engulfs them and penetrates their cells through the oxygen they breathe

126
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:54,840
and brings comfort and ease and and

127
00:27:54,840 --> 00:28:00,360
um sucker so again like any practice this might have

128
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:05,840
worked for some of you might have been an aha moment and for some of you may

129
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:11,840
not have and it's all okay not a problem it worked for you great add it to your

130
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:21,200
Arsenal and if it didn't let it go no worry so many different ways into the

131
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:29,440
temple so I like to invite us to uh explore how this practice was for us in

165
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:22,720
best of ourselves up on the altar of humanity you know and it reminded me of
