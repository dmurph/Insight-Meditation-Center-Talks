1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,860
yeah good morning good day everybody

2
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:16,400
I'll begin our third day of Stillness and the movement Adventure

3
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:23,100
so today I will be continuing um this theme of

4
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:31,500
Stillness and movement will be incorporating Stillness in the movement with emotions

5
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,340
as well as well as the body

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,180
okay let's begin

7
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:58,460
take a few moments to settle into the space you're in

8
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:14,780
allow this arriving and entering into this body and mind and heart

9
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:24,560
to be a gradual process not rushing pushing

10
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,460
and being gentle kind

11
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:39,200
arriving Here and Now

12
00:01:53,180 --> 00:02:00,259
entering into the Temple of this body mind and heart

13
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,799
making our seat

14
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:19,379
maybe just this words already evokes a sense of

15
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:25,220
grounded and uplifted

16
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,219
what's the felt sense of a settling into this body mind and heart

17
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,160
feeling and sensing

18
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:59,840
your own experience

19
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,379
maybe the global sense of the body posture

20
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,180
sitting lying down

21
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:38,239
maybe the contact of the body with the floor Earth

22
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:56,120
earthy body resting on Earth

23
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:28,020
giving this body to The Wonder of a gravity

24
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:36,680
nothing to do naturally settling down

25
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:54,720
the earthy part of the body is naturally grounding

26
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,720
stabilizing

27
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:11,660
solid steady

28
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,479
somewhat still

29
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,960
resting in the Stillness in the body

30
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:04,620
maybe just a hint of it or relatively still

31
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:11,340
doesn't have to be some kind of a grand levels of a

32
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:18,000
Stillness it's a relatively unmoving

33
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:22,580
study quiet

34
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,120
sitting like a mountain

35
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:27,419
there's a fears resonant

36
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:34,340
you can simply rest here maybe that's enough

37
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:50,599
otherwise you can follow the words

38
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:05,340
open to receive the felt sense of the movements of the

39
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,060
breath

40
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:20,000
and Stillness highlights the movements

41
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,080
becomes obvious

42
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,860
leaving and sensing

43
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:58,040
the sensations of the movements in the body

44
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:11,360
however they may show up for you

45
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,140
maybe it's the flow of the breath

46
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,300
coursing through the Torso

47
00:09:54,839 --> 00:10:00,440
maybe it's the expansion and contraction

48
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:10,220
that's everything moves through the body

49
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:29,420
nothing to do or simply becoming available

50
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:37,880
for the natural movements and the Stillness in the body

51
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:24,060
and other Sensations in the body may become

52
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:30,420
felt invisible

53
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,100
energetic field

54
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:59,640
pulsations vibrations

55
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,040
tingling

56
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,200
sway

57
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,940
whatever may be available

58
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:50,600
to the motion of the sensations

59
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,279
feel and sense

60
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:14,420
and Stillness never left us

61
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:46,940
in a sense of a lightness may be here

62
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:58,940
and deepening sense of grounding maybe here

63
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:27,839
not just the quieting and Stillness in the knowing

64
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,779
in the feeling and sensing

65
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:14,060
this is the perfect perfect place to rest in

66
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,139
if you like

67
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,320
do you feel wailing open to receive

68
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:49,579
the movements of the Mind may be waves of emotions

69
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,760
conceiving the Waves by resting

70
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:16,459
in the vast of Stillness in the knowing

71
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:28,500
as if you're settling in the bottom of the quiet Lake

72
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:35,120
and feel and sense the waves on the surface

73
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:04,079
maybe big waves or small waves

74
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:10,579
and nothing is felt emotionally

75
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,000
maybe just a tenderness

76
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,960
quiet kindness

77
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:54,480
version infusion

78
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:09,799
may have an embodied resonance

79
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:21,080
a beat or the coolness

80
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,539
related to the emotions

81
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,660
lasting in the bottom of the lake

82
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:48,200
to feel no sense

83
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:15,860
sensations of the body May coming

84
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,880
thoughts may come in

85
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:48,660
all of it can be received without

86
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,940
in the vast quietness

87
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:09,020
this is a safe place to feel

88
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:16,820
even if it's unpleasant

89
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:47,900
letting go of the storytelling of the emotions

90
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,779
lasting in the feeling and sensing

91
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,299
the emotions move

92
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,419
and emotions in your hearts and Minds

93
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:42,500
and in the body

94
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:50,159
like the clouds storms

95
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:55,158
and move through the tall mountain

96
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:06,200
all Mountain remains I'm moving

97
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,100
at a pleasant unpleasant

98
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:26,700
abide in the field of peace

99
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,139
and into Stillness

100
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:41,960
abide independent not claiming to anything in this world

101
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:57,500
foreign [Music]

102
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:20,279
today um I brought another

103
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:25,500
great woman disciple of the Buddha with us

104
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:32,460
her name is Sona and Sona is very different from the two

105
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:37,620
women I spoke about in the last two days

106
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:46,919
and Sona was a known Buddhist times to be a mother or a housewife were the many

107
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:52,159
children in fact she had

108
00:32:52,159 --> 00:33:02,640
10 children this is kind of a little harder for us to relate to in our modern day life

109
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:08,760
um but it's not uncommon in the ancient times

110
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:15,120
maybe ancient India and even maybe it's it's still so in

111
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:22,019
some part of the world nowadays I know for myself

112
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:28,679
my grandmother had five children and many in her generation had six seven

113
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:37,200
eight children and um women Mary very young and so they often

114
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:45,720
have a lot of kids what is not common for Sona is that all

115
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:51,840
her kids were doing really well all 10 children were doing really well

116
00:33:51,840 --> 00:34:01,080
that's kind of special and they had their own families their businesses were doing well and

117
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:06,960
they probably had it you know she probably had to grandchildren and so it was all good

118
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,899
and that's probably not very uh very common

119
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:18,599
um her husband was a devotee to the disciple of the Buddha

120
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:23,878
and at some point her husband decided to

121
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:30,300
join the monastic Sangha with the Buddha and so that left the sauna along with

122
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:38,398
all her children all her ten children um initially this wasn't quite an issue

123
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:43,560
and those days often the elderlies were

124
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:51,000
cared for by the children and all 10 of her children were doing really well so

125
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:57,960
she decided I'm just going to give away all my possessions and split it over

126
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:04,920
um across all 10 families 10 children's families and she asked if she could just

127
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:12,000
stay one with the one child at a time and kind of just rotate this

128
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:20,460
she didn't have a lot of needs so bear um necessity would do and that was working

129
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:28,160
well for a while and back then that weren't to really senior centers so that was how

130
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:33,260
elderlies often being cared for

131
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:39,839
um but that didn't last very long after some time

132
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:45,320
and there were began to be disputes

133
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:52,500
bitterness complaints acquisitions and we probably all know you know

134
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:59,099
they're probably a bunch of family dramas when in-laws are living

135
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:06,720
with the with the family and so the challenges with the living with the in-laws have restored to the

136
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:15,380
test of time from thousands of years ago till now and so that was the case for Sona

137
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:22,200
that was a saddening okay imagine you know she had given away everything to

138
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:28,440
all her children and her husband is no longer there to go

139
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:36,180
back to and so she thought well and there was really no other

140
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:43,940
option but for her to also join the Buddhism monastic Sangha

141
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:53,040
and there was no refuge in the children's homes or you know she also had no home of her

142
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:59,420
own and so she joined the monastic Sangha

143
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:05,400
that was the only way for her but

144
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:12,599
um this also turns out to be not easy for Sona joining

145
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:18,359
um the monastic Sangha of the Buddha uh

146
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:23,540
she her path a monastic path wasn't like

147
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:28,700
badass that I saw I described yesterday

148
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:37,380
or patacharas um when she joined the monastic Sangha she

149
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:45,540
realized all the way up till that point at that point of her life she had always

150
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:52,880
lived as a most of her life were kind of like wife

151
00:37:52,880 --> 00:38:00,000
mother grandmother and she had a really hard time to adapt

152
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:07,260
into a monastic Sangha life and maybe a lot different to live in a

153
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:13,079
monastic Sangha and he made were the people who you don't really know whether you like them

154
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:18,720
or not like and don't like them and there are a lot a lot of different

155
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:27,660
kind of things to do you know maybe the cooties or the cabins

156
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:34,260
need to be fixed and and they needed to learn to fix the cabins and all of this

157
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:40,260
kind of things um and she had no clue about those

158
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:46,320
and by the time she joined a monastic Sangha she was already kind of old and

159
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,660
weak you know wasn't very young and so she

160
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:59,099
did the things her ways and other nouns did things their ways and she often get

161
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:04,500
criticized by other nuts maybe they were younger maybe a lot of

162
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:11,099
them were younger and they would criticize her even on small matters

163
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:17,520
so that was really tough for her and so

164
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:25,079
um but Sona one of the prominent qualities of this woman Sona was that

165
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:30,359
she's courageous strong determined

166
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:37,079
she wasn't discouraged by any of these challenges that she's facing

167
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:45,480
so her sincerity dedication and the steadfastness let her one step at a time

168
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:51,359
on the Dharma path so she just kept at it

169
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:58,200
you know there is this term that one of my teachers is Philip Moffett sometimes would say

170
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:05,220
I've got practice the practice not practicing the results and so she

171
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:11,099
just gave herself over to practice as much as she could

172
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:18,000
and she probably didn't have a very good memory but she said the Buddha's

173
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:24,720
teachings in her memory she memorized it by heart and she practiced whenever she

174
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:30,599
remembered to do so that was kind of a wholeheartedness that

175
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:36,560
she went forth with this monastic life

176
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:43,020
and so definitely not like um bada who was very quick to add a

177
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:49,619
grasp at the teachings um this was not easy and she's like this

178
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:56,480
Turtle you know going one step at a time but she kept going

179
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:05,220
and one day this was what happened as she recounted this uh in the Legends of

180
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:11,880
the teres apadana and so she said

181
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:19,500
and then nanas left me alone in the retreat for a Buddhist announce

182
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:26,160
going off with the instruction he kept the water while we're gone

183
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:31,500
you can see you know this nouns were a little kind of mean when I read this you

184
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:38,339
know they were all going for retreat and and but they they asked a Sona to go

185
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:46,140
heat up the water while they're gone but um this is what happened

186
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:51,660
she said then bring water I poured it into a

187
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:56,700
small pot after placing it on the hearse

188
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:03,740
seated I then came toward my heart

189
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:11,880
just in the Simplicity of those activities pouring water into the small pot and

190
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:20,339
putting it on the Hearth she sat down and her mind became collected

191
00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:25,740
settled you can say entered into a state of a

192
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:31,160
samadhi and mindfulness

193
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:40,040
just so she says seeing the bodies this easedness

194
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:47,940
essencelessness impermanence throwing off all the defilements

195
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:51,920
I achieved our hardship

196
00:42:53,820 --> 00:43:02,359
so right in this process she saw the impermanence

197
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:08,880
not self and she let go of all the defilements

198
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:17,700
and became one of the awakened women then coming back those nuns asked me

199
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:25,440
about the hot water through concentration on the fire I quickly made the flame ignite

200
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:33,300
yes maybe she had a little psychic power or something uh kind of fun

201
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:40,140
and then astonished the nouns made to that fact available to the Buddha

202
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:45,240
hearing it Buddha Overjoyed spoke this

203
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:53,460
verse right now a life lived only for one day undertaken

204
00:43:53,460 --> 00:44:03,440
with a strong effort is better than a century lived inert lacking energy

205
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:10,619
so she was known to be one of the foremost of the nouns who had courageous

206
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:19,980
energy courageous effort in this whole process never giving up

207
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:26,480
I was determined her old age her household holder

208
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:31,980
conditioning didn't hinder her capacity to practice at all

209
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:37,920
she practiced the practice patiently and wholeheartedly

210
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:44,940
one moment at a time I was reflecting that in the age and the

211
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:51,480
culture well one is constantly pushed for efficiency

212
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:57,180
speed patience and a wholeheartedness can be

213
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:02,819
hard to come by and yet this can be one of those most

214
00:45:02,819 --> 00:45:09,200
important qualities and capacity to cultivate

215
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:16,859
and through this story it may also realize that the meeting

216
00:45:16,859 --> 00:45:24,480
difficulties and challenges are inevitable on our Dharma path

217
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:32,000
the Buddha experienced immense challenges too before his Awakening

218
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:39,660
including fear and dread living in the forest and he faced it

219
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:45,540
and so did this disciple sauna and so will wait

220
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:50,960
if we were to continue on our own Dharma path

221
00:45:52,920 --> 00:46:00,180
and Jack cornfield said this in his book The Path with the heart

222
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:07,520
as we follow a genuine path of a practice our sufferings may seem to increase

223
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:15,440
because we no longer hide from them and from ourselves

224
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:21,780
when we don't follow the old habits of a fantasy and Escape

225
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:29,460
we're left facing the actual problems and the contradictions of our life

226
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:35,640
a genuine spiritual path does not avoid difficulties

227
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:43,020
or mistakes but leads us to the art of making mistakes wakefully

228
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:49,460
bring them to the transformative power of our hearts

229
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:57,000
and so as we rest abide

230
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,180
in the Stillness openness of our heart

231
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:09,300
we allow the difficulties the storms

232
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:16,740
to pass through or not to push them away

233
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:23,040
to run away from them but we're cultivating this capacity

234
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:30,060
to allow to be with the challenges and difficulties of

235
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:37,020
our own life and the lives of all beings

236
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:42,300
so may this be the trans transformative power of our heart

237
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:47,300
for the well-being of all beings everywhere

238
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,460
thank you everyone for being here

239
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:58,099
may you all be well
