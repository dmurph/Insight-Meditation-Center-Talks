1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:06,560
so welcome um I'm Matthew

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,980
how are you doing maybe a little thumb pull

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:24,180
down okay okay pretty cheery for the YouTube folks FYI

4
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:30,119
um yeah happy to uh to sit with you

5
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:39,020
I tested negative by the way just in case you're looking at me like I'm a viral Vector uh just uh

6
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:46,500
so this is uh from from uh was listening to a talk from ajin sajito

7
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,899
and transcribed and you know edited down a

8
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:58,399
few things and I'll read uh just three three paragraphs here

9
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,619
so uh and uh in the Thai Forest tradition

10
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:10,200
um and has been in robes for close to um

11
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,979
50 years and I I recently sat sat with him

12
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:23,280
so um says I was visiting my elder brother yesterday his Alzheimer's and

13
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,880
also Parkinson's Parkinson's disease incapacitates the body and Alzheimer's incapacitates the

14
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,920
mind so this is obviously a very well yeah

15
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,040
it's a dumb messenger all this can break down

16
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,140
the physical body can break down the mental faculties can break down

17
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:53,939
still somebody is still in there he's unable to communicate hello okay

18
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:59,640
nothing happens just throw some words in nothing happens

19
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,640
obviously words aren't going to work here right so I just bring awareness over the whole

20
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:12,959
situation I make bodily contact I start gently massaging a leg holding a hand massaging

21
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,780
his hand sense of contact and then spreading awareness over a situation with good

22
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:25,980
will after about 10 minutes he starts to speak can't make much sense but at least

23
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:31,200
you can see he's encouraged to come out and at least start to say

24
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:40,260
something and I'm just listening encouraging and then I just start chanting metasuta

25
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:46,860
just radiating loving kindness this other hand comes over grabs hold of

26
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:54,720
mine three hands length together just chanting slowly met the sahagatena

27
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:01,140
you could feel the sense of ease and love and happiness because the energies The Body Energy the heart energy is

28
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:07,379
linking up so even though the thinking brain dissolves breaks down you can still have

29
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:14,400
a sense that of you know that I'm meeting this person there is a meeting place here

30
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:21,540
it's also not up to me to make something happen you know I cannot cure this person I

31
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:28,099
cannot change this person there's nothing I can do or say however much I like to

32
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,360
but he can still receive presence can still receive energy and still receive

33
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,900
love and kindness and as we're sitting there for about an hour or so

34
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,480
and then gradually his hand became stronger and stronger

35
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:51,120
you know this is poignant but also something very satisfying

36
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,659
because one feels the sense of wanting to do something being a bit worried wanting to help

37
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:02,760
feeling what can I do just relaxing

38
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:08,099
everybody gets to the end of their life sometimes people get to the end of their

39
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:14,280
mind before they get to the end of their life but that doesn't mean you abandon them

40
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:21,239
just made you abandon your wish that they'd be something other than the way

41
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:28,220
they are right now and then you can meet them you can start to do

42
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:33,780
that with people that are dying but it's more like you have to practice

43
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:39,660
that with people who are living rather we're been trying to make them

44
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:45,720
some way or another or you know you just hold with awareness

45
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:54,860
and loving kindness and Trust they will see that and the best will come out of that

46
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:10,320
so here is this uh

47
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,960
this this monk who has

48
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,900
stripped so much out of his life

49
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,199
and I heard him say that uh just in the the place he was staying he

50
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:33,300
just kept the lights down right because it didn't really want

51
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:41,720
the world always constantly jumping out at heart mind it was just like very

52
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:47,220
renunciate life dedicated to the cultivation of chitta

53
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:55,759
hard mind and and so much has been stripped out

54
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:02,039
but relating relationship

55
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,860
remains right care

56
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:13,440
remains and we talk so much about what is shed

57
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:22,880
on this path and and a lot is shed but we also keep a lot too

58
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,300
and there's something poignant to me about um

59
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:35,520
that that that ajan was speaking about his his brother

60
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:42,500
right this kind of the deep

61
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:48,199
mystery of the karmic bonds that we call family

62
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:55,139
right that kind of certain kind of reverence that that we have culturally for family and I I think for a good

63
00:06:55,139 --> 00:07:03,539
reason for the most part but the kind of mystery of just being uh

64
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:11,460
being of them but distinct from them being a kind of expression you know so

65
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:16,740
much shared sharing their pain sharing their potential

66
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,780
sometimes we are the next generation is just a kind of

67
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:27,919
expression of the potential that was unlived in the prior generation

68
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:34,500
so we do our best to nurture the seeds of uh wisdom and love

69
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:41,419
that we've inherited and uh

70
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:48,360
was teaching college students this past week and um

71
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:54,539
one of them came up to me at the end of a lecture and said you know I'm uh

72
00:07:54,539 --> 00:08:01,638
I'm practicing mindfulness I'm practicing mindfulness but I'm still afraid to die

73
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:11,220
20 or something and so yeah everybody gets to the end of

74
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:16,440
their life and that's a

75
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:23,639
a dhamma messenger classically something to wake us up everybody gets

76
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:31,139
to the end of their life and there are implications for how we live

77
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:37,860
of course their implications for how we live and

78
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:44,880
usually mortality you make mortality Salient in the mind and it it does a lot

79
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,459
of bad things to the heart generally when you meet it without wisdom Without

80
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:57,080
Love it can you see like so much of uh

81
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:04,560
the derangement of our culture is a function of unconsciousness around death

82
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:10,740
and the the fear around that can be marshaled for the most nefarious

83
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:17,640
purposes and generally it deforms our mind

84
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:25,560
but it need not need not it is a dhamma messenger

85
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:32,480
but in order for it not to make us more brittle

86
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,980
we have to take it into the heart and uh

87
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,800
away treating it as a dhamma messenger

88
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:49,260
Bertrand Russell said the world is vast that our own powers are limited

89
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:56,459
if all our happiness is bound up entirely in our personal circumstances it's difficult not to demand of life

90
00:09:56,459 --> 00:10:02,339
more than it has to give and to demand too much

91
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:09,140
is the surest way of getting even less than is possible

92
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,680
and so as I hear this hear this talk you know it's like

93
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:23,600
okay let this um this dhamma messenger let it just like

94
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:30,680
let the finitude sensitize me to goodness

95
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:37,620
sensitize me to goodness that is one thing death can do is it sensitizes us

96
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:43,680
to goodness because it's all that matters then

97
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:52,380
is like the only currency that matters even a little and it is not a perfect consolation

98
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:57,560
but it is the only one as far as I can see

99
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:04,100
and a lot of uh a lot of the Dharma path is just becoming progressively

100
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:10,879
sensitized to goodness in oneself in others

101
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:16,380
and we just get more and more responsive to that we take our cues from goodness

102
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:23,399
we live in this kind of open feedback loop where as a Dharma practitioner

103
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:30,920
everything is teaching us right as uh that famous phrase from Majin Shahs

104
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:38,399
there is a lot of intimacy and illness you know like we just come to depend on

105
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:45,959
the kindness of others and we can live a whole life as a kind of aspiring to be

106
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:51,200
an Island Independent but in the end

107
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,420
the nurse will get us the brother will get us

108
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:04,079
and we come to uh rely in one way or another on loved ones

109
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:12,899
on caretakers and so the the kind of intimacy of the

110
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:18,300
body breaking down and the the kind of love expressed through the touch

111
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:25,260
is moving to me and so ajan arrives and the words they

112
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:32,839
just don't go anywhere we know that experience the words just don't go anywhere

113
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:40,459
as if uh like words words are the wrong language

114
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:51,899
now sometimes they're not sometimes words can be medicine and um

115
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:56,940
I know I think ideally the kind of talking about the Dharma is supposed to

116
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:02,040
be medicine but um

117
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:09,120
even that's not even so much about the words the words are just kind of a

118
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,820
thread from one body to another a thread

119
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:20,639
from one body to another making love visible in some way

120
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,500
that's the function of the words

121
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:32,100
and so in this case though

122
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:38,040
words don't go anywhere and we we see that and

123
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:43,579
often words don't go anywhere even though they feel words stories

124
00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:49,320
conceptualizations can feel like the realest thing in the world

125
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:55,339
you know amidst the the

126
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:04,380
yeah in the in the kind of bubble encased within the The Narrative of our

127
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:10,139
life words feel more real than anything

128
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:15,839
and it can feel like happiness happiness is about kind of

129
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:22,380
rearranging the puzzle pieces of thought in our minds

130
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:28,680
and uh believe in the Dharma can get heady we

131
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:36,420
can get heady about what we're doing here and get kind of lost and Dharma abstractions

132
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:44,339
be tracking Dharma progress in this uh highly conceptualized way

133
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:52,500
and um and so the Dharma in a sense like our

134
00:14:52,500 --> 00:15:00,959
our self model just recruits the Dharma as another way of reifying itself

135
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:06,440
as another way of becoming all too knowing

136
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:13,260
the kind of motto we bring to the world the self and other the Dharma gets kind

137
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:18,660
of recruited in as a another

138
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:27,839
facet of of this all too familiar story

139
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:34,920
and so we're encouraged to stay connected to

140
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:40,199
the body which in a sense is a we both know the body

141
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:47,579
but it's also we're connected to a certain kind of not knowing there's a

142
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:56,040
certain kind of openness where we're being asked to kind of put down all the familiar tropes and stories

143
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:02,160
and lines and words and

144
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:08,300
just inhabit pour the awareness into the body

145
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,680
we try to practice sometimes in a disembodied way but then we just get

146
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:24,660
kind of mired in complexity Cormac McCarthy from Blood Meridian says

147
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:32,880
uh a man's at odds to know his mind because his mind is uh he has to know it with

148
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,160
he can know his heart but he don't want to rightly so

149
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:45,180
that's not to look there we could quibble with that last part you

150
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:50,940
know and I will you know right but yeah sometimes to know to no

151
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:58,199
one's mind that all we have is our mind and we just kind of get lost in complexity

152
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:06,000
and uh and so we breathe we breathe

153
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,980
when we reconnect with our body

154
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:19,020
and our heart of course I I do get the sentiment of best not to look there

155
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:24,058
um but uh but we can feel into that we can feel

156
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:31,500
into that and that feels a little bit less like the mind trying to know itself in a more

157
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:38,580
like uh oh yeah this body can be felt the surges and since the the goodness the

158
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:45,740
sensitivity the receptivity can be sensed of the heart

159
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:53,880
and so the path the path really begins when we feel uh feel the Dharma in our

160
00:17:53,880 --> 00:18:01,620
bones so our John's rubbing his leg holding

161
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:11,039
his hand massaging his hand very intimate and very embodied you know

162
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:17,640
when words fail okay embodiment heart energy transmitting

163
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:23,660
a Kind of Love through touch and

164
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:28,860
speaking another language rather than words

165
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:34,919
and we are kind of mammals you know

166
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:41,580
and touched as a lot to our system a lot

167
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:46,760
of times we don't don't even know you know so there's sort of like

168
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:52,140
oh yeah just like hard to even track what that does to the heart but there's

169
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:59,899
something soothed at a deep level in a gentle loving touch

170
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:07,919
a nine-year-old nephew tried out for a kind of Elite baseball team at least a

171
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:16,020
lead for nine-year-olds and uh did not make the team

172
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:22,260
close but did not make the team his best friend with whom he has some competitive

173
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:28,500
rival risk relationship made the team this is

174
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:35,220
just the world collapsing you know kind of for a nine-year-old and um

175
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:43,020
and so I'm like it's just you know quite upset and I'm like I'm trying like every

176
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:48,539
therapeutic way in to try to sue them you know it's like okay taking like all

177
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:55,080
these different attacks and uh and then uh that's uh you know I'm just

178
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:03,000
I'm just I knew it wasn't really working and you but I like trying what else am I supposed to do okay trying trying and he

179
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,980
says can you please stop talking

180
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:15,240
and uh okay okay and so he's got this swing in his room that like hangs down

181
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:21,059
from the ceiling and it's like this like drape of like nice Fabric or something

182
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:27,539
you just kind of get fully in it and you just you're just swinging from the ceiling and

183
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:33,780
it's like so I'm sitting there he's a kind of encased in this this uh this

184
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:40,320
swing and I'm just like yeah they'll just pushing you know

185
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,660
like simple simple kind of touch movement

186
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:49,100
things settling down

187
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:59,640
this is uh Nick Cave rate recent uh book which is describing the kind of

188
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:06,179
aftermath of uh the the death of his 14 15 year old son

189
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:13,140
died in an accident and um and he's like in you know in

190
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:19,260
morning hiding some kind of embryonic process after this

191
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:25,679
and then he finally goes out you know actually leaves his home so says uh

192
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:32,400
uh in conversation with somebody he says as far as the fans were concerned they saved my life

193
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:39,299
it was never never in any way an imposition and what you remember ultimately are the

194
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:44,340
acts of kindness the small but Monumental gestures

195
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:51,360
so vegetarian takeaway place in Brighton where I would eat sometimes I went there for the first time I had

196
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:57,360
gone out in public after Arthur died there is a woman who worked there and I

197
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:04,500
was always friendly with her just the normal pleasantries but I liked her I was standing in the queue and she

198
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:11,340
asked me what I wanted and I felt a little strange because there was no acknowledgment of anything

199
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:17,179
she treated me like anyone else matter of factly professionally

200
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,840
she gave me my food and I gave her the money and she gave me back my change as

201
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:31,140
she gave me back my change she squeezed my hand purposefully

202
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:37,500
it's a quiet act of kindness the simplest most articulate of gestures

203
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,840
but at the same time it meant more than all that anybody had

204
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:52,639
tried to tell me you know because of the failure of language in the face of catastrophe

205
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:08,600
and then ajan starts chanting chanting that that

206
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:16,760
and sometimes you know when you've done a lot of chanting when you've

207
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:24,299
said the metasuta when you've done the practice wherever it's like those those words they they kind of have this

208
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:31,679
channel in the heart mind and they sort of like evoke

209
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:39,740
goodness and such a fully full-hearted full-bodied way

210
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:46,620
and um and there is this sense of uh

211
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:56,120
of kind of plugging into this stream of Dharma love

212
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:03,260
it's like how far is that how far is that stream right now

213
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:13,220
part of why we practice is so that it feels very close at hand

214
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:22,520
very close at hand all it takes this is tilting the heart a little bit

215
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:30,500
and all those years all those hours of practice of rehearsing love

216
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,500
comes back

217
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:46,100
met sahagatena the Mind Made vast the Mind heart and mind made vast with love

218
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:52,740
and this is really a love that that can't go wrong

219
00:24:52,740 --> 00:25:00,559
not so many species of love that can't go wrong a lot of kinds of love can go wrong

220
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:08,100
sideways in one way or another but this is a love that that cannot go

221
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:17,240
wrong because it does not depend on samsara being arranged in a particular way

222
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:25,200
and so the sense of actually plugging into that

223
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:32,580
and um and the sense that there's no

224
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:39,480
no unfolding that invalidates this love no

225
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:46,220
pain possible that that reduces it

226
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:53,640
and so it said it can't you know it's measure less it's measureless

227
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:59,340
and to be met in that way that's a true meeting that's a true meeting that's

228
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:06,980
heart heart resonating with heart and um

229
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:16,919
and how How Deeply we belong to to be met in that way because it gives

230
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:23,340
space for us in our you know

231
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:29,760
in our strength and our limitation and our confusion and pain and love make

232
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:37,080
space for all of it all of it to feel like yeah there's no line being

233
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:44,419
drawn between what belongs and doesn't

234
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:49,980
and so his brother's grip gets stronger and

235
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:56,220
and then goes on to say that was poignant but satisfying poignant but

236
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:01,380
satisfying it's not up to me says to make something

237
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:08,159
happen I can't cure this person cannot change this person nothing I can do or say however much I'd

238
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:14,940
like to one feels the sense of wanting to do something being a bit worried

239
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:23,778
wanting to help him feeling what can I do just relaxing just relaxing

240
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:32,100
it can feel so terrible not to be able to do

241
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:39,140
something it's almost like we don't give that enough

242
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:46,860
credit just how bad it feels to to want to help and to be to run into the

243
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:53,039
limitations of one's control and

244
00:27:53,039 --> 00:28:00,440
in some relationship some relationships that are close I I feel like almost

245
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:09,020
almost haunted by the limitations of my power to free the other of suffering

246
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:17,779
and um and I see you know

247
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:23,460
I see the greed aversion delusion

248
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:30,559
and it might be subtle in them but there's something about it that I can just

249
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:37,860
almost not bear yeah it's way more evocative in them than it

250
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:45,120
is in me and um and there's a way in which for

251
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:53,520
when we love another person their suffering becomes a almost tragic

252
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:59,039
and um to be empathically connected to them and

253
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:04,620
to be to face the limitations of one's power which are nearly complete

254
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:11,880
to free them of that that's hard to open to

255
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:17,460
and the impulse to actually change them to

256
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:23,100
change the situation for me even just in kind of microwaves

257
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:29,299
like it just reaches a certain kind of fever pitch of just like

258
00:29:29,299 --> 00:29:38,100
intolerance of the other's pain or the way it kind of like spins me

259
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:45,179
and um you know growing up it's like

260
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:51,059
the suffering of a of a parent or caretaker or something

261
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:58,080
that's not a cause for compassion that's like an existential threat right to see

262
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:04,740
very clearly the limitations of of of the person who's who's

263
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:11,120
protecting you right to see the kind of

264
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:17,940
omnipotence just uh dispelled you know that's that's

265
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:23,960
haunting kind of and somehow it feels like that

266
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:31,140
imprinting then that way of relating to the suffering of loved ones has like

267
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:38,159
carried through even in contact grown up now right but um I don't depend in the

268
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:43,880
same ways but the same kind of spinning happens right

269
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:52,940
in different kinds of relationships and then the kind of intolerance of

270
00:30:52,940 --> 00:31:01,620
their pain can prompts me into action some kind of

271
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:07,080
intervention that masquerades as compassion but is

272
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:14,220
definitely not compassion has got a impulsive driven feel to it

273
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:21,600
afraid and the kind of white hot core of

274
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:29,340
willfulness willfulness this kind of frustration when we cannot change

275
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:34,519
another we cannot deliver them from suffering

276
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:41,159
and and the the kind of entanglement of that

277
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:47,640
the ways that in the kind of close relationships it's it's so easy to

278
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:52,700
become over identified with the pain of the other

279
00:31:54,779 --> 00:32:03,840
and empathy care compassion it's fatiguing when the pain of the other

280
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:10,380
and one's own pain becomes indistinguishable

281
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:16,760
right I think as a Carl Rogers said um something like around

282
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:22,740
therapeutic exchange accurate empathy to feel the pain of the other as if it were

283
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:30,059
your own without losing the as if condition without losing the as if condition we

284
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:35,580
lose the as if condition and then it's emotional contagion and

285
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:43,620
we're just swimming in it right we're over identified with it

286
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:49,980
but um here we we kind of have to distinguish

287
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:56,658
the pain of the other from one's own pain otherwise we both drown

288
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,120
it's not up to me to make something happen

289
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,580
it's not up to me to make something happen

290
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:15,720
it's like a lot of relief can come in that there's

291
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,820
a certain grief maybe in seeing the limitations of our power

292
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:26,460
the inevitability of suffering right but there's

293
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:29,898
there is a

294
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:37,679
there's some relief and I remember when I heard that line when I was listening to the

295
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:43,760
talk it was just like oh yeah something let down in my own heart

296
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:49,559
and so we've really got to find a way to

297
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:56,460
to keep our heart open even amidst our powerlessness

298
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:03,200
to keep the heart open even amidst helplessness

299
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:08,820
which has got to be among the most kind of

300
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:16,639
you know aversive postures for a human to be in

301
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:27,200
but um a lot of relief in giving up on change

302
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:33,138
sometimes we nurture change and sometimes we give up on it

303
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:42,240
and on the far side of our compassion can either be despair or equanimity

304
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:48,540
equanimity and so compassion is love in the face of

305
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:55,800
suffering and maybe we think Equanimity is somehow not caring what do you mean how do you

306
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:01,200
give up what do you mean you give up yeah we give up

307
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:06,960
that feels like the end of love but it's actually just another species of love

308
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:16,578
it's love in the face of the endless ungovernable nature of samsara

309
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:24,800
that our care can never fully cure the first Noble Truth

310
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:34,520
and the kind of a certain kind of cutting through the grandiosity and the resistance and the

311
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:41,760
impulsivity around it okay how do I stay open how does my heart

312
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:49,380
remain open even amidst the limitations of my power on the other side of my willfulness on

313
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,759
the other side of my control

314
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:03,119
and so once you start to do this with people that are dying it's more like you have

315
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:10,859
to practice with people who are who are living who are living

316
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:12,920
um

317
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:30,660
the the Neurosis I feel like we get into trouble when

318
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:38,820
kind of the Neurosis of one collides with the Neurosis of the other

319
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:48,960
that's real pain right when our our kind of clinging clingings tangle up

320
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,359
right and so we do the best we can to clear our heart

321
00:36:54,359 --> 00:37:00,980
um and to um so that the pain of the other does not

322
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:08,599
resonate and reverberate with our wounds but with our love

323
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:17,180
and um maybe in this way some of our

324
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:23,460
some of our the care that we feel becomes more bearable

325
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:31,800
less impulsive less uh a kind of way of engineering the shaping

326
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:40,500
the heart of the other and is a it becomes a kind of love that can't go wrong that's always going to uh

327
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:48,119
be of service the best will come out of that love and kindness and Trust they

328
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:56,339
will see that and the best will come out of that the best will not be perfect but the

329
00:37:56,339 --> 00:37:59,780
best will come out of that

330
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,799
I offer this for your consideration

331
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:20,119
please uh take what's useful leave the rest behind

332
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,059
okay
