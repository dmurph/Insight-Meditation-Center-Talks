1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,040
good evening

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,120
i i want to say it's nice to be here

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,840
with you all because in my mind

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,759
i'm meditating with other people even

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,200
though i am

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,240
alone in this room

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,640
but i i feel the sense i can see the

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,039
chats that um

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,760
there's others with us here others with

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,400
me here

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,719
so tonight i'd wanna i would like to

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,840
talk a little bit about

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,600
how we can bring our mindfulness

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,280
practice even to

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,840
thinking or thoughts or mental activity

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,320
or

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,920
often with mindfulness there's an

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,039
emphasis on being with breathing

19
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,160
being with the body but

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,320
of course we can also be with the mind

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,680
and their mental activity has such an

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,920
impact on our lives

23
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,198
it's worthwhile to become more aware of

24
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:05,680
it

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,119
and and to interrupt some of the

26
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:09,920
momentum

27
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,560
it might have some of the compulsive

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,040
quality it might have some of the

29
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,200
feeling of getting stuck going round and

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,680
round

31
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,920
and because it's so easy to just to get

32
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,600
lost into story

33
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,439
and mental activity

34
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,880
it's abundantly easy to do that we often

35
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,439
don't

36
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,119
fold in mindfulness of

37
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,560
mental activity mental states

38
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,560
until there's a certain amount of

39
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,360
stability and steadiness

40
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,600
so it might be for a lot of our

41
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,280
meditation

42
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,320
that we are just settling

43
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,240
and calming down and so it's primarily

44
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,520
spent with a

45
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,840
mindfulness of breathing and mindfulness

46
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,200
of bodily sensations

47
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,960
but when we feel like there's a certain

48
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,719
amount of stability

49
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,119
and this might not happen until we're on

50
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,720
retreat or

51
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,680
some other extended opportunity an

52
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,360
opportunity for extended meditation

53
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,840
periods

54
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,080
but whenever we do feel like there is

55
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,640
some stability then

56
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,680
we can turn towards

57
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,879
the thinking and the thoughts

58
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,160
without getting completely swept away

59
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,319
in them because of course this

60
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,840
um in order to

61
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,800
be mindful of thinking we need to not be

62
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,959
lost in thought maybe that goes without

63
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,200
saying

64
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,200
but we see both in the satipatana

65
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,239
so these two discourses some of the

66
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,840
primary discourses

67
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,280
that talk about mindfulness both of them

68
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,760
include mindfulness of breathing and the

69
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,800
body

70
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,400
before the mind

71
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,000
so this quality of stepping back

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,280
being able to see the thoughts without

73
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,120
getting lost into them

74
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,360
or to see anything really that bodily

75
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,640
sensations or emotions

76
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,799
or is this so being able to step back

77
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,720
in some kind of way is just a

78
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,720
characteristic in general

79
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,840
of how we can go a little bit deeper

80
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,519
with our meditation

81
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,159
and how we can a little bit more

82
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,040
steadiness

83
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,440
or solidity or something like this

84
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,920
so this idea of knowing what is taking

85
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,640
place

86
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,720
rather than just being immersed in it

87
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,560
sometimes in guided meditation i talk

88
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,840
about to sit and

89
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,720
know you're sitting there's a certain

90
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,840
pulling back when we know that we're

91
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,840
sitting

92
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,959
so there's a few ways that we can

93
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,280
look at i'm using this word mental

94
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,439
activity mental state and

95
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,920
i like to maybe like tease a apart three

96
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,560
different

97
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,680
aspects of this

98
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,199
and the first one is not so common

99
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,960
and maybe it's a little bit debatable

100
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,919
but i'll offer it

101
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,280
and that is in the suta that is the

102
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,520
discourse on the establishments of

103
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,320
mindfulness

104
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,680
there's some qualities of the mind

105
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,320
that it says is good to notice helpful

106
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,440
to notice

107
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,360
and one is whether the mind is

108
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,160
surpassable

109
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,320
or not surpassable so the presence or

110
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,800
absence of

111
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,360
surpassability if that's word

112
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,040
what does this mean so

113
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,840
there are some hints we might get if we

114
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,479
look at

115
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,240
the parallels that are preserved in

116
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,520
chinese

117
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,880
for the satipatanosuta and there

118
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,759
the word gets translated as cultivated

119
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,320
or not

120
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,759
cultivated so

121
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,080
one way we might understand this are

122
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,680
probably a few ways but

123
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,960
one way we might understand this is

124
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,080
whether this is our usual state of mind

125
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,759
or a more mindful state of mind

126
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,720
sometimes i think about this or refer to

127
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,240
this as it's more like street

128
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,840
consciousness

129
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,320
i'm just making up this term what i use

130
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,600
this kind of walking around

131
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,800
not being mindful versus being mindful

132
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,360
we i don't know how to describe this but

133
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,199
i think you know what i mean

134
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,000
like we know when we're being mindful

135
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,600
when we're not being mindful

136
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,360
we don't know of course we don't know

137
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,639
so not only that to know whether we're

138
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,720
being mindful but to also know

139
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,520
is there a general feeling like oh yeah

140
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,319
okay

141
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,120
i recognize this mental state this is

142
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,440
what it feels like

143
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,720
to be more settled

144
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,560
or this is what it feels like at the

145
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,360
beginning of a meditation period

146
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,960
and after i've been sitting for a little

147
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,479
while i

148
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,280
believe it'll be different so is it

149
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,919
surpassable or not surpassable

150
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,479
that is is this the edge of our

151
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,520
meditation practice

152
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,919
or is it the beginning there's is it

153
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:36,800
ways we're

154
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,000
in still in the process of getting

155
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,479
settled

156
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,759
so is this familiar territory or new

157
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,919
territory and this not so much that we

158
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,599
have to always be inquiring um

159
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,319
do i have some attainment am i in some

160
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,120
new place

161
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,000
all the time but so it's not an

162
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,960
obsession

163
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,919
with our progress or our development or

164
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,639
how far we've gotten

165
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,680
but it's just this uh recognizing where

166
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,840
we are

167
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,840
so that we can

168
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,520
know what what to expect maybe what

169
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,800
comes next or

170
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,120
how we might if we know that there's

171
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,240
some

172
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,840
it's possible to get deeper more settled

173
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,120
i'm using these

174
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,800
words more settled deeper

175
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,720
then we might know that oh yeah there's

176
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,479
can be a little bit more letting go that

177
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,560
can happen

178
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,680
there can be a little bit more quieting

179
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,000
that

180
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,599
can happen so that we can

181
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,879
walk this middle way between not having

182
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:51,759
this

183
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,319
excessive expectations like that's

184
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,479
supposed to be a particular way

185
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,520
but also we don't want to have any

186
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,479
disdain

187
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,199
for using reference points that we have

188
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,720
with our practice

189
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,840
or maybe even some aspirations

190
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,360
we might have for our practice

191
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,039
so that might be the first aspect

192
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,919
of our mental activity or mental state

193
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,639
is just

194
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,759
this very gentle maybe

195
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,400
it's not even worth them highlighting

196
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,160
but to acknowledge there's a gentle

197
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,599
acknowledgement

198
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,280
of where we are in the territory in the

199
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,959
landscape of

200
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,320
meditation so to speak

201
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,200
a second way that we might notice the

202
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,120
interior experience the mental state

203
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,160
is to be aware of this

204
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,040
state of mind or we could use the

205
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,279
expression mental state

206
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,240
so not the content of the mind so much

207
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,320
but the

208
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,399
quality of the mind the mood of the mind

209
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,279
the state of the mind maybe the attitude

210
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,640
i know sometimes um i have this just

211
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,839
general even

212
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,600
even when not meditating i have this

213
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,040
state of mind like

214
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,240
oh yeah i just can't quite think

215
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,959
i think for whatever reason i don't know

216
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:21,360
why

217
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,600
exactly maybe i'm tired or

218
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,519
feeling frazzled or something like this

219
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,839
and the mental acuity isn't quite there

220
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:30,640
but just

221
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,560
the general kind of state of the mind

222
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,040
and so to step back from the details and

223
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,760
to

224
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,680
notice the greater context or the

225
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,519
meloo in which our mental experience is

226
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,600
happening

227
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,200
so mental states are subtle

228
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,240
and diffuse they're not we can't

229
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,680
pinpoint them necessarily and say

230
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,880
it's here exactly this it's more of a

231
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,079
vague kind of idea or

232
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,880
experience

233
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,720
so this again in some ways can be an

234
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,240
interesting exploration because we might

235
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,120
have this assumption

236
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,600
that to be mindful of something means

237
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,120
that there's some

238
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,519
precision there's some delineation

239
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,399
i'm mindful of this and it has edges and

240
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,839
it's clear and it looks exactly like

241
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,200
this

242
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,279
again this is implicit probably we don't

243
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,000
have that explicit

244
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
but i'd like to suggest that we can also

245
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,959
be mindful of things that are diffuse

246
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,480
and vague maybe foggy

247
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,079
maybe they're just known in the

248
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,480
periphery of our awareness not in the

249
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,519
center of our

250
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,000
awareness a certain a different type of

251
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,440
knowing if you will

252
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,519
and maybe we could use as an example

253
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,079
that

254
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,200
when you're looking at a window

255
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,519
and you realize that the window is

256
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,959
reflecting back

257
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,040
so you can see whatever is being

258
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,200
reflected in the window

259
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,519
and you just shift your gaze or a little

260
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,800
bit and you can also see

261
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,959
out the window so there's two different

262
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,640
views that are possible and

263
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,800
to notice that it's light inside

264
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,240
and dark outside for example

265
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,200
and that's why the window is reflecting

266
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,120
so it's the noticing that it's

267
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,320
light often when you notice that it's

268
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,680
not so much that you

269
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,120
are pointing to one particular

270
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,399
experience or object but there's a

271
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,399
knowing of light

272
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,440
i'm not sure if this is a good example

273
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,800
but it's something like to explore

274
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,399
that there's can be a general feeling or

275
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,760
mood or attitude

276
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,720
and the classical teachings use words

277
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,839
like

278
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:13,120
the mind is constricted or expanded

279
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,240
that is scattered or concentrated

280
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,440
or colored with greed hatred or delusion

281
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,000
or

282
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,639
not colored with greed hatred and

283
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,920
delusion

284
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,800
or fettered or unfettered

285
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,639
so maybe we might use language like

286
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,120
appreciative or wanting more

287
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,440
or calm versus tense

288
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,720
or light-hearted versus critical

289
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,639
or maybe i um an example i gave

290
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,360
earlier feeling like i can't quite think

291
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,560
clearly i can't

292
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,200
feel like i'm maybe there's just a

293
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,120
feeling of

294
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,680
not a lot of mental acuity and sometimes

295
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,320
there is

296
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,120
some mental acuity and then even that

297
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,279
whole idea well what exactly is mental

298
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,880
acuity

299
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,959
so just pointing to the general feeling

300
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,040
of the mind and to recognize that these

301
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,120
states of mind have a more

302
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,399
pervasive and enduring quality

303
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,000
than just particular thoughts

304
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,560
that is we might have angry thoughts

305
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,320
that appear but they the angry thoughts

306
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,000
might just arise and then pass

307
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,120
away but there isn't a general mood of

308
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,959
anger there might just be a flicker of

309
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,760
irritation

310
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,440
in contrast when we're when we are in in

311
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:45,760
an

312
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,680
angry mood they're just everything

313
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,720
we feel just a little bit cranky and

314
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,920
irritated with everything this just

315
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,279
general sense but we're not

316
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,760
really angry with everything because in

317
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,720
the midst of that

318
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,279
we might be having thoughts of oh gee i

319
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,079
wonder what's

320
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:11,600
uh for lunch where are my glasses

321
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,639
is it time for me to get onto that zoom

322
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:15,279
call

323
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,720
you know we're having all kinds of

324
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,959
completely neutral thoughts

325
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,920
even though there might be this general

326
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,800
mood

327
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,240
of anger that might be colored

328
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,959
by anger

329
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,720
so it's possible to completely ignore

330
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,320
the mind state we don't have to pay

331
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,760
attention to it of course

332
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,120
but i think we all notice when we

333
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,440
wake up on the wrong side of the bed

334
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,079
kind of gives us a general mood

335
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,279
that it does have an impact on us

336
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,800
and often the more aware that we are of

337
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,920
what's influencing our thinking

338
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,120
our behavior the more we can make

339
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,279
decisions about

340
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,639
how authoritative we're going to

341
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,199
take to be our thoughts are we going to

342
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,480
believe everything or

343
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,000
are we just going to notice yeah i'm

344
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,760
cranky right now

345
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,639
maybe if you're that half of the human

346
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,160
population that

347
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,360
hormone cycle and monthly it might be

348
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:19,920
noticing

349
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,639
yeah okay having these types of thoughts

350
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,959
right now they don't have to be so

351
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,639
authoritative i don't have to believe

352
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,199
them or give them as much weight as

353
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,000
i might at other times when my hormones

354
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,120
are in a different state

355
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,600
so that's the second way is just this

356
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,880
kind of vague

357
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,959
mood or color of the mind

358
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,240
state that tends to be

359
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,519
a little bit uh maybe um

360
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,639
not obvious and

361
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,399
enduring and then a third

362
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,480
aspect of the of what's in the mind

363
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,800
we might call generally mental activity

364
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,839
or maybe more specifically

365
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,160
thoughts but there's a

366
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,199
whole range of things that we

367
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,399
fall under the word uh mental activity

368
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,440
or maybe even

369
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,920
thoughts kind of lump them together but

370
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,959
there's a range

371
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,480
in terms of how compelling they are

372
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,000
how lost we are in them

373
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,600
and maybe the energy or the

374
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,279
movement that's behind them that we

375
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,759
might get really

376
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,920
might be a pressure really to think

377
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,240
about them

378
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,680
there's also a whole range into of terms

379
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,800
of the wholesome or

380
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,079
unwholesomeness

381
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,680
some things that are clearly if we're

382
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,759
having a lot of thoughts of

383
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,879
wanting to cause harm

384
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,079
there's it's very different of wishing

385
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:00,639
to

386
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,199
end the suffering of somebody thoughts

387
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,240
of how you might

388
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,400
help them find greater peace and freedom

389
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,918
and then there's a whole range in the

390
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,240
middle

391
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,918
so mental activities yet one more way

392
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:18,798
that we

393
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,678
can pay attention and this these are

394
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,760
associated with the best of the human

395
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,839
experience and the worst of the human

396
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,240
experience

397
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,760
and when unattended just like

398
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,440
our mental state our mental activity

399
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,240
can have such a big impact on us

400
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,679
so i'm making this distinction between

401
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,679
mental state and mental activity

402
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,520
some could argue that maybe we don't

403
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,039
need to but

404
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,960
i find it helpful in meditation practice

405
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,120
to make this distinction

406
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,520
but notice that often the instruction is

407
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,039
to settle or let go or calm

408
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,200
mental activity there isn't the

409
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,960
instruction that we have to get

410
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,520
rid of eliminate mental activity

411
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,840
because meditation doesn't always

412
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,360
require that we have this

413
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,160
thought free mind a thought free mind is

414
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,120
possible

415
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,039
but that happens but usually in a

416
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,960
retreat setting when the mind is

417
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,200
really settled really quiet

418
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,360
so we doesn't have to make the fact that

419
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:35,919
there are

420
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,880
thoughts doesn't have to be a problem we

421
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,840
can

422
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,080
let go of this idea that somehow we have

423
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,480
to be getting rid of our thoughts

424
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,039
and instead just how can we work with

425
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,440
them if they're arising how can we

426
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,360
disrupt some of the momentum how can we

427
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,640
disrupt some of the unwholesomeness if

428
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,160
they are there and sometimes just simply

429
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,320
paying attention to the

430
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,880
experience of thinking

431
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,600
that is as i did in the guided

432
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,280
meditation

433
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,000
are these thoughts are they images or

434
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,480
are they

435
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,760
sounds and just having that gentle

436
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,760
inquiry can be a way that

437
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,840
takes some of the momentum away from the

438
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,480
thoughts and that might be sufficient

439
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,120
to allow the thoughts to just arise and

440
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,000
pass away

441
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,880
like thoughts do

442
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,720
another way is to bring

443
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,120
awareness to the sensations of the body

444
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,280
and when and or

445
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,240
any sensations that are pleasant there

446
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,160
might be a feeling of ease

447
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,400
or openness or

448
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,880
some sense of well-being or okayness

449
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,240
that's anchored in the body so i'm

450
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,000
talking about okayness

451
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,120
and ease and one could argue that there

452
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,760
those

453
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,880
also can be mental states

454
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,200
and if one can rest in them by all means

455
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,039
we can do that but often

456
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,679
it's easier to rest in physical

457
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:26,720
experiences of ease and

458
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,000
well-being and certainly in the as i

459
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,760
mentioned in the anapanasati

460
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,640
suta as well as the satipatanos

461
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,039
mindfulness of breathing or

462
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,240
foundations of mindfulness

463
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,080
they is this instructions on

464
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,919
mindfulness of the body and mindfulness

465
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,799
of breathing before the mind

466
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,840
so we can always just go back to

467
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,520
mindfulness of the body

468
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,200
or mindfulness of breathing

469
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
if we find that our thoughts have a lot

470
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,720
of

471
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,600
energy behind them or find that they're

472
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,960
unwholesome

473
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,760
maybe we can disrupt them or undermine

474
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,280
some of the

475
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,559
energy underneath them by just

476
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:16,799
being with sensations of the body

477
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,080
especially if there's any some

478
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,840
sensations that are associated with

479
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,600
well-being or happiness

480
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,840
or some contentment

481
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,280
so maybe just an emphasis um on rather

482
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,720
than having to get rid

483
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,080
of our thoughts we can just have a focus

484
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,799
on what's

485
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,400
helpful and what's unhelpful

486
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,720
what's wholesome and what's unwholesome

487
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,080
what's skillful and

488
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,919
unskillful and maybe to steer the

489
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,039
thoughts

490
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,679
steer some of the mental energy towards

491
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,440
what might be more wholesome more

492
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,919
helpful

493
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,799
so in order to do this there might be a

494
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:01,280
few

495
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,200
tools we can use and the buddha he uses

496
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,320
a simile

497
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,280
which i appreciate that there might be a

498
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,080
peg

499
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,600
that is in some wood

500
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,720
but um we might imagine that it's

501
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,919
and the buddha says you might want to

502
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,000
remove this peg

503
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,039
and in my mind i'm thinking those dowels

504
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,200
like when you're using ikea furniture

505
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,320
that you're

506
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,960
using to join different uh pieces

507
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,760
together

508
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,799
so something like that

509
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,600
and this buddha simile says that if you

510
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,440
want to replace a peg

511
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,960
that is in wood that you use a

512
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,000
smaller peg and you can

513
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,120
tap it out so if you

514
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,159
if the dowel if the peg is

515
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,600
rotting and you want to replace it

516
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,400
if you want to not have rotting peg

517
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,480
anymore you can replace it with one that

518
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,600
is

519
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,799
fresher and the word in the

520
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,919
similar uses to replace a coarse one

521
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,799
use a finer one so if you were doing the

522
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,799
dowels with ikea furniture of course

523
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,720
you would use a little bit of a smaller

524
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,840
dough to

525
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,880
tap out using a hammer tap

526
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,480
out the the coarser one maybe that was a

527
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,240
complicated explanation of

528
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,960
what was obvious and didn't need that

529
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,880
explanation but the point here is

530
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,320
to replace thoughts

531
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,600
replace unwholesome thoughts with

532
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,880
more wholesome ones

533
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,039
so one might be

534
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,278
to

535
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,000
chant the refuges and precepts if you

536
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,480
find

537
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,559
that your thoughts just feel like they

538
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:53,760
have this a lot of

539
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,559
energy and there's a um

540
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,080
you're feeling stuck with this

541
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,240
compulsive going round and around not

542
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,720
really going anywhere

543
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,360
we chant the refuges and precepts that

544
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:07,919
can be

545
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,640
uplifting and gives the mind something

546
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,760
to do

547
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,919
and really can support a sense of

548
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,000
openness and ease

549
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,520
of course don't do it if it doesn't

550
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,679
support a sense of openness and ease

551
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,240
if you find that there are some thoughts

552
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,720
of ill will

553
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,320
revenge or wanting to

554
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,240
give somebody a piece of your mind or

555
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,480
something like this

556
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,640
something that i've done is chanting the

557
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,360
meta suit in my mind

558
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,080
i memorized it and it was a great

559
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,520
support to

560
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,720
use it as a tool to to be chanting the

561
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,200
metasuta

562
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,520
and just the practice of memorizing it

563
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,640
was really

564
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,000
helpful so

565
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,679
i offer this as something that can be

566
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,279
helpful to kind of replace some

567
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,760
unwholesome thoughts

568
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,200
or if not chanting the metasuta

569
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,159
then to just do some loving-kindness

570
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:08,720
practice

571
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,159
bring to mind the phrases of

572
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,840
loving-kindness and

573
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,520
to do them in a way that is

574
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,000
easy and available and accessible

575
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,640
that is not towards the person for whom

576
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,200
you're

577
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,520
having some ill will but towards a

578
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,880
lovable being

579
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,919
send some good will some benevolence

580
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,120
to a lovable being

581
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,600
so those are some thoughts of some

582
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,760
ways in which you might replace some

583
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,159
unwholesome thoughts associated with um

584
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,200
ill will if you're finding that you're

585
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,360
stuck with some lustful thoughts some

586
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,640
sensual desire that is just not helpful

587
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,640
we can do meditation on body parts

588
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,640
this is what the buddha recommends for

589
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,480
the monastics right to have a life of

590
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,240
celibacy

591
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,960
and i can imagine it's not always easy

592
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,000
to be celibate

593
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,120
so help them and to help all of us

594
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,760
if we're having some thoughts that are

595
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,720
unhelpful and

596
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,360
unwise of sensual thoughts

597
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,679
to think about body parts so usually

598
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,039
when we think about

599
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,200
people's appearances we think about that

600
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,480
as a whole

601
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,559
this person's attractive this person is

602
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,080
attractive but we they become

603
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,520
less attractive if we

604
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,600
consider their body parts for example

605
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,400
from somebody who's a model for

606
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,360
shampoo for example and has beautiful

607
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,159
lustrous

608
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,440
hair it becomes

609
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,960
less attractive if you imagine that it's

610
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,039
chopped off and on your dining room

611
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,440
table

612
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,559
it's the same hair but just to consider

613
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,080
it by itself

614
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,520
kind of shifts our relationship to it

615
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,400
so many of you may know that there's

616
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,640
this practice of doing the 32 parts of

617
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,120
the body

618
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,679
it starts with head hairs body hairs

619
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:22,240
nails

620
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,279
teeth skin flesh spleen

621
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,640
phlegm spittle snot and urine and it

622
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,679
continues

623
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,520
so right when you start considering all

624
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,320
these things have a person

625
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,679
then that really can shift your

626
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,679
relationship to them

627
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,840
so this is another practice somebody

628
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,880
might want to consider

629
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,120
something else that we might do rather

630
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,760
than

631
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,880
to replace our thoughts is just to say

632
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,520
you know i'm going to think about this

633
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,720
later

634
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,159
right now i'm meditating

635
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,240
and it might need to have some energy

636
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,679
behind it

637
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,760
no i'm not going to do this right now

638
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,600
right now i'm going to meditate i'm

639
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,120
going to bring my attention to the

640
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,679
breath

641
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,200
for example and just to say

642
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,720
later later not that we're never going

643
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,240
to think about it

644
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,559
but just now is not the time

645
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,080
so now that's a

646
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,440
the third way we can think about mental

647
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,320
activity and mental states is to notice

648
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,080
our thoughts

649
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,080
and then not so much that we have to get

650
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,679
rid of them

651
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,159
but can we encourage thoughts that are

652
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,720
wholesome and supportive

653
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,520
and one way to do that is to replace

654
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,320
thoughts

655
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,520
to use a tool and of course if it's

656
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,880
not helpful we don't use tools not to

657
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,240
use it

658
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,320
so these are things just to if we find

659
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,000
that we're stuck and we

660
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,159
need something other than just returning

661
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,760
to the breath

662
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,720
we need something other than just being

663
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,440
with the body

664
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,440
so i just offer this as some ways to

665
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,399
work with our interior experience or

666
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,840
mental experience to notice

667
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,720
the mind state as well as to notice

668
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,600
where we are

669
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,360
in our settling process in our

670
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,120
meditation process as support

671
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,559
that supports for more ease

672
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,679
more freedom so that

673
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,720
can support our being present not only

674
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,760
for ourselves but for others

675
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,880
so that our practice can be for the

676
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,640
benefit of

677
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,000
perhaps in one small way for the benefit

678
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,279
of all beings everywhere

679
00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:01,760
thank you
