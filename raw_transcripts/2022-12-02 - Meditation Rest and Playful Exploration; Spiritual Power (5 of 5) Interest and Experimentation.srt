4
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:29,279
warmth that you all share with each other it's really meaningful it's really meaningful

5
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:35,460
to be here so we're right at the top of the hour so I'm gonna go ahead and start Us in the

6
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,980
meditation just

7
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:47,579
introducing some playfulness experimentation this

8
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:55,199
morning so to notice whatever feelings are happening whatever mood whatever

9
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:02,340
excitement or emotions are happening from engaging with each other or if you've

10
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:09,420
just arrived and you're not seeing chap noticing where you're at just noticing

11
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,618
the internal weather

12
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:22,880
the sense of familiarity being here or of newness if it's new for you

13
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,740
and finding a comfortable posture a balance of

14
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,960
relaxation and alertness

15
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:41,939
adjusting anything that needs to adjust for your comfort you'd be rocking back and forth in your

16
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:47,880
seats wherever you're sitting and finding balance

17
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,860
an internal balance

18
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:02,360
[Music] and allowing any excess tension

19
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,798
just to fade away on the out breath

20
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:17,660
and attuning to an overall sense of your body

21
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:24,800
your body immersed in this moment immersed in whatever weather is outside

22
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:33,680
contact of skin on air air on skin

23
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,959
and from the inside the contact of breath

24
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:49,940
gently soothingly stretching a diaphragm the belly

25
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,060
perhaps movements moving the rib cage

26
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,040
or chest ever so slightly

27
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:14,360
perhaps Sensations in the nostrils or at the top of the lip

28
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:23,000
feeling the warmth the warmth of the breath Within

29
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,599
and perhaps coolness as air becomes breath

30
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,440
from the outside

31
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:50,840
taking a moment to scan through the whole body

32
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:59,060
acknowledging in a friendly way possible whatever's there today

33
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:12,200
perhaps areas of heaviness or lightness

34
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,858
movement or Stillness

35
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:30,540
foreign go

36
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,880
and inviting to sweep through your whole body

37
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:46,880
inviting a softening the balance of relaxation and alertness

38
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:08,240
settling the attention on whatever

39
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:15,740
object or anchor of attention is most comfortable for you

40
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:22,400
my instructions will be on breathing mindfulness and breathing

41
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:31,320
for the most part and the invitation is to use what works for

42
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,960
you playing with it experiment

43
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:51,380
bringing awareness to the Forefront of experience

44
00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:01,400
allowing other concerns then and there

45
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,940
to fade to the background

46
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:36,680
noticing any soothing qualities or pleasure

47
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,800
even just a sense of aliveness on the in-breath

48
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,879
and out breath

49
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,120
resting

50
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,759
experimenting

51
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,639
experimenting with how it feels to place the attention

52
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:30,319
more firmly or more lightly on the sensations of breathing

53
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,280
which brings more satisfaction

54
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:09,680
noticing the differences between the beginning of the inhale

55
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:17,300
and the fullness of the lungs at the top of the inhale

56
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:31,580
noticing the release the beginning of the exhale

57
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,839
the feeling all the way through the exhale

58
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:47,000
to that letting go that moment of Stillness

59
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:54,240
at the end of the exhale prior to the next natural allowing

60
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,140
of an in-breath

61
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:21,560
encouraging continuous contact

62
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,180
of attention and breathing

63
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:36,800
in an open allowing spaceships kind of way

64
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,360
foreign

65
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:17,660
most of the remainder of this meditation will be in silence

66
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:25,940
the encouragement is to play with

67
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:32,940
how you engage with the breath the moment Sensations

68
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:40,140
lightly to maximize a sense of immersion in this

69
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,620
meditation

70
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,560
and when that sense if that sense of immersion emerges

71
00:10:52,560 --> 00:11:01,680
to rest allow ride the wave until it makes sense

72
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,820
to bring a little bit of experimentation in again

73
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,040
foreign

74
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:45,260
and for the last few minutes of this meditation

75
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:55,100
opening opening the awareness up to the overall flow of experience

76
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:01,080
perhaps still maintaining contacts

77
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:05,299
with breathing the body

78
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,940
allowing the flow of Sensations

79
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:19,039
moved our atmospherics of the heart and mind

80
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:25,640
arising flowing and passing away and

81
00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:32,240
mental phenomena sound

82
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:40,919
opening up and allowing a global sense the overall

83
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:44,419
inner processes

84
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:49,760
stepping back

85
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,100
foreign

86
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:57,380
taking a moment to notice again the overall internal weather

87
00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:05,279
sense of heart mind especially observing any

88
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:09,620
corners of experience

89
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,320
that are Pleasant peaceful

90
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:22,559
any good qualities that may have been cultivated

91
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:32,419
perhaps patient or awareness the touch of immersion their stability

92
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,799
and tuning into your heart

93
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:50,520
setting the intention to share these benefits this goodness

94
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:56,778
with those this life touches

95
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:07,340
perhaps with an internal gesture of offering

96
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:16,460
wishing others well as close and near or far and wide

97
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:21,500
as it feels right to send those missions

98
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:36,799
we have the benefits of our practice here together be shared with all beings

99
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:46,039
may all beings be saved may all beings be happy

100
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,760
may all beings be healing or healthy

101
00:30:53,820 --> 00:31:00,380
may they be peaceful and may they be free

102
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,320
foreign

103
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:52,259
thank you for the sincerity of your practice [Music]

104
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,960
foreign

105
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:41,299
so good morning again Sangha

106
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:50,159
today the topic is interest and experimentation in practice

107
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:57,360
this is the fifth in a five part series on a teaching the Buddha talk the basis

108
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:04,140
the steps or fundamentals to develop spiritual power and

109
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:10,640
meditative success a list of known as the idipada

110
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:17,880
and the poly for interest and experimentation is the Mansa

111
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:23,000
v i m a m s a

112
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:28,500
and today I'll cover two main points about this and then kind of briefly

113
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:36,000
review how this quality of Interest exploration investigation that's sometimes called

114
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:43,820
fits in with the other bases or enthusiasm or desire

115
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:52,559
um Veria energy or effort or mind and of course the two tripod

116
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:59,100
legs that have been with each species all along which is wholehearted engagement

117
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:05,000
and collectiveness immersion concentration

118
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:12,240
so the two main points are to be a

119
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:17,339
naturalist of the inner Ecology of your body heart

120
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:25,200
and mind In This Moment and second that there's an art and the science

121
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:31,980
and the encouragement is to be curious kind of Applied curiosity to be

122
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:37,440
experimental and to notice action and results

123
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,658
inputs and outputs but before I get into those points

124
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:48,060
first let's explore the range of meanings of this Factor

125
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:54,480
kind of a word cloud as I've been doing so some of the translations

126
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,580
or vimansa are experimentation

127
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:07,020
consideration and as I see these consider feel into

128
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:13,880
how they land in your body your heart your mind what associations they bring

129
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:20,760
considering that investigation

130
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:26,940
discernment close examination

131
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:33,859
active intelligence empirical inquiry

132
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:40,800
applied curiosity creative exploration

133
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,420
and receptive interest

134
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,460
so as with the sort of ingredients of all the other bases

135
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:58,320
practicing with this interest experimentation is on a Continuum it

136
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,839
depends on the other conditions in the practice in our lives in any

137
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:10,020
given session in any given day we there's an active end which is kind of

138
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:16,440
like the experimentation and the close investigation all the way through sort of a gentle

139
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:21,540
creative exploration or applied curiosity

140
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:28,700
to a more receptive end does this open allowing interest

141
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:36,960
any and all of these can be appropriate in a given meditation session and as the practice gains momentum at

142
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:44,460
different points whether it's over the course of years or on a long retreat it tends to be wiser to move towards the

143
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:51,839
more open and receptive end at a certain point the practice kind of does us you might have noticed this

144
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:57,619
occasionally where there's just this sense of coasting right

145
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:04,980
so in experimenting with experimentation

146
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:10,020
it's helped helpful as I mentioned earlier earlier to observe your

147
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:17,339
experience like a naturalist like a scientist and I'm remembering an anecdote someone

148
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:22,440
um said in a Dharma talk in the past year I can't remember who

149
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:27,540
they were walking hiking and on the hiking trail they ran across

150
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:36,180
someone who was just I think they were actually lying down on the earth and just closely examining this plant

151
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:42,900
and as they encountered each other on the path the um the hiker said hello and the

152
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:49,680
scientists the naturalist just looked up with this expression of lit up Joy about

153
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:56,760
the discovery they were making so that's part of the potential of this

154
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:02,579
close observation that that in itself can build a sense of

155
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:09,300
enthusiasm interest engagement immersion

156
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:15,359
so the key is to observe in this moment

157
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:20,700
it's not so helpful to and for the purposes of meditation it can be very

158
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:28,140
helpful in daily life but the purposes of meditation it's helpful to watch the cause and effect or the inputs and

159
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:33,599
outputs actions and results as we're meditating not so much to think

160
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:42,440
about the stories of the past or planning for the future but to look at those interactions as they're happening

161
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:48,720
it involves observing the details of the object of attention like we talked about

162
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:53,760
I've led us through this morning with the meditation and breathing

163
00:38:53,760 --> 00:39:00,780
in that sense it's like that scientist looking at the details of the foliage of this plant on the ground right

164
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:06,180
or like a bird watcher watching the plumage

165
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:11,820
or the shape flight and song of a particular bird species

166
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:18,180
particular bird there's also this

167
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:24,180
benefit to looking at the overall biosphere or ecosystem

168
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:29,520
how the body and mind are relating to each other in the moment how the whole

169
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:35,339
system is interacting oh when I take this longer breath

170
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:42,660
my my back relaxes or when I exhale in this way

171
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:48,020
there's a subtle sense of pleasure in the chest

172
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:53,779
so to notice notice these relationships

173
00:39:55,619 --> 00:40:02,099
there's an art and a science to this this is the second point and so

174
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:08,339
to be creative be playful be experimental at times I think of it as running these little testable

175
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:15,000
experiments or like an artist mixing different colors on the palette and just seeing how they

176
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:22,260
work seeing how the brush stroke works so in the moment this can be like

177
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:28,920
fiddling with a recipe adding a touch of seasoning while cooking or turning up or down the heat

178
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:36,060
and tasting noticing the effects many results though as all of you know

179
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:44,040
by now I'm sure unfold over time so patience is really really helpful

180
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:51,060
it's um more like that simile of the garden

181
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:58,200
changing the conditions a little plowing in a bit more mulch or fertilizer changing the watering regimen and

182
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:03,300
noticing the shifts over the days in the plant and then noticing at the end of

183
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:08,599
the season the difference in the fruits the yield

184
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:18,900
so um meditation many of the true benefits take

185
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:25,980
a season or more right to ripen there is though

186
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:31,980
a big place for this more closely related feedback I guess I'll say and

187
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:37,859
this is more feedback in the sense of instantaneous or close

188
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:45,359
noticing of results it's like the action reflection action model of learning and this is used in

189
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:53,339
many fields including in spiritual counseling field I do which is to do something

190
00:41:53,339 --> 00:41:58,800
to reflect on it and then tweak what you do the next time

191
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,680
and notice the results reflect on it again

192
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:10,200
there's also a real benefit every now and then just stepping back

193
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:18,359
and looking at the big picture whether it's how the practice is affecting the overall mood or tone and mind heart and

194
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:25,920
body in the moment in one session at the end of a session but also every now and then to look at

195
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:31,560
how focusing meditation is affecting my life your life

196
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:38,040
and adjust a just course appropriately I had the great benefit the first year I

197
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:44,220
practiced I think it was I didn't know any better I didn't know anything was supposed to happen when sitting

198
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:50,900
so what kept me going was the difference in how I was showing up and experiencing the rest of my life

199
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:56,460
with huge changes but they were changes they felt good

200
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:01,460
more relaxed a little happier and more aware

201
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:09,359
so in some ways this quality of overall

202
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:15,740
observation curiosity interest experimentation

203
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:21,300
Loops back to apply to all of the other bases that we've talked about this week

204
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:27,060
right noticing the overall

205
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:34,200
way these species are developing and how each one is showing up that is a

206
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:38,060
kind of Investigation or interest

207
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:45,599
the Buddha made two other overall suggestions he made a number but I'm going to focus on two

208
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:54,599
who are relating to these species for Spiritual power one is with each quality desire or

209
00:43:54,599 --> 00:44:00,660
Chanda varia or effort s subjective sense of Mind heart and

210
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:06,480
investigation itself to notice to Slack

211
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,359
or two tense like tuning that guitar

212
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:17,460
it should be neither two sac and we're too tense a tunic to tune it

213
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:23,880
and then the other is to have it neither be internally contracted

214
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:31,560
or externally distracted so those are two kind of shortcuts you

215
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:39,480
can bring to any quality in meditation really two tenths two Slack

216
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:46,619
too constricted or obsessive to distracted and Scattered

217
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:53,838
or is it just right or even in the range of just right

218
00:44:55,079 --> 00:45:02,280
so each meditation each process in this

219
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:08,040
journey you step in this journey of cultivating heart and mind invites us

220
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:14,579
to learn receive adapt I just want to invite you to enjoy it

221
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:21,900
when possible be playful or hold it lightly and to be with it with patience sense of

222
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:29,940
connection so this is the idipada

223
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:36,420
the basis for Spiritual power and I just also want to acknowledge in

224
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:44,400
closing that these teachings tend to emphasize more doing than a lot of mindfulness teachings

225
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:49,440
so please keep in mind thank God that these doings these

226
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:55,260
explorations tend to unfold best in a field of

227
00:45:55,260 --> 00:46:00,440
relaxation and ease and Trust in the process

228
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:07,859
so may these bases of spiritual power invite you Empower you to deepen and enjoy your

229
00:46:07,859 --> 00:46:15,319
practice thank you so much it's been a joy to be with you
