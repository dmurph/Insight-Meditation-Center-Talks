1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:10,280
so good morning or afternoon or evening let's go ahead and get started

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:19,160
together so let's begin with the meditation finding a posture that

3
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,840
is upright and also

4
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:31,960
relaxed allowing yourself to settle in

5
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:42,760
finding some balance the place where you're

6
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,879
sitting and just allowing yourself to be

7
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,878
supported by what you're sitting

8
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:06,159
on sometimes times we try to hold ourselves up in some

9
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:15,439
way but just softening and allowing yourself to be

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,720
supported aligning the posture so that your spine feels

11
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:31,920
straight and relaxed

12
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:42,680
closing the eyes gently that's comfortable for

13
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:01,840
you it's often in the eyes in the eye sockets

14
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,479
softening down through the neck and

15
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:16,800
shoulders releasing chest the

16
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,720
belly the arms the

17
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:31,680
legs having a sense of willingness and also trust in being

18
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,799
here in the present

19
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,680
moment bringing the mindfulness into the foreground the awareness of the present

20
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:05,080
moment perhaps even with a sense of curiosity

21
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,680
how is

22
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:25,040
this turning in particularly to the sensations of the

23
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:31,760
body sitting or perhaps you're lying down or even standing

24
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:45,879
ing this bily form that has supported us throughout

25
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:58,480
life we can notice that there's a mixture of Sensations in the

26
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:05,040
body letting go of Concepts like back or

27
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:13,920
knees or belly or head now moving into the sensations

28
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:23,239
themselves Sensations like heat or

29
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,120
coolness various kinds of flowing

30
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:38,080
feelings hardness tension

31
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:46,919
softness even some Sensations that may not be easy to put words

32
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:53,758
on as we're not maybe used to articulating them that's

33
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:06,039
fine just allowing your attention to move through the

34
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:13,800
body and notice if there are any areas of obvious holding

35
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,400
or habitual tipness that that might be

36
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:27,240
eased not as an engineering

37
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,160
project but simply out of gentle

38
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,880
interest in being in the present moment in a softt

39
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:04,120
way and if we find that there are some places that are not so easy to

40
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:12,160
soften or release then we let go of worrying about

41
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:20,639
that we also allow the mind to be with the body in soft and gentle

42
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
way

43
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:05,639
e and turning also to

44
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:12,360
include the mental and emotional and spiritual factors that are present

45
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:18,800
things in the mind noticing if there

46
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:26,439
are thoughts and feelings going

47
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:33,720
on that may be Rel relatively quiet or there may be a lot going on in the mind

48
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:39,160
it's all fine just

49
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:44,840
noticing how much activity what kind of moods and emotions

50
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,159
are

51
00:07:53,159 --> 00:08:01,440
present sensing again into whether there seems to be any tension or tight

52
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,479
witness habitual pushing associated with how the mind is right

53
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:14,680
now and inviting some easing or releasing or

54
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,400
softening also in the

55
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:35,279
mind and it's done without a sense of judgment that anything there is

56
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:42,719
wrong shouldn't be happening but again just out of a gentle sense of being

57
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,399
present in soft easy mindful way so we

58
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,720
align with being here and seeing

59
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
this

60
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,240
orienting the mind around Letting

61
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,360
Go letting go of tensions in the body letting go

62
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:34,959
of tensions in the mind in favor of a simple

63
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:42,240
awareness even if what we're aware of is pain or painful

64
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,600
emotion there's a way to let go of entanglement with that and

65
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,000
just be with it so letting

66
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
be

67
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

68
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

69
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,639
it actually takes some active interest and

70
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,639
engagement to let things

71
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:24,279
be if we're too vadal about

72
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:31,240
that the mind can be hijacked or get

73
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,399
so so bringing our careful [Music]

74
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,120
attention a soft

75
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:52,330
way finding just that middle point where we can be with

76
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:57,880
[Music] things without either pushing on them

77
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:04,680
trying to do something or falling away from them because we're

78
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:11,808
not quite connected where is that perfect Middle [Music]

79
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
Point

80
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
e

81
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
e

82
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

83
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:22,199
and when we find that a distraction has captured the mind in some

84
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:27,319
way and we simply let go of

85
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:34,079
that and so let let go of any judgment that arises around

86
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:41,120
that if it does Catch and

87
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,880
Release Catch and Release each

88
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:05,079
time was fostering a simple relationship with

89
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:08,199
the flow of

90
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
experience

91
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

92
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

93
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

94
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

95
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

96
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

97
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

98
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

99
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

100
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

101
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

102
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

103
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:03,760
there is wedding be there is Letting

104
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:08,679
Go and there is letting

105
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:16,799
flow letting experience Flow In and Out become more and less

106
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:23,760
intense letting attention be sharp or

107
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:34,679
Broad it's neither active nor

108
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:44,360
passive this way of simple

109
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
presence

110
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

111
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

112
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

113
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

114
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

115
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

116
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

117
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

118
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:20,599
as we sit in [Music]

119
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:27,159
meditation with an intention of having this very simple relationship to

120
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:33,159
experience letting go of complexity and

121
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:38,320
entanglement when they occur we can sense that this is a

122
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:43,320
beautiful way that we could also be in the

123
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:51,039
world it's not passivity because there's this

124
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:56,360
engagement known what's present noticing when the mind is

125
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:01,960
starting to get hooked so that we can let go we can be in the world this way

126
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:07,519
too generally flowing along but staying

127
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:16,519
connected and checking if we're getting pulled in to wanting or aversion or

128
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:25,080
irritation or judgment or ego and having the intention if we can

129
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:31,399
to relax that complication allowing us to stay simply

130
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:37,080
present which makes us more responsive and also more empathic with

131
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:45,799
other people more able to help if we're not

132
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:52,640
complicated and so the Letting Go internally is also a

133
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:58,600
generosity externally it's a generous way way of

134
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:04,799
being with others one that's not focused on

135
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:10,320
ourself we included we're part of the [Music]

136
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:16,519
whole but we're not acting as a gravitational Center of

137
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:23,080
holding things toward us great generosity of presence without

138
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:28,600
entanglement is quite beautiful maybe we can't maintain it all

139
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:34,039
the time but it can be an intention that guides our way of being

140
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:42,000
in the world and when we practice as we have during this meditation session we

141
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,840
strengthen that ability in the world bringing benefit to many others

142
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,320
not just

143
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,039
oursel

144
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:30,519
so we continue with these four

145
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:37,480
foundations that are both simple and strong enough to lead all the way to

146
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:43,799
Liberation the Buddha offered these four foundations of practice to a monk who

147
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:48,960
was so devoted to the Buddha's teachings that he had ordained with one of the

148
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,240
Buddha's followers without even yet having met the Buddha and he had been

149
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:01,600
practicing very diligently on his own and they're valuable for us because

150
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:07,240
they're simple to begin and they lead very deep if we stick with

151
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:12,320
[Music] them so we've talked about not

152
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:17,919
neglecting wisdom and about preserving truth and

153
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:25,639
these can be done right now in a straightforward way and then they can also be done very deeply or thoroughly

154
00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:33,760
keep going so today we'll talk about the third one it's it's usually translated

155
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:39,440
as cultivating relinquishment but the word that's

156
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:46,480
translated as relinquishment there is chaga which actually covers a broad

157
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:52,720
range of meaning it does mean relinquishment or letting go or giving

158
00:31:52,720 --> 00:32:00,240
up um it also means generosity so chaga is the movement of

159
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:07,760
Mind behind Donna literal act of giving in order to give we have to

160
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:14,000
release our holding of something so that we can give it so chaga is generosity it

161
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,279
goes with the act of giving so it's interesting to me that

162
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:25,240
there's this one word that spans a whole range from offering to pay for a

163
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:33,000
friend's coffee generosity all the way to releasing deep patterns in the mind

164
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:39,320
such as our view of self those are both chaga it's

165
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:45,120
interesting so the possibility here I think is quite amazing and beautiful so

166
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:50,760
if we start with literal acts of generosity in the world and we pay

167
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:56,720
careful attention to what is actually happening that is if we don't neglect

168
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:02,600
wisdom and if we Pres Reserve truth then we're putting the mind on a path toward

169
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:08,440
full Liberation that Letting Go can keep happening more and more

170
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:14,399
deeply and the verb that goes with it is to cultivate this quality of chaga and

171
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:21,039
that same verb can also mean to Foster something or to make it

172
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:28,519
grow so how do we make it grow one way is to notice what the act

173
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:35,639
of Letting Go feels like before during and after we do it and also to notice

174
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:43,440
what gets in the way of letting go those are basic ways of practicing so there's a suta that says

175
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:49,120
that before a beneficial act of giving the mind is

176
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:57,840
glad and during such an act the mind is confident and after such an act the mind

177
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:02,919
is uplifted I love that um so you can

178
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:08,398
notice for yourself when you're making a simple clean totally voluntary

179
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:15,560
offering like handing your partner a cup of tea in the kitchen or helping a child

180
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:21,440
zip up their jacket something really simple um how does the Mind

181
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,720
feel are there good feelings present like gladness and confidence and being

182
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:35,240
uplifted this is something that we can notice in your life you could even notice it today as you go on after this

183
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:41,878
session and when we notice wholesome feelings like that we are automatically

184
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:47,760
fostering this quality of CHA of generosity the heart understands

185
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:54,158
intuitively that this is a good thing to do and when we feel that kind of wholesome happiness we automatically

186
00:34:54,159 --> 00:35:01,359
strengthen it and we make it more likely that we can summon such a feeling even

187
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:07,200
when it's a little bit more difficult like when our irritating coworker asks

188
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:12,960
if we can do some extra printing for them since we're already using the printer right now and our first response

189
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,920
is I know that person is often troubling for

190
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:26,520
me I don't necessarily want to do their printing for them and then then we remember no actually you know I am using

191
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:33,079
the printer right now sure or to print what you need printed or

192
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:39,160
whatever substitute what what it's present in your life in that [Music]

193
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:44,359
realm and then notice also that this teaching says that during the act of

194
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:53,440
giving the Mind feels confident it's an interesting choice so this suggests that we give in a clear

195
00:35:53,440 --> 00:36:00,280
and conscious way not kind of casually or with a distracted mind mind or kind of you know giving with our right hand

196
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:05,520
while looking in some other direction um I remember sitting in a

197
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:12,240
retreat long ago uh with a teacher who said that we might consider engaging

198
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:19,000
with the Dono with the thought may this act of giving support the full liberation of

199
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:25,680
the heart I remember thinking wow you know it really hadn't occurred to me when I

200
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:32,280
put Donna in the bowl when I give at the end of a retreat to have kind of a a

201
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:38,960
thought like that my first impression was it sounded a little bit grandiose you know may this active giving support

202
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:44,040
the full liberation of the heart but as I considered it I realize

203
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:49,920
that giving with that kind of clarity and a powerful intention really would

204
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:55,640
multiply the benefit of the gift um you know we might need to check

205
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:01,440
if there's any conceit in that um but I found actually that having that thought

206
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:07,440
actually made my mind really happy it made it even happier when I was giving and it didn't make it

207
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:14,160
egotistical so may this act of giving support the full liberation of the heart why

208
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:20,160
not so if you're doing this kind of deliberate cultivation of chaga you can

209
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:25,400
have confidence that you're making it easier in the long run to also do the

210
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:31,318
deeper kinds of letting go some of which we can't really do

211
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:39,599
deliberately I sometimes work with people who take on the intention to release certain habits of mind for

212
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:46,359
example complaining was once working with a group um that was their task was

213
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:51,839
to try to avoid complaining for three weeks and just putting this this

214
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:57,599
intention into their minds allow them to make some interesting discoveries uh

215
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:03,319
particular they saw how compulsive complaining can be right so even though

216
00:38:03,319 --> 00:38:08,880
we're intending not to complain it's it has a certain momentum to it one person

217
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:15,680
caught their mind in the act of complaining um but she said in her words

218
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:20,880
I did not stop because it felt too good in the moment but afterward it did not

219
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:27,160
feel good at all can anyone relate to that you catch your mind in the act of

220
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:33,440
do doing something that you know isn't good for it but it feels so good we just

221
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:39,160
see it through yeah I'm going to finish that complaint

222
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:47,240
so it's humbling to see the momentum behind our habits our especially our unskillful ones and we can't necessarily

223
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:53,800
willfully release those but we can learn about them by noticing how they feel so

224
00:38:53,800 --> 00:39:00,440
she did a really good practice there because she noticed that it felt felt good in the moment to be complaining has

225
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:08,800
this hook on it that feels good but then she also noticed that afterward it didn't feel good there was actually some

226
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:14,680
UNH wholesomeness there so when we see this truth of how painful our habits

227
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:20,480
actually are even in the moment even if we can't let go at that moment the heart

228
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:28,200
will want to let go so if we can also investigate for

229
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:33,520
example um what gets in the way of letting go then what we're doing is

230
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:39,200
we're learning about holding on which helps us learn about letting go so it's

231
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:46,680
interesting to notice in our mind that we hold on to things long after they have served their purpose you know do

232
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:53,720
you have any material things that you're holding on to and you don't really need anymore say

233
00:39:53,720 --> 00:40:00,200
in your closet or your garage also attitudes philosophies

234
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:05,920
principles biases self-images habits of

235
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,960
behavior we start noticing you know what is it that we hold on to what what are

236
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:17,079
we carrying around we can admit that some of these things are a little

237
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:22,880
outdated and why is that you know why is that happening maybe out of habit maybe

238
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:29,359
out of laziness maybe reasons we don't even know it's not so important to know

239
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:36,640
precisely why we have these accumulations let's say but it's helpful

240
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:43,000
to Simply feel the tension and the stress of holding on to them and then

241
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:49,760
again the heart will try to find its way out so Letting Go can begin to happen

242
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:57,760
when we really open to the truth that's what we talked about last time this being willing to see what's true and the

243
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:05,520
heart will want to find its way out of any suffering that's unnecessary and we can Marvel at watching this process

244
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:11,920
happen there's a beautiful interplay between seeing what is true and letting

245
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:19,280
go so when we see pley that that grasping whether by greed or by aversion

246
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,359
is painful then the heart is motivated to learn how to let go of that grasping

247
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:30,680
and when we do let go the Mind Settles and clarifies such that it can see

248
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:38,720
deeper layers of Truth so there's this nice interplay between truth and letting

249
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:44,040
go letting go of anything that's not needed or is causing stress makes us

250
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:50,480
feel lighter and clearer and able to respond in different ways to situations

251
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:56,880
you can see this in your own life like suddenly you'll be able to say and do and think things that wouldn't have

252
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:02,760
occurred before as an example U one Dharma

253
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:09,599
practitioner I was talking with told a story about being on a team with someone

254
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:15,000
who was naturally talented and very easily excelled at the tasks that the

255
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:21,160
team was doing and she initially felt some Envy because she perceived herself

256
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:27,640
not to be as talented as this very natural talented person but being Dharma

257
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:33,960
practitioner she also noticed that Envy is a painful State painful for her

258
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:40,960
without the other person even knowing that she was feeling it and she didn't try to work directly

259
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,160
with the Envy except to feel the contraction that it brought to her heart

260
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:52,880
and she also tried to keep her mind on what she genuinely admired in this other

261
00:42:53,319 --> 00:42:59,240
person so she she held both of those she wasn't suppressing her Envy but she also

262
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:05,760
wasn't letting it get the better of her and there came a day to her surprise

263
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:11,000
when the other person did an excellent job on something and she felt mudita

264
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:18,319
which is appreciative Joy the third of the Brahma garas the third of the heart qualities so she felt appreciative joy

265
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:25,839
for the success of this person and it was pure and clean she just felt medita where did that come from she had

266
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:31,480
not deliberately done done mudita practice which some people try to do

267
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:38,079
when they feel envious as they quickly try to counteract it she wasn't doing that but she

268
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:46,359
realized that the combination of opening to the truth of her envy and having the wisdom to just stay with that allowed

269
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:53,280
something to shift in her heart there was a letting go into a deeper relationship with this person not so

270
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:58,520
tinged with her own self-c concern about being less than in some

271
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:04,839
way so sometimes if we just stay with the practice slowly creating the

272
00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:11,040
conditions that allow us to let go then we'll find that we do let go and move on

273
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:17,520
this is also part of cultivating relinquishment we don't always have to feel like we're directly working on

274
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:24,359
quote unquote letting go maybe we just create the conditions in our heart and eventually the Letting Go will

275
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:30,319
happen so a good exercise in realm of conscious letting go is to take a look

276
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:38,640
from time to time at what you what you own what you hold on to what you clean to and maybe explore what life would be

277
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:44,520
like without that for example refraining from complaining for 3 weeks these are

278
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:50,680
things that we can do consciously or deliberately and we'll find that many of the things that we think we need are

279
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:57,760
actually just habits that we don't need at all and then in the realm of the the deeper kind of letting go the we really

280
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:03,599
sort of can't do consciously then we try to tune into the tension that is always

281
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:10,680
there when we're engaged in greed or aversion or delusion and we try to admit to the truth that this grasping is

282
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:16,599
actually painful and then give your heart a chance to learn how to let go of

283
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:21,640
them and when you watch how this process works again and again you gain

284
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:27,040
confidence that the path is really about non- clinging there really is this fact

285
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:34,119
Foundation of relinquishment that the Buddha talked about to this practitioner no matter how contradictory

286
00:45:34,119 --> 00:45:40,800
that sounds in the abstract there is a foundation of relinquishment that we

287
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:46,760
can have and and live from when you see that it makes

288
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:52,680
sense and then through that we also get to taste the piece of release when we do

289
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:59,280
let go there's a releasing feeling and that peace is the topic for

290
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:08,000
tomorrow so thank you and may you have a wonderful day of generosity and letting

291
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:15,680
go take care
