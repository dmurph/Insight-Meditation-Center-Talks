1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,480
hello and welcome

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,160
to meditation at

3
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:19,720
IMC and this is the Friday meditation the last one of this this particular

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:27,240
series and um the introductory words I want to make

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:34,079
is to say that meditation is not for

6
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:40,600
bystandard uh it's not to be an observer from the

7
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:47,920
distance but it involves participation participating in something

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,559
profound but the act of participation is kind of very unique or maybe different

9
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,640
than how we normally would think where maybe the participation is the idea of

10
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,479
parti ation is active like it's a real doing and it's also not passive like a

11
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,520
bystander just being done to there's something in between between those

12
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,880
two and uh this is where some of the profundity of living from mindfulness

13
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:25,040
living from the Dharma begins to be possible and

14
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,720
um and the example I'd like to use is is

15
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:38,759
uh if you're cold and you go stand in the sun to get warm so you have a role

16
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:45,640
of Mo going someplace where it's sunny and standing there in such a way that the sun sun rays can land on you and

17
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:51,000
warm you up you probably face the Sun or put your back to the Sun so the greatest

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,560
surface area is kind of facing um you know the

19
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,479
Sun and um but then uh you don't

20
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:10,039
do the receiving of the sunlight and the warmth you don't send it through your

21
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:16,800
body and but rather uh the body is has these sense organs has a capacity to

22
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:24,160
absorb the Heat and you're allowing that to move through you to warm you

23
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:31,519
up and in a sense uh Your Role is to participate in the whole event

24
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:38,400
that is not your doing uh but you have to be present for it and allow this movement of the warmth

25
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,159
slowly thawing your body warming it up maybe and um so the same way in

26
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:50,840
meditation there's maybe a sun something equivalent to a sun warming us up from

27
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:57,080
the inside there's a light that's of that's beginning to like the sun arises

28
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:03,799
and and uh you might sitting there looking out in the early morning as it gets light lighter and lighter and

29
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:09,400
lighter and you're participating in this movement of the earth lighting up being

30
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,519
illuminated but you're not doing it but you are participating and it has a

31
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:19,840
effect on you so there's some there's illumination that can be born inside of

32
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,680
us or there can be love not love that involves any

33
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:33,120
desire that's desire and love are often confused but uh there's a kind of a love a warmth

34
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,239
that's generated from the inside out that we place ourselves close to and

35
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,439
allow for it like we're standing in the sun allow something to

36
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:48,680
appear and so it isn't so much that uh

37
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:55,480
uh uh we are doing something and it it isn't so much that

38
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,680
we are being done to but rather we're placed in ourselves

39
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:07,360
where the two come together and something wants to be expressed something wants to arise something wants

40
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:15,160
to appear that uh we participate in that we enter into as we

41
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,359
meditate and um so the initial kind of steps of meditation of relaxing and

42
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:27,040
settling and kind of staying with a breath are the kind of the early

43
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,680
preparation for particip ipating in a deeper expression that's going to come

44
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,400
participating in the sun warming warming you up and a kind of participation of

45
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:46,880
being there for the sunlight as it becomes brighter in the morning and so what is the equivalent

46
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:53,320
for you what wants to be expressed what wants to Bubble Up and be born from the

47
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,880
inside out so not from a desire from the mind

48
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:05,240
not from ideas what should happen and shouldn't happen or ideas of what will fulfill us

49
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,880
or not fulfill us but something that's deeper than

50
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:19,600
desire deeper even Than Me Myself and mine almost as if this is not personal

51
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,919
it's something deeper so to assume a meditation

52
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:32,360
posture and I like to think sometimes the posture is a posture

53
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:40,080
that of certainly a kind of respect maybe even a kind of

54
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:46,440
reverence where your posture is being adjusted in whatever

55
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,600
way that works for you so that you're ready to receive

56
00:05:51,600 --> 00:06:00,319
ready to host be the host the respectful the caring host for something that's quite

57
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:06,280
profound for the Dharma for your heart for love for

58
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:12,560
freedom and it's not a casual posture but it's not a tense

59
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,960
posture it's a dignified posture maybe the kind of dignified posture you

60
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,039
would use if you literally were receiving the Dal Lama in your house for

61
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:31,479
tea or or you were creating a meditation

62
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:37,520
room in your house to invite the Dal Lama to come and meditate with

63
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:47,319
you so you're making a posture and then to gently close your

64
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:53,360
eyes and this idea of gentling and being gentle at the

65
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:01,520
beginning is to begin orienting

66
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:07,680
yourself to be with something that is maybe maybe not

67
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:14,840
shy but maybe something which doesn't get easily gets eclipsed easily gets

68
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:21,680
overlooked something which is quiet unassertive

69
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:29,000
undemanding something inside that's profound and so to Gentle ourselves as

70
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,160
part of this preparation to

71
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:46,599
receive to be a host and then gently taking some deeper

72
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:55,360
breaths breathing in expanding your body your torso your rib

73
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,560
cage your belly

74
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,639
and relaxing as you exhale

75
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:27,319
settling with a longer exhale it's it's organizing your body bringing it

76
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:34,800
together bringing everything together together so it settles here all of

77
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:39,240
you coming

78
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:54,240
together rather than being absorbed in the thinking

79
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:01,240
World we're entering into the wholeness of of our

80
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,240
embodied

81
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,600
being and letting the breathing return to

82
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:31,200
normal and as simply and ordinarily as you can

83
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,279
unambitious let there be a gentling of your

84
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:54,240
breathing maybe a gentle softening of the belly the

85
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,680
body as you exhale

86
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:17,720
and a gentling and softening of your thinking

87
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:28,399
mind if the thinking mind is filled with thoughts and ideas and mental energy

88
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:34,680
agitation there's no room for the

89
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,920
mind to be a good

90
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:49,600
host to have space for something different than it's than just

91
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,519
thinking to have room to receive and feel and

92
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:01,240
sense the sunlight the warmth

93
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:10,240
something deeper that wants to emerge from deep

94
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:18,320
within maybe love maybe peace or calm

95
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,040
so relaxing the thinking

96
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:56,680
mind and then aligning yourself or attuning

97
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:04,639
yourself to your breathing to the body's experience of

98
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:19,480
breathing and with your breathing as if your breathing is

99
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:25,600
holding your hand or breathing is guiding leading

100
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:31,120
you follow the the exhale

101
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:38,160
to whatever is for you the

102
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,079
deepest maybe most intimate place

103
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,800
within underneath all your thoughts and concerns and fears and

104
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:57,000
desires all the challenges and pains that you

105
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,800
have is there any in or

106
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,480
intuition of a depth within

107
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,839
you even if you have to just imagine that rather than to feel

108
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:25,920
it allow yourself to breathe through and

109
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:32,240
with and out of that depth Within

110
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:13,959
shifting from the control tower in the head where we observe and comment and

111
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:20,759
judge and where we the victim and

112
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:30,320
the actor shifting from that to deep inside

113
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:45,279
and like you would maybe stand in the sun to receive the

114
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:54,360
sunlight be present in your torso be present deep and in deep within in your

115
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,160
heart or deeper

116
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:06,839
to allow something deep to express itself

117
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:14,120
to emerge to shine to

118
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:35,880
radiate and here it's not so important what that is could be difficult it could be

119
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:45,600
nice as it is that you're the host that you're a profound way

120
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,959
of sensing and

121
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:58,000
feeling of allowing this to meet you and you to meet it

122
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:10,000
and you don't need to know what's going to happen or why it's

123
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:15,880
happening breathe with openness breathe with

124
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:23,839
acceptance receptivity allowing what's deep

125
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:31,920
inside to have room to emerge for

126
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
for

127
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
for

128
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
for

129
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

130
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

131
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
for

132
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
for

133
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

134
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

135
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

136
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

137
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,480
for e

138
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:50,600
taking a few moments to feel what's happening for

139
00:24:50,600 --> 00:25:00,039
you not to think about it but to sense and feel the global body

140
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:05,080
as wide a sense of embodiment as you

141
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:09,320
can to sense and

142
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:24,960
feel and within that field of embodiment the movement of breathing

143
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:40,679
and relaxing

144
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:48,320
softening settling into a place of

145
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:55,960
quiet within maybe a still quiet

146
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:02,840
place deep within below

147
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:10,960
your beliefs your thoughts your reactions your fears your

148
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:18,720
desires below all those things which are kind of at the

149
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,679
surface deep down inside

150
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:33,120
and sensing

151
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:40,278
feeling the deeper quiet place

152
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:47,039
within if there is such that place or imagining it

153
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:56,080
there and then feel and sense what wants to be expressed what is

154
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:02,679
emerging from there what

155
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:08,000
is radiating shining

156
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:15,720
flowing vibrating

157
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:29,840
tingling and if this place within could speak

158
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,200
what word would it say

159
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:16,120
and perhaps from some place deep and quiet within you can have some sense or

160
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:20,880
intuition understanding

161
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:29,320
imagination that we have within us an

162
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:38,799
alternative to suffering an alternative to ill will and greed and

163
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:47,000
fear we have the possibility of

164
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:55,440
well-being being at peace and calm and as we come to the end of this

165
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,039
sitting to wish this for others

166
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:08,640

176
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:27,519
free thank you and to comment a little bit about

177
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:34,399
this last meditation it was uh meant to be a continuation of

178
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:42,919
the meditations and the teachings for this week from this week and uh with the idea that building

179
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:50,039
on that or being supported by all that and you might not have been to the

180
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:57,360
earlier teachings you might not be in a place where what I talked was relevant for you or something you can t you canti

181
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:03,080
felt you could kind of understand or do it's that's

182
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:09,080
understandable and it's easy to be that way and but maybe in sometime in the

183
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:16,240
future you can relisten to this and there'll be a time when you're ready for it so thank

184
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:30,919
you e

185
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:11,120
so hello and welcome to this Fifth and last uh

186
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:16,159
talk that's based on the the

187
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:23,480
practice of not making it worse that um maybe you don't know what

188
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:32,519
else to do you don't understand the situation it seems impossible it seems like it's you know not going

189
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:38,000
well there's always one thing you may I hope there's always one thing you can do

190
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,159
you can at least not make it worse you can restrain yourself from

191
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:50,000
speaking if the speaking you think is going to make it worse you can restrain yourself from the actions you're going

192
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:58,279
to do that if that's going to make it worse there's a a profound way that uh

193
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:06,279
or very important way that sometimes what's most important uh is

194
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:11,399
um doing nothing and doing nothing not to

195
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:19,720
celebrate doing nothing not to kind of imply that that's the only thing we can ever do or that but if we don't know

196
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:25,919
what to do and all the things we can think we might do is going to make the situation

197
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:33,159
worse um maybe restraint maybe holding back is the wisest thing we can do and

198
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:38,559
how to make that wiser so that is not just only restraint and kind of gritting

199
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:47,360
your teeth or something is to have a practice you can do uh uh while you're doing nothing and

200
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:54,279
so that's what I've been offering this week and around the acronym worse so you can

201
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:59,720
wait and uh there's something very profound about waiting

202
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:07,360
uh you can uh get pull yourself together get organized get oriented kind of let

203
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:13,118
all the different pieces of who you are your body your heart your mind your emotions be gathered together be

204
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:21,638
recognized and be be be here you can relax and maybe even more

205
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:29,079
uh valuable than relaxing you can rest relax and then rest in the place of

206
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:35,158
relaxation abide allow yourself to be there in that place don't pick up right

207
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:43,919
away with your thoughts and activities and doings don't relax and then jump up and act uh take in and be nourished by

208
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:49,839
the gentler softer relaxed fate rest in it for a

209
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:58,160
while and that allows you to sense and to see so after going through this process

210
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,200
sense more fully what the situation is what's happening in you and when you all

211
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:11,400
your senses are open to the situation what do you pick up what do you tune into that if if you uh that's different

212
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:18,160
than if you're only T tuning in through your belief systems through your bias through your preferences what does your

213
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:24,480
body feel as you kind of be there with the situation feel about the situation

214
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:31,520
or feel about yourself so sensing and then then uh part of the sensing

215
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:37,520
world is eyes seeing but seeing is more than just uh

216
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,560
you know uh sight it's studying looking

217
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:49,800
at understanding the situation um take a good look and what's happening here and you might be in a

218
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:58,440
better position to look and begin understanding after you've done the first steps in this process of of uh

219
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:04,880
not making it worse and then we come to the last

220
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:11,119
today and that is um to express the E is to

221
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:16,720
express and um and not making it worse is not supposed to be eternally passive

222
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:22,359
or not doing anything there is a time and a place to speak and so learning how

223
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:27,400
to speak wisely how to express ourselves wisely has many different dimensions and

224
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:32,839
it's a you know it's a huge fantastic learning um so for example there's

225
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:38,160
mindful speaking uh and learning how to stay mindful as we speak being embodied

226
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:45,920
as we speak there's learning how how to speak uh to speak in ways that um uh

227
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:51,599
don't diminish other people or don't criticize them or don't judge them uh so

228
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:57,000
there's you know the practice of making eye statements and uh making statements that

229
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:04,480
are really expressing the truth of the moment for ourselves and in this regard uh the um

230
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:10,640
I'm a big fan of mindfulness out loud mindfulness out loud means that

231
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:16,880
mindfulness inside is just to name and see and understand directly what is here

232
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:22,280
without any um additions to it judgments

233
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:27,960
reactivity uh opinions for and against just oh this is how it is now Without

234
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:33,560
Blame without shame um this is how it is now so that

235
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:41,280
same way uh can be expressed uh out loud um so rather than saying I'm angry

236
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:47,240
with you you can say you know this what's how this conversation has gone uh

237
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:56,359
I'm feeling pretty agitated and pretty upset and somewhat angry um and that shift in conversation

238
00:37:56,359 --> 00:38:03,119
goes from you know maybe I'm angry with you as if you're to blame to not saying

239
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:08,200
anything about the other person but taking time to speak about yourself that

240
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:13,480
can make much more room in the conversation for something deep to happen now you're expressing what's true

241
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:18,560
for you and um and so what what needs to be

242
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:24,560
expressed what needs to be said what needs to be shared what needs to be uh

243
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:33,079
come out and then there's a deeper dimension of this what wants to be expressed because uh that um uh if we

244
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:40,839
can really find ourselves in the deeply connected to the to the wholeness of who

245
00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:46,839
who we are or the Deep Quiet Place Within of who we are um we discover that

246
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:52,119
there's layers and layers of things that want to show up and be here that are

247
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:59,040
covered over or ignored or don't have a chance uh that is more as more who we

248
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:04,800
are more essential or more feels like the fullness of our freedom fullness of

249
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:10,920
our spirituality of our love then a lot of the kind of surface ideas of Me

250
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:17,680
Myself and mine and this is what's happening to me and this is what I want and this is why I'm hurt or something

251
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:23,599
there's something and so meditation is one of those ways we can drop down quiet

252
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:29,359
to that place of deep deep under the surface

253
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:34,880
and from there what wants to be expressed there what is the expression of

254
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,680
that uh and I find that meditation at some point shifts from when I first sit

255
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:46,839
down it's something I'm doing to it shift to to I I'm participating I'm

256
00:39:46,839 --> 00:39:52,400
going along with I'm riding along with uh something deep that wants to unfold

257
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,560
and move within me and sometimes it's just the breathing the breathing wants

258
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:03,040
to happen and it's not me breathing but breathing is breathing itself and I'm

259
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:10,960
there receiving that or participating it or allowing it resting in it but deeper than the breath there can

260
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:19,440
be a deep sense of care a deep sense of love compassion kindness care uh peace

261
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,800
that is also very quiet as in a sense maybe feels nothing to do with what you

262
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:32,800
want and your sense of self and exchange with other people and what you're going to get back it just kind of it maybe is

263
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:40,800
a form of love that has no object not about loving something or

264
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:47,160
being loved back there is just um something

265
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:54,520
profound and uh or maybe it's something difficult maybe it's grief that's the

266
00:40:54,520 --> 00:41:00,880
Deep thing but there's something fantastically important about this

267
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:06,040
reverence and care to open up to what's deep inside and make room for it and

268
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:12,720
feel the rightness of allowing this depth to be expressed to come out to be expressed in our body expressed in our

269
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:18,920
heart to be expressed kind of from the inside out and so not all

270
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:24,680
expression is spoken um because sometimes the spoken

271
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:31,240
expression maybe isn't as deep as we could go um but sometimes we do speak and

272
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:39,560
sometimes when a situation is very difficult uh there becomes a time to speak not just wait not just you know

273
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:46,319
organize and relax but there definitely is a time when we have to speak speak up

274
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:54,280
and um but speak don't speak up automatically reactively go through this process of

275
00:41:54,280 --> 00:42:01,760
wait organize rest sense and see and then you'll be in a much better

276
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:09,319
position to speak wisely caringly and hopefully in doing that

277
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:15,920
make the situation better and that in the end is you know I think what the heart most

278
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:21,680
wants um the heart most wants to not make it worse if that's the

279
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:28,359
danger but more than that uh we want to make things better we want to make this

280
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:36,640
a better world we want to make ourselves a better person we want to support others to live a better life and so may

281
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:45,040
this process we've talked about this uh week be one that supports you in many different ways in your

282
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:50,720
life so thank you very much so a couple of

283
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:56,760
announcements so I'll be uh teaching a 3-we retreat for the next 3 weeks at the

284
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:02,520
inside retreat center and um and U Matthew Bren silver will be here next

285
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:08,559
week and uh Diana Clark will be here I think the following two weeks and uh

286
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:15,200
both of these are wonderful teachers and I'm very happy and glad that they're coming to teach and that you'll have a

287
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:23,160
chance to kind of hear their teachings and and not just their teachings but also their um their

288
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:28,599
beingness I love them both quite a bit so it's I'm happy to going to be here with

289
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:35,800
you and um and then um it might be worth saying

290
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:42,000
that uh I teach every year a Buddhist chaplaincy program it's in person here

291
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:50,720
we teach it here I IMC it's through the Sati Center and that will start up in the end of September and um it's a been

292
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:58,880
a very significant for some people training program in offering spiritual care that um that uh is kind of uh

293
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:05,640
moving into for some people it's a stepping stone to becoming a professional uh chaplain and so it's a

294
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:12,119
very rich world of stepping into uh care and people who do it are have to uh have

295
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:17,520
a volunteer role to volunteer maybe in a hospital as a volunteer chaplain or or

296
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:23,200
in a prison or jail or there many places hospice anyway so if some of you might

297
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:28,319
be interested in it it's um it's a rich way of Contin in with this practice that

298
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:33,599
we do and you'll find more information under Sati Center

299
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:40,040
um uh sa.org there's both an online version and inperson and I'm involved

300
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:50,119
with the inperson here at IMC and the online is has other wonderful teachers who are teaching it so thank you and um

301
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:54,960
