of the body section in the sati bhattanasutra

visit his dad today so

7
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:47,920
so [Music] the sixth practice of the body

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:56,000
of the body in the satipatana sutta in many ways the previous practices

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,280
build up to this one really prepare us for this one and this is how all the practices in the

10
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:10,000
sati pratana sutta both the four main categories they build

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,840
from the more they build for the their foundations for one another as

12
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:24,640
well as in each subsection in each of the four subsections the body they build up um

13
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,960
for each other so this last one which really has to do

14
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:39,920
with appreciating our body appreciating our body as nature that this body is nature the

15
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,360
body that we take it to be me and mine is really a piece of nature

16
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,399
and is subjected to all the laws of nature

17
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,479
the previous couple of practices that we've done actually all of them but especially the

18
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,680
one yesterday that gil led with the elements with the

19
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,000
four elements the elemental nature

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,400
yes this body is the elements is is elements

21
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,160
inside nature inside nature outside as well as the one the day before with

22
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,879
the 32 parts of the body no as if this body was a bag of beans

23
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:33,840
as a so if we take those two practices and put them um on

24
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:41,120
wheels basically put them on steroids they put them on a time lapse put them on a time lapse oh what

25
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,519
happens with nature what happens with nature ah with that time lapse

26
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:56,560
with with the truth of impermanence then we arrive at this last practice

27
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:04,239
so so in order to um invite us for our reflection

28
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:10,159
for our um practice for our meditation today and i'll say a lot more about the

29
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,840
teaching of the suta specifically at the end in the dharma but just to

30
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,519
motivate our practice what i like to do

31
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:28,319
is to um flash a few images of nature

32
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:34,799
of of gardens and and outside there's as they say

33
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:42,879
picture is worth a million a thousand i don't know however many uh words so

34
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,480
um and then we'll start our guided meditation so this will just be a few seconds

35
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:57,040
to motivate that so so here we go

36
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:05,040
okay let's see here on zoom let's see driving

37
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:14,560
zoom sharing screen here we go okay so we'll start with the image

38
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:22,000
ah we'll start where gil left off yesterday so with the suggestion with the

39
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,840
invitation of seeing yourself as a garden

40
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:38,240
so you can use in the guided meditation also just an image of a garden a

41
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:45,120
vegetable garden you can use this one or your own favorite one

42
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:52,479
then perhaps an image of a forest redwoods lying down

43
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:57,840
watching the sky feeling a part of nature

44
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:05,039
again you can use this image or an image from your own mind later

45
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:11,440
and then the forest floor being a part of nature feeling that

46
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:19,840
nature inside nature outside all the elements earth water

47
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,880
fire and wind and fire being this this capacity of

48
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:34,479
nature to change and shift and and be transformed through sunlight through

49
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:40,560
heat and perhaps a log that has become a

50
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,479
nurse lock a nurse that has fought a log that has fallen

51
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:53,840
and has become a nurse log for other growth in the forest

52
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:07,840
and other images from the forest floor as we imagine ourselves as part of nature changing shifting growing

53
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:15,520
and of course decaying it's part of nature to grow

54
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:23,840
and shift and change we are not so different this body

55
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,880
is nature this body is nature

56
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:36,479
this body is not so different this body is nature

57
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:44,880
and so too just like nature this body is nature this body is not so different

58
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,840
it will decay

59
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:57,280
so so let's begin let's begin our practice

60
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:05,199
our formal practice by settling in by settling in into the fell

61
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:17,840
sense of this body in this moment

62
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:26,160
inspired and using the foundation of the previous

63
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,000
a days teachings

64
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,800
on the body

65
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,840
noticing the breath

66
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,680
moving in and out

67
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,160
noticing the contact points

68
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:10,080
the earth element the connection with the earth

69
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:17,758
as if we were earth sitting on earth this body as earth

70
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:27,840
sitting lying resting on earth

71
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:51,200
i like to invite you to imagine you're sitting or lying down

72
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,240
in a lush garden feeling this body

73
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:10,480
surrounded by nature

74
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,040
by fruits vegetables all parts of nature

75
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,839
this body alive and breathing is to

76
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,839
nature

77
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:05,839
perhaps as if you were lying down [Music] looking at the sky

78
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:18,079
at the trees around you vegetation around you

79
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:25,760
earth element to earth on earth feeling solidity contact points of this

80
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:34,079
body in this moment an expansion watching the sky

81
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,800
the clouds

82
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:52,959
the trees around part of the forest part of the forest

83
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,839
floor

84
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:23,120
relaxing softening inviting the body

85
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:32,480
to know to trust that it is part of nature

86
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:43,839
it's not separate it is not separate

87
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,880
to feel the peace

88
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:57,839
of nature peace to feel the peace of wild things

89
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,839
as in the poem by wendell berry

90
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:04,320
this body alive breathing is a part of nature

91
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:11,519
not so different from an apple

92
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,760
that falls from a tree

93
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,079
the forest floor and decays

94
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:35,839
not so different because body is nature this is the truth of how things are

95
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:49,839
the intimacy of being nature

96
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:17,839
seeing this body just as the apple

97
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,839
decaying the composting

98
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,839
going back into nature

99
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:59,839
this natural process

100
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:11,199
the mind can become quite calm and absorbed but the freedom

101
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:27,839
with the ease that this contemplation brings see for yourself

102
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,639
this body is nature

103
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:24,000
this body too is of the same nature

104
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:35,840
and it will be like that

105
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:49,600
like an apple

106
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,360
decaying the composing

107
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:03,919
it's not exempt from that fate this body is nature this body's nature

108
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:17,840
this body's nature

109
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,960
this body is nature

110
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:24,080
it's not separate from nature nature inside nature outside

111
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,640
nature inside nature outside

112
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,240
it is subject to laws of nature

113
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:53,840
this body will go back into nature someday

114
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:11,120
and for the last moments of this practice

115
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:27,039
if there has been any self-criticism or judgment coming up

116
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:34,840
about about your practice i couldn't do this my mind was

117
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:44,640
distracted whatever has come up let's compost it

118
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:51,840
let's offer it back into nature

119
00:30:53,760 --> 00:31:02,240
no need to hang on offer it back to nature

120
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:12,320
and knowing that the natural being natural this body

121
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:19,039
being nature is true for us for this being

122
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:27,120
and this seat as well as all beings all beings

123
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:33,760
everywhere all beings everywhere are part of nature

124
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:41,840
they're not separate from nature all human beings all animals

125
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,840
we're all nature

126
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:58,399
offering our hearts while we are alive while this body is alive

127
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:03,840
blessed with the miracle of aliveness

128
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:09,679
offering our love our care our goodness

129
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:15,840
to ourselves and to all of nature

130
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:23,679
this incredible mysterious thing called life

131
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:29,840
it's too brief not to love

132
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,039
it's too brief

133
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:43,840
it's too brief

134
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,720
may all beings everywhere including us

135
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,518
know their true nature

136
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:11,840
and be free

137
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:57,600
thank you all for your practice

138
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:05,279
for the generosity of your practice practices generosity for ourselves and

139
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,840
others

140
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:18,839
so the topic the topic of the sixth body

141
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:25,359
contemplation in the sati patana sato

142
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:38,960
so it is called the nine journal ground contemplations

143
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:49,200
and as i mentioned at the beginning the previous practices especially the 32

144
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:57,359
body parts considering body as a bag of beans and the elements which you did yesterday

145
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:05,680
elements of earth water fire and air his body is nature nature inside nature

146
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:14,320
outside so in the practice that we did

147
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:20,079
we envisioned we brought to our attention to our contemplation to our

148
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:27,599
mind to our imagination that this body is not so separate from other

149
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:33,200
bodies other i actually did apple today just to be

150
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,480
more gentle with with entering into this practice

151
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:46,320
uh with an image that i also showed at the beginning and a uh an apple decaying on

152
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:52,320
the forest floor we are not different we are this body is not different this body is

153
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:59,520
nature this body is ours and yet it's not ours

154
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:07,359
we weren't given a choice menu before we were born were you i want this

155
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:13,839
feature i want to be this tall we didn't really choose this body this body is

156
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:20,960
nature this is a deep and beautiful contemplation

157
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:28,480
that helps us that supports us not to take this body so

158
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:35,200
personally so every every wrinkle every this every that

159
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,880
this body is nature and it will go back into nature it can't be any other

160
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:48,160
way we know this of course we know this and yet we we try to

161
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:56,320
but well the society especially the western society keeps it as a hidden secret almost

162
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:03,280
and our going back into nature is so sterilized is is

163
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:10,240
hidden is taken away from view um and this practice really tries to

164
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:17,119
bring it into our consciousness that yes this body is nature

165
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:24,480
it will go back into ground it will just it will decompose all the sinews the

166
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:34,480
flesh the bones the all the elements inside will go back to nature it's it's

167
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:42,160
natural the these this practice

168
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:50,000
is laid out step by step by step um actually when in quite a lot of

169
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,160
detail and when i teach longer day longs or retreats

170
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:01,599
i think it would be more appropriate but for today as it's brief you know not going through the

171
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:07,680
nine stages because it takes some preparation but i will read them from the suta

172
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:13,520
so that you know what is in the sutta

173
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:19,520
and and then i'll talk a little more about what some of the effects of this practice could

174
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:27,920
be perhaps but of course you explore for yourself to see what what it does for you

175
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:35,320
so here is here is the section of the nine charnel ground meditations

176
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:42,560
contemplations from the satipatana sutta

177
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:50,240
again practitioners as though one were to see a corpse

178
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:56,480
thrown aside in eternal ground and just to say the charnel ground in

179
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:02,079
the times of the buddha was an over um

180
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:09,200
over the ground place where bodies were left to decompose

181
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:17,260
and decay so not underground but overground and there was a

182
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:24,480
[Music] practice a very active practice of the monks going to journal ground to do

183
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:30,320
this practice specifically to actually witness bodies

184
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:35,680
left to decompose in different stages different stages and that's what the

185
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:42,880
nine stages are that this body is is yes it's alive and it's nature it

186
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:50,240
will go through these nine stages so so please humor me as i will read

187
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:57,920
these stages for you so as though one were to see a corpse

188
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:06,640
thrown aside in eternal ground one two or three days dead loaded livid

189
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:14,319
with oozing matter which is what happens with every dead material including this body

190
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:20,720
so that's one stage one second stage being devoured by crows hawks vultures

191
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:29,280
dogs jackals and various kinds of worms again it's part of nature nature is very efficient very efficient

192
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,880
i showed a an image of a nurse log a log in the forest that has fallen

193
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:43,440
becomes food for other for other beings for other forms of life uh

194
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:53,200
in nurse long so we become a nurse log in in this way food for earthworms

195
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:58,720
next stage a skeleton with flesh and blood held together with senus

196
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:06,880
a fleshless skeleton smeared with blood held together with sinews again clearly they observed very a lot of

197
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:12,079
detail what happens skeleton without flesh and blood held

198
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:17,680
together with sinews next stage disconnected bones scattered scattered in

199
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:25,440
all directions next stage bones bleached white the color of shells next stage

200
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:32,960
bones heaped up more than a year old next stage bones rotten and crumbling to

201
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:41,200
dust so all the nine stages is the invitation in this practice in detail one compares

202
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:48,400
this same body with it thus this body too is of the same nature

203
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:54,400
it will be like that it is not exempt from that fate

204
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:04,240
so this practice this contemplation practice is one to

205
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:09,920
bring to mind either being able to be in the journal ground or imagining in

206
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:16,640
one's imagination to imagine yes this body as if lying in the forest floor is not so different

207
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:27,280
from the apple decaying or anything else decaying this body is nature this body is nature

208
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:33,839
and one impact one impact that this practice can have

209
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:42,079
is again actually multiple impacts i'll speak about one first is to to loosen

210
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:48,000
to loosen our attachment to to this body this art or rather i should

211
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:56,079
say our over preoccupation we're preoccupied but over occupied this body is nature

212
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:01,200
and it doesn't mean that we don't treat it then with respect where we don't take care of it

213
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:08,800
no not at all we take care of it as this amazing incredible piece of nature

214
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:16,079
that somehow is us or has been entrusted to us to take care of without

215
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:24,079
taking it so personally oh my skin my hair my my as if it's our it's as

216
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:29,839
or my stomach is gurgling or my the as if we have per you know it's our

217
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:35,839
personal responsibility to make it all uh act exactly it acts according to the

218
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:42,000
laws of nature the hair might be frizzy according to the laws of nature it's it's humid or

219
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:48,960
or we get we get sick according to laws of nature so so it really brings a different

220
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,160
healthier more free again not a careless but more free

221
00:43:54,160 --> 00:44:00,640
a different ways of relating to this body not taking it personally and yet

222
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:07,119
loving it caring for it as this amazing incredible piece of nature

223
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:13,839
another impact it can have is to again bring awe for this piece of

224
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:21,440
nature that's alive it will be dead when a liveliness when this this aliveness

225
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:28,160
when we take our last breath and aliveness is no longer part of this

226
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:33,599
body it will die it will decay very quickly in fact

227
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:41,040
within minutes there is research that internally um gases

228
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:50,160
and and compounds and chemicals in the body start to to decay i read was it 20 minutes

229
00:44:50,160 --> 00:45:00,640
40 minutes i forget now after we take our last breath so so that this piece of nature is alive

230
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:06,960
all these cells are alive and functioning and we're thinking and going about our lives

231
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:15,040
and have agency wow this piece of nature is alive it's it's just amazing

232
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:23,119
it fills us with a sense of awe that we want to drop to our knees

233
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:30,160
and kiss the ground in awe that this body is alive in

234
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:37,040
this brief moment and the mind can let go of so many

235
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:43,920
preoccupations that are not healthy or not are extra are not needed

236
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:51,760
so may we all find freedom find

237
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:59,599
freedom in embracing our impermanence not hiding it but

238
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:07,119
embracing the impermanence of this body and may be a cause for

239
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:14,079
freedom and ease for all of us oh one last thing

240
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:23,040
i invite you in the next few days to bring attention to bring awareness

241
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:29,920
to um maybe if you do composting you know if

242
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:38,079
there is piece of fruit or food that's that's ah that's decaying oh nature nature this

243
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:44,400
body is not so separate so bring it into your consciousness instead of pushing it away and letting

244
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:49,599
it be sterile in a way not seen bring the fact that this is nature

245
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:56,160
bring it into your consciousness this is nature

246
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:04,079
so and one thing that i want to invite you for those who may want to actually take this
