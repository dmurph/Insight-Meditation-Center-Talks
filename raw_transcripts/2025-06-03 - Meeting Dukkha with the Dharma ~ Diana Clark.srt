1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:11,000
good evening Welcome Welcome Nice to see you all practice together

2
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:20,880
So tonight I would like to talk a little bit about a simile that gets used a lot

3
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,000
in Buddhist teachings But I'd like to look at a different aspect of it a

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,719
little bit different uh emphasis and a little bit different perspective than on

5
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:40,480
what we normally hear or and you know what Jim can we have the volume go up just a little bit i'm sorry I didn't ask

6
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,920
you to do this earlier Let's see how that is

7
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:53,718
I guess I have to talk to see how the volume is I think that'll be all right Thank you

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,359
So the simile is the simile of the raft

9
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,799
And this is a a loose translation He goes "Imagine

10
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:11,360
a person in the course of a journey arrives at a great expanse of water

11
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:20,560
and the nearshore is dubious and perilous and the far shore is a sanctuary free of

12
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:28,000
peril But there's no ferry boat or bridge to take them across the water." So the

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,680
person thinks what if I collected grass twigs branches and leaves and bound them

14
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,079
together as a raft and then supported by the raft and paddling with my hands and feet I should

15
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,360
then be able to reach the far shore There's more to this simile but I'm

16
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:52,240
going to just stay with that This idea that we are here and we can see oh

17
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:59,600
there's some water That's going to be a trouble And over there not here over there is uh where it feels like it would

18
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:06,880
be safe and comfortable And part of the reason why I wanted to

19
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:14,959
uh talk about this is I saw a translation recently that used this word dubious I just love this word dubious

20
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:22,720
This idea that well where we are on this shore seems a little bit dubious and perilous And I want to talk about that

21
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,239
But before um I do that I'll unpack a little bit just at a very high level I'm

22
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:36,319
thinking in the next talk I'll do I'll continue u on the simile of the raft and unpack unpack some other elements but

23
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,840
just to give you guys a high level this idea the person on a journey

24
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,760
encounters a great expanse of water So we could consider like journey is life

25
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,200
just in the course of life and this great expanse of water is sometimes

26
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,239
understood as like a flood is you know something that's uh

27
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,360
has a lot of power behind it a lot of force going a certain uh direction We

28
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:10,800
can think of it as kind of like this overwhelmed feeling or just being like swept away feeling sometimes that we get

29
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:18,800
when we just feel like oh this is too much and just getting carried away And maybe this happens when we have some

30
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,280
particular stress or difficulties Or maybe it's when we have some

31
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:34,000
existential enst when we realize oh yeah death's going to happen to us too Or we

32
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,120
have a loved one that has a terrible diagnosis or perhaps some terrible loss

33
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,799
a grief with some maybe somebody has died and just this sense of okay this

34
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:55,040
movement is happening and there's we can't stop it There's nothing to do to stop it It's just the way things are

35
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,680
We could also say that this great expanse of water is uh in the Buddhist

36
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:09,439
teachings we might say it's this uh notion of ignorance this thinking that we can

37
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:15,760
control everything that we can avoid everything that's uncomfortable and then

38
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,799
we realize wow I can't even though you feel like you're doing everything right

39
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:26,800
there's difficulties are arising And I'll talk more about that

40
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:34,080
So being on a journey and coming across this flood this big expanse of water And

41
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,400
then the nearshore is uncomfortable too The translator here is using the word

42
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,520
dubious and perilous I'll unpack that in a little in a moment But then there's

43
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,199
this notion or maybe it's intuition or maybe you've some glimpses or maybe

44
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:57,919
you've uh heard some teachings that touched something deeply inside of you There's this recognition

45
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,680
oh there's freedom is possible There's something different than the

46
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:11,520
uncomfortableness that's being experienced on this shore There's something else is possible

47
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:19,440
is available Some freedom some peace some ease

48
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,479
This translator is using this uh word sanctuary a place where there isn't the

49
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,680
same suffering that we're experiencing And then this whole notion of the raft

50
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,720
of what's going to take us from where their difficulties is to the peace

51
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:41,919
freedom and ease number of ways we could translate that Excuse me And in this

52
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:48,800
context um I'll say the path of practice or we could say the dharma the teachings

53
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:56,160
the way things are or maybe specifically some people would even say like maybe the eight-fold path or something like

54
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,080
this is a way to get to the other side

55
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:08,479
So what I want to talk about is this nearshore where we are

56
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:14,800
The far shore is freedom and peace and ease And we have a maybe a sense that

57
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,280
it's possible Chances are you wouldn't have started a meditation practice or come to a meditation center unless

58
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:27,440
there's something in you that has this uh idea this belief that oh yeah it's

59
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:33,039
something different is available Maybe it's not clear what it is Maybe it's

60
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:38,639
very clear what it is But whether that's clear or unclear what

61
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,720
often is clear is like "Oh I'm here." Not in the midst of that peace and

62
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:52,240
freedom and ease And on a basic level we could say that

63
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:58,400
all beings think they should be happy want to be happy but most often find

64
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:07,360
that they're not not as happy as they would like to be or think they should be or as happy as they think they could be

65
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:13,039
We could say even that's one way of thinking about this nearshore and far shore I'm not as happy as I want and I

66
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:21,720
believe that happiness could be over there and there's just something in between where I want to be

67
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,199
So one thing about this nearshore is that it's uncomfortable

68
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,639
because right if it weren't uncomfortable if we were on a journey and we encountered a big expanse of

69
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,319
water we would just turn around or just hang out there and enjoy the view or the

70
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:45,840
sound of the water going by we would just enjoy it But we have this feeling like no we want to be somewhere else

71
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,560
that's part of itself is uh part of the suffering

72
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,360
So there's something um I think that's

73
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:05,039
really noteworthy or for me that touches me and that is that the Buddha he talked

74
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:11,360
a lot about this near shore like where we actually are including there's

75
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,479
nowhere there's expectation that we have to be anywhere else We don't have to be

76
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:22,800
somebody else We don't have to be having different experiences or create a

77
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,160
completely new uh life or something like this

78
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:35,599
In fact the first noble truth many of you are familiar with this There's four noble truths And the first one is there

79
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:43,839
is duka Duca is this word that has this wide wide range of meanings just mild

80
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,760
irritation to absolute tear dread the most awful experience So

81
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:55,680
uncomfortableness and in the whole uh range sometimes gets translated as

82
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,959
suffering as stress dissatisfaction

83
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:06,560
Sometimes it's just that feeling like it's not quite right

84
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:14,000
even if we can't even say what is not quite right And sometimes it's just flatout awfulness So this one word

85
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:22,320
covers this big range And there's obvious dooka We all know

86
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,959
this about just pain You know the our bodies are vulnerable They

87
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:36,560
have uh they get injured Last week I took a little tumble when I

88
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,880
out for a hiking and I thought "Oh okay you know it's going to be fine Wow

89
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:49,040
Yeah The bruising and the I don't know It just turned out to be Oh okay Yeah This is Dooka This is what it means to

90
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:56,640
be have a human body is uh to have some pain after uh taking a tumble for a hike

91
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,080
Like nobody's immune from this Of course this is what happens

92
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:09,680
Illness loss right these are like the obvious things of Duka Then there's also at the subtle ones just the way that

93
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,839
things change We think "Okay we finally got all our ducks in a row and then something else happens."

94
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:24,320
It's like these ducks never quite stay in a row They're always swimming and doing something or paddling or maybe

95
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:31,440
this subtle duke of always having to prop up this sense of self making sure that we look good that people don't

96
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:38,320
really know uh how unsure we are about some things or making sure that uh

97
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,519
people understand how capable we are or whatever it is whatever ideas we have

98
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:51,920
about ourselves trying to defend an obvious and not so obvious ious ways

99
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,680
And I would say a subtle dooka that turns out to be so prevalent that

100
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,839
supports the real real set of dooka is this way that we're always trying to get

101
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:11,600
away from the obvious dooka How we're always have this resistance this sense of well

102
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,519
things should be different things should be otherwise I've spoken about this in a number of

103
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:23,200
different ways including this way and sometimes we're often saying no no to our experience whatever it is there's

104
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,720
this subtle like no it should be tweaked a little bit or no it has to be

105
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:35,920
different in obvious ways and this uh I appreciate this is the

106
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:42,800
first noble truth there is duka and it's not to discourage us it's not to say uh

107
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,160
like oh everything is suffering you better just get used to it You know it's

108
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,440
not that kind of a feeling Instead it's just so that we can stop like blaming

109
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,480
ourselves So we can stop thinking like "Oh I must be doing something wrong

110
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:05,839
because I'm having some uncomfortableness in my life It's not that you're doing your life wrong It's

111
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:12,639
just that life includes dooka That's just the way it is

112
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:18,800
And part of our suffering duka is not really believing that And this is a

113
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:25,360
little bit what I want to talk about today We tend to personalize it and feel like it's a personal failing when

114
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:31,600
there's difficulties I'm not saying that you know we can't do anything about it and everything we do

115
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,720
is perfect and any discomfort we have is uh somebody else's fault That's not what

116
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,560
I'm saying at all But there is this way in which we often have this subtle sense

117
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,320
of what am I missing if I'm having uncomfortableness We have this subtle

118
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,600
way in which we just think we're failing or doing it wrong and we're just blaming

119
00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:00,160
ourselves So maybe

120
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:08,320
what we could say one of the main points of Buddhism or this practice is to dissolve our habitual tendency of trying

121
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,440
to make everything be better which is perfectly natural Of course we

122
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,600
want to feel comfortable It's just not always possible It's that simple It's

123
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,040
just not always possible I have this terrible knot and bruise on

124
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:32,959
my leg It's just not possible that that's going to go away and that I'm going to be able to sit and walk comfortably It's just not going to

125
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:39,519
happen right now So this idea of the near shore where we

126
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:46,079
are is dubious I want to unpack that a little bit Dubious maybe we could define it as

127
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:53,279
filled with false promises And this an unreliable foundation for

128
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:59,199
happiness and well-being If anybody's interested the poly word is

129
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:05,839
asanka This is not a common word It's we could uh translate the poly as like

130
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:12,639
suspect or unreliable or deceptive And so what does that mean what does

131
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:19,519
that mean for us as uh practitioners sometimes we have this idea that okay

132
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:26,720
well if I just I'm using this expression get our ducks in a row but I could use this other word like if I could just get

133
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:34,399
things perfect or this perfectionism shows up in our life okay if I just

134
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:42,079
meditate perfectly whatever perfect is right that that's a moving target of course also but just these subtle ways

135
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:48,959
we think like well clearly I haven't I'm not doing something Right I I just need

136
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:54,160
to do it more perfectly Be the perfect Our life would go better

137
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:00,959
if we were the perfect meditator or the knew the sutas perfectly or uh some went

138
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:07,839
to per had perfect retreats uh or something like this This is dubious

139
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:15,839
because of course perfection isn't attainable It's just this mere concept that uh we

140
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:22,160
make up to say well whatever perfection is is uh something over there

141
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,199
clearly not what we're having because it's uncomfortable and then if we were to come over here then perfection would

142
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:33,600
be just a little bit more something else right it's something that we're seems to be chasing after

143
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:40,160
just look at people who you know have a perfect amount of money they have a lot

144
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:46,399
of money and then they're Oh no no no they need more Or I have a certain amount of fitness Oh nope They need more

145
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:53,839
This like just this inherent like just not being satisfied with what they have

146
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:59,759
So this perfection is unattainable or just getting everything exactly all

147
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:05,160
lined up That's actually doesn't exist

148
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:12,639
It's a little bit dubious because we often are chasing some external

149
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:19,279
experiences to help us feel better Some validation from others or some

150
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:24,880
attainments like I achieved this I have that whether I mean we can attain

151
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:31,360
anything We could um put the the grasping for

152
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,800
attainments onto any project meditation to be able to count the

153
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:44,320
breaths up to 10 and then once you do 10 oh okay now I need to do that again or need to sit so many retreats or have so

154
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:50,399
many meditative experiences or something like this or meditate daily for so many

155
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:57,839
days or read so many meditation books whatever it might be but I'm sorry I'm

156
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,880
this uh validation we kind of feel like these attainments

157
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:11,760
and We let people know oh I I did this I sat a threemonth long retreat Look at

158
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,798
me And we feel like oh was okay that didn't

159
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:23,360
quite work You know maybe it works for one second And then like oh I'm still the same person And you know there's

160
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:29,840
this way in which we often are looking for things outside of us to make us feel okay

161
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:37,120
praise or love attention from other people to make us feel like we're okay

162
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:46,880
And this is dubious because any sense of okayess that is built on

163
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:53,280
things external to us right it's not reliable Of course it isn't

164
00:17:53,280 --> 00:18:00,240
because turns out we don't get to control the whole world so that they we only get the praise and achieve the

165
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,600
things that we want to achieve in the way that we feel like we want in order

166
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:11,679
to feel good But there's a way in which we want this We to feel like okay I'll

167
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:18,120
be happier if I have some more external validation

168
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:25,760
And this also ties into this idea of control Like we do not control nearly

169
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:31,360
what we think we do And sometimes we have this feeling like okay well things

170
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:38,160
would be okay if I could just control myself control my thoughts or control my

171
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,600
emotions or control those people over there you know if they would just stop

172
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:51,799
doing whatever it is they're doing that uh doesn't seem quite right for to us

173
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:58,160
But there's this way that um even though we realize that we can't control we we

174
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:04,000
just keep trying Controlling other people turns out not to work It's a

175
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,559
little bit annoying for the other people and it's annoying for us too because it doesn't work And it kind of like uh has

176
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:16,160
this uh way it impacts our relationships So it's this dubious

177
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:22,559
trying to control things We just keep on discovering that we don't actually control what we wish we could or what we

178
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:28,799
do So that's the dubious side of the nearshore of kind of like the the Buddha

179
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:34,160
talking about the first noble truth There is dooka

180
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,080
I also want to talk a little bit about perilousness

181
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:46,880
because there's been ways in which we've been trying to deal with these difficulties that just lead to more

182
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:54,480
difficulties We thought that it would be helpful and maybe some of these patterns or behaviors were helpful at one time in

183
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:01,280
one setting but we find ourselves repeating them in a way that isn't so helpful anymore

184
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:07,440
We might have some um addictive or compulsive or some we just feel

185
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,600
compelled to do some behavior that just isn't helpful

186
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,600
Maybe it offers some short-term relief but it just ends up deepening suffering

187
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:25,840
Whether we're turning to just uh entertaining ourselves on these little rectangular devices we carry in our

188
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:32,080
pockets or whether we are distracting ourselves or zoning out with Netflix or

189
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:38,559
something like this or doom scrolling or writing mean comments on on uh social

190
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:45,039
media or something like this or whether we find ourselves overeing or drinking

191
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:52,400
things in alcohol in a way that's not helpful or so many ways in which we kind

192
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:59,039
of find ourselves compelled with uh behavior that turns out to just lead to

193
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:05,679
more suffering So this is a perilous way just turns out to lead to greater and

194
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:13,840
greater suffering Or maybe there's this way that's also perilous that we have this habit of uh

195
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:19,440
blaming others like just oh it's if this

196
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:25,919
I wish I could come up with an example right now Let's see I'm thinking of I know somebody who does this an awful lot

197
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:31,200
So somebody who has a tremendous practice but can't see the way in which

198
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:37,760
they are always like blaming others They have a certain amount of uh freedom and

199
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:44,320
inner knowledge but when something goes wrong they're always like "Oh that person

200
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,360
should have done this or this company should stop doing that or you know something like this." Instead of kind of

201
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:58,000
like turning around and seeing like "Oh well you know you have a role in things." And blaming is not a way

202
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,200
forward Maybe in the moment it feels good because we get to be self-righteous you

203
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:09,600
know I'm the right I'm doing everything right and those people over there or that person did something wrong But it

204
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:16,640
perpetuates perpetuates resentment or the sense of separation and doesn't

205
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:23,440
allow us to actually be with the discomfort It's a way in which we distract ourselves so often is to start

206
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,799
blaming But then we yeah the resentment gets uh

207
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:33,840
really really eats on us really eats one's

208
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:39,440
insides or maybe that uh there's this par

209
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:45,520
something that's perilous is that we really believe something is fundamentally wrong with us and we have

210
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:52,799
this deep shame or this inner critic is really loud and we believe it and we

211
00:22:52,799 --> 00:23:00,640
have this voice that's telling us that uh we're inadequate in some kind of way

212
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:07,840
And this of course is perilous because it kind of like closes the heart and closes the mind and causes us to kind of

213
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:14,640
shrink We don't have the confidence to maybe take risks and learn new things or

214
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:22,720
to see a bigger picture or something like this So I could go on with more ways in which

215
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:28,000
things are dubious and perilous but I don't want this to just be a long list

216
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,039
of all the terrible things But for me there's a way in which it

217
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:38,559
feels also a little bit freeing just to read like oh this is a human condition

218
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:45,760
This is what humans do It's not like a personal failing

219
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:51,039
So often like in this era of uh social media where we get a curated view of

220
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:56,960
people's lives we don't you know what they want us to see but the truth is

221
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:03,919
here so many people so many people I wanted to say everybody

222
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:09,760
I don't want to say I don't know everybody so I can't say that but I don't know of people who don't have

223
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:18,559
this So what do we do what do we do with this

224
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:26,480
so this path of practice is to acknowledge the first noble truth is there is duka and rather than turning

225
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:32,720
away from them can we acknowledge them

226
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:41,120
as best we can as best we can This is uncomfortable Just to say to notice like

227
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,559
to be with uncomfortableness and not distract ourselves not blame others not

228
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:52,000
blame ourselves not collapse into it but just to be able to say "Yeah this is

229
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:00,400
Stuka." And there's this way that when we give up beliefs that life will just be smooth

230
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:06,640
and comfortable when we give up that idea that it should be smooth and comfortable and that it's

231
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:12,559
smooth and comfortable for everybody else there's a way that there can be a certain amount of relaxation like right

232
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:18,720
okay it's just human This is what it means to be human is to have some of

233
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:26,000
these difficulties So what are some of the things that we can do when we do kind of a acknowledge

234
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,159
that there is dooka i'll I'll mention a few This this is a

235
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:38,440
really could be a really long list I'll just say a few things

236
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:45,760
Can we recognize expectations i talked about we're here on the

237
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:51,039
nearshore There's this expanse of water and then there's a far shore

238
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:58,880
So that we have this idea like oh I should be over there on the far shore and I'm not I'm over here

239
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,919
There's this way in which we could say this is type of expectations

240
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:11,039
So in this simile somebody is literally looking across water to the far shore But often what's happening is we have an

241
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:17,120
idea in our head It's just imagination It's just

242
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:22,880
something in our head about how things should be and then we have a

243
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,480
relationship with this imaginary thing and then we have what's actually

244
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:34,320
happening and then the expectations get laid on top and they don't match They never do

245
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:41,440
So just to notice oh yeah I'm making up this idea of how it is and I'm feeling

246
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:47,679
that discomfort from how it's not matching what's actually happening

247
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:53,440
as best you can notice your expectations and just say "Oh yep Those are thoughts

248
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:59,840
and what's actually happening is that I'm hungry." Or I I thought that uh I'd

249
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:05,279
be able to sit down for dinner but now I realize that the neighbor needs my help

250
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:11,279
right now and I'm going to go help And maybe there's a little bit of grumpiness there or crankiness or something because

251
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:17,919
you're hungry Instead of feeling like I really wanted to have dinner just realize oh yeah I'm

252
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,760
just hungry and this is what I'm doing now

253
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:29,279
And then this way in which we can meet this uh what's happening here on the

254
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:37,520
nearshore what's dubious and perilous is can we meet it as best we can with

255
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:43,200
care with warmth Can we welcome it as

256
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,960
best we can this is a tall order This is so much what practice is about is how

257
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:56,240
can we actually be with what's happening Meditation practice we would say is big

258
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:03,039
part of it is to just build the courage and the capacity to be present

259
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:10,640
in a warm-hearted way instead of saying dang it dang it dang it dang it just uh

260
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,480
being like "Oh wow Yeah this is hard." And just to acknowledge this is hard and

261
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:22,159
can we be okay with that i keep on saying as best we can because

262
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:28,159
what I'm pointing to is not something that's we're just going to start doing immediately or you know we'll change

263
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:34,559
everything tomorrow But there's this way that meditation practice really trains us this

264
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:41,200
non-resistance and presence and that turns out to be actually the

265
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:47,120
way to the far shore The way to let's say that we're at the

266
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:54,399
near shore might say is uh point A Some of you have heard me say this before And

267
00:28:54,399 --> 00:29:02,720
the far shore is point B where the peace and freedom is over there and the dooka is over here

268
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:11,760
How we get over there we could say the raft is to be completely at point A

269
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:18,559
is how we get to point B And how do we be completely what does that me even mean to be completely at

270
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:24,559
point A that means to let go of resistance of how things are let go of

271
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:30,799
this secret idea like yeah okay I'm gonna tolerate this but I hope it's going to be better in the next minute

272
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:35,880
Just saying yep this is how it is

273
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,000
And to help with that here's a poem I'd like to share

274
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,799
And this poem is by Rosemary Tramer a poet I'm often quoting

275
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:56,320
And um she's using the word love in this poem We could say just meeting without

276
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:01,600
any resistance as love It's complete uh

277
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:07,360
welcoming and allowing This poem has a little bit of chemistry

278
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:16,320
in it So for me it's like the dharma and poetry and chemistry It doesn't get better So for me this is a I don't know

279
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,679
may maybe my fellow a fellow chemist here will like it appreciate it as well

280
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:27,919
Okay here we go It's called love like water by Rosemary

281
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:33,520
Tramer Love like water

282
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:40,640
We could say the pain was a block so great it could not be moved

283
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,000
We could say love did not try to move it

284
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:53,919
Love simply dissolved the mass and surrounded it The way water meets a

285
00:30:53,919 --> 00:31:01,039
block of salt breaking apart each ionic bond until every atom of sodium and

286
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:09,200
chloride is surrounded by molecules of water And in this way and sooner than you'd

287
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:15,360
think the pain was rearranged into minuscule bits And there was no part of

288
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:22,960
the pain that was not touched by love The pain was no less It's true But mixed

289
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:29,440
with love dispersed the pain became something new

290
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:36,480
something vital that encouraged a different kind of life a substance that

291
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:44,360
supported buoyancy a medium to carry me

292
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:58,159
Rosemary Trauma is pointing to we don't need to change the pain but can we meet

293
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:03,919
it directly and the pain and us both get transformed

294
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:09,919
when we do that and this path of practice is all about

295
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:16,399
can we do this and meditation in the same way sometimes we're having bodily

296
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:22,720
discomfort or mental discomfort and as best we can we let go of the tanglements

297
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:28,320
we have with it or the stories we have and just come back to the object often

298
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:34,480
that object is the breath or come back to the anchor just come back as best we

299
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:39,760
can this is what's being asked of us in this

300
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,799
practice it turns out not to be really complicated

301
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:52,000
just not so I'll read this poem again

302
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,880
Love like water by Rosemary Tummer

303
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:05,039
We could say the pain was a block so great it could not be moved

304
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:13,200
We could say love did not try to move it Love simply dissolved the mass and

305
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:20,000
surrounded it the way water meets a block of salt breaking apart each ionic

306
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,679
bond until every atom of sodium and chloride is surrounded by molecules of

307
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:33,760
water And in this way and sooner than you'd think the pain was rearranged into

308
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:41,120
minuscule bits And there was no part of the pain that was not touched by love

309
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:48,960
The pain was no less It's true But mixed with love dispersed the pain became

310
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,559
something new something vital that encouraged a

311
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:59,919
different kind of life a substance that supported buoyancy

312
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,759
a medium to carry me

313
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:14,280
I think I'll end there and open it up to see if there's some questions or comments Thank you

314
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:29,200
If we're in a relationship or even a job or career and we find that it's causing

315
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:34,720
aggravation in some way or suffering in some way how do we know whether that we

316
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:40,320
need to find a new relationship or a new job or whether the issue is actually that we're just not being mindful and

317
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:46,079
present for what we're going through now do you have a sense what what would you

318
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:51,760
say it's tough because you know if you're suffering I'm I'm not always sure

319
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:57,839
whether it's something I I need to make a life change or if it's just me not

320
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:03,359
deal not with not with the right perspective in the current situation It's very challenging I find it to be

321
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:09,680
very challenging Yeah So there's a way in which uh we can have this idea about

322
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,800
what something a new relationship a new job or whatever it might be and there's

323
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:22,079
a way in which we're only uh focused on that in order to get away from this That

324
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,119
might be a clue that um cuz chances are

325
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:32,160
if we're not cuz let me say this while we're on the

326
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:37,760
nearshore the dubious and perilous and all this kind of stuff there's something that we often can learn we can learn

327
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:43,520
about ourselves I absolutely am not saying that we should stick in stay in

328
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:51,440
suffering or stick with the suffering but there can be a way in which we can learn and grow from suffering So this is

329
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:58,320
the question is to ask yourself is um is it just to get away from something

330
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:05,359
that's one question And the second and do I feel like there's something I can learn about myself here and if you feel

331
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:12,160
like nope I'm just uh I'm meeting this with a lot of freedom and I'm meeting

332
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:18,640
this with I have some clarity here and I'm seeking help from other people if necessary But this is just a really bad

333
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:25,280
situation my boundaries are getting crossed I'm being disrespected or you know something like this then it's time

334
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,800
to move on Is is that helpful

335
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:40,640
you're you're talking about this practitioner that tended to place blame

336
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:46,240
on other people And I guess my question is uh at certain points I found myself

337
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:53,119
the target of blame despite whatever efforts I make

338
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:59,599
the blame remains there Uh so I guess I'm just wondering any

339
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:06,000
guidance on how to be in a in in relationship with somebody

340
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:13,040
who who receives their view is blame Oh yeah Who blames you who blames you

341
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:21,920
well this person I'm thinking about sometimes blames me for things I try to think well what do I do uh

342
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:27,119
yeah It's funny I just think like oh isn't this interesting this person's blaming but I don't I don't know I don't

343
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:34,000
take it personally I just feel like oh this is the way that they're trying to deal with this discomfort And I don't

344
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,320
defend myself I just uh and I don't try to make it better or do something

345
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:45,520
different Uh I don't know if that's helpful at all but I just say like "Wow

346
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:52,000
okay So they must be uncomfortable because there's blaming going on here." And I don't defend myself because I just

347
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,160
feels like that just kind of like um it validates the blame in some way to even

348
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:03,359
start that conversation about don't blame me or something like that

349
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:06,480
Yeah Thank you

350
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,280
I think I'd be home Yeah

351
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:24,000
Um my question was with regards to navigating giving um advice to somebody

352
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:31,200
in a crisis situation So I tend to just tell them that um I think the best thing

353
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:37,760
to say to somebody would be that um there's a lot of hope for them I'm sorry

354
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:44,720
I didn't hear the last part that there's that there's hope in the future Oh that there's hope in the future Yeah So but

355
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:51,920
what you're saying is that you know not necessarily like you have to try to be um present in the moment Um but

356
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:59,520
sometimes that moment is so like such a crisis for them Yeah That I often

357
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:06,400
don't know how to navigate that Yeah Yeah Of course Right This is really difficult And what's being pointed to

358
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:12,480
here is to not pretend like it's a not a crisis Is to if it's a crisis to kind of

359
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:18,480
like acknowledge the crisis quality even though people often want to oh it's going to be fine Don't worry about it

360
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:26,000
It's going to be later So I'm not saying that we need to uh uh wallow around in

361
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:32,240
the difficulty but there's uh I know this like when uh my father died it was

362
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:37,599
it was kind of a relief when people actually said you know I'm sorry your

363
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:44,640
father died it was just instead of you know trying to tiptoe around and not knowing what to say it just felt like oh

364
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:51,200
okay yeah now now we're speaking authentically and instead Um yeah So

365
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:58,000
I'll say that this idea about hope for the future Um

366
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,560
I guess the language that I often use is we don't know exactly what the future

367
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:11,040
holds but we do know that things change And sometimes that feels like tangible

368
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:18,400
That feels like oh yeah we we all have this experience that things change We don't know exactly We don't know if it's

369
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:25,280
going to be better We don't actually know if it's going to be better but it will be different than how it is now

370
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:32,640
So you don't look convinced No I do That's

371
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:38,838
just my face Thank you You're welcome

372
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:45,880
Does anybody else have a comment or question

373
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:01,520
okay Okay So thank you for your attention and I'm wishing you a

374
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:08,119
wonderful rest of the evening and safe drive home Thank you

375
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,039
Good
