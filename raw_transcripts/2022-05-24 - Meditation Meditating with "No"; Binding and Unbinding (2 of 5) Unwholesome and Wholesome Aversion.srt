1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:10,559
so hello everyone and welcome to our meditation

2
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:16,800
and um yesterday

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,400
meditation i recommended the word yes

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,720
as an expression of an affirmation and a confidence in the practice

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,880
today i'd like to offer the word no and uh

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:42,239
and the word no to say no to something not this can be done with love love for oneself

7
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,920
love for the situation not as a hostility towards anything

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:55,760
but a wise caring for the whole situation and in the context of meditation

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,359
some of you have meditated for a long time and you're probably very familiar

10
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,560
with movements of your mind thoughts and ideas and

11
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:13,520
maybe even certain attitudes that you have that are not really don't really serve you or

12
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,680
sir doesn't really serve the world that they're not healthy not helpful

13
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,880
in fact they are might be detrimental or a waste of time

14
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,200
and so to recognize that and you know and to say no that's not

15
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:38,479
what i'm going to do now no thank you or

16
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:45,759
not now or no you know again no thank you

17
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,200
it doesn't have to be harsh it doesn't have to be hostile

18
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,439
it doesn't have to be proof that you're doing something wrong or proof that you're somehow

19
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,439
you know a bad person because your mind has done what it does the mind does all kinds of

20
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:11,039
things that we don't have to identify with but we do have the choice to say i don't

21
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,959
have to be involved with that there's no need to be if we don't identify you don't live in

22
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:23,040
those thoughts those attitudes we can at least

23
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,160
and then step back and say no i don't have to pick that up i don't have to be involved in that

24
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,840
not now no thank you and uh and have clarity about this no

25
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,560
no and then come back and be with a practice be with a practice

26
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,319
and when the mind starts you see the mind going off to do these other things again

27
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,360
say no in a way where the attitude of the no the

28
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,519
word no is expressed in a way that feels

29
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:04,159
healthy that feels caring that feels friendly to the situation

30
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:09,519
and um so that when you finish saying no it isn't that you feel like you're harsh

31
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:16,000
or curt or something you feel oh yeah that was good to not choose to go in that

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,640
direction there's more valuable things to do

33
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,280
so to say no to

34
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:34,640
a slumping posture by taking an upright alert posture

35
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,400
or your equivalent depending on what posture you're in

36
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,799
a posture that evokes a certain kind of healthy

37
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,879
alertness in the body

38
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:00,120
not tense or stressed but alert

39
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:11,959
and to lower your gaze relax the focus of the eyes

40
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,720
and to gently close the eyes

41
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:35,520
and as a affirmation of being here and now at this time in this place

42
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,320
you might take a few long slow deep breaths

43
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,280
long slow deep breaths

44
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,840
exhaling as relaxing as you exhale

45
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:19,840
and then letting your breathing return to normal and it can be an affirmation

46
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:26,800
of being present here and now to go through your body to relax it

47
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,638
relax the muscles of your face

48
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,599
relaxing the shoulders

49
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:50,360
relaxing the chest softening in the heart area

50
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,560
and softening the belly

51
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,639
perhaps as you exhale relaxing the whole body

52
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,759
so the weight of gravity and the weight of your body the pull of

53
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:24,319
gravity and the weight of your body becomes a gentle affirmation

54
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:31,800
here now is a time and place to be

55
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:41,120
and also maybe relaxing any mental tension

56
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:49,840
pressure to think maybe now as a gentle no

57
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,199
not now this is not

58
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,880
healthy or useful to continue with the tension and the

59
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:08,960
pressure of the mind and to whatever degree it's possible

60
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,479
soften and relax the mind

61
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,240
and then to gently settle into

62
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:36,240
the body breathing settle into the moment here and now

63
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:50,159
and when you find yourself wandering off in thoughts or having attitudes which are not helpful

64
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,960
see if you can find a loving way to say no

65
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,680
not now not this

66
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,280
and no that protects you from pouring your life energy into

67
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:21,440
those thoughts those attitudes maybe even those feelings

68
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:30,160
and instead this valuable life energy that we have

69
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,959
to let it go into awareness attention here and now

70
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:46,200
breathing breathing in and breathing out

71
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:36,080
a gentle loving no to step away from

72
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,440
preoccupations fantasies

73
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,320
attitudes that are not helpful right now

74
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:55,039
to step away and then if affirmation a yes for here

75
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,919
and now in the practice

76
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,960
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

77
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,640
to consider how our capacity to

78
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:06,799
say no or not this capacity to

79
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:14,799
turn away from unhealthy and unhelpful states of mind and activities

80
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:21,840
how it protects people others

81
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:27,679
from our words our actions

82
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,200
that are harmful

83
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:39,360
to ourselves and to others and how the ability to turn away from

84
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,480
harmful tendencies gives us the opportunity to turn towards

85
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:52,159
what is beneficial to recognize benefit

86
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:59,360
to recognize discover where we can meet the world with friendliness and kindness

87
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,640
care compassion

88
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:11,520
and so as we come to the end of this sitting to do so to turn our attention now

89
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,559
outwards to the people we know and don't know out in the world

90
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:23,520
people suffering from poverty and war and oppression

91
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:29,200
racism hate hate

92
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:36,320
and to all people to wish them well

93
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,640
to wish them to be free of their suffering

94
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:48,720
internal and external may all beings

95
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:55,360
be happy may all beings be safe

96
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:03,760
may all beings be peaceful may all beings be free

97
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:10,320
and may the influence of our meditation are collectively and individually

98
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:17,640
spread out into the world today for the welfare and happiness of all

99
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:35,039
[Music]

100
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,039
so

101
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:19,600
so today i'm going to talk about the second of the five by bindings the ways

102
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,640
that we get bounded up caught tied up

103
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:33,039
and the second of the five untyings things that loosen us and free us

104
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,799
and um the um

105
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:44,240
and uh so the second of the findings

106
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:50,480
is hostility and the second of what unbinds us it's

107
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:57,279
related it's a compliment to that is uh to

108
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:03,120
restrain ourselves to avoid to turn away from

109
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:09,279
things that are harm producing so both of them can involve turning away

110
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:15,519
from something and so the word version

111
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:22,480
if often in english we think of aversion as being a kind of hostility but it comes from the

112
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,760
word avert which means it turned away from and

113
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:34,960
so there's two ways of averting there's a way to do the hostility and there's a way to do it with

114
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,240
wisdom and care and recognition of what really is beneficial here

115
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:45,679
and what is not and both movements are should be known

116
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:52,640
the hostile one we should really be able to be to recognize how it's harmful for us

117
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:58,640
when we have acts of aversion which are hostile or have ill will as part of it

118
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:04,799
it's considered to be a poison uh for ourselves or a way of to burn

119
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:11,360
ourselves like you touch uh put your hand in a fire you burn yourself put your hand in the fire of hostility

120
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:18,240
and you get burned and uh and sometimes hostility

121
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:24,080
is or ill-will can feel justified sometimes it can feel good there's like power there there's

122
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:30,000
energy there sometimes there's a very strong affirmation

123
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,559
of conceit of self concern of identity in creating a strong sense of separation

124
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:42,320
like that's wrong that's bad and extreme one form it takes is in

125
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:47,919
racism where uh there's hostility towards another race

126
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:54,960
and in do having that hostility it's an affirmation of my specialness that i'm special that

127
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,720
i'm something good and kind of creating an identity in

128
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,399
opposition to other people and so hostility as much as it burns

129
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:13,919
people there's a confusion about it where some people go towards hostility to ill will because

130
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:19,600
they feel it's justified they feel the certain kind of pleasure from it

131
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:26,799
at the same time as they're being hurt by it and hurting others by it and so the um

132
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:32,559
to begin to recognize the impact that ill will has on ourselves is one of the

133
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:39,440
great possibilities of meditation resentment is a kind of ill will towards others

134
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,799
that when you sit and meditate you feel how much it harms oneself

135
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:50,480
in fact in when you're sitting in meditation to be simmering in resentment um

136
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:56,240
as clearly you're not causing any harm to the person you're resenting

137
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:02,240
in some ways if you've been hurt by someone else you're enabling that

138
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:08,720
hurtful behavior to hurt you hurt you even more and more because you're kind of repeating and

139
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:16,079
reinforcing the the pain of resentment in a way that is um you know continuous

140
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:22,638
continues to hurt i don't want to diminish the importance of care and attention to

141
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:28,560
things like resentment i don't want to diminish the fact that people do do things that

142
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:34,878
are wrong that bring us cause us to have ill will or resentment or hostility towards

143
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:40,638
others what i like to say is does it doesn't justify the wrong

144
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:46,158
it just means that what i'm trying to say is there's a better way there's a better way of living a life

145
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:53,200
than being living a life that is motivated by hostility hatred and that can take care of ourselves and

146
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,800
take care of the world uh just fine and one of those ways

147
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:05,920
is to avert ourselves from doing harm avert ourselves from the

148
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:12,560
internal movements of mind that are self-inflicted hurt to ourselves

149
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:19,119
so for example the poison of the fire of hostility harms ourselves

150
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:24,160
sometimes hostility is directed towards ourselves and then we can people can be very

151
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:30,079
critical to themselves and and so this kind of behavior is

152
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:38,400
something to avert oneself from to say no i don't need to do this this is not useful helpful healthy to do

153
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:45,359
no thank you and and what some of the ways in which this a healthier verting is done in buddhist

154
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:52,800
practice that traditionally is a very strong emphasis on is the practice of restraint

155
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:59,040
that we hold our tongue we hold our physically our body in such a way that

156
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:06,320
we don't punch anyone out we don't do anything physically with our body that will harm anybody else

157
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:11,440
and and restraining this way requires

158
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,720
mindfulness and it strengthens the mindfulness muscle to uh

159
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:24,320
it can require a lot of commitment to really kind of track oneself and stay present and not speak not

160
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:30,960
blurt something out that's hostile no i'm not going to speak i'm not going to say that

161
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:37,119
and and so to a practice of restraint the practice of avoiding

162
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:44,640
abstaining so if we feel like we're going to break one of the precepts that we're going to kill or steal or

163
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:51,119
cause sexual or sexual activities and cause harm harm other people if we're going to lie

164
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:57,599
if we're going to intoxicate the mind that there's where averting and saying no

165
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,640
restraint avoidance abstaining averting no

166
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:08,000
i have better things to do this is not useful this is not going in a good way

167
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:16,000
and there's a lot of inner strength that can be built up in restraint in avoiding in

168
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,760
turning away you know it could be starting can be something as simple as

169
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:28,240
avoiding opening up the refrigerator to have a snack when you don't need a snack you've had plenty of snacks you know

170
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:35,040
it's not useful to have more and and develop that capacity to say no

171
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:42,079
to change directions to avoid getting involved in that direction in an unhealthy direction

172
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:47,280
this develops a lot of inner strength inner strength that is

173
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:53,359
not meant to be not not punitive it's not harsh it's not critical

174
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:59,440
it's actually a kind of done the right way it strengthens our love

175
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:05,040
our good will our care for ourselves and others

176
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:12,480
and um and so uh we have to be a little bit careful with the language of

177
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:19,359
um using the in in buddhist english using the word aversion because

178
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:25,280
sometimes people believe that any averting away any saying no not this

179
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:31,280
is somehow a negative form of aversion that should be avoided that somehow in buddhist practice we're

180
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:38,640
supposed to just practice accepting mindfulness of everything be present and accept things and hold things and and

181
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:44,560
somehow not ever say no to anything but just be with things

182
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:51,359
certainly there's time and place when practice mindfulness is strong when the mindfulness overrides the

183
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:57,359
tendency to get involved with unhealthy states of mind where it can be very

184
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:02,480
powerful and very significant to just hold it in accepting mindfulness

185
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:08,240
but we do it because we know that we're not going to act on these impulses

186
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:15,440
but there is a definitely a time to say no not this not now and

187
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:22,480
and in fact the practice of mindfulness increases our capacity to recognize what

188
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:29,200
is not useful and not pick it up not be involved in it not go down that road don't need to do

189
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:34,560
that so um two powerful movements

190
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:40,240
potentially very powerful movements of averting one towards hostility

191
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:45,920
and one is an expression of of kindness of goodwill towards oneself

192
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:52,320
and others and there can be power in hostility that's why some people love

193
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:58,880
it and there but there can also be power in this healthy averting

194
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:04,400
and some people are afraid of that power that strength but this is one of the things that we

195
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:10,000
can develop in this practice and it's easier to develop that power and strength

196
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,680
if if we know what kind of averting is healthy and helpful for oneself and for

197
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,880
others and then oh you know no i'm not doing that

198
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,079
and as we become stronger it becomes easier to

199
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:32,000
to not get involved not pick up things it's almost like as we become

200
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,800
stronger we're not so easily influenced

201
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:45,040
by the impulses that we have we still might have them but they don't land anywhere they don't get picked up

202
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:53,280
anywhere because of that strength because we have something else going strength of mindfulness strength of care

203
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,480
so the

204
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,920
so you might for this next day look upon

205
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,960
all the movements that you have that are averting movements where you're turning

206
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:15,040
away from one way and in order to do another way or just turning away from one way not to do it

207
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:20,240
and see if you can recognize the distinction between when it's done with hostility

208
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:25,920
frustration ill will irritation and

209
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:31,920
when it's done with care with maybe even love or wisdom

210
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:38,240
with a clear sense of doing what is helpful and beneficial and hopefully you'll see these

211
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:44,720
difference with these two forms of averting and you'll see that the healthier verting feels good

212
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:51,520
that it's beneficial in and of itself to do that movement to act on that kind of

213
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:59,599
so i hope you enjoy a day of

214
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:05,599
healthy averting and and the study of how this works

215
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:10,599
and for you thank you
