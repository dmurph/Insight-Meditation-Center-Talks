1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:06,560
so good morning hello everyone

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:13,920
welcome so for this morning's meditation I would like to evoke

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:21,359
a maybe an experience from some of your childhoods if you have ever been on a

4
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:28,759
seesaw as a child but standing in the middle uh and either side of the

5
00:00:28,759 --> 00:00:36,600
fulcrum and uh and try to find the balance so that both sides of the Seesaw

6
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:44,600
are parallel to the ground sometimes getting there takes some muscles to you know to push one way

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,960
or the other but when you find the midpoint and you're able to stand there

8
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,239
with the Seesaw balanced uh there's no longer a lot of

9
00:00:55,239 --> 00:01:01,399
effort needed maybe just a little bit of adjustment um

10
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:08,439
with the uh um little bit of adjustments with just the weight little bit but it's very

11
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:16,040
little so in meditation we can find that balance point that stands

12
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,720
between Pleasure and Pain between what's comfortable and not

13
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:31,520
comfortable where we're not leaning into the pain or pulling in away from leaning

14
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,799
into the pain or leaning into the pleasure leaning into the um leaning

15
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:45,960
away from the pain leaning away from the pleasure um we're not if you go in

16
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:52,920
meditation towards the pleasure too much the whole seesaw

17
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,840
tips if you go to attack the pain the cisa

18
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:05,759
tips but there's a place of standing in the middle the balance point where

19
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:14,120
mindfulness has the greatest ability to become clear clearing the fog clearing the air

20
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:21,599
clearing the heart and mind completely connected to either side because that's

21
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:29,360
where the balance point is so it's not avoiding anything but

22
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,239
it's also not picking it up or going towards it or reacting to

23
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:40,959
it being balanced in the middle of it all and clearly

24
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:48,120
seeing and for today it's the midpoint between comfort and discomfort Pleasure

25
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:54,200
and Pain so to assume a meditation

26
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,840
posture and to

27
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,799
gently close your

28
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:18,000
eyes and feel the weight of your body against whatever supporting your

29
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:27,879
body maybe imagining that the support points is the midpoint of the

30
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,599
seaw and maybe be adjusting your weight a little bit your posture so that you

31
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,439
feel more balanced on that those pressure

32
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:48,159
points maybe as you exhale to settling into those pressure

33
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,920
points of

34
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:03,280
support gently maybe lovingly taking some little bit deeper breaths

35
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:10,920
just deep enough to feel a richer connection to yourself your

36
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,160
body and to relax the body as you

37
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720
exhale

38
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:43,160
letting your breathing return to

39
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:53,120
normal and continue to relax on the exhale but imagine you're relaxing e

40
00:04:53,120 --> 00:05:01,800
equally evenly on either side of your body so relaxing the shoulders both

41
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,840
together so there's a settling maybe into the midpoint the balance

42
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,320
point between

43
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,520
them relaxing in the

44
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:33,240
chest equally on both rib cages throughout the

45
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:42,600
diaphragm perhaps settling relaxing into the midpoint of the

46
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,160
chest balance

47
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,639
point on the exhale softening in the belly

48
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:09,280
equally on both sides of the body both sides of the

49
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,880
belly maybe relaxing on the sides of the

50
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:31,560
waist relaxing into the midpoint

51
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:42,000
maybe if you're sitting in a cushion or a chair there might be some sense of

52
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:51,599
relaxing into the tailbone where the tailbone gets close to the chair the

53
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,120
cushion the

54
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
midpoint

55
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,919
and then on the exhale on the inhale feel your thinking

56
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:20,759
mind whatever you associate with the energy or tension pressure of

57
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:28,520
thinking whatever is physically activated around thinking feel it on the

58
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:36,840
inhale and on the exhale Relax The Thinking

59
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:52,520
mind and relaxing evenly on both sides of the

60
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
Mind

61
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:23,400
relaxing and thinking mind so you can relax into a midpoint

62
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:31,440
Center where the Mind itself maybe feels balanced at ease

63
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,080
if the mind is resting in the easy chair of the

64
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:58,959
brain the mind can know and be aware without getting up from that chair

65
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:05,399
to look at anything or get away from

66
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:11,399
anything or follow anything like follow the

67
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:24,040
thoughts thinking mind resting at the center balanced at the

68
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:31,360
center doesn't go out and doesn't go in

69
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:39,920
but stand spanning in and out so whatever comes to awareness is

70
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,480
known without being for or

71
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
against

72
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:12,640
with some sense of a body being balanced on the Seesaw of

73
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,680
Life the heart

74
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:31,320
balancing and the mind balanced

75
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:41,959
without become not going towards or going away without trying to fix or

76
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:47,000
to hold

77
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:55,800
on there's pleasure and there's pain there's things that feel Pleasant

78
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:01,240
and unpleasant

79
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:08,800
stay in the balance point stay rooted in the

80
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:18,120
Middle where there's balance and a possibility of clarity of

81
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
seeing

82
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
for

83
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
for

84
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
for

85
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,199
have you already left the balance

86
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:33,000
point tipping and in the direction of thinking or

87
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:52,160
reacting stay close to your body your heart your

88
00:13:52,959 --> 00:14:01,040
mind so all three are lined up balanced on the Seesaw of love

89
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
life

90
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
for

91
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
for

92
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
for

93
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:26,399
when we're balanced in the playground seesaw we have to have a certain

94
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,959
continuous awareness of our

95
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:39,839
balance so when we're balanced the Seesaw of Pleasure and

96
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:47,920
Pain there needs to be a relaxed continuous Clarity of

97
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:55,240
mind that knows how the system is tipping towards

98
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:01,120
one or the other and in The

99
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,839
Knowing staying

100
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
balanced

101
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
for

102
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
for

103
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
for

104
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
for

105
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
for

106
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
for

107
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
for

108
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
for

109
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
for

110
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
for

111
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

112
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
for

113
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

114
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
for

115
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,039
and then as we come to the end of this

116
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:56,640
sitting to find the midpoint the balance

117
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:03,200
point between comfort and

118
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,120
discomfort between wanting and not

119
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:23,520
wanting and that midpoint to be balanced there is a significant way

120
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:31,278
to hold yourself in respect to respect

121
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:36,840
yourself your value your

122
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:42,520
presence and it's also a very significant way from which to be respect

123
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:48,720
other people to respect the dignity the value

124
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,360
the autonomy of others where we can care for them deeply

125
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:59,679
love them but we're not tipping the

126
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,720
Seesaw sliding towards them or away from

127
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:14,240
them not over involved or under involved but beol in involved with

128
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,240
respect in that balance

129
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:33,159
point and as we end is sitting to from that place of

130
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:38,760
balance from a place of

131
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:46,200
respect care and appreciation of

132
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:53,480
others to wish them well to have our heart

133
00:26:53,480 --> 00:27:00,240
radiate with goodness generosity respect

134
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:06,919
May others be

135
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,720
happy May others be

136
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:20,080
safe may others be

137
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:23,600
peaceful May

138
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:30,158
others be free

139
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:39,000
and may the way in which I stay balanced each of us stays

140
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,039
balanced may we contribute to the welfare and happiness of all

141
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:52,679
beings may we support others to be balanced and strong in

142
00:27:52,679 --> 00:28:00,120
themselves may all beings be happy

143
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:10,740
[Music]

144
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,120
thank

145
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,120
you

146
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,039
right

147
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,039
e

148
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:40,640
so good morning good day to our second talk

149
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:46,240
on mindfulness of grasping of

150
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:54,480
clinging and today there's many synonyms or many members of this family of

151
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:02,880
attachment and one of them is compulsion uh and to be acting on compulsion means

152
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:09,279
that we're not quite in charge and we're not quite involved with

153
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:16,640
uh uh the choices we make and in extreme forms it can be called

154
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,880
addiction and some people have addictions with the words they speak

155
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:29,320
with um the things that they do there's a compulsive quality to them and um some

156
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:34,880
people lose themselves in the activity they do and so the Buddha was addressing this

157
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,559
very directly and um and he wanted us to be

158
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:48,960
mindful of the whole dynamics of how compulsion grasping attachment arises in

159
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:56,600
us and um and so clinging and grasping are not abstract ideas they are

160
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:02,120
physiological events that occur within us we can feel you

161
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:07,600
know in some ways or other I'd like to propose that generally when we tense up

162
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:14,000
in our body we're actually grasping to something maybe it feels necessary if we

163
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,120
want to be safe in some situations but chronic

164
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,600
tension uh is not about the immediate safety in the situation chronic tension

165
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:31,240
has to do with grasping or clinging or attach M sticking to certain kinds of

166
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:38,919
ideas or beliefs or attitudes or feelings that we have and uh so sometimes the compulsion

167
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:44,360
is so strong I can feel like there's we're stuck to something you know we have the

168
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:49,559
expression in English uh to be stuck to stuck on some topic some idea some

169
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:58,600
feeling and um so the attachment is strong so uh so the it's a physiological

170
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:05,159
event as well as a mental event and an emotional event the Ecology of grasping

171
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:10,279
compulsion is what we start becoming aware of as our mindfulness increases

172
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:17,559
and develops it's kind of a natural thing as the mindfulness becomes more sensitive we become sensitive to where

173
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:24,720
the tensions are where the contractions are where the pushings are where the where the restlessness is that's all

174
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:31,440
symptoms of this compulsion and um so one area of compulsion that's

175
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:38,919
uh uh very common for many people maybe everyone is around um what's Pleasant

176
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:44,799
and unpleasant Pleasure and Pain comfort and discomfort and this for the Buddha

177
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:51,960
is a second of the five bundles of clinging that humans uh collect so it's

178
00:32:51,960 --> 00:33:00,200
one thing to to uh uh have an to want to have um

179
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:05,639
you know something sweet to eat and that's fine but there's also compulsion

180
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:12,960
to have it where something takes over and and we just not just have one we have two three four of some sweets

181
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:21,440
because something has taken over and we're automatic pilot and each Act of compulsion is a

182
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:28,360
new grasping onto something clinging to it and so we're Gathering Together

183
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:34,360
these bundles and some people live with these bundles of clinging of compulsion

184
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:39,880
so it isn't just for something sweet but it's also for um certain kind of

185
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:45,440
Pleasures certain kind of delights certain kinds of um clinging to

186
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:51,080
avoiding discomfort at all costs and going to Great Lengths to make ourselves

187
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:58,399
comfortable in situations some people are more oriented to comfort and discomfort than others

188
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:03,679
um maybe a kind of sensual sensuous kind of person maybe I don't know exactly

189
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:10,679
what kind and maybe shouldn't even say it that way but some people are more oriented to this way and but everyone is

190
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:17,280
to some degree and there might be many things that were gathering together into these bundles of

191
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:24,638
attachments bundles of compulsivity and uh it just takes the slightest little uh change in the

192
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:31,000
circumstance we're in where the compulsion is ready to act up and um and

193
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:37,679
so uh to start becoming mindful of our relationship to the pleasant and the

194
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:46,000
unpleasant to comfort and discomfort to um uh and uh and in many

195
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:53,638
ways that's very fundamental to the human um mind is to somehow be reacting

196
00:34:53,639 --> 00:35:01,520
to Pleasant and unpleasant wanting more pleasant getting away from the unpleasant uh attacking the unpleasant

197
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:07,680
uh some people push away the pleasant um there something they have some association with the pleasant that

198
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,960
that's wrong maybe in some kind of way uh to feel the pleasant experience some

199
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,839
religious teachings seem to get people thinking that they're not supposed to experience

200
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:25,320
pleasure and so to uh um but in some ways it's kind of always operating you

201
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:32,280
sit down in a chair and it's a little uncomfortable you want to make yourself comfortable you sit you uh you go into a

202
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:37,960
room of people you look around to see where is it comfortable to sit and uncomfortable based on the people who

203
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:45,000
are there and um and might be more complicated assessment going on but for

204
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:53,880
some people it's just a simple sense of Pleasure and Pain that's is operating there and um and it can drive a lot of

205
00:35:53,880 --> 00:36:00,240
behavior um some Behavior people will spend days sometimes planning ahead to

206
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:06,800
have a certain kind of pleasure uh or go to a greater extent to avoid a certain kind of discomfort that

207
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:13,640
they don't want to deal with um sometimes it's more complicated like with people who are conflict avoidant it

208
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:20,680
might be more complicated than simply avoiding pleasure uh discomfort but some of it just might be avoiding discomfort

209
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:25,800
they just I don't want to be uncomfortable there are beliefs that people have around comfort and

210
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:32,000
discomfort or Pleasure and Pain some people feel like they're a failure like some they've done something wrong

211
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,440
that they're experiencing unpleasantness in their life and they have to fix that

212
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:44,760
at all costs to kind of prove that they're kind of a worthy person or a successful person or having a good life

213
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:51,680
other people um uh their sense of self gets validated

214
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:58,800
when there's a lot of pleasure um a lot of joy and then they've uh it kind of masks Maybe some deeper anxiety that

215
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,079
they carry and but they like who they are when there's a lot of pleasure but when there's no pleasure there're then

216
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:10,640
they're left with something deeper about themselves that they're not comfortable with so

217
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:17,319
um um and now some people identified very strongly with discomfort some people

218
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:25,560
actually look for discomfort look for pain want to have it and it's certain kind of odd way because it's so familiar

219
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:31,160
maybe they grown up in a way that's always their companion and on the surface they don't want to have it there

220
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:36,599
but they don't know who they are without it that's how they've navigated the world how they've set up even their

221
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:41,960
social relationships is around their their pain or their difficulty they have

222
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:48,640
and so people get attached to these things and they're attached to a lot and this is for the Buddha it isn't just we

223
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:54,200
grab onto one thing we're grabbing onto lots of them over and over again and we

224
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:59,359
live carrying these bundles of attachments and

225
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:05,640
um and uh and so the Buddha that's you know the second of the five bundles the

226
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:12,359
condas often called Aggregates and um and so for practicing

227
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:19,440
with that uh it's Central to inside practice to start becoming mindful of

228
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,760
how things are Pleasant and unpleasant uh so that we can see whether

229
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:31,760
or not we're reacting to the Pleasant un Pleasant some because some there's a lot

230
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:38,119
of human reactivity a lot of human uh motivations that are built on the very

231
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:43,599
simple idea that something is pleasant and unpleasant um I I kind of suspect that

232
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:49,359
some political philosophies had their start and someone thought something out

233
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:56,359
in this world was unpleasant for them and so they wanted to build a whole philosophy to get that to go away and

234
00:38:56,359 --> 00:39:03,599
not be there so that they could be more comfortable um occasionally it's that

235
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:10,200
that basic to some of the more complicated sophisticated things people are doing I've known people who've done

236
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:15,359
uh you know great pieces of Science and they said that but basically they're

237
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:20,520
pursuing pleasure they find a tremendous pleasure and Delight in in their work

238
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:28,160
pleasure of the mind and that's what keeps them going and that doesn't mean there's attachment pleasure and uh is a

239
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,240
beautiful wonderful part of life and uh when it's there without attachment and

240
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:40,760
without causing any harm to anyone uh there's no reason not to allow ourselves to feel the full extent of the pleasure

241
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:46,359
and that comes into play in meditation with a deeper more concentrated

242
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:53,079
meditation um there's a lot of pleasure that happens and um and the idea is to

243
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:58,599
experience it without any um for or against without any attachment not to

244
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:05,079
make another bundle of grasping around meditative pleasure as we would many other

245
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:12,640
things so to sit quietly in meditation being mindful of what is settling into

246
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:18,720
what is relaxing into what is here with time we start seeing we start

247
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:25,079
feeling uh how we're reacting how we're clinging how we're want we're for or

248
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:33,319
against thing we're leaning this way and that way way how we lose our balance point how we lose that quiet Still Point

249
00:40:33,319 --> 00:40:40,440
in the middle that is where we come Al a certain thing comes alive so if we're balanced on the

250
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:47,440
playground seesaw and the Seesaw is parallel to the ground there has to be a continuous

251
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:54,200
wakefulness to staying there present it's uh most people who might be sleepy

252
00:40:54,200 --> 00:41:00,400
probably their sleepiness goes away or dullness in the mind goes away way if they manag to find that balance point on

253
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:07,079
the playground seesaw and um so there's something about waking up

254
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:12,200
to that balance point inside of us that can see and know clearly what's

255
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:17,760
happening um and can feel the difference between leaning forward and leaning back

256
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:25,480
literally leaning forward leaning back when we're we kind of cringe we pull back we lean forward we feel happy and

257
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:34,079
there's nothing again wrong with that it's instinctual sometimes but it's the early warning sign that oh now there's

258
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:40,880
possibility that uh compulsivity happens grasping happens um that we're getting

259
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:46,640
stuck on something and um so to see

260
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:52,680
mindfulness as uh being uh being in that balance point

261
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:57,800
between Pleasure and Pain between the pleasant and the unpleasant between

262
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:04,319
comfort and discomfort and it's a fantastic thing to

263
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:11,040
for the wakefulness the clarity of mind to be strong enough that we're not

264
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:17,319
caught in the orbit of anything it's almost as if we can see clearly what's

265
00:42:17,319 --> 00:42:22,839
happening where the clarity is not caught in what's happening some people

266
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:28,920
call it observing there's an observing mind that has a balance and

267
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:36,920
Clarity and so we can find ourselves in the Seesaw of Life balanced and wise

268
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:43,040
because of that so thank you I hope that

269
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:51,559
um the the this talk this these talks this week this week will give you some

270
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:59,119
inspiration to respectfully uh uh

271
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:06,720
kindly curiously look at how you grasp how you cling how you're attached how

272
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:14,440
you lean One Direction Another how you lean into for and against things and now for today just a very

273
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:21,200
simple thing of pleasure Pleasant and unpleasant Pleasure and Pain comfort and discomfort

274
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:26,720
how do you react to that how do you live with that is there in fact some compuls

275
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:32,200
compul impulsivity that you have around this and you might think ahead through

276
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:38,599
the day and and kind of consider where during the day are you most likely to be

277
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:43,920
caught up in the issues of pleas Pleasant and unpleasant so you prepare

278
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:50,520
yourself as you go into that situation to remain Mindful and try to understand it

279
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:54,240
better so thank

280
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,040
