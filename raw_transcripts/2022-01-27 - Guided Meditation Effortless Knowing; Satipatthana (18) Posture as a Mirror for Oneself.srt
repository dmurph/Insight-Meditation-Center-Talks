1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,200
so hello again from irc and site retreat retreat center

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:12,639
and um today i'd like to continue with this

3
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:18,960
practice of knowing and [Music] it's important to appreciate there's a

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:26,000
range of maybe intensities of knowing or range of

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,760
ways we know sometimes it's very intentional and directed

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,840
and sometimes it's uh unintentional

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,040
and undirected if

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,160
sometimes in practice when it begins most people a lot of people find it helpful to have a directed practice just

9
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,680
focusing on their breath for a while and that focusing on the breath kind of allows things to gather and settle

10
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,680
around it and so that um and so that we uh

11
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:06,479
um um you know and uh so we're not so easily distracted and mind doesn't

12
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,560
wonder so much and when the mind is stable that's when uh that that's when it's be

13
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,560
useful when to lessen less directed knowing and in a certain kind of way less

14
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,400
intentional um uh less not a knowing that has any quality of

15
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,920
work to it or any quality of of um

16
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,479
doing it but rather it's a knowing that just arise just is

17
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:43,600
and so to give you a little maybe a taste of this i know we just haven't even started meditating

18
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,280
but if you just close your eyes the way you are now

19
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:57,520
and um and when you make no effort

20
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,439
to be aware but you're awake you're not falling asleep

21
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,079
what do you know

22
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,959
when when awareness is not directed anywhere

23
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,840
what is known what comes into awareness

24
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,000
is it the sound of my voice

25
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,319
are there sensations in your body or in the environments sounds in the

26
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,319
environment

27
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:58,720
not preferring or directing attention any one direction but in a sense just being open

28
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,200
to the obvious

29
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,680
sensation experience that comes into awareness

30
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,080
in the most simple form

31
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:28,239
in relationship to simple sensations

32
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,840
the direct sensations of the moment

33
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,200
and the knowing which is no not any work

34
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,480
it's just an openness of mine to let things be known

35
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,080
as they appear in their own way there's no control

36
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,319
over what is being experienced

37
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,519
perhaps the only thing you can do you do is relax

38
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,959
if you notice that you're knowing

39
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:24,280
has a certain fixation on anything relax

40
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,120
if you're mostly aware of something in particular

41
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:40,479
maybe a strong sensation chances are other things appear together

42
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:46,000
with it or in little moments in between

43
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,199
in a sense the knowing follows

44
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:08,600
the trail of what arises what appears

45
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:40,879
and if you settle into your body relax into your body

46
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:48,080
relaxing the shoulders

47
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,639
relaxing the belly

48
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,080
relaxing the arms and hands

49
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,960
even the fingers

50
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,520
relaxing the thighs

51
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,240
calves

52
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,840
all the way down to the feet

53
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,360
perhaps relaxing in the face

54
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,840
softening around the eyes the jaws

55
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:19,280
and with the awareness open now just open and receptive to the

56
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:26,919
sensations of your body anywhere in the body

57
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:38,960
what sensations arise which are then known without any work

58
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,639
without any directedness

59
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,240
the knowing might not be verbal

60
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:01,120
it might be deeper some people might say intuitive knowing

61
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,360
of sensations as they appear

62
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,840
there is a kind of natural knowing of their presence

63
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,440
and no need to linger with any sensation

64
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:45,680
no need to think about anything simply

65
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:52,720
each fleeting sensation that appears maybe disappears and

66
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,720
reappears

67
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:03,760
the coming and going and different sensations

68
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:10,399
as they arise see if you can notice

69
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:17,120
almost an almost effortless knowing that knowing

70
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,480
for which you don't need to make any effort

71
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:32,760
your effort is simply to stay receptive and present in your body

72
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:38,160
if you're thinking about things or living your preferences or

73
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,279
reacting to your sensations

74
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,640
all that is

75
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,880
different than the sensations themselves

76
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:03,519
if you live in the preferences reactions thinking

77
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:11,279
you might miss the dance

78
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:18,160
of sensations in your body as they appear and disappear

79
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:25,360
as they appear and then another appears another appears

80
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,440
some don't disappear so easily

81
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:41,120
but are followed by some different sensation

82
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,120
sometimes a surprise where they appear in the body

83
00:12:52,639 --> 00:13:01,360
not directing attention holding attention anywhere except for the whole body is a organ

84
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,600
of receptivity

85
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:25,120
and because the breathing is one of the bigger movements when the body is not moving otherwise

86
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,320
chances are that the sensations of breathing

87
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:44,519
also arise in the field of sensations

88
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:55,600
see if you can notice the effortless knowing

89
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,519
or a kind of natural knowing

90
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,079
of what is it that arises

91
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:15,720
settling more perhaps settling into the body breathing

92
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,919
and they're having this receptive awareness

93
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:30,960
that allows sensations of breathing to appear whatever way they want

94
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,000
whatever way they do

95
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:45,760
maybe they don't they appear in ways that are not your the common pattern

96
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,080
because you're not directing or expecting

97
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:58,279
the common experience of breathing just open receptive

98
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,840
allowing the sensations to appear as they do

99
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:13,480
and allowing the simplest form of knowing of this appearance

100
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,880
when there is a quiet receptivity

101
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:43,360
a sensitive receptivity to our experience

102
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:53,559
then when we encounter the suffering of others

103
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:59,039
we might feel it more acutely

104
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:11,679
and readily or easily give up the simplicity of knowing

105
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:24,000
knowing suffering without any without giving birth to effort

106
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,520
directedness responsibility

107
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,840
needing to do something

108
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:46,159
without taking it in in any personal way

109
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,840
that that suffering somehow

110
00:27:52,480 --> 00:28:00,480
requires something of you the suffering is simply known

111
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:07,360
experienced as part of the field of things that

112
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,720
appear and disappear

113
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,880
and this doesn't have to be aloof we're disconnected

114
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:30,840
it's actually more intimate it's staying intimate staying connected

115
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:38,240
falling back on responsibility or preferences or taking it personally

116
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,720
that's where the kind of disconnect begins

117
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:55,320
taking in the suffering of the world in this simple way of being present

118
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:07,520
may allow for a simplicity of compassion

119
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:13,840
the simplicity of well-wishing of care and love

120
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:30,159
where our care our kindness can also arise in his almost effortless

121
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:39,158
way and we know that we care

122
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,600
we see the caring arising

123
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,159
and to know it with this simplicity of knowing

124
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:02,559
not being quick to make it personal or need to do anything

125
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,880
just care kindness

126
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:15,440
and perhaps with that as a reference point for

127
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:24,480
the dedication of merit dedication of our benefits and practice

128
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:32,640
may these words i speak be your words and may they arise

129
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,679
with ease and effortlessly

130
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,320
out of your being

131
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:52,398
may all beings be happy

132
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:05,840
may all beings be safe

133
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:17,639
may all beings be peaceful

134
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,518
may all beings be free

135
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,640
and may we as a community and as individuals

136
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,840
go into the world

137
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:50,240
to benefit the world to support the welfare of others

138
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,000
may all beings be happy

139
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,440
and with uh as i bow now to end the sitting

140
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,639
perhaps you'll bow and return

141
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:22,159
so i thought this would be the last talk on the second exercise of satipatana

142
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,320
which is the mindfulness of postures

143
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:32,720
and as with the first exercise each of the

144
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:38,640
13 exercises it's followed by the refrain

145
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,760
and the refrain is the same for each and this

146
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:49,039
implies that this simple pos mindfulness of posture

147
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:54,799
as it as a as a foundation can lead to the deepening of practice described in

148
00:32:54,799 --> 00:33:00,159
the refrain so it can lead to a

149
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:06,559
kind of open awareness that's receptive to both what's inside and outside

150
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:12,720
what's the ways in which we experience our body from the inside out and then the ways we experience our body

151
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:21,600
from the outside in just it's just an open awareness to know to know what is arising

152
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:28,399
and um the um

153
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:33,679
and then as we do this there starts becoming a sensitivity to

154
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:40,159
how things just appear and um even though there might be some predominant thing that lasts

155
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:45,360
uh at the same time we notice that new things appear into consciousness into awareness

156
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:52,000
from the body within the posture the sensations of the body and to receive the comings and going of

157
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,120
sensations and to know it in this simple way can allow kind of a deepening and a

158
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:03,279
quieting and a settling stilling of the mind until we start tasting something of the

159
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:09,040
freedom of the radical simplicity where there's no craving

160
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,320
no clinging to anything so that's one direction

161
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:21,200
in which the this mindfulness of posture can go

162
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:26,878
i'd like to take it a different direction which is as we become more sensitive and more

163
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:32,960
attentive to our posture we can become aware of the details of our posture

164
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:39,599
or the subtle variations in our posture as we go through our lives and we can have develop a tremendous

165
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:45,358
amount of self-understanding by noticing the shifts in our posture

166
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:51,520
so there doesn't have to be big shifts so it doesn't have to be mean from going from standing to sitting or sitting to

167
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:58,640
lying down but if we're standing with someone talking with them or we're sitting with someone

168
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:04,079
doing some activity what is the posture expressing

169
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:09,440
are we tense and maybe like we're not happy with what's going on and we're actually in a

170
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:16,640
chair and we're pushing back into the back rest of the chair or perhaps we're really eager to

171
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:22,320
understand someone and this desire to understand and we lean forward

172
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:29,200
maybe they tell you that they have the um they know what you know

173
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:34,720
what the lottery number will be for the winning some big prize

174
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:42,240
then we lean forward because of the desire for something uh or maybe we feel uh discouraged

175
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,359
someone says something and and um you know someone says something

176
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:52,640
personally about ourselves someone says to mel to me that you know

177
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:59,440
that uh well self-respecting dharma teacher doesn't wear blue shirts and so then

178
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:06,400
i've noticed that my shoulders sag and the little slumping going on there's a deflation going on the discouragement

179
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:13,920
the disappointment something so there's all these little movements that the posture varies

180
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:21,359
and um and if we as we pay attention to the posture and we're sensitive to it and then we

181
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:28,079
can become aware of the subtle shifts and variations we turn away someone's saying something and we find ourselves

182
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:34,240
turning away or [Music] the

183
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:41,839
we're holding ourselves more tensely so the posture

184
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:47,599
expresses what we're feeling the posture expresses what we're uh

185
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:54,040
some intention some purpose some uh

186
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,839
all kinds of things are expressed in the posture and we say that we this is a kind of represented in the english

187
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:05,599
language by the verb posturing

188
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:10,720
we say someone was posturing it means that they were kind of asserting themselves at their status and

189
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:17,440
trying to you know take a assume a place in the hierarchy or in the situation or

190
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,560
trying to show them prove themselves or show who they are and relationship to others

191
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:30,880
and and that can also be expressed in posture confidence can be expressed in posture

192
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:36,000
care and attentiveness can be expressed in posture

193
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,920
to really be present for someone can be expressed in posture many years ago i've been i haven't

194
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:47,440
experienced this for now for maybe almost 30 years but there was a series of people over a

195
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:55,280
course of a year i'm not saying three people maybe who um if i stood listening to them

196
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:01,200
speak and i was kind of facing them directly maybe i'm a little bit intimidating

197
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:06,560
perhaps but i directly face someone and listen to them but they would

198
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:14,240
turn around almost at 90 degrees to talk to me and if i went around kind of to be more

199
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:21,119
you know directly facing them they would turn around 360 degrees without knowing it

200
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:27,520
just because they didn't want to have that direct you know looking or direct contact

201
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:35,440
and so i was quite surprised by this because i was partly because they seemed unconscious to it

202
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:41,200
though i don't know what was going on now that 30 years later you know maybe it was something about how i was maybe i

203
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:47,280
was too forthcoming in my attention so it can go both in all kinds

204
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,400
of ways sometimes we pay attention to the postures of other people and it tells us

205
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,680
something about how they're responding to us and reacting to us and this is one of the meanings and one

206
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:03,119
of the interpretations of the first part of the refrain that

207
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:09,359
one experiences oneness observes the body

208
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:17,440
internally and the body externally that some people say it means to pay attention to other people their bodies

209
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,640
and so now with the posture you can also notice people's other people's postures and the

210
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:29,200
shifts they have and as we speak and as we're doing things as they're doing things we can tell so often a lot about

211
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:36,720
their emotional state their their attitude about things in their posture

212
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:43,839
so this uh exercise this mindfulness of posture

213
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:50,720
can take this more subtle form this variation here as a means of both self-understanding

214
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:56,800
and a heightened understanding of other people and our psychology our attitudes our

215
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:03,760
feelings and emotions sometimes can become very clear or first revealed through shifts in our

216
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:11,119
posture and that happens for me sometimes that the first thing i know that i'm tense is when i'm leaning

217
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:16,960
forward maybe and sometimes when

218
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,000
when i'm giving dharma talks and i'm a little bit concerned that people are not understanding me or

219
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,440
following me i notice i begin leaning forward and it's that leaning forward that tells

220
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:33,520
me that i'm a little bit now worried about you know how people are hearing me or

221
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:39,599
how clear i might be and so i noticed that leaning forward occasionally leading forward doesn't

222
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:46,000
mean that but sometimes i know that's what it means and and then i notice that and that

223
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,040
you know and then i come back and relax and settle in again

224
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:57,040
so um mindfulness of posture i hope that these days i've been looking at it

225
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:05,040
uh has heightened your attention and interest and sensitivity to posture your posture

226
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:11,839
and the value of how that can be one of the anchors one of the to the present moment to staying

227
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:16,880
present staying mindful being here and not wondering often thoughts too far

228
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:22,160
away from the presence so

229
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:33,040
so thank you very much

230
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:39,119
and tomorrow i will start on the next uh exercise

231
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:46,319
which a little bit is a continuation of what i just did now where i where mindfulness a posture can

232
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:51,680
lead to a wider understanding of of ourselves

233
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:57,920
so the next exercise also on mindfulness of the body involves a kind of a richer wider

234
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:04,079
understanding of things in our lives as we go about it so that's for tomorrow and

235
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,800
thank you very much
