00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:07,839
hello everyone and welcome for this meditation session and

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:14,719
uh the session is uh connected to this five week introduction to mindfulness

3
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,720
meditation series I'm doing on these um 7

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:27,920
a.m. and um so with that in mind the theme for

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:35,800
this week will be mindfulness of emotions and for the first meditation related to

6
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:43,559
this I'd like to keep it really simple and uh start with an an

7
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:49,199
analogy that if you are going to cross a

8
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:54,600
field which I did recently that is

9
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:01,239
Muddy maybe marshy Maybe easy to get deeply

10
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:06,720
stuck in the mud and it's a slow going get sucked into the mud and it to pull

11
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,479
your feet out again and over and over again and it's a hard

12
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,880
going but then you discover that right there in the field there are stepping

13
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,759
stones and if you just step from one stepping stone to another there's no

14
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:30,799
getting stuck in the mud and it's easy going and the mud is still there in fact

15
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:38,320
now the field looks more beautiful and uh has its own dignity its

16
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,880
own value but um you're not getting stuck in it and so it's nice to walk and

17
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,079
observe and be with it and stepping from one stone to another where you're free of the

18
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:56,840
mud so the same way uh emotions are very

19
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:03,560
important for mindfulness meditation uh for the point of view of mindfulness

20
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:10,280
there's no emotion which is wrong to have and uh there's no condemning of an

21
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:16,519
emotion but what we're trying to do is not have some judgment about an

22
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:23,560
emotion but trying not to uh get stuck in the mud to get stuck in it and it's

23
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:29,840
possible to get stuck both in uh Pleasant emotions and unpleasant ones

24
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:36,959
and the pleasant ones we don't recognize often that we're stuck that we have kind of but because it's so nice but uh the

25
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:43,680
idea in mindfulness meditation is to learn how to uh respect the dignity and

26
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:51,760
value and and circumstances of every emotion we have while walking on the

27
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,599
Stepping Stones while walking uh in a place where we don't get stuck where

28
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:03,200
it's firm and dry and and uh so very supportive and we don't get pulled into

29
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:11,120
it so I would like to offer uh one way that maybe you can do this and maybe

30
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:18,519
experiment and that is that uh uh in this meditation to if it works for you to let

31
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:25,440
breathing be the center of the meditation and riding the inhales and

32
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,680
exhales staying close to them but when there's an and when

33
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:40,720
there's an emotion that's present the stepping stone is to very uh

34
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:47,319
clearly kind of from a dry land from a place that you're not

35
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:53,519
stuck um label note the emotion it could

36
00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:01,680
be with a verbal note Joy sadness

37
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:12,640
annoyance peace calm whatever it might be and um but see if you can find a way

38
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:18,560
to note to be aware of the emotion uh from a place where you're on

39
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:26,000
a stepping stone where you're not being pulled into it you're not participating in it you're not feeding it with stories

40
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,280
and reactions you're not uh being over WellMed by it you're not being pulled

41
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:37,240
into its orbit and to find a way to say that mental

42
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:44,199
note and it's also possible to have a nonverbal note so it doesn't have to be necessarily words but it's some clear

43
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:51,039
recognition of the emotion that's there but in their recognition uh we're kind of uh not

44
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:56,560
we're on a stepping stone we're seeing the terrain but not in it not stuck in

45
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:03,720
it not pulled into it and and um and some of you might have really wonderful

46
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,759
relationship with some of your emotions and think why should I do that but uh for the purposes of

47
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:18,280
deepening the meditation this is invaluable to do so you might want to experiment with it and um and so make that note or make

48
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:24,759
that recognition oh this is this is anger this is

49
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:31,639
boredom and uh and uh but see if you can make that note such a way that the

50
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:38,280
noting itself the recognition itself is free to add to this it might help with

51
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:45,600
this process uh make that note either at the beginning of the

52
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:53,000
exhale or the beginning of the inhale whichever is nicest for you experiment a little bit maybe so if you do it at the

53
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,880
beginning of the exhale make the note uh you know so it might be sadness

54
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:05,720
it's a sadness and then as you exhale kind of relax as you say it it's just

55
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,800
relax around the sadness or relax with it just relax the stickiness or the

56
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,960
Leaning into or the reactivity that might be around sness just relax with the

57
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:24,599
exhale if you do at the beginning of the inhale maybe it's more of a uh a being

58
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:30,639
grounded centered on yourself and making room to feel the emotion more fully

59
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:36,759
while not being stuck in it so using the and over time you'll

60
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:44,000
learn how is the simple you know one second act of clear recognition brings

61
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,199
with it a little bit of Freedom or a lot of freedom in relationship to emotions and it's not to

62
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:57,120
dismiss emotions and will see it's actually to have a deep respect for them

63
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,520
and make room for them that we cannot not do if we're stuck in them or involved in them or caught in their

64
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:11,440
orbit or participating in them so assuming a meditation

65
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,879
posture and gently lowering your gaze or closing

66
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:21,160
your

67
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:32,360
eyes checking in with your posture to see if there's any adjustments to be

68
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:39,840
made it helps you feel more stable

69
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,080
grounded

70
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,479
aligned gently taking some breaths which are a

71
00:07:53,479 --> 00:08:01,199
little deeper than usual Fuller than usual so that at the exhale

72
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,560
you can have a longer exhale and relaxing

73
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,639
the body as you do

74
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
so

75
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:56,200
then letting the breathing return to normal and continue relaxing the body on

76
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:01,440
the exhale maybe going through the body body systematically

77
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,000
from top of the head and down through the

78
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
body

79
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
e

80
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:19,760
feeling your breathing in your torso the movements of the body the sensations of

81
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,519
breathing in your

82
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:35,720
torso and the part of your torso that moves as you breathe feel the weight of

83
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:42,920
it so that as you breathe and relaxing you're settling

84
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:51,079
in settling your body grounding it here so the weight

85
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,120
settles

86
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
relaxes

87
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:30,959
feeling the sensations in your torso as you breathe so that you're beginning to

88
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,720
be aware without being centered in the

89
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,279
control tower in the head the awareness practice is centered

90
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,639
in the

91
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
body

92
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:27,959
and then as you continue you might notice now whatever

93
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:35,360
mood or Motion state of mind that's present with

94
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:43,519
no issue around whether it's a pleasant or unpleasant emotion

95
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,040
mood and at the beginning of the

96
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:57,839
exhale or the beginning of the inhale whatever feels best for

97
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:08,440
you quietly have a one word recognition or one moment of wordless

98
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:14,959
recognition experimenting with how that moment of

99
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:22,040
recognition stands alone by itself meaning it's

100
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:27,760
not entangled or reactive to whatever mood or

101
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,120
emotion without preference for or

102
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,360
against a moment of recognition that's

103
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:49,720
free and then if you're with the exhale to relax with that emotion relax around

104
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:56,240
it if it's at the inhale allow yourself to fully

105
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,360
[Music] feel the

106
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:12,160
emotion and with every breath see if you can find that stepping

107
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,320
stone that involves recognition

108
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,240
naming that is above the

109
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
mud

110
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
e

111
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
for

112
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
e

113
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,519
e

114
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
for

115
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
e

116
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:02,799
for it might be

117
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:10,360
interesting to think of this exercise of naming or

118
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:19,520
recognizing your emotional state as a form of Truth

119
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:25,320
telling just saying the truth about how you

120
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:32,600
feel but doing so from a place of

121
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:39,320
Freedom it's okay it's completely okay to have this

122
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:46,360
emotion here but recognize it from the Stepping

123
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:56,080
Stones recognize and then relax with it recognize and

124
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:04,080
allow its space and room room without being

125
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:09,720
involved staying on the firm Stepping

126
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
Stones

127
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
e

128
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
e

129
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120

e

131
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
for

132
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
e

133
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
for

134
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
for

135
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
for

136
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
for

137
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
for

138
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
e

139
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:41,279
gently pulling yourself out of whatever state that you're in whatever emotional

140
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:47,919
state and with respect for the state care for how you

141
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:54,200
are find a way of naming truth

142
00:25:54,200 --> 00:26:00,880
telling this is how it is simple naming it that put you up on

143
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:08,600
this Solid Ground free of being pulled into

144
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,640
whatever state you

145
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,600
have

146
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:48,159
and then coming to the end of this meditation perhaps recognizing or

147
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:53,520
feeling how a simple Act of Truth telling about how you

148
00:26:53,520 --> 00:27:00,000
are can make room for you to be more than whatever

149
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:08,559
emotion you you are it's a way of making space breathing

150
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:14,640
room so that how we feel is not interfering

151
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:24,360
with an open available way for our care and our

152
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:29,520
kindness to be ready to meet the world

153
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:39,398
so there's more space for love for friendship for

154
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:46,760
friendliness and with whatever degree of open kindness that's

155
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:51,919
here extending your good will out into the

156
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:59,240
world for the people who are live near you or close to you

157
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:05,039
to those far away may all

158
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:11,120
beings be happy may all

159
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,880
beings be safe may all

160
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:25,159
beings be peaceful may all beings be

161
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:34,799
free and may our openness contribute to that

162

165
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:05,360
I begin the third week of this introduction to mindfulness meditation with this week focusing on

166
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:11,399
mindfulness of emotions emotions are an important part of our

167
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:18,200
life and mindfulness meditation is meant to offer have a lot of respect for our

168
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:24,799
emotions and as I've often said that I love the word respect as a synonym for

169
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:32,519
mindfulness because the Latin roots of it could uh be understood as uh to see

170
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:40,120
again to give a second look to what's happening so to respect emotions is to

171
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:46,880
give it it really take a look at it second don't just take it at the first impression but take a second look what's

172
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:52,640
happening here so one of the principles of

173
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:58,200
practicing mindfulness of emotions and mindfulness meditation

174
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:07,880
is in fact to have a deep respect for emotions that uh emotions um in and of

175
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:14,639
themselves are significant movements within

176
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:19,960
us they um are things which are we are moved by

177
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:25,320
something and um and we want to allow the

178
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:31,480
movement without judgment but also

179
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:40,120
without participating either reactively pushing it away or judging it

180
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:48,200
negatively uh or participating in it by um leaning into it and telling ourselves

181
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:55,600
stories that perpetuate it and keep it going and um I'm fond of the idea that

182
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:02,760
the word emotion has the the word Motion in it and the E the Latin prefix e means

183
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:07,799
out emotions are things that are moving out they represent that we've been

184
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:15,440
touched we've been moved in some way and um and in and of itself it

185
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:25,039
represents our capacity to um to be moved to be involved in a way

186
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:31,880
that's to this world with ourselves that something deep gets elicited something deep place maybe I like to

187
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:39,639
think of a place that's tender within has been has been kind of come alive and it's expressing itself and and somehow

188
00:32:39,639 --> 00:32:45,360
we're being moved and um and certainly some emotions

189
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:51,639
are unpleasant some are Pleasant some are not helpful for us to live by or

190
00:32:51,639 --> 00:32:57,919
participate in and some are very helpful to live by and participate in but no

191
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:05,120
matter whether it's Pleasant or unpleasant skillful or unskillful uh emotions can be understood

192
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:10,399
as providing information something is being

193
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:18,519
expressed and we want to be able to uh hear or see or recognize what is

194
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:23,880
happening here what's being expressed what is there to learn with this

195
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:30,919
emotion I sometimes think of all emotions as messages and we want to read the message

196
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:36,080
we don't want to Kill the Messenger we want to see okay this too is carrying

197
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:41,880
some message and uh if it's an unpleasant emotion or one that's

198
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:47,000
maybe um harmful even for to for

199
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:55,960
ourselves or for others it's still carrying a message maybe from someplace deeper than what it is itself and so to

200
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:01,679
respect it and make room for it um so we can really hear deeply what's really

201
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:08,040
happening here with us that kind of Truth telling or truth finding in this

202
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:14,919
process and uh so I like to say that uh mindfulness meditation is meant to be

203
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:20,118
one of the safest places to feel your emotions or or to say it differently

204
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:25,560
it's one of the places where um it's meant to be where we can allow whatever

205
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:33,200
emotion we have and allow it to be there so we can feel it see it know it uh and find our

206
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:38,960
freedom with it now that's a tall order sometimes emotions can be quite

207
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:45,679
difficult and and um they can be overwhelming at times so it's a process

208
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:51,040
of learning it's a process of building the skill and the capacity to have this

209
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:57,440
kind of mindful attention openness to whatever emotion we have it's not something that necessarily can be done

210
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:05,720
overnight or immediately but that's kind of like the North Star for this practice is to build this capacity to be present

211
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:12,280
in a non-reactive non um entangled way to any emotion that we

212
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:19,320
have and so I like to think of it that it's this you know it's one of the few places in our society where it's uh

213
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:24,440
there's no need to be ashamed of our emotions no need to repress them no need

214
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:30,200
to um condemn them um and there's no need to participate in

215
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:37,160
them lean into them collapse into them and um and uh you know so if

216
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:42,400
there's murderous rage um you know we're committed for duration of meditation to

217
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:48,320
not move more or less and um and just allow it to course through us without

218
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:56,079
punching someone out we just like sitting their feeling allowing it to be there and uh if we have great beatific

219
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:01,599
kind of feelings of Love um you know it might be problematic sometimes in daily

220
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:07,800
life if we have that in the wrong occasion but um uh what we can learn

221
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:14,119
that as we learn how to be how to experience whatever emotion it is what

222
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:19,640
we're learning is how to know it how to recognize it from a place of stability

223
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:25,720
or calm to be able to recognize it where the recognition of it is

224
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:30,839
free and one of the freedoms is to be free enough just free

225
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:36,720
enough um to um to be able to listen

226
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:43,240
more deeply to the emotion to not be so involved in it so reactive to it so

227
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:48,960
overwhelmed by it that we have the capacity to see it to know it to listen

228
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,640
deeply what is this and that's where the earlier parts of this uh inned

229
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:02,079
meditation is very important because um the all emotions are

230
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:07,839
expressed one way or the other in the body and if there were no Body

231
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:12,880
Sensations at all it might be hard to really discern that you're even having an

232
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,359
emotion so be able to feel the little movements of of or big movements in the

233
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:25,800
body the contractions the tightness the agitation the energy the the suffusion

234
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:31,079
of warmth or goodness that comes with some positive

235
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:37,040
emotions um that's to feel it physically or to feel how the breathing has come

236
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:43,480
into play some emotions when they come up strong affects the breathing and makes the breathing tight or shallow or

237
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:49,760
fast and um or sometimes it's a some some emotions help the breathing relax

238
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:57,720
and settle and become slow and and bigger and um so to be able to recogn

239
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:05,319
recognize the bodily expression of the emotion what's happening in the body the what's happening with the breathing is a

240
00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:11,200
support to stay in the present moment with the

241
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,359
emotion what we're doing in mindfulness meditation is seeing any

242
00:38:16,359 --> 00:38:23,160
emotion as a present moment event almost as if for the purpose of the

243
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:31,400
meditation it has no before and has has no after we don't have to connect it to the

244
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:37,480
story of why it's there and we don't have to connect it to the the

245
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:46,040
predictions of what it means that it's there what's going to happen to us we're learning to just hold it be present for

246
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:51,839
it respectfully for what it is as an event here and

247
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:58,480
now and that means uh without a lot of thinking about about it without a lot of

248
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:07,079
analysis or story making or and we're learning without a lot of Association to

249
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:15,359
self one of the interesting things about emotions is when there's a lot of identification with the emotion I am the

250
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:21,520
emotion the emotion defines me you know I'm this kind of person who's always has

251
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:27,440
this kind of emotion and that's an added layer on top

252
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,599
that over time we learn this meditation we don't need to do we can keep it very

253
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:38,200
very simple even if it's very strong emotion I've sat with meditation with

254
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:44,119
anger that felt like a volcano and um but uh I didn't identify

255
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:49,800
with it I didn't make myself the angry person I just made room in my body I

256
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:56,920
kept coming back to my body and feel it feel it so in this first day of uh

257
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:05,319
of uh teaching about mindfulness of emotion I want to keep it somewhat simple and I want to suggest uh the

258
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:11,319
practice of um um the um one one second

259
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:18,839
or 3 second mindfulness and uh this is something you can do through the day it's a art form

260
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:24,079
so or craft that you can learn and cultivate until it becomes stronger for

261
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:29,920
you and that is the the the

262
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:36,359
the the practice of simple recognition of what emotion is happening

263
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:43,119
in the moment and it isn't that the recognizing it's not that the recognition of the

264
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:49,720
emotion is what's important it's that how we recognize it so that we recognize

265
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:56,680
it with um uh without being entangled we recognize it without being caught or

266
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:02,280
reactive to it we recognize it without defining ourselves by it or telling us a

267
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:10,480
story about this means I am some way or other um it's uh stepping out of the you

268
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,880
know the swampy mud of the field that we were crossing up on the Stepping Stones

269
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:23,480
where there's um you we're still able to cross the field we're still intimately part of this beautiful maybe natural

270
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:28,760
landscape or where the field is in we're not removing ourselves from the world or

271
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:34,920
becoming dis dis engaged but we're just stepping

272
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:41,680
up on these wonderful Stepping Stones where we can walk across the field without getting stuck in the mud and the

273
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:46,920
stepping stone is the simple Act of recognition

274
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:52,680
recognizing sadness grief just as that oh this is

275
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:58,079
grief and not to feel like you have to not grieve or that supposed to be you

276
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:03,200
know any different or that you're changing it for the next second after

277
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:10,079
that just for that second oh it's like the sun has come out oh this is

278
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:15,480
grief this is Joy this is love this is

279
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:21,280
hatred this is boredom this is calm this is

280
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:27,200
agitation this is fear this is

281
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:35,400
um confidence so whatever state mood mental state emotion that we have to

282
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:40,720
experiment with just naming it taking the moment to almost like you're pausing

283
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:46,119
for one second 3 seconds oh this is how it

284
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:54,319
is yes this is how it is and but just clearly enough fully

285
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:59,640
enough definitive enough that you're almost like stepping

286
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:06,160
out of the the current of being swept away or involved

287
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:12,440
with whatever emotion it is but not to stop it but to see it clearly to have a

288
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:20,520
moment of truth telling oh this is how it is and um and then to repeat myself the

289
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:26,480
recognizing what it is has tremendous value but in this exercise that what's

290
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:33,200
more important is how you recognize it and that's where the experimentation is

291
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:39,720
that's where the training is in this meditation is to is to um see what you

292
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:45,040
can do to recognize it so you feel like oh for that moment you're free to that

293
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:52,680
moment you're not identified with it that moment you're not entangled or reactive to it is just very

294
00:43:52,680 --> 00:44:01,760
simple stepping away step stepping back and seeing it for what it is without being

295
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:08,240
entangled so you might uh do this if you you know through the day

296
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:15,000
today and I don't know how you know you could set a timer on your device that you know every 15 minutes or so there's

297
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:23,480
a little reminder check in how you are and see what it's like to just that moment to name it maybe you want to do

298
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:29,079
that a few times uh over a minute or so just to

299
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:35,520
experiment you know maybe you can do it five six times over a minute and just experiment what is it Gil talking about

300
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:42,880
about this recognition that's free recognition that's not entangled or caught and see

301
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:48,000
uh what you learn from this see what you find from this and if you want a little

302
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:56,160
if it this this becomes kind of easy or not you know you want a little bit more then um uh do that act of recognition

303
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:01,240
either at the beginning of the exhale or the beginning of the inhale and just

304
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:08,000
relax with the emotion on the exhale or if it's the beginning of the inhale allow for it after you've made after

305
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,319
you've made the recognition then almost like you make room to allow forther on the

306
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:19,480
inhale or once you've recognized it in this nice way at the beginning of the

307
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:26,680
exhale then just relax with it and see what happens to you and so this is just the beginning

308
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:32,760
and we'll continue now next 4 days with um developing this important area of

309
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:37,319
mindfulness of emotions thank

310
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,800
you
