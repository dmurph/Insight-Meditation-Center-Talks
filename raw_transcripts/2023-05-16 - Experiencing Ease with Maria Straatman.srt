1
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:10,740
good evening so

2
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:18,680
oh I'm not sure I got all my pieces together here hold on a moment

3
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:28,920
somebody had larger ears than I did okay I think we're there

4
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:33,960
so uh my name is Maria stratman I forgot to

5
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:42,799
say that last week so I'll say that now and I'm here for Diana who is on retreat but she should be back next week

6
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:49,920
so um tonight what I'd like to talk to you

7
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:56,819
about is experiencing ease

8
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:04,380
so when I say experiencing ease I do not mean that everything is going

9
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:11,520
to be easy or that you're going to be happy or that everything will suddenly stop

10
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:18,119
being a problem for you in fact it turns out that ease is

11
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:23,339
somewhat difficult to talk about and mostly what I'm going to talk about

12
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:30,300
is the what it is not what ease is not and then how we might be able to go

13
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:37,800
about that so last week I sort of introduced the topic by putting an emphasis on mindfulness and the need for

14
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:45,980
being aware of things just as they are to be able to see just this Justice

15
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:51,359
and the importance of perseverance that is that you just keep coming back

16
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:57,420
you just keep coming back and you just keep showing up

17
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:05,579
and you don't stop you just keep being mindful you keep

18
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:10,619
reminding yourself recalling this is what I'm doing

19
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:18,000
and another important idea we talked about is that the whole thing all of the experience is a process it's not a thing

20
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:25,640
it's a process I'm having trouble with my glasses tonight sorry about that

21
00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:33,480
so the mindfulness is a process it's not a place it's not uh we think of it as a

22
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:41,760
technique but what we're really doing is paying attention to this is what's going on now this is what's here this this this and

23
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:49,200
this and this experience as we know it is transitory

24
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:57,079
comes and goes our thoughts come and go the feelings of our body come and go sounds come and go tastes come and go

25
00:48:57,079 --> 00:49:03,480
everything is transitory it's conditional

26
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:10,560
that is we don't get to determine what it is it's based on all of the things that

27
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:16,500
have happened before we came here the environment that we're in the attitude that we have when we get up in the

28
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:22,319
morning whatever our experience is is conditioned by all the things around us

29
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:28,859
and within us and before us and what we're thinking it's all conditioned by

30
00:49:28,859 --> 00:49:34,020
that and we don't control those conditions

31
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:40,020
and it's uncertain we don't know what happens next

32
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:45,960
despite the fact that the brain that we operate with believes

33
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:52,440
that we know what's coming next we actually don't know what's coming next because an experience doesn't

34
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:59,460
happen until it happens we can't make it happen we can't control

35
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:06,000
what happens it's in process

36
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,640
as are we the person that we call Self is also in

37
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:16,920
process we're not the same as we were

38
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:23,880
this afternoon I was reading a poem by The Poets in borska maybe I get that

39
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:29,940
right who had written a poem about herself as a teenager

40
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:37,440
and she said I I look at that girl and I say who was that

41
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:44,460
she can't identify with who she was as a teenager at all it's very clear I'm a different person

42
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:49,859
even though she knows that person very well both of those persons

43
00:50:49,859 --> 00:50:56,720
they're not the same and that's true of each of us we're not the same as we once were

44
00:50:57,359 --> 00:51:06,720
not the same as we were a moment ago what we experience is very momentary

45
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:13,619
and we experience it through the this body through all the feelings and sounds and

46
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:19,559
tastes and thoughts of this body but to think that this body isn't

47
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:26,400
changing and that there is a me that isn't changing is not paying attention

48
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:32,160
it's not being aware of the really transitory conditional nature of Who We

49
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:38,940
Are Who We Are and that this is controlled by the

50
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:45,480
memory okay so memory being the continued processing of information

51
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:51,900
and offer information retention over time the thing that that the neural circuits that are

52
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:57,780
created in the brain that the brain uses to tell us what to do about these conditions so on the way

53
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:03,780
here I left with plenty of time and I turned on to Sand Hill Road which

54
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:11,220
is kind of the main artery out of Palo Alto going to 280 which was the route that I take

55
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:16,619
getting here and so I turned on to this the street and was shocked to find a

56
00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:22,980
line of traffic at seven at night it just is unusual five o'clock yeah I get it but boom to

57
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:28,319
stop and then the light changed and we didn't move and I thought what's happening and

58
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:34,220
I could feel that prison of fear around oh I'm going to be late

59
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:40,920
and all the associated thoughts around that well I should check this and I should have checked that and what if I

60
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:46,559
did this and maybe and then and what I did instead was say and how is my body

61
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:52,260
doing what's happening am I leaning forward which is what I tend to do when I'm rushing

62
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:59,819
of lean forward you know grab the grab the steering wheel no I wasn't doing any of those things I

63
00:52:59,819 --> 00:53:05,819
was quietly my hands were quietly just barely grasping and I said oh

64
00:53:05,819 --> 00:53:15,900
despite this prison of fear about how I have to rush I'm not yet rushing I don't have to rush

65
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:23,460
so even the bright though the brain was giving me signals all this this is this is potentially bad you should prepare

66
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:30,300
for things that being what you expected I didn't have to react to that

67
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:37,079
and it was so um happy making to realize I wasn't

68
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:42,359
reacting to that even though I felt I felt the prison of fear if that was

69
00:53:42,359 --> 00:53:47,960
there but I didn't have to rush

70
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:54,059
and then I felt contentment and then I said but I have to drive

71
00:53:54,059 --> 00:53:59,160
it's constantly changing it's going all the time but I did not have to get into

72
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:04,400
a mode based on what the brain told me was true

73
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:12,900
the other thing is that the the mind the the yeah the Mind tends to create a concept around our experiences it likes

74
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:18,540
to turn things into nouns you know so what I called a person of fear was

75
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:24,119
really a feeling in my body that I translated interpreted as a frisen of

76
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:30,359
fear a small excitement but it was really just a small

77
00:54:30,359 --> 00:54:37,500
excitement and it was only when the Mind named it fear and set up all those conditions

78
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:44,599
around well here's how you react to this that I had to worry about it

79
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:54,300
what we're interested in the way to experiencing ease

80
00:54:54,300 --> 00:55:01,319
is to find oneself in the alternative ways to to notice there are

81
00:55:01,319 --> 00:55:07,740
alternative ways of interpreting what the signals of our bodies and minds are sending us

82
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:13,020
there are alternatives to the reactive way that is common whatever that

83
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:19,440
reactive way is we de-personalize the sensation we take

84
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:25,500
it out of the realm where we're saying this is who I am and I will do I take care of the things this way here's what

85
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:32,040
I do in this Sati batana suta which is the

86
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:39,599
suta that talks about mindfulness discourse on the establishment of mindfulness it kind of it makes a

87
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:45,720
statement that is really about ease although it doesn't say that

88
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:53,760
the statement is one abides independent not clinging to anything in this world

89
00:55:53,760 --> 00:56:00,119
now on the surface you look at that and you say okay this is another message about not clinging not holding on

90
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:05,960
but the real word that I want to put your attention on is the word independent

91
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:13,440
independent and it the independence here is um not about

92
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:20,300
well it is about Freedom actually but it is about being Unshackled un impelled

93
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:26,220
I'm I'm not forced to do this I don't have to do this the independence is

94
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:31,859
about not succumbing to reactivity

95
00:56:31,859 --> 00:56:37,020
and we can only do that by being mindful of what's Happening by seeing what's

96
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:42,300
happening by being clear seeing clearly oh this is what's going on this is

97
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:48,059
what's going on the mind is continually engaged in the

98
00:56:48,059 --> 00:56:54,420
process of wanting or not wanting I like this I don't like this this is Pleasant this is unpleasant

99
00:56:54,420 --> 00:57:02,700
all of that that string of of uh arising that comes from the sensation the

100
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:09,059
feeling it's Pleasant or unpleasant I like I don't like I want I don't want that all happens very quickly

101
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:14,780
and the mind is constantly setting this up I want I don't want

102
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:24,540
we form patterns of reactivity around that and then we translate those patterns of

103
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:32,700
reactivity into who I am so shortly before I came I picked up I

104
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:38,339
foolishly looked at my email and there was a last minute of the day message

105
00:57:38,339 --> 00:57:43,500
that somebody had sent out do you know about this form call me if

106
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:49,680
you have any questions and I thought oh my goodness this person is totally misinterpreting this form I filled this

107
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:57,839
form out long ago and it wasn't for them it was for me and my mind immediately wanted to solve

108
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:04,740
a problem without actually knowing what the problem was except that it was unexpected that he wanted me to call him

109
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:11,520
with my questions and uh immediately the mind went into I have to

110
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:17,819
have a solution for this I have to handle this it has to be done now and I kind of laughed at how quickly

111
00:58:17,819 --> 00:58:22,700
that happened now I have to do this now

112
00:58:23,579 --> 00:58:29,359
and what is it I have to do now it's already done

113
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:34,920
but somehow there was this impetus I have to do this

114
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:40,980
and I kind of laughed at that person that had to do this and I spent a few minutes sort of well

115
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:48,079
let's see what are the consequences a brief analysis of you know what is the problem here

116
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:56,700
and then I say okay it is how it is there is confusion

117
00:58:56,700 --> 00:59:03,359
this is contractual confusion between two different organizations by the way so it's not just somebody

118
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:09,119
misinterpreting me it has to do with a lot of other things and so I thought well

119
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:14,240
okay it's done

120
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:21,420
we're not assigning them this right and so now all I have to do is manage it was

121
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:27,599
a sort of it was not so much a simplification as a stepping back from the idea that it's a problem

122
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:34,579
there may be something to be solved but the truth is it doesn't require

123
00:59:34,579 --> 00:59:40,619
establishing fault blame anything that has to do with why this is

124
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:47,640
happening just this is happening so now what do I do okay so so it's stepping back from all

125
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:53,339
the defensive things and all of the um creating a problem part of it and just

126
00:59:53,339 --> 01:00:01,280
saying oh now this is how things are now this is how things are

127
01:00:02,819 --> 01:00:07,859
practice of finding oneself at ease

128
01:00:07,859 --> 01:00:14,880
is not the result of a deliberate action it's not like I can give you a practice and say well practice this and you will

129
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:22,619
be at ease you don't get to make an agreement with the universe if I do these five things then I get ease right

130
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:28,260
because ease is something that arises out of the conditions

131
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:34,740
in which we're practicing it has a lot to do with the attitude

132
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:40,260
that we're carrying around what do I think about how I am in the world

133
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:44,720
how do I feel about how things are in the world

134
01:00:48,839 --> 01:00:55,020
am I attached to whether things are desirable or undesirable or can I be

135
01:00:55,020 --> 01:01:01,260
independent of that decision can I be independent of the reactivity

136
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:08,940
on whether this is desirable or undesirable [Music] if that is a function of needing things

137
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:16,200
to be other than they are do I need things to be other than they are which is what gives rise to

138
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:21,319
suffering needing things to be other than they are

139
01:01:24,059 --> 01:01:29,520
the way to ease is to find oneself in a place where you

140
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:36,660
just let things be what they are this is not to say complacent it just

141
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:43,140
means that you say oh that's how it is now what

142
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:50,220
oh that's how it is you don't rush to blame responsibility

143
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:56,480
criticism resentment all of those things are extra things

144
01:01:57,799 --> 01:02:05,520
mindfulness from the Satya batana Sutra says one is aware as it actually is

145
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:10,559
this is suffering this is the arising of suffering

146
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:16,079
this is the cessation of suffering this is the way leading to the cessation

147
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:21,299
of suffering this is the practice to see things just

148
01:02:21,299 --> 01:02:26,420
as they are and to see oh this is causing suffering

149
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:34,740
oh suffering is less when this happens oh if I do this

150
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:38,780
I notice the suffering decreases

151
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:47,000
there's an another kind of uh system within Buddhism that talks about

152
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:55,559
how we think about obstructions or how we think about how

153
01:02:55,559 --> 01:03:03,599
wanting things to be other than they are and that is a a system whereby we look

154
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:12,140
at the gratification that comes from having things as they are we see the danger in that gratification

155
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:19,859
and we let go of it which is called Escape Escape so it's

156
01:03:19,859 --> 01:03:25,559
gratification danger escape so if I Can See Clearly doing this

157
01:03:25,559 --> 01:03:31,619
creates this potential Danger so wanting something so much that it

158
01:03:31,619 --> 01:03:37,680
makes my life miserable wanting so much that this has to be this way

159
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:44,160
does indeed make my life miserable and I can see that that wanting is very dangerous

160
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:51,180
that wanting that wanting is so strong that it's tying me up in knots

161
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:57,059
that's a danger and how do I escape from that Danger

162
01:03:57,059 --> 01:04:05,520
by lessening by lessening the need to want so if we think of

163
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:13,740
any affliction wanting or not wanting as a form of enchantment

164
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:21,500
you know I really I just want this can't I just want this come on

165
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:25,640
it's not hurting anything

166
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:36,420
if we see how entangled we are through that wanting if we see that entanglement

167
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:42,000
then we are no longer deluded that everything about it is wonderful

168
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:48,180
we see ah we become disenchanted

169
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:56,160
we're not enthralled by that way of being and when we are disenchanted we become

170
01:04:56,160 --> 01:05:02,700
dispassionate the energy flows out of it

171
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:07,859
and we say oh I guess not

172
01:05:07,859 --> 01:05:13,799
I guess no I I have to see that I have to see

173
01:05:13,799 --> 01:05:18,740
what's actually happening now that I see it I can't unsee it

174
01:05:20,299 --> 01:05:26,480
what we're talking about is becoming unattached to what we want

175
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:33,240
unattached it doesn't mean we stop wanting things it just means we don't have to have them

176
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:39,660
we don't adopt that that feeling of I must have and we see when that arises

177
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:46,339
and we say ooh sticky sticky

178
01:05:47,099 --> 01:05:52,799
and we don't necessarily do anything about it it's not a call to action

179
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:58,500
the principle is when we see it the tendency to hold on to it is

180
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:06,319
automatically lessened so I can give you an example of that

181
01:06:07,079 --> 01:06:14,520
let's say uh let's say I have I have something that I'm very resentful about

182
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:19,740
okay somebody has done something that is just Unforgivable

183
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:27,119
now I can spend a lot of effort trying to forgive them for the Unforgivable but it's more useful for me to see

184
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:33,539
I am resentful that there is resentment here I can see the resentment

185
01:06:33,539 --> 01:06:40,319
and when I see that resentment I can say that hurts I hate that resentment

186
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:48,000
yeah but it's not fair it's not fair and my need for it to be fair when after

187
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:53,099
all it's already happened I can't affect the outcome of something that has

188
01:06:53,099 --> 01:07:00,240
already happened I can see the futility of that I can see there's there's no hope for

189
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:06,539
that okay so I I'm gonna give up wanting it

190
01:07:06,539 --> 01:07:12,539
to be better oh I can see that the resentment has

191
01:07:12,539 --> 01:07:18,420
nothing to do with the person or group that's caused this thing

192
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:25,760
but everything to do with my desire for what has already happened to be different than it was

193
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:36,539
the resentment is all mine the suffering of resentment is all mine

194
01:07:36,539 --> 01:07:41,640
it's not caused by you or your action

195
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:47,400
it's tied up in my reactivity to wanting things to be different

196
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:53,280
and it's already happened it can't be different you 've already happened

197
01:07:53,280 --> 01:08:00,119
and you could argue yeah but if I just let that pass nobody said anything about letting it pass

198
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:05,640
it's different what we're talking about is very subtle

199
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:12,119
what we're talking about is the need to have it that way the need for it to be

200
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:19,758
different you can feel it in your body you feel it kind of leaning into it in a kind of

201
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:26,520
there's there's a tight energy when you feel that tight energy you say

202
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:31,859
oh alarm alarm I should see what's happening here what's really happening

203
01:08:31,859 --> 01:08:34,159
here

204
01:08:38,819 --> 01:08:44,160
the art of just being present for what is true

205
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:49,798
is it kind of uh uninvolvement it's not it's not really uninvolved so much as

206
01:08:49,799 --> 01:08:57,660
it's unattached it's unattached you have to be completely in it you have to know what's happening to see clearly but you

207
01:08:57,660 --> 01:09:04,258
don't have to hold on to it and and and make it mine it doesn't have to be about

208
01:09:04,259 --> 01:09:12,678
you it could just be this is a risen this thing has arisen

209
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:20,699
so if we think about ease what we're talking about is what people

210
01:09:20,699 --> 01:09:26,040
like to call equanimity and I kind of stay away from Equanimity

211
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:31,199
just because everybody thinks it means I'm comfortable with and everything is

212
01:09:31,199 --> 01:09:37,199
balanced and and what I really mean to talk about is that ease is

213
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:44,160
this the attitude that allows you to say I see you whether it's Pleasant or

214
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:49,560
unpleasant it isn't about it being good or you

215
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:59,580
being good or anything being better or worse than it was it's seeing clearly this is how it is

216
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:07,500
resentment is here I see the resentment but I don't have to say I am resentful

217
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:14,520
I can just see the resentment and if I don't try to justify it to myself thereby re-energizing it by

218
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:21,199
telling the story it kind of loses its oomph

219
01:10:21,239 --> 01:10:28,580
it's really actually hard to hold on to it there are

220
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:38,520
there are people in my life there's I'm thinking of somebody yeah so so Mary was a

221
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:45,000
is no longer with us but when I first met her the two of us were pretty uncomfortable

222
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:52,380
with one another we were both pretty strong women with with uh lots of opinions and she wanted to go this way

223
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:58,199
and I wanted to go that way pretty much we had the same thing in mind but we just wanted to do it

224
01:10:58,199 --> 01:11:05,040
differently so we ended up being on a committee together I think we were trying to we

225
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:10,860
were trying to get an increase in property tax assessments to take care of

226
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:17,520
our roads so this was not an easy project to go around and convince people they should raise their taxes but

227
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:24,239
we were on a committee together to do this and so we decided we needed to get to know each other because we were both

228
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:34,140
aware of this discomfort we had with one another so I told her uh that I was that I had

229
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:39,780
worked for a company that built cyclotron so if you don't know what that is it's a very large physics machine

230
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:48,739
that producers radioactive isotopes or radiation beams for a variety of uses

231
01:11:48,739 --> 01:11:53,760
our applications were medical so I was telling her that you know I used to

232
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:59,760
build cyclotrans and all of a sudden everything changed

233
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:04,980
and I assumed you know it had to do with Will okay so she knows I'm not an idiot

234
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:12,960
and you know I know this is a bright woman and so maybe we can be more comfortable it was only after she died

235
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:21,140
that I learned that her father was EO Lawrence who invented the cyclotron

236
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:27,659
she never told me but the openness

237
01:12:27,659 --> 01:12:33,420
to just not requiring her to explain to me what was different and her

238
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:40,739
willingness and my willingness to just be open to each other over things we

239
01:12:40,739 --> 01:12:48,600
didn't know about each other led to actually a very warm friendship

240
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:53,120
unfortunately she died less than a year later

241
01:12:54,659 --> 01:13:02,280
but it is it is that openness about I don't know what's going to happen I

242
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:07,320
don't know about you you may make me uncomfortable but I actually don't know

243
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:14,658
you and so what I'm uncomfortable about has to do with something I wish was true

244
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:24,060
that doesn't have any meaning doesn't have any reality it's not part of the experience it's what I'm creating

245
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:32,600
out of the reactivity for I want things to be this way I want things to be this way

246
01:13:34,739 --> 01:13:40,380
the poly word for Equanimity is upeka and the components of that word break

247
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:45,600
down into a looking over looking over something looking

248
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:52,679
broadly about something that the idea is you're looking at what is

249
01:13:52,679 --> 01:14:00,000
unfolding and you just allow it to be the mind is responding to what's arising

250
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:06,420
but we don't have to go into the place of reactivity we can go into neutral

251
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:12,060
open okay it could be this but what if it's not

252
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:20,400
what if I'm just available for how it changes for what arises next

253
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:26,100
you can literally feel the energy in your body change from a kind of

254
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:33,179
stretching like a rubber band that relaxes

255
01:14:33,179 --> 01:14:38,820
just just thinking what if I'm wrong as long as it doesn't go all the way the

256
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:45,780
other way to oh my goodness I could be wrong and we developed a fear in the other direction but just that neutral

257
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:53,340
place of I don't know what's going to happen fear is present uncertainty is present

258
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:59,219
anxiety is present but I don't have to take it in make tea

259
01:14:59,219 --> 01:15:07,080
for it turn it into my life story I can just let it be

260
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:13,260
I don't even have to let go of it but I'm letting go of is the need for it

261
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:17,119
to be different than it is

262
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:24,420
so I I'm walking around at night I stub my toe

263
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:29,940
it hurts fortunately I don't break my toe

264
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:35,460
it's your fault for leaving that there it's my fault for being so clumsy it's the fault of the chair for sticking out

265
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:43,620
so far I should have gotten rid of that a long time ago all of those thoughts are extra creating more stress

266
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:50,640
it just happened and the pain is enough we don't have to create more pain

267
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:58,560
by castigating ourselves or someone else by creating fault the toe is already stubbed

268
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:07,820
okay despite all efforts I keep getting older

269
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:13,980
now older is older than right

270
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:17,360
but I'm not really old

271
01:16:20,219 --> 01:16:27,239
if I get tied to I don't want to get older sort of missing the whole point

272
01:16:27,239 --> 01:16:33,540
the point is I am still here I am still this way no I'm no longer

273
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:40,880
that way nor am I what I fear in the future I'm just this

274
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:47,760
rather than holding on or pushing away I'm just here for this

275
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:55,219
I'm not Enchanted by how I wish things could be I just see clearly

276
01:16:58,020 --> 01:17:03,780
doesn't mean that we disengage with life or that we don't have things that we

277
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:10,260
fight for or that we believe in or goals that we set for ourselves

278
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:15,800
that's all part of fully living this life

279
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:24,900
but there's an attitude of mind that can be open to any experience around what my

280
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:32,040
intentions are without condemning those experience experiences without elevating those

281
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:37,940
experiences by just seeing the experiences just as they are

282
01:17:38,699 --> 01:17:43,739
it's actually not dispassion in the sense that we want to be passionately

283
01:17:43,739 --> 01:17:50,520
alive but to be passionately In This Moment it's when we passionately want things to

284
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:56,940
be other than they are that we get into trouble and it's the need to change them to

285
01:17:56,940 --> 01:18:02,460
affect it to manipulate the present the need to manipulate what we see that

286
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:08,360
gives rise to suffering and it's distinguished from

287
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:13,739
determination that I'm going to make these changes or these improvements or I'm going to

288
01:18:13,739 --> 01:18:19,280
stand up for these rights those are all good things

289
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:28,980
what is also true is it's not saying that if I don't make this happen

290
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:35,940
I can't be happy I can never be I can never be satisfied unless this is true

291
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:43,280
we can work towards something without it having to be true in order to not suffer

292
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:51,420
what we pay attention to is where am I struggling if we're struggling suffering

293
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:58,199
is present we can join a struggle without struggling I don't know if that makes

294
01:18:58,199 --> 01:19:05,400
any sense to you we are not free of conditions in the

295
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:11,400
world we are not free of intentions but we can be free of the stubborn holding

296
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:16,820
on to our way we can be free of that

297
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:22,560
for years I had miserable thanksgivings because I had an idea about what

298
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:29,400
Thanksgiving should be that my family never met and when I gave up that idea I started

299
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:34,739
enjoying Thanksgiving again it took me so long to figure out I was

300
01:19:34,739 --> 01:19:42,360
the one making me unhappy because they weren't behaving the way I wanted them to behave

301
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:48,260
but what I let go of wanting them to be a certain way lo and behold

302
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:52,940
all of that tension washed out

303
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:59,760
and I could just enjoy the family I had to give up the idea that it had to

304
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:06,179
look a certain way and if not everything hit the table at the same time the food didn't hit the table at the same time

305
01:20:06,179 --> 01:20:11,400
and the turkey wasn't cooked exactly this way and the tofu ferky was

306
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:18,260
different and I used to make five meals for Thanksgiving it was ridiculous

307
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:23,000
all trying to have it look a certain way

308
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:32,159
the need to make things as we want them is the thing that gives rise to

309
01:20:32,159 --> 01:20:34,640
suffering

310
01:20:37,739 --> 01:20:43,860
there's another set of three that's important in Buddhism that's part of this

311
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:51,300
suffering Continuum it has to do with the determination of Sila samadhi and

312
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:57,000
tana so that is integrity or virtue

313
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:03,420
stability samadhi being meditation meditation comes in between

314
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:09,000
a virtuous life and wisdom Panna is wisdom

315
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:17,100
in order to experience ease one must be comfortable with these three legs of how

316
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:23,280
we practice forget about

317
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:29,340
the over emphasis on technique it's not that if I sit most effectively

318
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:35,640
in meditation then all of this is automatically going to happen because that's not the case

319
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:42,780
in order to be able to look at things as they are I actually have to know that I am

320
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:47,658
leading a well-intentioned life

321
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:55,080
the confidence that comes from I am living my best intentions

322
01:21:55,080 --> 01:22:02,040
can't be overlooked it doesn't mean we don't mistakes we don't make mistakes that we don't uh behave in ways that we

323
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:08,580
don't like we can say oh there you are doing that thing again but we don't add condemnation on it

324
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:13,820
we say oh look what's working

325
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:21,780
we develop The Virtuous life we develop the ability to be stable

326
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:27,480
to follow through on our intentions that's what we do in in meditation when

327
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:34,140
we find a place of Stillness so when I describe to you the the uh

328
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:41,659
getting in line on Sandhill and saying where is my body I felt a Stillness in me

329
01:22:41,659 --> 01:22:48,900
that told me I wasn't reacting that there was still time to just be

330
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:54,840
still you have to become familiar with that place of Stillness in order to reach it

331
01:22:54,840 --> 01:23:01,679
in order to recognize that it's there I'm not talking about deep jonic States

332
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:10,260
here just the stability of I am here I am here I am here

333
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:17,400
I am in this moment this person just as she is is in this moment and to feel

334
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:24,659
that settling that comes from that thought the Stillness and stability of

335
01:23:24,659 --> 01:23:31,500
I'm still here and the wisdom that comes from seeing

336
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:39,840
the habits of mind that are operating to see uh prison of fear but I don't have to

337
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:46,500
these these three areas Sila samadi Pana

338
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:54,540
are really about the Eightfold Path the ways to the cessation of suffering

339
01:23:54,540 --> 01:24:00,179
that's integral to it so what I'm saying

340
01:24:00,179 --> 01:24:07,500
is the way to ease is to adopt a life that allows you to feel it

341
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:14,159
that that increases the likelihood that it can arise in your life

342
01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:21,000
and that involves each of these three factors it involves being Mindful and seeing

343
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:26,400
things as clearly as possible so that we are not Enchanted but become

344
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:34,199
disenchanted and therefore not delusional if we can say oh I see this is what's

345
01:24:34,199 --> 01:24:39,360
operating it may not be comfortable

346
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:45,420
it may be wonderfully comfortable but I don't know what's going to happen

347
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:52,820
next being present for that is what it really means to be alive

348
01:24:55,500 --> 01:25:02,820
so I'm going to give you a little quote here from um earthlyn Emmanuel manual who wrote a

349
01:25:02,820 --> 01:25:08,880
book called The Way of tenderness and the subtext to that is Awakening

350
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:16,020
through race sexuality and gender so she is a Zen priest black woman

351
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:21,960
uh let's see and here's here's the quote

352
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:29,280
I speak simply of just being still of finding that place where our only Act

353
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:37,320
is breathing in this state of Stillness we do not seek answers for our active Minds but

354
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:43,340
allow one breath to be the total experience of life

355
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:50,520
a moment is not now a moment is simply a state of being itself

356
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:56,940
we too can be in a state of being ourselves and not worry about now

357
01:25:56,940 --> 01:26:03,840
we can be holy ourselves as ourselves while engaging the breath

358
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:08,880
as a result of this breath as a result of the meditation that arises from it

359
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:15,719
our motivations become purified of our wounds our expectations our stories and

360
01:26:15,719 --> 01:26:24,739
our distorted perceptions of others as a result of this breath

361
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:32,699
as a result of the meditation that arises from it our motivations become purified of our wounds our expectations

362
01:26:32,699 --> 01:26:38,880
our stories and our distorted perceptions of others

363
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:44,520
it is the Simplicity of awareness this is how it is

364
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:49,860
the Simplicity of awareness nobody said it was easy

365
01:26:49,860 --> 01:26:56,280
just simple the fullness of attention on just this

366
01:26:56,280 --> 01:27:01,920
allows us to see clearly we have breathing room we're not

367
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:09,120
we're not constricted by all the ideas we have by what we think about what's going on we just let what we think about

368
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:15,739
is going on just let it lie there just let it be there

369
01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:23,400
just know it's like this or I don't have to explain it to myself

370
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:28,860
I don't have to Nuance it I don't have to know all the details of why I think it's like this

371
01:27:28,860 --> 01:27:36,780
just it's like this and I remain steady in my purpose

372
01:27:36,780 --> 01:27:42,179
I don't get distracted by trying to explain it to myself

373
01:27:42,179 --> 01:27:47,639
it's like this from this we develop the confidence of

374
01:27:47,639 --> 01:27:53,840
just thisness just being here just just this

375
01:27:56,520 --> 01:28:01,698
and we can say ease

376
01:28:01,739 --> 01:28:08,460
and ask yourself what is ease what would what would Place me at ease

377
01:28:08,460 --> 01:28:14,060
right now not a solution of the problem

378
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:21,540
so here's practice ask yourself

379
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:27,860
what might you let go of so you can be more yourself

380
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:35,540
what might you let go of so you can be more yourself

381
01:28:38,580 --> 01:28:44,600
so I have a little thing I want to read you from

382
01:28:44,699 --> 01:28:54,020
David White this is a poem called a tillicoa lake

383
01:28:54,840 --> 01:29:01,920
in this high place it is as simple as this leave everything you know behind

384
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:09,179
step toward the cold surface say the old prayer of rough love and open both arms

385
01:29:09,179 --> 01:29:14,760
those who come with empty hands will stare into the lake astonished

386
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:23,360
there in the cold light reflecting pure snow is the true shape of your own face

387
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:31,980
leave everything you know behind step toward the cold surface say the old

388
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:38,219
prayer of love and open both arms those who come with empty hands will

389
01:29:38,219 --> 01:29:43,260
stare into the lake astonished there in the cold light reflecting pure

390
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:48,600
snow the true shape of your own face

391
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:54,198
I wish you the true shape of your own face thank you

392
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:02,520
we have only a brief minute if anyone has a comment yes

393
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:07,940
we have it would you speak into the microphone because they're recording this

394
01:30:10,139 --> 01:30:17,219
hello um I could not stop thinking about the whole time you were talking abusive

395
01:30:17,219 --> 01:30:24,239
relationships um I was in a very long one where at first I didn't want to get out because I

396
01:30:24,239 --> 01:30:30,780
didn't know there was a way out yeah and then once I knew there was a way out I didn't want to get out because I was

397
01:30:30,780 --> 01:30:37,199
like well what will I do who will I be you know like I just this is I'm I'm attached to this house so I'm attached

398
01:30:37,199 --> 01:30:44,219
to this life and so I I can't want something different or better for myself once I

399
01:30:44,219 --> 01:30:50,040
began to want different and better and safer and you know that was the

400
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:57,420
beginning of a self-love journey and I notice my friends around me are in relationships that are very

401
01:30:57,420 --> 01:31:04,739
unhealthy and they're telling themselves they don't want to leave and that there is no better for them so that's I was

402
01:31:04,739 --> 01:31:09,780
hoping you could kind of touch on the Nuance of that that it is

403
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:15,360
so um so I know what this is like

404
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:23,699
and uh you know there's a place where the devil you know is safer than

405
01:31:23,699 --> 01:31:29,040
what's out there if this is so scary out there could be even worse because you

406
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:38,219
begin to get the idea there are several ideas that come up one is well I don't deserve any more than this one is uh it

407
01:31:38,219 --> 01:31:43,320
could be worse than this now that I know this is bad even worse could wait for me out there

408
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:50,100
there are all kinds of variations on that and what is needed is to say where

409
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:59,699
is suffering this is suffering I do not need to suffer now when when

410
01:31:59,699 --> 01:32:04,920
you're really when when your sense of safety is tied up with this

411
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:10,560
the the real delusion is thinking that you're safe in that situation so what is

412
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:17,219
needed is a a reassurance it it it actually amounts to compassion toward

413
01:32:17,219 --> 01:32:23,159
oneself and to achieve compassion towards oneself you have to say

414
01:32:23,159 --> 01:32:28,760
you have to be able to get yourself into the place where you feel

415
01:32:29,580 --> 01:32:37,639
I'm doing the best I can I'm really trying hard

416
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:44,940
and I love me because ultimately it comes down to a

417
01:32:44,940 --> 01:32:51,420
decision on whether you'd love yourself how you can move forward

418
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:56,940
it it really has to be something that that settles on your own

419
01:32:56,940 --> 01:33:01,980
sense of worth in order to reach that

420
01:33:01,980 --> 01:33:07,800
you have to look at how am I living in the world am I not harming

421
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:15,600
am I not lying am I not stealing am I not abusing sexuality am I not

422
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:23,300
abusing intoxicants no I'm not doing any of those things

423
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:33,420
then life is good you are you are doing your part to be free of afflictions

424
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:39,840
and so you deserve you deserve

425
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:45,600
To Love Yourself to get to the place where your worth is

426
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:53,300
not dependent on other people where you can just see here I am

427
01:33:54,120 --> 01:34:00,980
and there's a there's a seeing of all the other stuff that you're attached to

428
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:13,620
it it's in that place of um uh gratification

429
01:34:13,860 --> 01:34:21,120
and escape to escape gratification danger escape so how you how you see

430
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:26,280
the momentariness of the gratification and the danger that exists outside of

431
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:31,800
that gratification so the gratification is I'm safe here but then it turns out you're not safe there

432
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:38,960
then when you see that when you see that really clearly I'm not safe

433
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:45,420
then you you can't unsee it and you don't need to cooperate with

434
01:34:45,420 --> 01:34:51,840
being unsafe but that's that's a very personal journey and it's not one you can do for

435
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:58,380
someone in the end you can only do it for yourself

436
01:34:58,380 --> 01:35:04,560
and you can urge other people and support other people but you actually can't do it for

437
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:09,840
other people and you can't judge

438
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:16,440
that the conditions that someone else chooses are necessarily

439
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:22,620
unskillful you know I watched

440
01:35:22,739 --> 01:35:28,500
some very negative behavior in my family and

441
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:35,100
have encouraged people to do otherwise and they're still my family

442
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:38,420
and they didn't do otherwise

443
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:46,039
okay those are the chase choices being made

444
01:35:47,940 --> 01:35:53,820
and so as a friend you're in a position of supporting that person not

445
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:59,460
necessarily what they're doing but that someone makes a choice it's it has to be

446
