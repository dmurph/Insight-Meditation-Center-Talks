1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:07,759
okay okay well hello and welcome welcome to happy

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:15,200

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:23,199
ah so so for today this fresh new day

4
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,880
whatever day it is whatever time zone for today the topic i'd like to invite

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:35,600
us to engage with [Music] is

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:42,000
patience for ourselves patience for ourselves and patience for others

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,440
patience such a beautiful quality of the heart and mind

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,960
ah so patience

9
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,038
in praise of patience and praise of patience

10
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:08,799
such a useful parame parami is is the name of

11
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:16,640
what's called ten perfections in buddhism there are ten beautiful qualities of the heart and patience

12
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,600
kanti kanti is one of them patients

13
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,479
so patience as as an expression of meta as an expression of kindness for

14
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:34,960
ourselves let's consider you know this mind this body we take it

15
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,479
to be ours we take it to be we take it so personally especially when

16
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,600
when um maybe it doesn't feel well or it's

17
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,640
sluggish or it forgets something or or

18
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:58,079
it it gets agitated or gets upset angry this heart this mind this body

19
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,439
what if we treated this being as

20
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:12,160
as we would treat a an elderly beloved parent just it's okay

21
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:18,239
sweetheart it's okay it's all right i'll have patience with you i'll have patience with you instead of

22
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,160
being short-tempered with ourselves like ah you forgot this again or

23
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,239
ah gosh you you lost it or whatever it might be whatever it might be or you're

24
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:37,440
sleeping again oh my goodness you're distracted again fill your favorite

25
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,760
habitual pattern in there the one that you you lose your patience with what if

26
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:50,800
what if we had patience so so you might wonder oh wait a minute if i have too much patience with myself then

27
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,319
i'll never improve i'll always be distracted and

28
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:04,640
sleepy and forgetful and angry not exactly so not exactly the idea of

29
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:11,840
patience is not acquiescence it's not to accept and and um

30
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,159
and resign ourselves that's not the idea here it's actually it's like a very wise

31
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,920
uh [Music] aikido move and the aikido move aikido

32
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,120
for those who may not be familiar with this martial arts the idea is you use the

33
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,400
energy of the opponent you use the energy and you redirect it in a very

34
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:41,040
skillful way you don't oppose it you redirect it you redirect the energy so

35
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,360
the idea of the redirection here is say with the pattern that

36
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:54,640
um is troublesome or for one thing it may not even be our fault anyway if it's with the body or the mind or we're not

37
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:01,439
feeling well and we feel betrayed by the body um and then with the other patterns with

38
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:07,360
with the anger and loss of temper etc um

39
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:14,959
having patience with ourselves actually that that moment of acceptance is like re

40
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:20,799
it's like shifting the energy like okay you're here i see that you're here i

41
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:26,160
accept that you're here ah instead of fighting you now how now

42
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,280
that you're here now that you're here okay how can i work

43
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:37,919
with you that is in that moment wisdom can come in how can i work with you

44
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:44,960
and again i've named a range of different patterns um in the mind and in the body and some

45
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,000
of them might be realized the body is just tired or sleepy or

46
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,160
angry or having a hard time like okay rest patience patience patients

47
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,680
and then with some of the patterns um maybe another skillful means is helpful

48
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:12,080
but patience patience taking our time taking our time with heartfulness all right

49
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:18,320
there's more i can say but i think that's enough let's just practice together and see what arises

50
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:25,440
in our reflections in our hearts and our minds and our bodies in the areas that we can have just a

51
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,560
little more patience for ourselves and of course patience for

52
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:37,639
others so all right let's let's practice

53
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,360
land in our seats let's arrive

54
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:55,919
calling forth the power of patience in this moment

55
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,479
can we have patience as this body settles relaxes

56
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:15,360
let's go or maybe it doesn't let go just yet maybe it's too agitated to let go

57
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,840
right now can we be patient with that

58
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,039
with whatever the conditions are

59
00:06:53,919 --> 00:07:02,759
whatever is arising in this moment and this body and this mind

60
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:11,120
space of the emotions can i can we have patience with it

61
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:17,000
as we gently invite the body to settle

62
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,160
it's just an invitation it's not

63
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,680
meant to be forceful

64
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,000
like a hammer it's just an invitation

65
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:17,840
and can equality of patience inhabit the body especially the lower

66
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:27,400
part of the body sense of stability groundedness receiving the breath

67
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:33,440
can patience be intertwined with awareness right now

68
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:41,680
to receive the breath all the time in the world for just this breath

69
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:49,120
as if this in breath is the most important awaited breath in the world

70
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,080
to take its time

71
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,519
not waiting for the next in breath chest this one

72
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,040
just this out breath

73
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,680
deliciously enjoying with patience

74
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,120
it's arising in this moment

75
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,000
receiving receiving this breath

76
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:38,200
just the sensation of the breath in the body

77
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,920
not going after the past or into the future

78
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:09,160
resting resting moment of refuge

79
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,200
spending another few minutes just settling with the breath

80
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,920
with patience

81
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,320
and if there is lack of patience right now

82
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:06,399
with anything sense of irritability lack of patience

83
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:12,000
can you be patient with that can you be patient

84
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,199
can you be patient with lack of patience or the judgmental mind or whatever is

85
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,839
coming up it's something challenging

86
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,160
to be patient with the lack of patience

87
00:14:52,880 --> 00:15:00,320
see how that might feel like an aikido move to be patient with lack of patience

88
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:15,320
does your heart relax a little bit more is there more ease

89

93
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:32,800
of your body the memory of maybe today or yesterday

94
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:40,480

95

some mishap

96
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:56,720

97
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,519
maybe you're impatient

98
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:18,720
maybe judgmental mind arose or any other version of it for you

99
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:27,280
gently ever so gently without getting off kilter if you get off kilter let it go

yourself your body your memory your emotions

104
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:20,080

105
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,200
of just

106
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,679
that flavor which can feel like a tightness in the

107
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,000
heart

108
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,919
feeling the contraction maybe in the body the heart

109
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:57,559

114
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,799

of patience it's okay

123
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:56,720
patience with this body it's doing the best it can

124
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:06,280

125
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,000

127
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,400
is there more settling more peace more ease

128
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,200
more energy available

129
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,000
more kindness available

130
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:47,120

133
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,399
more kind more wise

134
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:17,639
more wholesome i would come next time

135
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:09,200
now if you wish can stay with this feeling

136
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:16,159
or spaciousness or if you like again feeling your body on the cushion

137
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:21,120
or the chair your breath feeling embodied

138
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:31,120
and opening up the heart the body again maybe this time inviting a memory of a time

139
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,720
the recent times you were a little bit impatient

140
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:45,000
not as patient as you would have wished with someone else

141
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:56,000
maybe it wasn't even so overt maybe you didn't even lose your temper

142
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,799
but in your own mind you knew that you were a little patient like okay

143
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:09,679
wanting them to see the point or get it or do something or not do something

144
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:16,720
aware of this internal impatience

145
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:30,559
and feel really a little bit if it's okay it's not overwhelming

146
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:35,679
let yourself feel that contraction a bit in the body just

147
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:41,679
contraction of impatience lack of patience doesn't

148
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:49,200
feel so good does it it feels like it sucks the air out of the room

149
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,799
sucks the air out of your lungs

150
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:03,679
now relax and let's do a redo in our minds and our hearts

151
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:09,120
our memory this thing is happening in our memory

152
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:15,440
ah we're being patient fully patient they're doing the best

153
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:21,840
they can this being with the causes and conditions of the

154
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:30,400
background their upbringing [Music] their experience their genetics

155
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:37,200
who they are they're getting a hang of this being

156
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:44,399
human thing just like i am i can give them space

157
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,519
to figure it out in their own time

158
00:26:52,480 --> 00:27:00,720
and give them the gift of patience give myself the gift of patience

159
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,559
and see how your heart might feel

160
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:13,919
is the contraction loosened ah melt

161
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,200
is there more ease

162
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:25,120
offering yourself this other being the gift of patience

163
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:36,240
and if there's impatience present like it's not working can you be patient with

164
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,600
the lack of patience it's okay i'm getting

165
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:47,799
the hang of this human being human thing too

166
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:05,519
offering them patience maybe yourself too

167
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:13,960
see how soothing calming healing

168
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,600
the self can feel

169
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:31,440
and notice how with more patience towards others can be more supportive

170
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:37,360
more wise in our actions towards them

171
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,679
more kind

172
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:52,639
it frees up energy for wisdom patience frees up energy

173
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,320
for kindness and wisdom

174
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:38,640
can there be patience with whatever is arising in this moment border agitation distraction

175
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:47,039
not acquiescence but patience patience has an uprightness to it

176
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:56,399
immorality that acquiescence doesn't

177
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,880
see for yourself

178
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:56,158
and as we bring this practice period to an end together

179
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:04,240
can we offer patience to our hearts

180
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:17,839
in our aspirations to awaken to be wiser and kinder

181
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:23,359
patience paves the path

182
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:30,640
offering ourselves patience as a gift of kindness

183
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,000
to enable wisdom

184
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:43,280
and may our patience may our cultivation our goodness

185
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:49,520
be a cause and condition for kindness

186
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:58,119
awakening goodness all around the world all beings everywhere

187
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,760
may they be patient with themselves patient with others

188
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:11,799
all around for those who are like them or those who are different

189
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:21,200
patience patience patience may all beings everywhere

190
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:27,640
be free including ourselves

191
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,760
thank you all thank you for your practice

192
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:00,160
in praise of patience so

193
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:08,400

so any reflections any questions comments in praise of patience

198

or maybe more specific and oh you can always type in chat if you type to me

199

privately i will read your reflection but not your name so it will be private

200
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:51,920
if you type to everyone it will be a both um

201
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:57,359
i'll read your name and your reflection you can also raise your zoom hand

202
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:02,440
and richard

203
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:13,119
hi i i i wondered if patience extends to like giving yourself

204
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:20,400
time enough to do some let's say practice you know that you want to sit for 45 minutes instead of

205
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:27,440
five minutes rather than get antsy and cut it short

206
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:33,440
yeah exactly yes tell them tell me more

207
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:39,040
yes and i'm curious what where it's coming no because it's sort of easy

208
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:45,599
to say oh i i know i'm progressing slowly

209
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:51,280
but you know i'm easily distracted not in the sense of

210
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:57,040
thinking of something but wanting to do something else and

211
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:02,960
i need to do one thing for long enough

212
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:10,240
before i drop and do something else well said that's exactly right there's

213
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:16,720
this it's um you know given that you have the aspiration just as you said to to awaken

214
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:22,240
to wake up and and you sit and after five minutes there's like okay i've got to do this

215
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:27,920
other thing like oh yeah that's more important like wait a minute dear what's what's your highest aspiration

216
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:34,880
what's what's really important to you right so could be can can you and bringing patients there

217
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:41,440
this is a beautiful way this beautiful quality or can i be patient with this agitation because maybe what's really

218
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:49,119
underneath of wanting to get up and do something else is a sense of agitation um can i be patient with myself or maybe

219
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:56,560
they're different framing as you were saying like a sense of patience okay i'm just gonna be patient with me walking this path

220
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:02,560
i'm going to be patient and i actually give it time not just give it five minutes so there's so many different but

221
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,760
it's also fully engaged with whatever that thing is yeah yeah

222
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:13,760
exactly yeah patience is fully engaged yeah

223
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:20,160
yeah patience is fully engaged resignation is not engaged that's another thing you have to explore

224
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:26,318
patience is fully engaged yeah thank you richard

225
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:33,359
you are the reflections here bill says it seems to me that patience and love

226
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:40,000
are closely related yes indeed exactly thank you for that

227
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,079
you says thank you nikki you're welcome you mary says i love the reminder patience

228
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:51,839
paves the path yes you're welcome yes patience paves

229
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:57,280
the path it is engaged it is engaged

230
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:03,839
active engagement with ourselves with others um yeah

231
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:07,839
patience pays the path

232
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:17,119
any other reflections before we share patience

233
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:23,760
pepper says patience and acceptance are also related yes yeah definitely yeah

234
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:29,599
they're both related and and a little different the same way that patience and love are

235
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:35,200
related and it's like i think of these as venn diagrams right you know you're familiar with venn diagrams these

236
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:42,160
circles like you have these circles that define a particular entity so patience and acceptance have areas

237
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:47,760
that are in common but of course there are other aspects to them

238
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:55,280
and so so in many ways patience uh needs needs acceptance patience

239
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,560
um patience requires a level of acceptance that yes this is how things

240
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:07,599
are right now this is how things are right now and and how can i hold it how can i hold this with with both

241
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:14,839
uprightness with spaciousness with good will and with steadiness there's a steadiness

242
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:21,280
also uh in patients that's part of it it's it's really fun to explore

243
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,800
these qualities in the body and the mind like oh yeah and i'm so loving how all

244
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:32,319
of you have been and how the comments are coming like oh yeah these are related oh those are

245
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:39,519
related kind of feeling them in the in your in your body and mind yeah

246
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:47,680
so [Music] there are no other further reflections

247
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,838
maybe i'll pause for one more moment

248
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:59,200
so okay so i'll invite you now to

249
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:04,800
the small to small rooms so the invitation

250
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,880
for um the practice together

251
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:16,720
is um first of all showing up with patients showing up with the quality of

252
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:22,800
patients for yourselves equality of patience for others which again

253
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:28,400
has both love and acceptance in it as observed

254
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,440
and each person will say one nugget just one thing could be about this practice

255
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:38,800
today or it could be about your relationship with patients

256
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:46,079
relationship with your patients in general um does it come easily does it seem like a challenge or what nuance you've

257
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:51,440
explored you observed today as you were playing around with it

258
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:58,720
and um and so each person one person will say one nugget and then the other person

259
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:04,400
will say another nugget um and then the next person will say one more nugget

260
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:10,480
and it will come back to you so you'll go around a few times and

261
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:16,400
let's go in alphabetical order according to the first name and

262
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:22,640
um what else yeah so each person just sharing from your own experience if you

263
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:28,720
wish you can also offer silence and say past and just hold presence

264
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:34,240
patience compassionate presence that's perfectly okay it's fine

265
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:40,880
so um yeah i think that's uh i think that's

266
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,640

well we discussed among other things being on the phone to a t

278
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:06,720
[Laughter] and i thought that was just to me that was just the the perfect uh

279
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:13,040
the perfect obstacle the perfect task perfect learning uh situation

280
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:18,480
uh how to hang in there and maybe get what you want but not make it

281
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:24,079
worse yeah yeah yeah that's that's exactly right

282
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:29,599
yeah thank you fred that's a great example yeah and we all go through

283
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:35,200
examples like that yeah appreciate that barbara please

284
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:44,160
oops please you're still uh you're still muted ah there i have a similar example i live

285
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:51,359
on an island that has a drawbridge and for the first time in the year and a

286
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:57,200
half i've lived on the island i went to leave and and there that there

287
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:02,319
was no the traffic wasn't moving we were backed up for blocks this way and that

288
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:09,760
way and you could see people that were unaware of it were getting really worked

289
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:17,040
up and those that know that the drawbridge is up we're just sort of relaxing

290
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:24,240
and you know none of us were going to get across the bridge any faster for getting all worked up so that's exactly

291
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:29,440
right opportunity for patients yeah for exercising practicing thank you

292
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:35,359
thank you for that and there's one reflection privately that it's hard when someone takes up the

293
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:42,240
whole time seems to be happening a lot lately so so i appreciate that maybe in the groups also you know even though

294
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:47,359
with the invitation that each person will just say a nugget and then the next person will say nugget and the next

295
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:54,240
person will come back to it may not always happen that way even there's always the invitation to be mindful and

296
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:59,839
yet especially with the topic tonight i think that is the perfect if that happened in your group

297
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:05,119
it's okay it's a perfect opportunity to be patient with one another it's like

298
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:10,400
it's okay if i don't say something tonight i can exercise patience that was

299
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:15,920
the invitation anyway can you show up with patience for each other and yourself so

300
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:23,040
if you did that yeah you just succeeded even if you didn't get a word in edgewise yay then you've practiced

301
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:29,520
perfectly with with uh meta and patience so anyway so thank you all it's it's

302
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:34,559
lovely to practice with you and whatever we do as long as we bring kindness to it

303
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:41,760

heart for the purpose of serving yourself and all beings everywhere may all beings be safe
