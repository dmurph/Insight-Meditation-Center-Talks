1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:06,560
okay it's good to be with you all

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:12,000
my name is devin devin berry i'm actually in northampton massachusetts

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,920
i'm happy to be here with the insight meditation community in redwood city um

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:31,840
and we'll do a guided meditation for about 25 minutes or so and then i'll offer some short reflections afterwards okay

5
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:38,000
so allowing yourself to settle in in a comfortable posture whatever that may be whether

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,840
that's sitting on a cushion or a chair or lying down standing if you prefer

7
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,960
and resting the body alert yet as comfortable

8
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,840
as possible in this moment

9
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:13,840
and maybe gently closing the eyes

10
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:20,560
maybe getting a sense of the body the body sitting on the cushion maybe your bottom

11
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,159
on the cushion or feet on the floor hands on knees

12
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,640
just any of those contacts contacts

13
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,520
getting a sense of the body resting on the earth

14
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:45,360
maybe that's a sense of the body breathing expanding and contracting almost like a balloon

15
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,680
perhaps noticing warm or cool air at the nostrils

16
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,759
maybe one of the other anchors rise and fall at the chest or in and out of the belly

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,479
allowing attention to rest there coming back with some sense of

18
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:23,840
gentleness or kindness when the mind wanders off

19
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:37,840
allowing the breath to be as it is

20
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:08,000
maybe noticing with a slight sense of curiosity or alertness any

21
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:19,840
sounds in the background just allowing them to come and go

22
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,839
so

23
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,840
you

24
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:53,840

thank you for joining us today devin really appreciate it thank you good to be here with you all

37
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:24,640
so i wanted to offer some brief reflections on meta and

38
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:30,720
i'll say this wasn't actually the plan coming in but i received an email late last night with the subject

39
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:36,400
heading that said why meta and it was really late at night and i deleted the email by mistake so i

40
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:43,359
didn't actually read the email i just saw the subject head y meta and i think it just must have

41
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:48,560
been in my mind stream so i have been uh was thinking about it all night and i

42
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:55,119
thought about it this morning while i was out on a walk and thought this is a good inquiry a good uh

43
00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:01,760
piece of information for reflection it's something i realize that i haven't actually reflected on in quite a while

44
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:07,680
in my own meta practice and and then going back and looking at the email i did in fact

45
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:14,079
find from a yogi a friend of really wanting to know

46
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:20,480
why would he be doing this practice why why why should i do this practice and and and i think for me it had been

47
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:26,880
pretty easy to answer it was just sort of it was that you know i've said over and over again it's this um

48
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:33,760
um wish for good will and kindness for myself and for everyone else

49
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,040
and i think he was looking for a little more a little more than that and so i was just sort of

50
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:44,560
um going back and letting that inquiry sort of land in the body to

51
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,960
really get a sense of of what it was

52
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:56,320
that has driven me to this practice or or leads me to to to meta practice and it is a i

53
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:02,079
consider it a foundational practice for myself and one that that i that i love to share and

54
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:08,320
talk about with others and encourage other other folks to do and i think it's really it's sort of um

55
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:14,560
well actually having that wide method is it's a really good thing just to clarify intention with with any of our practices

56
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:20,160
and with meta in particular i think clarifying the intention the the

57
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:28,720
intention in meta seems to be or at least i i see it as the um the engine right so this this

58
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:34,640
intention is is the engine that that then drives

59
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:39,279
um the condition

60
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:46,800
and action and how we engage in the world it right it's sort

61
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:53,760
of the engine that conditions the action that colors how we engage the world

62
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:00,400
and what i've seen over the years so there are these categories in meta

63
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,440
oftentimes that that we work with if we work with them in a systematic way of the

64
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,880
self benefactor you know someone that is supportive of you or inspiration to

65
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:19,359
you or has has inspired you mentors teachers that sort of thing dear friends um the difficult

66
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:26,320
person or category those you know those folks that we may have a little charge with or or a little difficulty or challenge with

67
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:32,960
and the neutral category and the thing that came to mind to me most is is that neutral category those folks

68
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:41,040
that that i don't know and i'll come back to those in a bit how that was um led to some pretty

69
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:46,800
profound shifts in my own practice i wanted to get to a little bit the first thing i thought when this why meta

70
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:53,200
came up is something that i've had posted on a refrigerator for years it is

71
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:59,359
in this way that we must train ourselves by liberation of the self through love we will develop love

72
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:06,079
we will practice it we will make it both a way and a basis take our stand upon it store it up and

73
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:11,680
thoroughly set it going and that's from the mutant nikaya

74
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:18,640
and sort of use that as a aspiration or a little mantra to actually um

75
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:26,640
get back to what this practice means for me what i'm doing with this practice and i think my initial

76
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:32,560
difficulty with meta was i had lots of blocks and there was lots of anger and agitation and resentment and it was the

77
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:39,200
last thing i wanted to do and of course it was the thing that i probably both needed to do um so that's been a helpful support for

78
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,838
me and

79
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:52,000
many of the suit is mirror so some of what i was saying about the the intention and clarifying intention and uh

80
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,400
meta as a as a practice that conditions action and moves to heart a

81
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,599
lot of that is actually mirrored in the sutas and so i wanted to look at a couple of them and actually look at

82
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:09,520
the origin story of meta itself but one of the from the early sutas

83
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:16,240
in the way that um one of the first instances that we know of of the

84
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:22,000
meta being used or being spoken of in the sutures is also from the samyut nikaya

85
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:29,440
so the monks so the monks went to the park of the wanderers of other sex on arrival they exchanged courteous

86
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:36,079
greetings with the wonders after an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesy as they set to one side

87
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:42,079
as they were sitting there the wanderers said to them friends so gotama the contemplatives teaches the

88
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:48,560
dhamma to his disciples in this way correct come monks abandoning the five

89
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:55,599
hindrances the corruptions of awareness that we can discernment keep pervading the first direction with

90
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:01,040
awareness imbued with good will likewise the second likewise the third

91
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:06,319
likewise the fourth thus and above below and all around everywhere in its

92
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:13,599
entirety keep pervading the all-encompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with goodwill

93
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:20,800
abundant expansive immeasurable without hostility and without ill will

94
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:27,440
so we see that as one of the early instances of um the buddha and the buddhist disciples

95
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,960
talking about meta and how it was practiced at that time

96
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:40,079
so there was something um also that that interested me early on

97
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:48,000
with with with meta and the suit is was the origin story itself where

98
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:54,240
during one of the rainy seasons and there are 500 monks 500 being lots of monks not necessarily

99
00:41:54,240 --> 00:42:00,880
an exact number always uh 500 monks in the forest during the rainy season

100
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:06,480
they went to practice and had been there for a few days and all seemed to be well and

101
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:14,160
they're practicing making headway in their practice and the tree spirits and

102
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:19,680
devas and other beings in the forest at some point became a little agitated and and upset

103
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:27,040
because they weren't sure how long these monks were going to be staying and being there and so this as the story goes they begin

104
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:32,079
emitting horrible smells and sounds and doing all sorts of things to

105
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:38,960
scare the monks and it worked the monks were terrified and uh they all packed up and

106
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:45,280
ran off and went to see the buddha and the buddha of course sent them right

107
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:51,359
back to the same forest and this time he had mentioned that they that they were in the forest without

108
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:57,119
protection and so he sends them there with protection and what he sends them with is the

109
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:03,040
metasuta so they go back and practice and so they're practicing meta they're chanting

110
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:08,560
the metasuta and of course this allows them to really settle into the

111
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:16,560
practice it settles the mind the tree spirits the devas the beings and all of these other creatures begin to see the monks as

112
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:22,240
not being so mad and they seem to also be affected by the meta that's happening and they

113
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:30,079
begin to actually support the practice that's happening and of course as in many of the stories

114
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:36,079
in the sutures the monks became enlightened and so the protection that they actually

115
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:41,359
sent the that that the buddha actually sent the monks with was what we know

116
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:47,280
as the meta suta and the mata suit i believe is the only one of the brahma bihar's

117
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:54,400
these divine abodes these uh the one of the four brahmana baharas these these practices of the heart

118
00:43:54,400 --> 00:44:00,400
we call them in today's vernacular it's the only one with it with a dedicated discourse

119
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:07,920
um i want to take a look at that for a second so it says this is what should be done

120
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:14,240
by one who is skilled in goodness and who knows the path of peace let them be able and upright

121
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:21,520
straightforward and gentle in speech humble and not conceited contented and easily satisfied

122
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:28,560
unburdened with duties and frugal in their ways peaceful and calm and wise and skillful

123
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:33,599
not proud and demanding in nature let them not do the slightest thing that the

124
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:39,680
wise would later reprove wishing in gladness and in safety may all beings

125
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:45,440
be at ease whatever living beings there may be whether they are weak or strong

126
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:52,160
omitting none the great or the mighty medium short or small the seen and the

127
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:57,200
unseen those living near and far away those born

128
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:04,000
and to be born may all beings be at ease let none deceive another or despise any

129
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:10,160
being in any state let none through anger or ill will wish harm upon another

130
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:16,240
even as a mother protects with her life her child her only child so with the boundless

131
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:23,200
heart should one cherish all living beings radiating kindness over the entire world

132
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:30,720
spreading upwards to the skies and downwards to the depths outwards and unbounded freed from hatred

133
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:36,000
and ill will whether standing or walking seated or lying down

134
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:43,119
one should sustain this recollection this is said to be the sublime abiding by not holding to

135
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:50,880
fixed views the pure hearted one having clarity of vision being freed from all sense desires is

136
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:59,119
not born again into this world so that was the

137
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:05,920
detects the crux of of what the buddha had given these monks to practice with in the

138
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:11,440
forest and when i think about

139
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:19,040
so he gave them this protection practice right so we often view meta as being a a protection practice

140
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:25,119
and i think when i look at that inquiry of why meta some of that is actually to be able to protect myself

141
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:32,560
it actually allows me allows us to be with mindfulness allows the mind to

142
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:38,800
to settle somewhat and allows us to be able to release the heart to be able to

143
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:45,920
open the heart with this sense of safety that our practice

144
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,280
helps us to cultivate and so when when i was mentioning before

145
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:56,800
about the the neutral category the neutral persons and beings i really

146
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:05,920
feel like i've gotten to see quite a profound shift in social connection actually

147
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:12,560
out and about in the world so really taking my practice off the cushion and into the world and so

148
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:19,280
before moving to new england i i lived in uh san francisco for a number of years and all over the bay area

149
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:26,400
the last few years i was there before moving i um gave up my car so i was riding cow

150
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:33,599
trains and barred and riding a bike and walking and and ubers i spent a lot of time in ubers

151
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:41,520
back and forth to the airport and that sort of thing and actually used that as an opportunity to

152
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:46,720
practice meta with the neutral person so every time i got into cars right i was

153
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:52,960
with someone that i didn't know hadn't seen before and what i noticed actually is oftentimes i was in the car

154
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:59,760
with someone that had some piece of buddhist iconography on the dashboard or hanging from the

155
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:06,800
window or something and so i actually used that opportunity to to practice meta

156
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:14,160
for them and occasionally would mention something about the uh um the iconography that

157
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:19,839
that they had the little buddha statue or prayer prayer flag or something or quite often someone would ask me you

158
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:25,839
know where i was going when i was you know headed to the airport with them and oftentimes it was to retreat and so that

159
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:30,880
led to a conversation about about uh meditation or buddhism and that thing and so for

160
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:36,160
for a number of folks this was you know what they knew from their home countries and so it was a really

161
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:42,000
beautiful connection and what i'd seen over and over and over again is that this person that was

162
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:48,079
neutral someone that i didn't have a charge with one way or the other that i didn't know had never seen often times would never

163
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:54,800
see again this was someone that moved from that neutral category to the

164
00:48:54,800 --> 00:49:01,280
friend category not necessarily a dear friend in a couple of cases yes but but they were able to move and

165
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:07,839
it was based on um this being able to settle the mind some

166
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:14,480
with degrees of mindfulness and and using the meta practice and actually wishing this

167
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:21,680
other person good will and kindness and friendliness and being able to model some of that and there were a

168
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:28,240
couple of different occasions where the person that was driving me to my destination we

169
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:34,079
ended up i stopped for coffee with one one i actually invited

170
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:41,440
to my house to the surprise of everyone else in my house for sure and it was quite a beautiful

171
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:47,119
thing to be able to pop into the back of this car with this

172
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:53,040
person i'd never seen before to be able to practice over the course of whatever that ride was

173
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:59,200
10 20 30 minutes and feel like i've made a deep connection

174
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:05,359
with this person upon getting out of the car and i've seen that time and time again

175
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:11,680
with the metro practice not necessarily that but it just allows me to actually one see the blocks that are there where i'm

176
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:17,520
hesitant um or where i've created a projection or story about someone

177
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:24,800
and also has allowed me to um as the buddha sent

178
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:32,319
the monks back into the forest with this antidote to fear it has served as a as an explicit example of an antidote

179
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:39,680
for fear in my own mind dropping that into the mind stream and so some of those are the why meta

180
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:44,800
for me and also it points to something else that that another beautiful part of the

181
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:51,839
sutures that i love the purpose of my teaching of the holy life of the dharma is not for gaining merit not for good deeds nor

182
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:57,839
rapture nor concentration but for the sure hearts release this and this alone

183
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:04,240
is the reason for the teachings and as i stay close to that and as i as

184
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:10,400
we stay close to this aspiration of practicing for the sherhart's release whatever the practice

185
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:15,760
is then it allows us to connect with ourselves it allows us

186
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:21,520
to connect with others around us and i believe given the the times that

187
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:28,000
we're in right and it's going to be different in all the times but the times that we are particularly living in i think this is actually quite

188
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:37,200
um an important and quite profound thing to uh to keep close from the tavija suta

189
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:44,960
just as if a mighty trumpeter were with little difficulty to make a proclamation to the four directions so by this

190
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:51,440
liberation of the mind through the development of loving-kindness one sets an example leaving nothing

191
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:57,119
untouched nothing unaffected and this really speaks to right

192
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:02,720
the sending of the emotion of care and love in all directions nothing untouched nothing unaffected

193
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:08,800
nothing out of earshot and that helps to keep in mind that

194
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:15,920
i'm not picking and choosing and in the not picking and choosing right it doesn't matter it's like

195
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:23,520
white male cis bodies black bodies trans bodies queer bodies everybody it does it matter who it is

196
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:28,559
right and at different times meta can serve as a purification practice of their little

197
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:34,559
blocks or or um um little things that come up in the mind

198
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:41,119
that we don't particularly like or difficult so it's able to point out some of those

199
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:47,119
things and as those things come out come up then um

200
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:53,280
skillful means to be able to hold those with mindfulness and probably compassion as well so at

201
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:59,440
times it's like both of those brahman bahar practices end up being two sides of the same coin that i often

202
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:04,800
use as something difficult or challenging comes up in the mind when i'm doing meta whether

203
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:10,160
i'm doing it in a formal sense or whether i'm doing it off the cushion

204
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:19,359
and i think with the y meta as well it um

205
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:26,240
when i think of it now actually quite a bit of the why is around um i used to always talk about and heard

206
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:33,520
the term stealth meta right so much of what i was talking about and with the the the neutral person or the

207
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:39,200
neutral beings was stealth meta right it's not me sitting on the cushion it's not us sitting on the cushion but it's

208
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:45,440
us out about in the world practicing meta and i think part of the why that i'm interested now is really

209
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:52,800
um blurring that line removing that barrier of not actually their my formal practice and my

210
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:59,920
uh stealth meta practice being one and the same not separating them at all

211
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:05,599
and really being able to in the same way that we rest attention on the breath or that we rest

212
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:10,800
attention on sensations we rest attention on those phrases rest

213
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:20,720
attention on images rest attention on the felt sense of benevolence good will kindness

214
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:28,400
friendliness and in doing that it really blurs the

215
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:38,240
line there isn't there isn't a separation of that practice at all

216
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:41,760
so there's one other thing

217
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:54,640
so there's um these 11 benefits of meta and i believe this was later on

218
00:54:54,640 --> 00:55:00,079
the sudimaga this is which is roughly i believe

219
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:05,760
don't quote me on this roughly i believe five five hundred two thousand years after the time of the buddha these 11

220
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,400
benefits were

221
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:18,880
we will sleep well we would wake up feeling well we're not likely to have

222
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:24,720
nightmares our body relaxes and our face is joyful even animals and celestial beings feel drawn

223
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:30,079
to us spirits protect us fire poison and weapons will not harm us

224
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:37,680
the mind immediately becomes calm our complexion brightens we die with a clear mind or unconfused

225
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:44,400
will die in peace and i've always found those interesting it's not so clearly there are some in

226
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:50,480
there and i'll jump to one right away that that the very first time i heard it whereas fire poisons and weapons will not harm

227
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:55,599
us right that's not one to test out and so i i i think i in in in my mind

228
00:55:55,599 --> 00:56:01,359
i've really viewed it as looking at it in regards to to greed hatred and delusion rather than

229
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:08,400
rather than some very explicit things um but the sleeping well and waking well

230
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:14,160
is one that actually you can immediately try out and experiment with it's one

231
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:20,720
oftentimes that i use in terms of listening to the chanting of the meta suit in pali or in english or

232
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:26,240
chanting it myself uh listening to talks on the brahmi viharas

233
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:32,960
before bed it's really interesting to see what changes occur

234
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:39,119
or noticing changes the next morning and doing this over quite a bit of time

235
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:49,359
or actually being quite conscious and intentional upon waking to explore that inquiry of

236
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:57,599
goodwill friendliness benevolence to all beings and it seems that the more that we're

237
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:03,359
able to actually string together um as many moments of of kindness

238
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:09,920
as possible right then that continuity of mindfulness is there that continuity

239
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:15,119
of meta is there and actually there's a pretty profound shift that occurs right and that's one that

240
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:23,200
you don't have to believe that's one you you you try out for yourselves so and i'll leave you with this this is

241
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:29,760
another that has been supportive of me because it feels like much of what we're

242
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:35,760
creating when we're creating this this field of meta and working with this on a regular basis it's sort of this

243
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:45,040
uh we begin to work with the soil of friendliness and there's this beautiful 14th century tibetan poet longchimpa

244
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:51,119
out of the soil of friendliness grows the bloom of compassion watered by the

245
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:56,240
tears of joy sheltered under the cool shade of the

246
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:05,119
tree of equanimity out of the soil of friendliness meta

247
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:13,920
grows the bloom of compassion karuna watered by the tears of joy mudita

248
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:19,440
sheltered under the cool shade of the tree of equanimity

249
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:26,720
so holding those uh that highest aspiration of wishing ourselves and others good

250
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:32,160
will friendliness and kindness

251
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:38,160
is the why of matter or has been the why of meta for myself of late

252
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:44,240
thank you all very much appreciate it
