1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,879
so

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,639
warm greetings to our meditation time together

3
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,760
and i want to start with a principle of meditation that

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,400
is not well appreciated i think or taught and that is that

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:31,920
in some of the challenges we have for meditation the art is rather than fighting the

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,480
challenge is uh transforming the challenge into something that helps us to be

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:46,559
present and to enter into the meditation space and um the um

8
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,520
so for example if there's a lot of thinking going on and you really can't stop the thinking

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,719
and just like you know really obsessing about something or other and think you know and you try to come back

10
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,878
but just it's hard or you keep spinning out then rather than struggling with your

11
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,000
thinking you might reorient your thinking

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
to think about meditation think about what's actually happening in the present moment

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,040
and thinking about meditation is not the same as meditation exactly

14
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,479
but it's certainly better than the alternative because you're pointing the thinking

15
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:32,799
into the present to what's actually happening what you're dedicated towards and so a variation of this has to do

16
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,960
with the imagination that um if we're thinking about the past or the future

17
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:45,280
it's partly an act of imagination we're thinking thoughts of fantasy it's

18
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,560
imagination especially when there's visualizations going on we're visualizing things

19
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,960
and to some degree imagination is at play with a lot of the ways in which we drift off in thought and that's one of

20
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,799
the reasons why it can be so compelling and so it's also possible then to use

21
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,720
imagination to be present to point us back into the present moment

22
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:15,440
and and ideally for the purposes of meditation this would be a very simple act of

23
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:21,599
meditation of imagination imaginations which support the settling

24
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:29,120
and concentrating and uh becoming more attentive to the present moment but to harness the

25
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,640
power of imagination to be present is um something that the

26
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,000
buddha never taught explicitly but in his teachings it's kind of

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,959
implicit and i'll talk about that later so i'll offer you some simple

28
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:56,000
i'll offer you some simple acts of imagination that maybe can help you gather yourself

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,720
together and become focused and present here in the moment and so if you hear as you hear these

30
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,720
little exercises and imagination keep in mind this is this is the purpose of them to help us really be

31
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:17,120
here in the present moment so to begin to

32
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,000
take some care for your meditation posture

33
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,000
and the attention to the posture is the

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,560
beginning of mindfulness meditation being mindful of

35
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,120
the posture making mindful adjustments

36
00:03:40,879 --> 00:04:00,319
and as you exhale mindfully relaxing and softening parts of your body

37
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:08,000
close your eyes and to begin the process of

38
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:15,840
being present in the place you're at here in this body this time

39
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,359
slowly maybe tenderly take a few long slow deep breaths

40
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:43,840
breathing in and deeply and maybe lovingly exhale long exhale

41
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:57,840
and then letting your breathing return to normal

42
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,680
and then one more time one more round of going through your body

43
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,039
and on the exhale relaxing the parts of your body that are

44
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,840
easy to relax

45
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:25,840
and as you relax relax into the pull of gravity

46
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,840
and then sitting here quietly

47
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:03,680
meditating quietly in your meditation place evoke your imagination

48
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,919
that with your eyes closed imagine yourself sitting meditating where you're

49
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:16,639
meditating imagine yourself in this space

50
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:24,319
imagine yourself on your spot imagine you're seeing yourself in your

51
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:35,840
meditation posture

52
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,479
in a sense you're using your imagination to imagine what is actually happening here

53
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,680
but it is an act of imagination a little bit removed from the

54
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:54,879
direct experience imagining

55
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:02,479
your spine your back

56
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:08,000
have a picture in your mind perhaps of what's happening with your hands

57
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:17,120
your legs

58
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:24,720
if you have an easy ability to visualize maybe visualize yourself sitting here

59
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,840
quietly peacefully just here

60
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:41,840
and then imagine that side by side with you is a person

61
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:48,479
who really inspires you in in the dharma

62
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:58,560
maybe the buddha sits next to you or kuan yin available

63
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,680
or some teacher that greatly inspires you

64
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:12,319
and they're meditating next to you and what would it be like to have this

65
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,759
inspiring meditator side by side with you sharing with you

66
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:27,840
in the meditation in your space

67
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,479
and then imagine that see in sitting here in your own

68
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:50,640
experience you're sharing a lot of experiences with this companion of yours

69
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,839
both of you feel the temperature of the room

70
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:03,040
both of you who hear the same sounds around you

71
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,800
in this inspiring person next to you imagine how this person feels the

72
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:22,880
temperature hears the sounds

73
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,120
and like you this person is breathing

74
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,839
and while there might be differences between your breath and theirs there's also a lot of

75
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:41,519
similarities they also experience their rhythm of breathing in and breathing out

76
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,560
and maybe imagine how this person would sit peacefully and

77
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,720
feel that rhythm and the sensations of breathing

78
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:10,320
and like you this person feels their body maybe there are some

79
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,839
differences but a lot of similarities to be in this body to feel it and sense

80
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,920
it and imagining how this person meditates

81
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:30,839
and holds and relates to their body from the inside out maybe with peacefulness or calmness or

82
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,839
ease

83
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:49,200
and as you're sitting with yourself here can you feel or intuit

84
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:56,480
within yourself some degree of calmness or peace

85
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,839
embodied calmness settledness

86
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:15,839
which receives your breathing the experience of breathing

87
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:26,839
imagine what it'd be like for you to be peaceful maybe you're not peaceful

88
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:31,680
particularly but imagine what it'd be like

89
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:37,680
maybe remembering a time that you were peaceful or contented

90
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,120
settled at ease

91
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:49,120
remembering what it was like at that time physically the actual experience from

92
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:55,760
the point of view of your body what was it like in your body to be peaceful and settled

93
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,399
at ease

94
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:10,639
and then to let go of the imagination of your companion

95
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:17,120
of some other time and place where you felt peaceful even imagination of yourself sitting

96
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:24,720
here but allow there to linger some of the

97
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,800
qualities of peace or calmness

98
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:44,000
and gently tenderly you know allow the experience of breathing

99
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:53,839
to be received in whatever calmness or peacefulness that there is

100
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,480
receiving the experience of inhale

101
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,720
allowing for exhaling

102
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:26,240
letting there be an ever so short pause before you inhale

103
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:35,839
pause where the mind can get quiet

104
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:49,120
in which then you can just receive the inhale when it wants to begin

105
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:55,519
an ever so short pause at the before the exhale

106
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:02,399
so that you can feel more fully how good it is to allow

107
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:17,839
for the release the exhale

108
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:10,160
imagining that all around you and all within you is lots and lots of space

109
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:17,920
lots of room and breathing

110
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:28,320
has lots of breathing room room with space which is peaceful

111
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,439
expansive easeful

112
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,399
and breathing in and breathing out

113
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,279
allowing and releasing

114
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:53,279
is intimate with all the space and room peace

115
00:15:53,279 --> 00:16:09,839
that's also present here

116
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:02,160
imagining the mind what it would be like if it were there

117
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,038
was a refreshing silence in the mind

118
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:15,760
a silence which was maybe that maybe spread through all the space

119
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,839
that's here

120
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,720
silence that makes your thinking

121
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,840
not so important

122
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:41,919
silence that allows the thinking to relax and dissolve

123
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:47,840
diffused into the silence

124
00:17:52,400 --> 00:18:01,840
breathing in and breathing out in space and silence

125
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,320
having a very teeny pause at the end of the out breath

126
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,360
the end of the in-breath

127
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:48,000
relaxed pause can be a little protection

128
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,360
from being caught up in your thoughts or your imagination

129
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:05,840
little reminder stay here with the direct experience of breathing

130
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,039
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

131
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:53,200
take a few moments to imagine some of the people that you you'll encounter today or

132
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,960
communicate with today or maybe think about today

133
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:05,360
and imagine what it would be like if you could encounter them

134
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:12,640
being peaceful having a simple good will

135
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,679
without any animosity or anxiety

136
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:26,880
or any strong desire that expectation for anything

137
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:35,840
imagine what it'd be like to meet them in a peaceful goodwill

138
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:43,039
that is not so strong to

139
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:49,840
disturb them but just nice for you

140
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:05,840
imagining that possibility and then wishing aspiring

141
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:11,120
that whatever benefit and goodness that's come from this meditation

142
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:17,279
then it might be translated in your body in your heart and the mind

143
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:23,919
to walking through the world in a way that brings benefit to others whether seen

144
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:29,039
or unseen whether you know knowingly or unknowingly

145
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:36,720
may it be that the merit the benefits the goodness of our meditation together

146
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:45,840
spreads into the world with kind actions supportive actions

147
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:53,200
generous activity for the welfare and happiness of all beings

148
00:28:53,200 --> 00:29:02,720
may all beings be happy may all beings be safe

149
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,480
may all beings be peaceful

150
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,398
may all beings everywhere be

151
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,840
free

152
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,840
you

153
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:18,720
so my friends that the

154
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:24,880
kind of subject for this week is the fifth and sixth step of mindfulness

155
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:30,000
of breathing which is to experience joy and happiness in meditation

156
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,279
and it's certainly not easy to experience that and you can't just do it just because the

157
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:41,120
instructions say so you should do so but uh to explore this territory of joy

158
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:46,799
and happiness meditative well-being and some of the conditions that support it some of the

159
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:53,360
things that bring it about can be very helpful and so that's a topic for today this

160
00:30:53,360 --> 00:31:02,880
week and so um so there's uh the precursor

161
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:11,880
often often the suttas for joy and happiness is gladness and uh the word is pamoja

162
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:18,240
p-a-m-o-j-j-a and pamoja comes from the

163
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:24,240
the kind of the root word we don't never know if the root or the etymology is that important

164
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,760
for the people who spoke it but it's certainly a fun game to play

165
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:36,320
and uh so the paw is the prefix can mean either outward or upward and uh

166
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:44,840
the moja comes from the word for face mukka and so

167
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:50,080
the the uh the idea of you know something of the

168
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:56,880
face uplifting face a face that's rising up or maybe a mouth sometimes the mouth is

169
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:02,880
closely associated with this word from for face and it's the uplifting of the lifting of

170
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:09,360
the mouth i think of it as uh up lifting up the corners of the mouth to make a smile

171
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:16,559
so is that which and lit makes a smile or a kind of maybe a beatific kind of

172
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:25,120
out upward gazing at what inspires us and in fact and for the buddha the

173
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:30,640
the uh he encouraged people when there's difficulties in meditation

174
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:38,240
to think about or imagine an inspiring something that's inspiring or

175
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:45,760
but inspiring not in a way that's activating because the word for inspiring also has the meaning for

176
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:53,120
confidence or peacefulness or kind of brightness so that which brings brightness or

177
00:32:53,120 --> 00:33:00,559
confidence or or peacefulness kind of a peaceful confident brightness

178
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:05,679
maybe so we'd say in simply in english kind of inspired

179
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:12,640
and and and to be inspired when we sit down to meditate involves

180
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:20,880
activating the imagination and and we find that imagination

181
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:27,679
is regularly referenced in the teachings of the buddha in relationship to meditation

182
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:34,399
and this was certainly very different than how i was introduced to both vipassana practice and zen practice

183
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:39,919
where the explicit and the implicit instructions was not to not to be involved in

184
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:45,919
thinking so much and now certainly not to be involved in imagination this was the meditation practice about

185
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:51,519
just being present for things as they directly are unmediated by concepts unmediated by the

186
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:56,799
imagination just the experience in and of itself and

187
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:05,600
the direct sensations direct contact with things and and and that's definitely true

188
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:12,960
but it becomes it becomes true as the meditation gets more and more centered in the present moment

189
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,079
and but to get ourselves centered in the present moment and centered in the present moment with some

190
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:23,200
joy some well-being imagination can be

191
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:30,398
harnessed can be utilized for that purpose and and so uh the buddha i encourage

192
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:38,000
people to think of an inspiring topic and some of the things that he um talked about that were inspiring

193
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,079
was to think about that the buddha himself think about someone who you're really

194
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:50,158
inspired by their practice by their being how they are in their life in a way that kind of

195
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:56,398
is inspiring enough to really want to sit here and be here and kind of kind of puts to rest other

196
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:02,560
thoughts and concerns that keep you distracted and um or

197
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:09,200
to uh the encouragement is to be inspired by your own virtue

198
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:15,359
and of course that requires us to be virtuous and but the word virtue

199
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:21,520
has really means virtuous conduct so you don't have to be inspired by what

200
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,560
you're feeling on the inside the buddha's teachings are be inspired

201
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:32,400
by how you act in the world and if you're acting in a world without causing harm if you're not you haven't

202
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,839
stolen any money from the bank lately or you know it killed any of your neighbors late recently

203
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:45,359
or uh you know done all kinds of things then that's a source of being inspired

204
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:52,000
and it doesn't mean you have to be a hundred percent virtuous but uh to recognize the way that we

205
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,079
are living a virtuous life even if it's just for today

206
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:03,839
not to be burdened by the past so much and but rather be inspired by what is good and

207
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:09,280
beneficial and so to be inspired by one's own virtue maybe that's a hard thing for many

208
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:15,200
people to imagine to experience but it's certainly one of the teachings of the buddha and one of the purposes of being

209
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:21,119
virtuous is to create the inner context to be inspired and gladdened and

210
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:26,240
uplifted so we're more so it's easier to stay present

211
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:31,520
and the other thing that the buddha makes explicit about what's inspiring

212
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:38,960
is his mudita

213
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:44,320
the appreciative joy to think about the things in the world that bring you a

214
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:51,440
wholesome nourishing kind of joy like so to share in the joy of others who are doing wonderful things

215
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,800
and and be inspired by that and so this idea of being inspired

216
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:02,400
uh by things is um uh is not meant to take us away from the

217
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,520
present moment or to be a spiritual bypass it is not meant for us to dwell there

218
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:14,480
just kind of keep thinking about thinking about and fantasizing about it but rather to do it just enough that

219
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:20,880
it really orient us to the present moment it brings this uplifting kind of

220
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:27,920
feelings and goodness that we're capable of then feeling and then riding those feelings into the

221
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:36,079
present moment it's sometimes easier to be present if there's some modicum of well-being that's here as well and

222
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:41,119
it's not meant to be again an overriding or a bypass of the challenges we have or the

223
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:46,640
suffering we have but it is helping to create a context where it's

224
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:52,800
easier to be with the challenges to work through them and meditate with them breathe with them

225
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:59,359
and so the principle here that i think that supports this idea of using the imagination

226
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:06,640
for something that's inspiring is that is that to to to do it when the

227
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:11,839
alternative is worse human beings spend a lot of

228
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:17,359
time in their imagination imagine the future what's going to happen the terrible things are going to happen

229
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:22,480
imagining the past remembering you know some percentage of our memory

230
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:28,560
is uh fantasy we it's well known that we don't necessarily remember accurately

231
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:35,040
what happened in the past we're telling ourselves a story we spin it a certain way we spin it around the things that really

232
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:40,800
have a charge for us whether it's good or bad and we kind of kind of stretching

233
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:46,320
certain parts of the story the memory to fill the space of memory

234
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,680
in a way that not completely accurate and uh and so sometimes that can be very

235
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:59,599
depressing and agitating uh certain fantasies can be not helpful at all and uh so if the if

236
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:06,560
we're doing that anyway in the imagination then uh it's possible to use the imagination

237
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:14,400
don't fight the imagination then and try which might not be working but harness the imagination to help you

238
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,680
be here in the present moment to gather together and

239
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,800
and then when you're here enough then you can let go of the imagination

240
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:32,480
and then sit here and be present so you know i've in the course of this teachings i've offered some imagination

241
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:37,520
imaginary kind of scenarios images to help for example

242
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:43,520
as i love this image for breathing of the of the waves of the ocean washing up on

243
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:51,359
the sandy shore and kind of i have this image of myself of of the especially when the waves once they're

244
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:56,800
washed ashore they're washing up across the sand and making the sand wet for a while

245
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:02,400
and then the receding and then as it recedes it's the sand is wet but then the the water

246
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:08,560
kind of that's the surface kind of gets pulled into the underneath the sand and so you get a

247
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:14,640
whole different texture feeling of receding and absorbing

248
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:20,000
and this image of this of then of like the i use it different ways in meditation but

249
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:27,200
imagining the breathing experience of breathing are the waves and my body is the sand

250
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:32,560
or the experience of breathing the sensations that come and go the

251
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:37,599
cycles of upswelling and and receding

252
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:44,960
with the exhale is washing across the shore the sand of awareness and it kind of

253
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,640
that image kind of keeps me there and involved i've known some people who have

254
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:58,240
one person in particular who used um the image of a large bird maybe a

255
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:04,319
i don't know some large wonderful majestic bird flying in the sky and the inhales and

256
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:12,800
the exhales were the where they uh the flapping of the wings the slow long just flapping in

257
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:18,319
the wings of the bird and uh and that kind of kept her engaged and involved and

258
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:24,800
flying along and um so to use the imagination

259
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:32,079
to help us be connected and then uh to use it to help us be inspired

260
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:39,200
uh and and to know as i've said how not to overuse it how to use it so

261
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:44,880
it's onwardly leading in the direction i talked about yesterday that we're going towards

262
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:51,920
uh doing less and less activity to quiet or still or states of mind and to more

263
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:58,880
from coarser to the more refined more active to the more peaceful and so we use these things to support

264
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:07,920
that process knowing at some point we have to let go of it not relying on it too much not

265
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:14,880
overdoing it not depending on it not using it as a antidote so we don't have to face our

266
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:20,400
difficulties or work through them but rather as a way so that we can be present

267
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:27,520
in an effective way so so to

268
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:33,680
particularly i want to end now with the idea of inspiration with that which brings a brightness and

269
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:41,839
uplift a delight brings confidence brings trust brings a willingness to

270
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:49,680
engage in practice and this idea of an inspiring things

271
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:56,800
and i would encourage you for the next 24 hours to consider what inspires you

272
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:03,599
and stay close to thinking about it and visiting it being with it somehow be

273
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:08,640
connected to it or maybe there's many things maybe you can talk to others

274
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:14,400
friends or anybody who you strangers about you have this assignment to talk

275
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:20,240
about what inspires you and and you'd like to share a little bit and hear from them what inspires them and

276
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:26,400
and maybe in ways that are spiritual in nature or has to do with some of the fundamentals

277
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:32,640
of what gives her life purpose or value and in doing so i hope that you have

278
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:38,839
some wonderful conversations and and some wonderful um time

279
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:45,280
thinking time with yourself what is it that inspires you and maybe

280
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:51,119
that you can stay close to that so thank you very much and we'll continue

281
00:43:51,119 --> 00:44:04,079
a little bit this uh the way the buddha uses imagination for meditation tomorrow thank you
