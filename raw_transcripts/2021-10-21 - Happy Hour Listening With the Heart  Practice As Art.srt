1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,600
so so hello and welcome everyone dear sangha

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:12,480
makes me happy to see you how nice what a lovely ritual we have to come together

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:19,199
from different parts of the world and practice together

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,560
so so for today's practice um

5
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:35,090
i'd like to invite us to consider the frame of reference of our practice

6
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:41,600
[Music] and there could be many frames in in our

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,440
study and practice and there's not a wrong frame

8
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,920
or a right frame just different frames to consider and

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,640
the frame i'd like to to invite for us to consider is the frame of

10
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,080
of our practice of our life as art

11
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:14,240
this open-ended co-creation arising in each moment

12
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,240
this sense of sense of beauty sense of grace

13
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:28,640
which happens to be the um frame of reference yes

14
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,200
turns out to be the domain of art art is often where beauty is is explored

15
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,280
so what if we consider our practice our exploration not so much

16
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:49,200
with a or this should happen etc etc but as with with the sense of art in the

17
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,040
making the sense of appreciating the beauty of our

18
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,640
dedication our practice even if there is fatigue even if there is pain

19
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,600
even if there is distractions in the mind what if we treated all of this as part

20
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,280
of this art this this this beautiful creation

21
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:22,239
and with this frame of reference of art if you would imagine for a moment

22
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:28,879
with music if you're a music if you are if there's a type of music that you like

23
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:36,720
um how you listen how you listen to the favorite music that you like

24
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,000
with your heart opening your heart opening your mind opening all your

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,879
senses to be impacted to listen with all your senses not just with your

26
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:56,000
ears but with your heart in the same way if you were looking at

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,360
a painting or a photograph or visual art really receiving paying attention

28
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:10,959
letting yourself be impacted this sense of beauty because the art isn't just what's on the wall or just the music

29
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,080
that you hear it's co-created in the moment with your

30
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,640
perception with your way of attending with your way with your openness

31
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,560
it's almost like the sound in the forest if a t a tree

32
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,319
falls if there's no one there to hear it did it make a sound

33
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,920
did it fall so here the sense of this art this art of your practice opening

34
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,040
your heart to what is arising the breath the body

35
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,080
awareness knowing wow

36
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,360
the most beautiful and profound instrument ever

37
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,920
that we take for granted this co-creation of knowing with various

38
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,760
stimuli that arise in the mind and the heart and the senses

39
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:14,400
our thoughts all of this so so if you are wondering especially if

40
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,600
you're new wondering okay what does that mean what what are the instructions what

41
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,479

42
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:32,240
and i also say don't worry don't worry this practice

43
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:39,440
that i will guide and introduce for us to explore is a practice of deep listening it's

44
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:45,680
just the practice of deep listening you know how to do this you know how to do this

45
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:52,080
it's not new we've done it a million times it's a practice of listening it's a

46
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,440
practice of deep listening listening with your heart listening your fear with your heart and

47
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,680
if if cognitively like what it what does it mean to listen with my heart don't think

48
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,160
about it too much drop into the body don't think about it you you you know

49
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,960
what to do trust trust that you know what to do

50
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:24,639
i'll say one more thing before we start this practice and then to say that

51
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:32,479
this practice is particularly um appropriate this way of deep listening

52
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:39,360
to ourselves deep listening listening with our heart listening with our hearts

53
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,520
as if our minds our our awareness

54
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:51,360
our thoughts our bodies it's the beautiful symphonies this piece of art in the

55
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,919
making this way of listening with our hearts is a

56
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:03,039
particularly lovely practice to to bring in when

57
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:10,400
you're tired at the end of the day when maybe conjuring up say metta may you be safe

58
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:16,160
may you be happy or maybe when you wake up in the middle of the night sometimes

59
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:22,800
and it feels like the mind is tired but the heart is awake so listen just deeply

60
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,840
listen to the crickets to the sound of rain to the sound of silence

61
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:34,639
to the to whatever is arising listen with your heart so these are the simple instructions

62
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:43,440
listen with your heart and let's begin by settling in with the body

63
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:49,638
so let's arrive and settle

64
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,680
landing in this body

65
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:27,360
letting go for now just because we want to land and arrive

66
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,840
first to stabilize first

67
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,800
letting go

68
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:50,240
of memories of thought of thinking and just being simple in the body with

69
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,400
the breath

70
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,280
connecting let your heart connect with the breath

71
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:19,360
relaxing relaxing into the body nothing to do

72
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:29,280
this is not a doing practice just receive receive the breath

73
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,839
as if you're listening to the breath with your heart

74
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:45,039
listening to the sensations of the breath with your heart

75
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:52,480
not just the sound but the sensations deep listening

76
00:08:52,480 --> 00:09:00,080
opening your heart sweet dear body what do you need right

77
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,320
now

78
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:14,000
asking the body and listening with your heart it's care in your heart

79
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,560
what is needed what do you need right now

80
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,560
just receiving the breath receiving the sensations

81
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,519
and if thoughts arise not listening with your head but

82
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,079
listening with your heart what is needed

83
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:19,839
dear thought i wonder why you're coming up in this moment let your heart listen

84
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:49,600
and if doubt arises or the various hindrances

85
00:10:53,040 --> 00:11:00,480
maybe your heart maybe your heart smiles says oh dear is that so

86
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:08,399
is that really so [Music] like a caring

87
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:18,519
mother listening deep listening

88
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,920
your heart listening

89
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,440
your body to your breath

90
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,800
and with each breath

91
00:11:52,800 --> 00:12:00,800
that is heard by your heart ah relaxing more

92
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:07,320
into your chair into your sit bones

93
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:03,360
at first we primarily listen right now to the breath and the body

94
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:10,279
just to arrive and to settle later we'll open up some more

95
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,800
listening to the symphony this music

96
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,959
that is my life in this moment unfolding my breath

97
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:41,760
these sensations this awareness this instrument of

98
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,760
knowing

99
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
both knowing and being known

100
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,399
your heart knowing

101
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,680
this instrument of perception

102
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:21,120
notice of dropping into your body opening the heart

103
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:28,639
listening listening to the body the breath and now opening up to the sounds

104
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:38,040
opening up to the sounds listening with your heart

105
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:54,639
is there a slightly different quality to listen with the heart

106
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,600
and with the head

107
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,279
don't think about it feel into the heart

108
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:40,240
sounds noises

109
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,600
they sound different when you hear when you listen with your heart

110
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,839
opening your heart with ease

111
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,360
don't try too hard

112
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,720
drop in let it flow through you

113
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:23,000
you know you know how to do this this listening with your heart

114
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,799
if the question arises am i doing this right what am i supposed to do yes

115
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:19,840
the answer is yes you are doing this right just listen just listen

116
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,840
that's all just listen

117
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:36,039
relax and listen with all your senses with your heart

118
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:52,519
listening 360 degrees all around

119
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:08,080
staying with all your senses within an open

120
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,559
open heart

121
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:24,559
the heart that cares listens

122
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,520
what is needed right now maybe nothing

123
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,720
maybe something just listen with your heart

124
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:52,360
like art let it be open-ended nothing needs to happen

125
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:07,919
the beauty the grace this moment just

126
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,200
opening our hearts and listening

127
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:37,799
and whatever is needed for you right now is the right thing

128
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,559
no right no wrong

129
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:56,880
opening opening to this magnificent spacious unfolding

130
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,440

131
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,360

to be cared for to be listened to with your heart

135
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:44,320
do the sounds even noises back in the background do they sound different

136
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:49,799
transform somehow when you listen with your heart

137
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,159
not with your head

138
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:27,159
receiving the symphony of perceptions knowings

139
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,799
with care

140
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:02,120
are even judgments transformed if you listen with your heart

141
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,960
coming back listening to your body your breath

142
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:29,000
the sensations is your heart

143

what care is needed for this body this breath in this moment

144
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:34,400
and for the last moments can you imagine

145
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:41,280
with our hearts more than our minds in this moment

146
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:48,079
we can listen and listen to the sounds of the universe

147
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:53,200
this magnificent unfolding of life

148
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,960
that we are a part of not separate

149
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:05,240
not an island completely interconnected

150
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:26,000
listening with our hearts to these amazing notes

151
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,119
of interconnection and causes and conditions

152
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:38,680
that we're a part of receiving giving

153
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:57,519
may our hearts be open to listen

154
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,720
to what is needed

155
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:11,560
for ourselves and others to serve as best as we can

166
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:49,200
where you have one soloist establish a theme and everyone else building up on the prior

167
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:57,440
people prior musicians doing their variations on a thing

168
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:03,280
i love that yes yes the co-creation of the small group practice

169
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:08,960
yes may you make beautiful music together

170
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:14,880
today as you go into small groups and it's all beautiful it's all beautiful there is

171
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:21,760
sorrow suffering it's all part of the the sacredness of being part of this

172
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,359
life so it's all beautiful not to shy away and just try to share the good

173

i also appreciated uh suggesting art and

175
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,599
feeling the senses uh before joining the sangha i

176
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:51,280
went out on the beach and it was a vision of of

177
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:59,280
gray tones it was it was no color it was raining and the clouds

178
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,319
were low and you couldn't see the lights across the bay it was just gray on gray

179
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:10,960
with little white birds skittering along the shore

180
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,160
and so it was wonderful to get out of the hat my head

181
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:23,520
and suddenly it was like oh that was it's our first rain how wonderful and it

182
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:29,599
was wonderful to observe it coming down [Music]

183
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:34,960
i feel moistened my heart feels moist and as you talk about these images and

184
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,400
the moistening thank you barbara it's lovely yeah getting out of our heads that's

185

186
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:53,680

187
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:58,720
ah and fred says strangely it dampened mine

188
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:05,280
i love the the art of all these different experiences

189
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:12,880

invite with uh the if you wanted to try this practice

193
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:39,680
is you know i was using listening as a metaphor um obviously and and maybe

194
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:46,240
what what to something to try if you wanted would be to bring

195
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:52,079
more actually more awareness to the heart center here as if you're really listening from

196
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:58,480
your heart from your heart center um and and try that and see if if you

197
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:04,480
know we might make a difference or maybe this is not the appropriate invitation for you it's

204
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:47,280
slowly just their sense of oh and one other thing i wanted to share with you guys it was interesting

205
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,319
noticing like the sounds the ambient sounds i don't know there was

206
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:57,359
uh you know maybe a truck driving and the sounds just felt or or there was a co

207
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:02,800
yeah there was a a motorbike racing by and and my heart opened up to

208
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:09,200
oh wow somebody's having the thrill of being on a motorbike it was not like oh somebody's making noise being on a motor

209
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:14,640
was like oh somebody's going to get through so just it was a very different way of of

210
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:21,839
listening and hearing he says thank you nikki the sangha is a trained building

211
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:28,079
community of truth and trust and now making music together a song of communal love

212
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:33,119
and abraham please

213
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:40,079
uh okay thanks um as you know some of you people know i'm very very deaf and my hearing aids

214
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:46,560
lately screwed up and i have to bring my hearing aids into my audio center to get them fixed up so i'm not sure i even

215
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:51,839
heard it i was just trying to be economist um but it seemed like you were talking

216
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:57,599
about us opening up and so i just opened up and

217
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:04,480
what was there was just my tremendous love of music when i was a child how much i loved playing music

218
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:09,920
and that i i don't do that anymore and i don't sing and uh

219
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:16,720
then i i thought well this is a real could be a real pity trip and i don't want to do that and i

220
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:22,240
remembered my high school music teacher who inspired me to music and

221
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:28,319
how much we all loved him he was like a hero in our town and then later i heard that he was very

222
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:35,280
disappointed that he didn't get the position that he was supposed to get or wanted to get as a conductor and

223
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:41,760
maybe even got into some alcohol and so i started sending him loving-kindness and i thought you would

224
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:47,200
say something about be open for something that you don't expect or has never been there

225
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:53,200
and i've never sent him any loving kindness and it was just beautiful for me to

226
00:45:53,200 --> 00:46:00,599
to love him for what he gave me thanks thanks folks

227
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:06,640

254
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:26,160
hi there uh very quickly it was so funny that you brought this topic up tonight because i

255
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:32,000
was talking to somebody else about it this morning and what i was saying i didn't involve

256
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:40,160
the whole go into the whole story but ever since i've started working with you all my listening skills have increased

257
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:47,359
exponentially i can't tell you how much i'm it's coming to me from the universe and

258
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:53,280
what i'm hearing internally it's changed a lot of my behaviors it's so increasing

259
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:58,960
um and that's that's not honest truth and i was talking to

260
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:05,839
somebody else today you know what a difference that is doing

261
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:12,280
and then you bring it bring it up tonight i thought boy this is really weird

262
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:21,520
that's beautiful thank you claire the sound is coming and going in your sound a little tonight but what i heard

263
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:27,200
you say is that ever since you've started to to practice with the sangha and training in this way that there's a

264
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:32,559
sense of uh you're you're here you're you're um you're you're listening

265
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:38,880
and and also some kind of sense of intuition like listening to messages from the universe and from within

266
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:45,280
yeah i'm sorry i use earbuds when you're speaking because i can't cause i can hear better right but it blocks my

267
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:50,319
speaking i always forget to take them out it's all good

268
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:57,839
heard you loud and clear yeah there's something and now that you bring that up and and i'll say this and before closing

269
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:05,599
um i'll share with you that for me also there's this this listening this listening for

270
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:11,359
me also with my meditation and my path i feel like i i'm more much more intuitive

271
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:18,640
i listen much more about both with people and with sense of you know intuition it just it's

272
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:25,040
again i don't want to make it sound woo-woo but there's so much to this world it's just listening when we really

273
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:31,920
listen there's so much that we can pick up in conversations with others with just what what is what is offered so

274
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:37,359
yeah listening we can listen with our hearts thank you claire thanks for bringing that in

275
