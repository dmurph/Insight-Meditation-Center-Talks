1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:08,000
start over again with the welcome you all and and uh to tell you that I'm happy to

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,120
be back here at doing this uh morning teaching and meditating with you all all

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:20,000
of you and uh the theme I'd like

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,920
to uh or the reference point I'd like to offer for this meditation is one of the

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:33,680
probably one of the most fundamental if the fundamental Buddhist principle which is

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,520
nonharming and to uh to live with

7
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:47,239
nonharming to um uh but in terms of meditation to

8
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:56,719
meditate in a way that is non-harming that meditation itself can be seen as the continual Act of

9
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:03,440
non-harming and in meditation the chances of harming others uh are small

10
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:12,479
as we meditate maybe we neglect people sometimes and that's can be harmful but uh the primary person that

11
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:19,560
we're being harmless towards in meditation is ourselves and part of meditation then is

12
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,280
a not only continual Act of non-harming but the deepening

13
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,320
sensitivity to what non-harming is for ourselves

14
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:37,000
so that uh we're orienting ourselves to see and understand all the ways subtle

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,920
and not so subtle that we are self Haring in

16
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:49,159
meditation and to shift that to a way of meditating

17
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:55,439
that is non-harming and uh and many meditators

18
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,000
don't think of their meditation from in this with this reference point but in the the course of deepening and

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,800
deepening their meditation uh uh either uh consciously or not so consciously uh the idea of

20
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,599
living with nonharming becomes more and more a theme and so in meditation it can be

21
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:21,120
something as simple as um being angry with ourselves because we're not getting

22
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,120
concentrated in being critical of ourselves because of what we're thinking or that we're

23
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,879
distracting it can be a striving to uh uh to want to attain some great

24
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:39,480
attainment and then very striving there's a tension a stress level that uh

25
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:46,760
you can feel that it's kind of causing stress causing harm to ourselves pain

26
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:54,480
suffering and so uh to be very attentive that the way that we come back

27
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:01,560
from the Mind wondering off that we don't jerk the Mind back as it's you know like a like a violent tug or

28
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,280
something but we do so in a non-harming way we we gently bring the Mind back we

29
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:13,879
invite the Mind back we settle the Mind back or we invite the breath back to the

30
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:21,080
breathing back to the Mind back to attention so that in some way it is um

31
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:28,560
uh you know we're not caused adding stress by the way in which we meditate the um you know sometimes we

32
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:35,799
there's physical disc comfort and to tough it out to somehow um think stoically that I have

33
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:43,560
to kind of just bear the pain is a is a kind of self harm sometimes there's pain that we feel

34
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,920
inspired in a very wise way to use the pain to develop our

35
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,360
meditation to develop ourselves to grow in our capacity for equinity and self-

36
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:02,720
understanding and then it may then it uh it might not be a form of self har to sit with a pain uh we're not injuring

37
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:09,720
ourselves with it but we we are learning and growing and in a in a very

38
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:17,519
beneficial way that serves us in many places in our lives so so for this meditation to uh

39
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:24,639
reflect as you do it that how you meditate that it's a nonharming way and

40
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:31,000
maybe even better it's the opposite it's uh of harm it's um you know it's

41
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:39,639
beneficial it's uh conducive to peace to to conducive to the kind of deep calm or

42
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:46,800
a kind of uh delightful sense that um confidence in oneself that no matter how

43
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,759
the meditation goes that uh we're not going to respond in a way that adds stress to our

44
00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:00,639
system so to um to

45
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,159
gently lower your gaze or close your

46
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:18,400
eyes and to readjust your posture a

47
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:35,280
bit and gently taking some long slow deep breaths not too long not too deep

48
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,000
comfortably

49
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,439
so and relaxing on the exhale

50
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:07,120
and letting your breathing return to

51
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,759
normal and then in a global simple

52
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,960
way become aware of how you are sitting

53
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,840
here how you are

54
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,400
meditating is it a peaceful

55
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:41,319
stance a peaceful way of how you are or could you carry with you stress

56
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,199
tensions maybe even hostilities from the day from the week

57
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,639
from a

58
00:06:53,520 --> 00:07:01,199
lifetime and if there is do not be in conflict with that not

59
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:09,440
to add stress to it but let the awareness that knows

60
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,639
it be a nonharming awareness that has

61
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:19,960
space to know to

62
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:30,560
feel in which the knowing of it all

63
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,280
awareness of it all is a nonharming

64
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:43,400
awareness an attitude of being

65
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,639
present in a simple peaceful

66
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:59,159
way that also disconnects in any intentional or active

67
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:07,680
way which you're participating in what is stressful or

68
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
harmful

and as we come to the end of this sitting one way

100
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:23,520
[Music] to bring the benefits of meditation into

101
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:29,000
our life is to appreciate

102
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:36,000
any degree of Peace nonharming

103
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,039
non-conflict in which we

104
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:49,600
meditate the peace and meditation can be very big can be contrasted with the lack

105
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:57,200
of it that many people live with in their lives and then one of the gifts we can

106
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:03,039
bring the world is to become

107
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:14,720
someone who other others feel safe with giving the gift of

108
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:21,279
safety making ourselves safe for all beings

109
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:37,159
so that our capacity to live without harm to

110
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,399
ourselves begins to be extended bit by

111
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:48,559
bit to learning how to live without harming anyone

112
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:57,720
else nonharming way of life which gives others the gift of

113
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:05,080
safety may all beings be

114
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:11,600
safe may all beings be

115
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:21,799
peaceful may all beings have the safety where there's room to be

116
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:30,240
happy may all beings feel the safy

117
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:38,519
that allows them to connect more deeply to the people around

118
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:46,760
them may all beings be safe from harm and violence

119
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:52,440
and poverty so they can grow into their full

120
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:57,000
potential as a human being

121
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:04,559
and may we contribute to a peaceful world may all

122
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,398
beings be

123
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:20,258
[Music]

124
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:30,159
happy thank you

125
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,158
e e

126
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:48,720
so hello everyone and welcome to this Monday morning uh meditation and

127
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:55,960
teaching and I'm very happy to be back it's been a while and happy that you've had some

128
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:02,679
wonderful teachers coming to be here while I was gone and

129
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:09,399
um so I want to turn my attention from at least next couple of weeks to what

130
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:14,919
some people consider to be the foundation of

131
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:21,200
Buddhism and that is um in English we would probably say it's

132
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:28,279
ethics and uh virtue living a

133
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:37,240
living a um virtuous life and uh if we think of Buddhism as a

134
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:42,360
pyramid then uh ver virtue and ethics

135
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:49,159
would be the foundation upon which the pyramid is built like the bottom layer of it big

136
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:55,000
wide strong base uh upon which the the

137
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:02,320
the higher points of the pyramid would go up to a point and the second layer would be um

138
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:09,519
meditation or suade or cultivating ourselves in a in a Wholesome Way and

139
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:16,279
the third would be wisdom the top of the pyramid so that wisdom is supported by

140
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:22,519
meditation uh spiritual practice and that spiritual practice is supported by

141
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:28,279
ethics and ethics has to do with a lot to do with how we live our lives uh in

142
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:35,720
relationship to other people it can be in relationship to ourselves as well

143
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:40,960
um uh the um um but the interpersonal

144
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,320
world we live in is a huge part of a human life some people as adults forget

145
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:51,600
this because they've somehow um become separated from others

146
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:59,720
somehow become alienated sometimes become isolated but uh uh uh a healthy way of

147
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:07,480
of being a human being is to be brought brought up by adults who care for them who feed them and clean them as babies

148
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:13,159
who watch over them protect them as they grow up the Deep interpersonal world

149
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:19,000
that human beings are dependent on continues into adulthood if we have uh

150
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:26,240
children or or there's children in our immediate Community then uh part of what

151
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,440
uh potential for rle for the adults is to care for them and help them grow up

152
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:38,600
in ways that are safe and and um and uh allow them to grow into their full

153
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:45,799
potential the interpersonal world of human beings is huge and so when we when ethics is at

154
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:54,360
the foundation of Buddhist practice it is um beginning to care for the interpersonal World in a in a way that

155
00:31:54,360 --> 00:32:00,639
then supports uh uh our own inner life so that we're in a good place to

156
00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:07,519
meditate and to cultivate wisdom the um one of my favorite uh

157
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:12,880
definitions but this is all kind of uh circular because one of my favorite

158
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,480
definitions of wisdom in Buddhism is from the buddhis is that a wise person

159
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:24,080
who's someone who uh avoids harming self

160
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:31,120
harming others harming self and others or ing the whole world rather a wise

161
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:37,120
person considers or focuses on benefiting self benefiting others

162
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,760
benefiting self and others and benefiting the whole world so the fact

163
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:48,639
that this is what this kind of defines or describes a wise person is their care

164
00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:54,039
for how to live in the world with self and others that avoid harming

165
00:32:54,039 --> 00:33:00,440
oneself and instead brings the opposite the benefits others and concerned with

166
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:06,480
the welfare of the world and so ethics is a foundation for

167
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:13,480
samadi samadi for wisdom wisdom itself then uh supports further deepening and

168
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:19,440
uh understanding of the value of ethics of virtue of of

169
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:27,000
non-harming so it turns out that in the Buddhist teachings probably the fundamental principle that uh lays at

170
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,679
the heart of it all is the idea of non-harming the highest reaches of

171
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:37,720
Buddhist teachings in the is that is often held in

172
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:43,799
the to be in the four noble truths and those have to do with suffering and the

173
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:49,960
end of suffering and the end that we're ending is the th those ways which we are

174
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:56,080
responsible for our own suffering the ways that we contribute to it so that

175
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:02,440
it's not saying that all suffering is caused uh by oneself but where we have

176
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:08,200
the most uh agency the most capacity to make a difference is to make a

177
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:15,398
difference so that we don't contribute to our own suffering we don't add to it we don't how we create it and it turns

178
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:22,118
out that uh over time with deep kind of mindfulness we understand that how

179
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:27,280
phenomenally fundamental and pervasive uh the ways in which clinging

180
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:33,679
and attemp attachment of all kinds causes self harm or to say it in the ter

181
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:39,560
terminology of the formable truths causes suffering so and ethics is also in

182
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:45,800
Buddhism the fundamental ethical principle is non-harming so there's a way of understanding that non-harming

183
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:51,878
runs through the whole course of uh of Buddhist teachings the Buddhist training

184
00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:57,040
the practice of it and that is a reference point constantly for for what

185
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:03,920
we're doing and um and it might be easier to understand the value of not harming

186
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:11,119
oneself and um and uh the idea of not harming others is a more challenging uh

187
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:16,960
idea when there's issues of safety involved and protection when there's

188
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:23,040
issues of Justice involved that uh we feel like we're being are what's fair or

189
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:28,680
right for us is being threatened but uh but

190
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:33,960
uh one of I like to believe that one of the minimum kind of engagements that

191
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:39,320
Buddhists have in an ethical World ethical life is using non-harming as a

192
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:44,640
reference point to understand themselves and to understand how we can live with

193
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:50,560
others and what works uh for the welfare and benefit for all beings both in the

194
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:56,800
short term but also in the long term sometimes violence can can cause

195
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:03,880
can bring results in the short term but in the long term causes tremendous amount of harm that takes maybe takes

196
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:09,119
generations to to uh to

197
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:15,079
rectify and um so uh in the last uh two

198
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:21,240
weeks that I was teaching here I taught about uh these 10 basic human needs um

199
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:28,599
meaning and purpose agency and autonomy identity and dignity community and

200
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:34,960
kinship and healing and Reconciliation all F all 10 of those

201
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:42,160
could be it's a way of understanding them that the heart of all of them is the principle the way of living that

202
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:47,800
involves nonharming Aima and that

203
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:55,280
uh that this is and and that uh the purpose and meaning for for the for the

204
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:03,760
Buddha at the heart of the Buddhist teachings is uh a life of non-harming to have uh to have a healthy

205
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:10,560
sense of agency a healthy sense of autonomy is a very soil from which a

206
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:16,640
powerful confident non-harming lifestyle life way of life can arise it's a people

207
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:22,880
often whose agency and autonomy and freedom is curtailed frustrated that uh

208
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:28,319
feel like they have to harm in order to get what they need and what they

209
00:37:28,319 --> 00:37:34,640
what they want and so you can analyze all all all 10 of these from the point of view of

210
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,839
that non-harming lies for Buddhism lies at the heart of it whether you agree

211
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:46,359
with to this is another thing but it's the um

212
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:51,920
um the um uh it's the reference point that I

213
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:58,560
think really makes Buddhist practice come alive a reference point that really guides Buddhist practice this or

214
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:04,760
supports mindfulness really kind of helps us to question ourselves and see ourselves in a deeper and deeper

215
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:09,960
way uh we don't have to necessarily agree with the principle of non-harming

216
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:15,480
to use it as a powerful reference point to help us clarify and really understand

217
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:22,040
what does make us operate what does motivate us what do we believe and then we can look at it more

218
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:28,319
deeply um the um uh I think that uh to to be

219
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:34,599
respectful of all beings there's a time also to be respectful that uh how

220
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:40,599
intense the motivation is for self- protection in people protecting themselves protecting their family

221
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:46,880
protecting your children that um that that that is what prompts people to be

222
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,200
violent to protect them themselves and what a what a fundamental human need it

223
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:57,440
is to protect one's family and so it isn't the the call for nonviolence

224
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,960
vience a call for non-harming needs to respect the Deep Instinct we have that

225
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:08,520
um is not necessarily greed hatred and delusion that leads to acts of violence

226
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:16,560
but occasionally involves something something very deep and fundamentally human not to justify it but to respect

227
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:23,800
how people are and only through deep respect can we hope to be able to convey

228
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:29,480
to others the value of a him the value of

229
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:37,040
non-harming and even if we don't believe in it in all circumstances it is the fundamental

230
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:42,359
principle for how we relate to ourselves if what we want to do is to become free

231
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:47,480
the spiritual Liberation The Liberation of heart that Buddhism uh Champions that

232
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:55,280
points to the possibility of the profound peace that's possible um is

233
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:02,359
inseparable from a deep deep Affinity a deep Association a deep

234
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:08,119
realization of the value the beauty the wonderfulness the wholesomeness of

235
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:13,599
living a wise non-harming life a

236
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:20,000
wise life that understands deeply how to engage in the world um in a way that

237
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,760
supports self and others and can do so so that we're safe

238
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,240
for all beings one of my favorite another one of my favorite quotes from the

239
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:38,000
Buddha is his instruction to make yourself safe for all beings what a

240
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,440
great thing to do so that no one has to be afraid of us and what does that take

241
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:51,720
what how do we have to grow how do we have to develop ourselves how do we how do we become strong how do we become

242
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:57,520
skilled in finding our way through this complicated world so that we can can

243
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:04,640
provide a sense of safety for all beings that we encounter it's not an easy task

244
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:10,359
um but it's a worthwhile one maybe it's a lifetime task that we're working

245
00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:16,720
towards I I think it's a noble task to become safe safe for all

246
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:22,560
beings and how that translates

247
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:27,760
to others to society around us um maybe

248
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,880
that's secondary to how we discover this for

249
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:40,760
ourselves and meditation and mindfulness is a path to understand the

250
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:47,000
value um not too to understand but to really see to discover clearly for

251
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:55,760
oneself to verify for oneself that uh that a nonharming approach to

252
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:00,880
living a non-harming way of living with our in the world with our body with our

253
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:06,680
speech with our even our thoughts brings tremendous benefit tremendous goodness

254
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:13,280
to one who practices it and to know that so thoroughly for oneself that it's not

255
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:20,319
a no one has to convince you no one has to give you a philosophy or ethical

256
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:26,559
guidance to understand the value of non-harming it's so obvious from what

257
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:33,520
has developed in your own heart through this practice that we do and that

258
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:41,000
to to support this process if you're interested um to use that the concept of

259
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,400
non-harming not as an admonition not as something that you should do but rather

260
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,640
as a reference point to help you reflect deeply what is happening here what in

261
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:58,240
what way are we harming where is the non-harming how what is the wise thing

262
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:03,359
to do here in reference to this phenomenal tool

263
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:08,559
phenomenal um um a teacher that we can

264
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:15,079
carry with us the teacher of non-harming so this week uh I'm going to

265
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:22,160
talk about some of these um fundamental principles of uh Buddhist ethics and

266
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:27,880
this is the one of them the most important one today and then uh

267
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:34,440
and that will create the foundation and for next week to talk about the

268
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:41,920
precepts so um thank you and I'm very happy to be back
