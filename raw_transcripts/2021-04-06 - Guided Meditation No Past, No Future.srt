00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:11,120
hello everyone and welcome and welcome to this meditation

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,920
session and um

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:26,000
one of the ways of maybe getting a little more feeling for

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,559
the potential of meditation is to have a very clear

5
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,640
bracketing putting aside of the past and the future

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,840
when you meditate now the past and the future have their

7
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:55,440
certainly have their importance in human life and in fact it's a bit of a problem if you

8
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:03,600
don't remember anything of your past in the future but there's also something very valuable

9
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,119
about putting it aside so that you can have a very

10
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:17,920
different experience of yourself or experience of life without that reference of the past and

11
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,880
the future that to understand to really experience

12
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:35,040
something qualitatively valuable about the present

13
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,360
and so we're not forgetting about the past but we're putting it aside for the duration of a

14
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,560
meditation session it will come back thoughts will come about the past and

15
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,680
the future but in mindfulness meditation we're not interested in those thoughts

16
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,880
but we are interested in recognizing them as present moment phenomena

17
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:08,399
here is a mind that's thinking about the past here's a mind concerned with the future

18
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,560
here it's like this and for this it's for this it's kind of

19
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,160
like for the duration of the meditation you're forgiven

20
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,560
about whatever happened in the past whatever you did in the past you don't have to be blamed for anything

21
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,239
when you're meditating it's kind of a time-out zone a neutral zone

22
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:40,319
and it's like in the old days people would go into the church for sanctuary and

23
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,760
the legal authorities couldn't go and pull a personality was in the

24
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:52,160
sanctuary of a church so you are in the sanctuary of your meditation

25
00:02:52,160 --> 00:03:00,720
and you're safe here now from the past everything is forgiven for now

26
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,760
you don't have to do it after the meditation and you don't have to think about the future

27
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:16,319
for a time being meditation you're not responsible for the future and what will happen and don't need to plan

28
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:24,959
so that just here just this experience it's kind of like

29
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:35,040
here is a door and you walk through that door to a deeper intimacy deeper connection

30
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:43,280
to the lived experience of the moment so take so entering into this door

31
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:54,079
through your body and entering into a meditation posture

32
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:01,840
and part of the value of being intentional with the meditation posture

33
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:14,400
it's beginning this process of entering into the present more fully

34
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:29,840
and doing so through your body

35
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:40,400
and also stepping through this door of the present moment into the present

36
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:49,759
stepping out of the past and stepping out of the future to just here to take a few long slow

37
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:57,600
deep breaths

38
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,360
breathing in deeply

39
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,639
and relaxing the body as you exhale long

40
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,840
exhale

41
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:26,160
and if you take a long exhale a long ride into the present

42
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,600
let there be a momentary pause at the end of the exhale

43
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,400
a fuller acknowledgement here

44
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:53,840
maybe a silent acknowledgement feeling here

45
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,840
letting your breathing return to normal

46
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:16,639
and because the body is such a wonderful vehicle for sliding into now

47
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,840
as you exhale

48
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,120
relax your belly

49
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:48,000
and sometimes if you relax the belly all kinds of other things throughout the body will relax as well

50
00:06:48,000 --> 00:07:03,759
as you exhale relaxing the shoulders

51
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:17,840
and softening the face

52
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,960
and perhaps also calming the mind

53
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,280
cooling the thinking activity

54
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:45,440
quieting your thoughts

55
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,560
and as part of present moment experience

56
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,759
there is awareness of the present

57
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,319
awareness is always a present moment event

58
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:13,840
if you are aware the awareness is occurring here and now

59
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:36,560
and for these minutes you are allowed you have permission to put aside the

60
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:44,320
past and the future enter and to enter into the door

61
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:54,320
through the door of the present moment

62
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,160
not to attain anything or get anything or make anything happen

63
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,839
but to abide

64
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,880
aware mindful

65
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,839
of your experience as you hear

66
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,600
and letting the comings and goings of breathing

67
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,399
support you to be here as breathing is also a present moment

68
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,040
phenomenon

69
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:51,839
riding the breath riding the sensations of the body breathing

70
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:05,839
like riding on the present moment

71
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,839
so

72
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,839
so

73
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,880
putting aside the past putting aside the future

74
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:56,480
for now for now so you can be here

75
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:04,320
whatever the now is for you now it'll never be exactly this way

76
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:12,799
again it's worthwhile resting

77
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:18,640
awareness grounding awareness

78
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:24,799
in this unique lived experience of now

79
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:31,760
letting the thinking mind take a break

80
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:40,320
just aware just

81
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,840
mindful

82
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:21,760
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

83
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:30,399
from time to time when you consider other people or

84
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:35,600
even more so when you're together with them

85
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,960
it's useful to put aside the past

86
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,480
and put aside thoughts of the future

87
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:56,000
so that you can really see the person in the present

88
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:03,840
certainly there's a time and place for the past and the future to be considered

89
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:11,440
but there's also a time and place to put those aside

90
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,960
and to meet someone in the fullness of how they are in the

91
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:24,159
present with whatever fullness you are

92
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:30,000
in the present

93
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,880
to connect to the humanity of another person

94
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:40,799
as they are in the present moment with a beating heart

95
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:49,278
breathing lungs with blood coursing through their body

96
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:58,320
with their vulnerability and their strength

97
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,200
with their good qualities and not so good qualities

98
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:13,840
to just to be there feel and sense and be with a person

99
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,559
and having that capacity can be a vehicle or a means

100
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:31,840
for greater respect for the other her greater care and friendliness

101
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:40,559
a greater good will well-wishing

102
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:49,919
greater empathy maybe even a sense of shared humanity

103
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,840
sharing in the difficulties and the joys of this life

104
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:02,559
from time to time to put aside the past and the future

105
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:14,080
so that we may have greater goodwill and compassion and love

106
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:23,840
kindness for the people we're with in the simplicity of the moment

107
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:29,360
and may it be that this meditation practice we do

108
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:35,039
supports us to be present with others

109
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:42,559
in a fuller deeper richer way

110
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,559
and that we bring a heart

111
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:55,279
that is inspired by the welfare and happiness of others

112
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:05,360
may we live contributing to the happiness the safety

113
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:11,519
the peacefulness and the freedom that others can have

114
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:18,880
may this practice spread from us the benefits of this

115
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:26,000
practice spread from us for the welfare and happiness of all beings everywhere

116
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:33,840
may all beings be happy

117
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,840
so

118
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,720
you
