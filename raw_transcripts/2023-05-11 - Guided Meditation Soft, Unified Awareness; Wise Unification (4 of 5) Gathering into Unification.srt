and releases into the Opera

82
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:30,380

special good morning to those of you who arrived a touch late

124
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:40,860
we are in day four of a five day series on factors of mind

125
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:47,279
that supports devotee wisdom concentration

126
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:52,980
in meditation practice and that support us in daily life

127
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:58,380
we started with the fundamentals of mindfulness and practice Intelligence on

128
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:06,320
Monday and then moved into a series of mental factors known as

129
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,940
the five yonic factors there are five factors that support this

130
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:17,279
greater stability and refinement deepening of meditation

131
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:23,100
so we covered vitaka and vichara connecting and sustaining

132
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:28,440
then the emergent factors of joy

133
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:34,740
and happiness or contentment and today we cover the fifth of those five factors

134
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:39,860
quality known as a kagata

135
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:43,860
eka g-g-a-t-a-a-t-a

136
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,460
and that translates as single pointed concentration

137
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:56,340
unification and those are some of the translations I'll go into a few more of them in a few

138
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:01,380
minutes first I want to start with a story

139
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:07,559
near the end of his life the Buddha was visited by an emissary of a very bad

140
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:13,860
King it was just not a nice person committed patricide to take the throne

141
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:20,580
and this king king had seen the Buddha before but it was

142
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:28,500
maybe a little shy to be in the presence of the Buddha again given all of his misdeeds so he sent an emissary a

143
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:36,299
minister along to ask the Buddha a question and his um his question was predicated

144
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:42,960
based on the notion the truism that Buddhas Never Lie

145
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:50,820
so the king thought to take advantage of this and sends this Minister along to ask about the king's chances of

146
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:58,440
conquering and neighboring people the vajis and he's asked this question directly

147
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:07,019
and the Buddha doesn't actually address this emissary head-on that instead turns to his dear

148
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:13,679
cousin in attendant Ananda and asks him a series of questions that make

149
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:22,020
it known that as long as the vatis these neighboring people Gather in peace disperse in peace and

150
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:27,419
conduct themselves with Harmony and respect they will stay Unified

151
00:34:27,419 --> 00:34:34,440
and unconquered so this is timeless societal advice that

152
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:43,320
happens to be timely for many of us right now also a really good analogy for our minds

153
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:49,560
If We Gather the constituents of our minds in Harmony and respect

154
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:58,280
stability emerges our hearts and Minds can unify

155
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:05,040
the polybird for Unity is used to refer to both group deliberation

156
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:12,060
and unification around a topic and to unifying in meditation then it's

157
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:17,940
called a kagata in meditation this process of

158
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:23,940
unification is unifying streams of thought impulses and attention in a

159
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:30,420
congruent Direction just like little rivulets gather and flow into streams

160
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:38,099
and those streams gather and flow into rivers and then those River Rivers eventually gather together and flow into

161
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:43,440
Great Mighty Rivers like that

162
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,780
another example is if you picture a pile of iron filings just kind of all in many

163
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:55,859
directions and you pass a magnet over them they all unify and move in the same

164
00:35:55,859 --> 00:36:00,900
direction it's like that

165
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:07,260
congruent alignment so

166
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:14,660
invite you to feel in your body feel into some of the range of translations

167
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:26,880
unification being collected

168
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:34,160
calm one pointedness

169
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:39,920
Tranquility or Serenity of mind

170
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:47,059
so that's one range I'll talk about that for a little while and then bring in another

171
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:54,000
when this quality is present all of the other factors of Mind we've

172
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,540
talked about over this past week are in synchrony congruent aligned and

173
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:06,119
moving in the same direction there's momentum but it's a quiet

174
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:11,059
still momentum not Gathering

175
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:18,119
magnetism if you will as that synchrony tranquility

176
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:26,099
Serenity grows the experience of our hearts Minds bodies becomes more quiet

177
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:33,300
subtler there are several stages to this each a

178
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:40,440
marked shift into a deep and stable State of Consciousness known as Janna

179
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:47,220
and Janna 's are usually almost always only available in deep

180
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:52,338
Retreat long retreat for most people

181
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:57,540
that's okay the rest of the time the Mind naturally produces thought most of

182
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:03,960
the time thinking is its natural function that's not an enemy much wisdom can be gathered

183
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:09,900
from this broad receptive mindful awareness and practice

184
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:15,839
intelligence and then sometimes these stages take hold

185
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:21,960
and while we're not going to experience them in a half hour sit or a single YouTube

186
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:27,300
video I'm going to speak them as similes that

187
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:33,960
the Buddha offered that can evoke a sense or a taste of how each stage of

188
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:40,820
unification in this progression unfolds and there are four that I'll talk about

189
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:46,680
as I speak these similes the invitation is to feel them in your body

190
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:54,300
and perhaps visualize them and if you can't visualize or feel into your body imagining that you can visualize

191
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:59,599
or feel into it's just fine that works too

192
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:08,000
so settle back for a moment maybe take a breath or a sip of tea

193
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:17,000
and then open your receptive awareness your intuition

194
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:24,300
so in connecting sustaining

195
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:31,380
Joy and easeful contentment happiness are all present

196
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:37,260
and unified it can feel like needing moisture into

197
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:42,900
dough so that the moisture pervades evenly

198
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:46,039
all throughout

199
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:56,839
feeling that often it can feel like ripples are weird

200
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,460
the breath massaging every part of the body the attention

201
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:05,900
massaging every part

202
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:13,380
the Buddha described this process as being like water added to Bath powder

203
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:22,460
kneaded together skillfully to create a single soft ball of soap

204
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:31,820
moisture is pleasurable awareness throughout the whole body and mind

205
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,140
testing three energetic experience

206
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:50,300
none in the second similarly the mental movements of connecting

207
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:57,560
sustaining attention become unnecessary and drop away

208
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:06,380
only joy happy contentment remain Unified

209
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:13,619
the body and mind an experience like a clear Mountain Lake

210
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:19,320
no rain or streams feeding it replenished only by a cool internal

211
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:26,060
spring an internal Wellspring of well-being

212
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:43,500
and even that in the next stage that energetic quality softens

213
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:49,200
and quiet and each individual person's body and

214
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:55,440
mind are submerged and unified with calm

215
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:01,380
content happiness a calm content pleasure

216
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:08,579
is like water touching lotuses of many many different colors that are completely submerged

217
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:14,480
in the cool clear water from tip to root

218
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,880
immersed no part left out

219
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:36,780
then everything except for calms I mean unified Equanimity drops away

220
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:43,079
like after emerging from a cool soothing bath and being wrapped from head to toe

221
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:50,599
in a soft bright white cloth or fluffy towel

222
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:59,599
enveloped like stepping out of that cool Shady Spring

223
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:10,200
so imagining feeling in your body for any sense of resonance or any intuitive

224
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:17,579
glimpse these similes provided the process of serenity

225
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:23,940
unification is a progressive Letting Go a letting go of what's more obvious or

226
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:30,019
coarse into what's calmer and more peaceful

227
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:37,800
stage has its own value and each must be released in order to

228
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:43,560
make space for a more calm and peaceful place

229
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:50,780
and perhaps this is why in kagata usually translated as unification

230
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:56,280
or collected calm it also has the meaning of a capacity to make

231
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:01,619
distinctions discernment is developed in this process

232
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:08,579
of learning to make distinctions between the different mental factors which we've been learning all week and also in the

233
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:15,900
process of letting go of the more energetic and exciting in favor of the Tranquil and the

234
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:21,079
peaceful this helps to mature a practice

235
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:26,460
and happily that maturity these lessons

236
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:33,839
don't require deep Retreat and uncommon stance of mind to start to learn them and embody them

237
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:39,780
tastes of each of these factors including unification begin to train our capacity

238
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:45,420
for letting go and experiencing how these different mental factors can

239
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:52,578
deepen broaden and add beautiful qualities to our meditation

240
00:44:55,140 --> 00:45:03,839
so thank you thank you for your attention today tomorrow the topic is how wisdom can

241
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:09,540
support the development of these factors and how the development of these factors

242
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:16,440
supports the growth and wisdom I love that the similes and comments

243
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:24,720
coming in and encourage you to share whatever observations or

244
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:31,200
glimpses you had with each other and with me and if you have any questions based on

245
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:37,560
the four talks I've given so far please drop them in the chat I can't promise I'll get to all of them

246
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:43,380
but I will certainly try to read them in so thank you Sangha for your kind

247
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:48,780
attention and your homework assignment if you wish to

248
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:55,500
take it until tomorrow is to notice what brings more peace

249
00:45:55,500 --> 00:46:02,660
and unification to your heart and mind thank you
