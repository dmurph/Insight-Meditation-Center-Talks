00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,859
good morning everybody my name is Nancy yamahiro

2
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:14,400
I was your check-in person today I'm also a board member here at IMC

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,560
I'm warm welcome to all of you thank you for your practice

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,500
thank you for being here and a warm welcome to Our Guest today

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,539
um for those of you that don't know um

6
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:37,800
they're all from a group called grip an acronym for guiding rage into power

7
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:44,160
which is an intensive year-long trauma healing and accountability program

8
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:52,980
serving about 500 incarcerated people each year in California state prisons many folks serving life

9
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:58,320
sentences for serious or violent crimes

10
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,960
it is a model for restorative justice in the state and I would argue around

11
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:10,320
the country in the last 10 years more than 1200

12
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:19,020
students have graduated from grip of those 525 or 528 sorry have been

13
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:25,159
released and come home to their communities there were

14
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:32,340
recidivism rate is less than one percent in other words a success rate of 99

15
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:39,079
percent I'd like to introduce Kim gross Moore

16
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:44,280
who is a student of IMC and the Sati

17
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,939
Center chaplaincy Program she subsequently trained as a group

18
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:57,020
facilitator and then became the executive director in 2019.

19
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:03,899
with the support of IMC she led the expansion of grip to the correctional

20
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:09,420
training facility in Soledad where she continues to

21
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:17,040
facilitate today a strong believer in the principle the first Revolution is internal

22
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,140
she considers meditation and the Dharma as the foundation of her work for

23
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:28,260
justice in the community and I'll turn it over to Kim and let her

24
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,200
introduce our other guests and welcome

25
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:42,239
it's okay to take off my mask is that right to speak that we can okay thank you

26
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,459
thank you Nancy for the introduction and good morning

27
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:55,800
I'm going to introduce my colleagues briefly and then say a few words so I'm so happy to be here uh with a team of

28
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,580
folks from grip my actually my boss

29
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:08,700
PJ BluRay I is on the board of directors of grip and he's here with us today he's

30
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:15,140
been here before Bernard Moss is a senior facilitator with grip on our staff

31
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:20,220
and uh chewy Cortes is a facilitator as

32
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,980
well facilitated for several years inside Avenal State Prison and now lives in San Francisco

33
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:31,379
and they'll have a chance to share more of their stories in a minute but I'm

34
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:36,659
just so happy to be back here I as I was driving up this morning my

35
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:42,239
so my daughter just started high school and last night was the homecoming dance

36
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,580
and all the anticipation and flurry and nervous excitement of that as I was

37
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:55,379
driving up her I realized oh this is feels like a homecoming for me to be here it's uh it's been

38
00:03:55,379 --> 00:04:01,560
about four three at least three maybe four years since grip was here at IMC

39
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:08,340
and we really do feel like this is a home for us and so I first just really

40
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,860
want to thank you all and express the gratitude that is in my heart and that

41
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:20,699
we feel when we come here because Gil and the IMC community so many of you who

42
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:27,419
have come up to visit grip at San Quentin or down at Soledad or elsewhere or have just been supporters over the

43
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:33,240
years is really just wonderful and I don't think grip would be where it is today

44
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:40,380
without the support of this community so much gratitude and thank you

45
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:47,940
and I feel that sort of nervous energy and excitement of homecoming as well so just being here and uh when I I actually

46
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:54,060
first met grip learned about grip when Jacques verdant the founder brought some

47
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:59,960
folks to sit up here and I was sitting there and that was my first introduction

48
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:05,940
to grip and it was a transformative experience for me and I was in the

49
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:12,780
chaplaincy training program and got the chance to go up and visit the program in San Quentin and then

50
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,880
train as a facilitator and then help to bring grip into CTF Soledad where I

51
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,100
still facilitate so as as Nancy said she said everything

52
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:32,039
that I was going to say about what we are and the stats if you're interested in the data of impact that we we have

53
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:37,680
been quite successful in supporting folks inside the state prisons to turn

54
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,620
their lives around and and then become peace makers in the community and we're going to share some stories today that's

55
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:49,620
what we do best is share stories that's the real impact that we have so I'm going to turn it over in a minute to my

56
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:57,000
colleagues really to take it from here and then we're hoping that we'll have a little bit of time after after some

57
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,400
story sharing to actually share an activity that we do inside the prisons

58
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,919
that builds a sense of common humanity and empathy it's called struggles in a

59
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:14,160
hat and so we we might ask for a few volunteers to participate with us to do

60
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,940
a little activity so I think maybe I'll just one other thing I'll say before inviting my

61
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:27,060
colleagues to speak is that our curriculum is grounded in a course book

62
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:34,440
that Jacques Verdan the founder wrote and it's called leaving prison before you get out

63
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:40,199
I think that's really kind of the common cause we have here with IMC that there's

64
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:46,319
an understanding that we're on a common Journey we're on a we're engaged in a

65
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:52,500
common practice of freeing ourselves from whatever that prison is between our

66
00:06:52,500 --> 00:07:00,240
ears right and whether you're incarcerated or whether you're in you know free

67
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,340
ostensibly geographically and able to come to a place like IMC there is still

68
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:11,819
the kind of practice that we all are doing to learn how to free ourselves

69
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:18,000
from suffering and be able to be of service be able to open our hearts and

70
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,160
uh and experience true compassion and love and connection in the world

71
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:30,020
so much of what I do as a facilitator in grip is really about that shared Journey

72
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:36,680
my own practice my own healing work that I do and accountability work that I do

73
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:42,840
in tribe in community inside the prison with others who are

74
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:50,639
engaged in that same practice so we consider it very much a shared and common Journey we

75
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,460
it it is a program that's mindfulness based we bring tools and practices into

76
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:01,680
the prisons but really what I hope today will be about is an

77
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,139
understanding and an experience of how much of the Dharma is coming out from

78
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:13,500
the prisons as well the wisdom and the experience and the the uh the living

79
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:19,800
examples of transformation that we can learn from folks that have been

80
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,080
incarcerated so with that I'm going to invite I think I'm going to start from that end and

81
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,680
invite Chewie to start and then make our way this way

82
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:36,779
good morning I want to share with you guys

83
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:43,020
how grip has impacted me but before that I'll briefly share where

84
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:50,220
I was before group before grip I was 15 years incarcerated at the time

85
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:55,680
and I was in the shoe what is known as isolation in

86
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:02,060
prison not knowing why I was angry not knowing why

87
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:10,620
I was so prone to be reactive and when I got introduced to grip

88
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:16,500
I did so by a commissioner of the parole board she says you might want to look into

89
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:22,920
some programs she directed me on where to find these resources and

90
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:30,000
the first program I participated in in 2016 I learned about anger

91
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,140
but it was still leaving a lot of gray areas with educating myself about myself

92
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:42,959
and in 2017 I came across grip

93
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:48,060
and I remember getting interviewed by the founder jocks and he asked me why do

94
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:54,480
you want to want to be part of grip and I said well I've done some work but

95
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,779
there are still gray areas and and I don't understand why I'm so angry all the time

96
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:05,940
why I'm so reactive I spent 10 years in isolation you don't

97
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:12,240
spend 10 years in isolation because you're a good person right and for me

98
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:18,600
what grip allowed me through the curriculum it's not just curriculum it's

99
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,120
it's a guide in in helping us educate ourselves about ourselves through the

100
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:30,000
curriculum and what I was able to learn I was able to learn about the trauma

101
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,519
and understand how the trauma was manifesting itself in my life

102
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,800
which was in a dysfunctional it was a dysfunctional expression

103
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:47,760
and the work through the exercises that I was able to do I was able to learn of how powerful

104
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:54,899
this trauma was just learning about the amygdala a part

105
00:10:54,899 --> 00:11:01,320
of the brain that is always on alert and it's like a security guard

106
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:07,740
you know Vigilant paranoid so when I started learning about that I

107
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:14,579
started seeing myself and that that's me I'm very reactive

108
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:21,060
and when I started understanding where these triggers were were coming from

109
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:28,040
what trauma was uh connected to then it allowed me to actually

110
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:33,899
acknowledge it make peace with it start to make peace

111
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:39,000
with it heal and have compassion for myself

112
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,180
then it opened up the door for me to have compassion for my father for my mother

113
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:51,420
and what it did is it replaced the anger the resentment that I had for them with

114
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:58,160
empathy and compassion because I was able to have empathy and compassion for myself

115
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:04,680
so the work that I've been able to do in grip alongside other men

116
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:11,640
has been very rewarding has been something that uh it's been life-changing

117
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:17,160
and uh it's not only for me it's I I'm witnessing these men in there have uh

118
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:22,800
those realization moments those realization moments that

119
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:29,640
it's like a light turning on right and and when that light turns on there's accountability

120
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:35,640
there's complete ownership and there's transformation I'm an example of that

121
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:41,640
so I'm just so grateful and honored to be here thank you guys I know I have to

122
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:48,079
share the mic here otherwise I'd I'd like to be speaking in the full time but I can't

123
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,699
so with that I thank you guys

124
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:02,160
I need this I think I'm out here I can talk in this okay okay

125
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:09,180
uh hello everybody my name is Bernard Moss um so uh this is my third time here so uh

126
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:14,760
thank you for welcoming me back here um so my journey

127
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:23,880
um I spent 28 years in prison California State Prison uh was convicted in 1988 of

128
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:30,120
of crime of attempted murder um in 2002

129
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:37,920
I arrived at San Quentin and I met Jacques for then and I participated in his first program

130
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:43,260
called catargio which was that San Quentin and I just thought it was the

131
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:49,680
most silly thing in the world to sit in a room and to meditate and to just talk

132
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:56,579
about your feelings and and your emotions and I would not bite in I I

133
00:13:56,579 --> 00:14:08,459
wasn't a buy-in for for the group and but I stuck with it because he stuck with me and uh some years later 2011

134
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:14,100
we transformed over to grip and I was chosen to be one of the first

135
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:20,399
participants to participate in the grip program and I sat in and I went through the

136
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:27,060
program and I graduated and uh after graduation they came to me

137
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:33,959
and they asked me to come back and facilitate and I said me you know like really yeah and then and they like yeah

138
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:39,000
so I was like yeah sure I'll try it so I came back and I started facilitating

139
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,720
grip but the tools that I learned from the grip program are invaluable

140
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:51,120
we talk about when our tools is called Ceta practicing our Sensations emotions

141
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:58,680
our thoughts and our actions and being able to connect and recognize those things and it was something I never was

142
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:06,019
able to do before I was sitting here this morning and when I was asked to guide the meditation I immediately

143
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:13,920
realized how nervous I was right I'm like I'm gonna guide a meditation with people

144
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:20,160
who meditate all the time and I'm nervous so once I started got into

145
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:27,540
meditation and and we got silent I said oh I forgot so many things right and I'm

146
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:33,540
sitting here and I'm like well this is a sign of meditation but I really want to say some more things but I'm not going

147
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:38,820
to say anything I'm just going to sit here and go with it right but yeah but uh thank you all for just bearing with

148
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:47,040
me with that I appreciate that but um yeah um yeah the the this has taught me how to

149
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:52,220
reconnect with me right and and to be my true authentic self

150
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:57,779
we sit in a room for 52 weeks right meet

151
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:04,019
once a week for two hours for 52 weeks and we really get to cover four areas of

152
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:11,540
stopping our violence developing emotional intelligence cultivating mindfulness and really

153
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:18,360
understanding how our violence affects our community our victims and

154
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:27,060
the survivors of our violence and it's so so powerful right and just meditating

155
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:32,880
and just sitting is so it's so is this one of the main

156
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,920
tools that help us connect with our inner self and our inner being

157
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:44,519
and it brings so much peace and harmony to people who are inside of violent

158
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:49,560
environment right so you have all of the people from different gangs and

159
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:54,839
different cultures and you know different races who sit in this room but

160
00:16:54,839 --> 00:17:02,519
it's a room full of peace and Harmony right and we sit there with each other for some of my class I facilitate here

161
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:09,660
on the outside now and one of my classes is two hours long and then I do a weekend class that's eight hours long

162
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:17,400
and this just peace and Harmony throughout that day with each and every person that sits in that room and it's

163
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:24,000
powerful and I I I can't stop doing this work because I sit in that room and at

164
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,419
the end of the course I have men who have sat on death row for 20 years and

165
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:35,640
are now on the main line of the prisons who tell me

166
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:41,820
after doing this work I feel again I honestly have feelings and emotions

167
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:51,179
again and I can never hurt another human being and that is so powerful I can never see

168
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:57,419
myself not doing this work and I can never see myself ever doing harm or

169
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:03,539
hurting anyone ever again so I I just attribute that to grip right and and

170
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:09,120
being a part of this program it's it's it's life-changing and and I think

171
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:16,620
people like Kim and jock that come into the institutions and they provide programs like this and IMC for

172
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:22,080
supporting uh people like myself and PJ and Chewie who who

173
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:29,220
who made bad decisions in our life when we were young and now we got an opportunity to participate in a program

174
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:37,020
like this to help us go back to being our true authentic selves the people we were truly intended to be before our

175
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:43,620
lives in prison and and it's it's it's it's yeah it's it's just something to be

176
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:48,780
so grateful for and now I get an opportunity to be a grandfather and a

177
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:54,179
husband and a father and an uncle and you know it's something that I never

178
00:18:54,179 --> 00:19:01,020
never imagined you know and I get to make all these new friends people that we used to sit on the yard and we used

179
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:07,140
to look at each other and want to kill each other and now we get to be best friends and you know today me and two we

180
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:12,960
met each other for the first time personally and we've been on Zoom calls before but today we first met each other

181
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,900
personally for the first time we drove over today from San Francisco and we were just talking in our stories are

182
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:25,260
just so similar and you know but we wouldn't have realized that on a prison yard before grip right because we

183
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:30,419
probably would have been pinned against one another or you know we wouldn't have that opportunity to just sit down and

184
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:38,880
get to know each other on a personal one-on-one basis and like we're both humans right so programs like grip help

185
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:45,240
unite people and to realizing their Humanity before they're released from

186
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:51,240
the belly of the Beast right so uh which I just want to thank all of you just who

187
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,820
support efforts like this and programs like this yes so thank you Edward

188
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:03,360
Airlines yeah and uh yeah it's just powerful and I appreciate you all so with that I'm going to shut up also and

189
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:11,460
I'm just going to pass the mic over to uh PJ thank you Bernard

190
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,520
I'm not sure what I'm going to talk about actually no I think about it

191
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:22,380
um I guess I have a lot of like it's a lot of stuff like just flies

192
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:29,760
through my mind doing a meditation a lot of stuff comes up um I want to say thank you all for a lot of gratitude

193
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:35,940
to be back here again I was here four years ago I think it was my first few months out

194
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:41,700
for my IC Attention Center after serving 19 years in prison I was detained by ice

195
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:48,660
and I was there fighting my case they were trying to deport me to a country I've never been to before where

196
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:55,080
I have no relative where I have no ties and um it was a very scary time and I think I found a lot of comfort and

197
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:03,179
support when I got here in balance so my life has changed a lot since then and covet happened and just the world

198
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:08,580
has changed in this really you know like brought me to a different direction and

199
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:13,919
I'm so happy that I'm at least at this point to be able to do this work again I

200
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:19,500
have to actually live it right I think I guess what I want to say is um one day I want to share is some

201
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:26,820
this thing that I always it's in the group curriculum that I've always been part of my life and I was born into it by this um called

202
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:33,120
amorphity which is love your faith and um as a as a Buddhist practice

203
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:39,000
practitioner I grew up into Buddhism so my mom all Buddhists my dad are Buddhists a whole culture is Buddhist

204
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,120
I'm Cambodian and so Buddhism is just not a practice that we do but it's a way of our life I've been born into it

205
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:52,200
what's in a culture it's in the language it's in a mannerism even in some of the food that we eat and um my mom always told me you know

206
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:58,200
like she always shared a story about how she survived the genocide with the Khmer Rouge and the committing Master

207
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:04,740
genocide she shared about the hardship she grew up what it was like for her as a farmer's daughter and then um

208
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:12,120
you know crawled through landmines from for hundreds of miles getting to the border of Thailand so that

209
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:17,220
so that I can live and so my brother can live and so she can live I was born in

210
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:22,380
Thailand so I wasn't born yet at the time but um

211
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:29,280
yeah and I think like coming to the United States resettling you know feeling the hardship of living

212
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:35,820
the polished community a lot of violence a lot of gangs experiences school shootings and school

213
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:42,539
you know just bullying that led me to a joining gangs myself and then

214
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:48,299
getting to incarceration as one of the youngest juvenile lifers in the correctional system I was 14 at the time

215
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:54,960
and um and I've like gone through all this hardship and I've always had this thing in my my heart it's like

216
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:01,260
my mom always say like you know you cannot like when I say more for tea I love your face he said it always sticks

217
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:07,380
to me she said um like you can always make things worse for yourself you know

218
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:13,860
like you could make things better for yourself now um make the best of what you got no matter what it is

219
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:19,200
or you can make it worse and then I think about her I think about her like in the refugee camp

220
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,480
you know looking from sun up to sundown starving and then getting beaten at the

221
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:30,059
same time and having to witness the people you love get tortured and killed in front of you I'm like

222
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:35,159
how do I love that kind of Faith you know is this it's a really hard thing to swallow until you actually live through

223
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:42,299
it and I remember you know sitting in prison um I was in the shoe at one point and um

224
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:47,820
I was really hot and I was like I feel like I was dying because there's no air conditioning it was like summertime and

225
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:53,940
I was for concrete wall and it was so miserable I couldn't sleep you couldn't like I was I think it was

226
00:23:53,940 --> 00:24:01,200
too sleep deprived for some for some point and my my soulmate my best friend

227
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:07,679
um was in the top bunk and he was like dude just so let's stay on the floor you know and

228
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:12,720
we try to float the cell but they fix the um the water so you can't really

229
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:19,140
you know one other thing we used to do when they get those so hot you flood the cell and it cools the cell down but then

230
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:25,440
they they um some people will float to sell and made a mess and so they would shut the water off so then you can't

231
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,960
really get cool right so and I remember like that's in in my head

232
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:38,880
and I um when I went to ice I had the exact same experience I was you know after 19 years

233
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,880
of incarceration so my journey with grip was that I I um was I had an opportunity

234
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:51,480
I was a young young man you know like trying to prove myself I was really afraid you know in prison because I was

235
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:57,419
one of the youngest person there right I I knew it I knew I was young I knew people you know look at me a certain

236
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:02,580
ways and I don't have like same kind of status I don't want no one else have so I would always try to

237
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:09,480
assert myself more than the next person in front of me and I'll try to make myself bigger scarier you know like

238
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:15,059
um that was my mentality and it's because I ideally I think that if people are afraid of me and people think that

239
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:20,280
I'm not a easy person to victimize they're going to leave me alone right and they're going to show me some

240
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:27,720
respect and so I lived that lifestyle for many years in prison and um one of the elders actually told me man

241
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:33,720
you need like that's not you like we can see it like it's not even with you you

242
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,760
know I think I think it shows in my um upbringing from I guess part of my um

243
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:45,059
being with my mom has early made me a better good person and I never see that and I never thought myself to be a good

244
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:50,400
person until I went to a program um it's called the red World program and

245
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:56,720
actually I was a Chapel I was talking to chap at the time and um one of the Native American

246
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:03,539
practitioner who invited me to a ceremony and so he said like man we started

247
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:09,240
talking he said man Cambodian your guy says like indigenous way is similar to ours

248
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:15,360
you know like I really wanted you to come to a ceremony and it changed my life forever because I sat in the ceremony

249
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:21,659
and it was dark I was in a nippy it's called the lodge and um you can't really see nothing right and it's between you

250
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:27,659
and the Creator between you and Mother Earth between you and yourself you know like um no one dares to judge you no one

251
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:34,020
there to see you and they will sing this really cultural spiritual song and it just like really Echoes it through your

252
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:39,240
whole body you can feel yourself and the the hot rocks and the steam you know

253
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:45,480
it's almost like a sauna but the steam which is really like it represents the breath of Grandfather which is supposed

254
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:53,880
to cleanse you right and so I was I was felt cleansed I felt the hardship of the heat was over 100 you know 140 easy and

255
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:59,580
um coming out of the lodge out there like maybe a couple hours of being in there

256
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:06,419
and I felt I suppose I felt tired I'm supposed to have felt drained and exhausted but I

257
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:12,900
came out of there like a new person I felt I was Reborn and and everything everything that that

258
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:19,620
I in my life that didn't make no sense all started like crashing in on me and and all the teaching my mom had taught

259
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:25,500
me all the stories you told me about her experience about where our people come from and I struggled all came back to me

260
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:30,900
which I have forgotten all those years because I was so deep in my own pain that I never really looked at no one

261
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:36,960
else and uh and so when I was coming for this renewal this moment of

262
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,659
my life I just I was really open now I was really open to anything like because then I was so close I had a big old wall

263
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:48,539
in front of me I was hurt so many times I was abandoned so many times that I didn't

264
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:55,080
accept anything right any any like opportunity and so I didn't really love my experience like I never made it better I

265
00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:00,360
made it worse the whole time and so when I was invited to do this

266
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:07,260
program um from through through the the split Lodge they were like hey we have a red World program we want you to attend with

267
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:13,320
us you know and we'll just do some healing and so I joined the program and it was

268
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:19,740
strange because I was youngest I sat there on a circle with eight men been in

269
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:26,400
prison more than three decades have done everything in their life um the manageable and they were like so

270
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:32,880
vulnerable you know they were sharing so deeply about their experience and everything that they have said I have lived through and I feel like

271
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:40,679
like accumulate in so many ways it's almost like a cycle you know this is cycle of how can you be so much older than me

272
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:46,020
and still live the same cycle I have gone through and I think what I connect at that time is not the experience but

273
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:53,460
our emotion our feelings you know like I felt what you felt you know and I think I could relate to you and I remember my

274
00:28:53,460 --> 00:29:00,019
facilitator and just a moment that just totally changed my life forever and made who I am today

275
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:05,700
um my facilities shared how he lost his daughter to crime he lost both of his daughter

276
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:12,059
and he was crying he was shaking he was reliving the moment and I connected with his pain and the thing I

277
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:18,539
connected with his pain because I was so open and I've clicked with his pain and I started connected with other people in

278
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:24,539
my life's pain and I connected to the person of harm and she's asking her family

279
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:29,880
and um I was ashamed you know first time I felt like I did the sexy and pain to someone

280
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:36,299
else's that I did you know to my facilitator my friend Martin at the time who was sharing this

281
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:42,419
and it rocked me to the core and I just was so guilty I was so ashamed and I was

282
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:48,779
at that moment I think I pledged my life to like never allow anyone in my life to ever experience that again and so I

283
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:54,840
dedicated my life at that moment to the change and I walked away from the prison job pretty much walked away from the

284
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:01,559
prison yard almost started started a full-scale riot because people were like you're not person politic you're not you can't go

285
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:09,779
by yourself you can't do what you want to do but um I had a lot of Elders who thought that if I was sincere and they cared for

286
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:15,620
me enough to give me a chance and they told me like we'll give you a chance and you want to try to harm you in this yard we will

287
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:22,200
respond accordingly and and I was allowed you know to practice continue practicing the Native American spiritual

288
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:28,500
circle on ways and then their their ways were so related to mind that it allows

289
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:34,500
me to find like horror again my who I am as a person and I started to see myself I remember I'm a good person like what

290
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:40,140
happened and that Journey you know led me to restorative justice

291
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:46,620
I went back to school I became a counselor and I started doing a lot of work in the prison and then my counselor

292
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:53,640
was like man you should go to San Quentin because there's so much opportunity like you could grow more and

293
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:59,640
and at the time they were doing like a prison realignment they were changed in the facility we changed the process of

294
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:06,659
how things are working and I ended up going to go to San Quentin and that's when I met job you know my first first month and

295
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:12,120
actually I was I was in the program but because I just got off the bus running and I was

296
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:18,539
I was like I wanted to learn I would have to say she would desire to learn to grow because I found myself for the

297
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:24,059
first time I knew who I am I knew where I wanted to do I knew where I wanted to go and I just want to do it

298
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:29,940
and I want to get involved in everything so I can learn I feel like if I have more knowledge I have more tools I can

299
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:36,360
provide more services and I can do more right because I didn't not I didn't know and um and and I think one of the

300
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:43,140
facility Kevin Penn at the time he was um he was the violent prevention facilitator who was working with Jacques

301
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:48,480
before this was before we would call it grip and um Ken was like dude

302
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:55,919
like you have a great spirit man I can feel it when I'm around you he's like you should come to class with me to to

303
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:04,260
you know to sit with me in a class and say why would I want to do that he said well because we teaching people how to

304
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:10,799
be Peacemaker you know and and we're teaching people you know it's related with domestic

305
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:16,320
violence but we also want to teach people how not to do violence and how to like prevent violence so he said I think

306
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:23,159
you would be good for to be one of the facilitators so I invite you to come and just sit with me and find out so I came

307
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:29,220
through class and I see Jacques with his hat I thought it I'd kind of laughed inside

308
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:34,440
of my my mind because he reminded me of the guy crocodile Gundy and I was like

309
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:41,340
what is this guy have to offer right he's this white guy come over and he's you know like gonna offer me some

310
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:47,399
knowledge about um being be a peacemaker and it was so strange because I talked

311
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:52,980
to him he talked to me it was like the first time like this dude is so calming

312
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:58,679
you know I was like nervous but I was like excited and I was like just curious but he just like talking to me and you

313
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:03,840
know just he just calmed my nerve right away he's like so welcoming and then I sat in the circle and I was really quiet

314
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:09,059
and I just watched shop the whole time and the way he taught the classes and I

315
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:14,940
at that moment I realized this is what I want to do and that's the person I need to follow

316
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:21,000
that I need to take note from and so Jacques started talking about the curriculum we started teaching about

317
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,299
grip and about the ways and a lot of the stuff that when I think about grip I think about a way of life you know a lot

318
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:34,260
of stuff that came back to me you know about the more fatigue you know like I remember you know just sitting there and just

319
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:40,380
meditating and just thinking about man I can't believe my life has gone from you

320
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:47,880
know from a kid who was bullied who was spit on who was pushed around who was shot at on multiple occasion first for

321
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:54,720
being Asian and then they're being different and to a prison yard and now I'm in the

322
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:01,500
class and I'm teaching and there was a it's just so so real I'm like this is this can't be right and and

323
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:06,539
then I started to really think about that more in depth and I started to meditate on it and I just

324
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:13,200
realized it was my energy I willed it to happen you know like my mom said like love your faith you know make the best

325
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:19,500
of what you got and put that out in the world because you can always make it worse or you can make it better and I think your energy my energy was was

326
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:26,220
creating this environment for me and and I was able to do the work you know and I'm able to

327
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:33,480
touch people's heart and able to make so many friends and naturally you know minus minus the the harm I've created if

328
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:39,839
someone asked me would you go back to prison and live your life all over again I would say yes the reason why is because I've met so

329
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:46,618
many beautiful people through that Journey I will not be here with Bernard or with Kim and I would not have met Chewie I would

330
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:52,080
not have like met jock and I would not have met a lot of people that I loved today that called my friends and my

331
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:58,320
brothers who have gone through and I think I think my life was forged through the fire and hardship

332
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,540
and I think it was forage before me

333
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,900
my mom my people

334
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:15,500
so I became very proud who I am where become

335
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:23,119
and I'm proud that I could sit with you all

336
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:31,320
be vulnerable share deeply and just appreciate the moment you know

337
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:37,380
I can never do that before in my life so I think like when I look back in my

338
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:43,980
life and I think about my journey I mean I'm still stuck in Immigration I'm still dealing with the court process

339
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:50,280
but despite all that I think this beauty you know I think there's Beauty and growth and beauty and and going through

340
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:56,940
like they said that the lotus flower grows were very beautiful but it goes from very dark muddy place

341
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:03,119
so a big grip our work is beautiful I think

342
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:08,880
I mean we build leaders and teachers so so far everyone I know who graduated from grip who's out now it's doing great

343
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,820
thing in the world and I think they're they're doing great things because not just the tools that they got from grip but because

344
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:22,200
they grow some of the transformation and I think they have changed transformed their own Journey their own life so

345
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:27,420
I just love your faith I think that's kind of

346
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:33,079
my teaching today I'm worth a tea thank you

347
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:43,560
maybe we can just take a minute one of the things we do in grip is we put one hand on the heart and one hand on the

348
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:49,440
belly and it's a way that we hold the emotion in the room together

349
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,660
because we know when one person is doing the work we all are doing the work so

350
00:36:54,660 --> 00:37:02,599
thank you PJ for sharing your journey that we all are holding with you

351
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:15,300
and thank you Bernard and Chewie also for sharing your stories

352
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:21,119
do we have time to do um how much more time do we have ten

353
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:28,619
seven minutes Bernard can we do a yeah a very quick version okay all right so I'm

354
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:37,760
gonna pass up so um can I ask for maybe four volunteers there's one

355
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,779
and this will be real quick

356
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:53,839
and one more thank you so uh

357
00:37:53,839 --> 00:38:01,859
so this exercise is called struggles in a hat anybody else need a pen okay and what we do is so we get people

358
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:09,420
together in the room and they don't know each other they don't trust each other oh Abraham okay

359
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:15,599
and they don't know each other they don't they don't they don't trust each other they don't know each other but we

360
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:22,680
have to find a common Bond so do an exercise called struggle and a hat so we ask people to write down

361
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:28,619
something that they're struggling with currently and they write it on a piece of paper so

362
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:34,800
if you can write down something in your life that you're struggling with and it can be anything

363
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:40,680
and just think for a second and write it on the piece of paper and then just ball up that piece of

364
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:47,099
paper I mean my my head under your chair all right

365
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:54,240
okay thank you and don't put your name on it anything

366
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:01,079
so what we're going to do we're going to drop them in the Hat and and we're going to go back around and you're going to pull it out and you're gonna read it

367
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:07,800
and we're going to ask you if you ever struggled with that how you

368
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:14,820
dealt with that if you've never dealt with that situation how would you

369
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:20,160
personally deal with it by not giving advice but just talking

370
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:28,920
about how you as an individual would deal with that situation and uh and just using I statement if I

371
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:35,579
had if I had was encountered with this situation I would and that's as simple as this uh

372
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:41,339
this exercise is so so you're going to put your you're going to put your struggle in the Hat

373
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:47,520
and then you're gonna pick out somebody else you're going to pick somebody else and speak as if it's yours right

374
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:54,599
so just ball it up you can ball it up or fold it yeah there you go and just drop it in thank you and then we'll come back

375
00:39:54,599 --> 00:40:01,220
around and you'll pull somebody else's out if you pull your own out drop it back in

376
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:10,020
and we'll do it real quick and this is a way that we kind of build

377
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:15,599
a bond in our circles to let people know that we're alike

378
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:21,599
right we're not as much we're not so much different than we think we are we've been sitting on this prison yard

379
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,700
looking at each other pinning each other against one another wanting to harm each

380
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:32,160
other kill each other stab each other but you're just like me you go through

381
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:38,160
the same things I go through oh I can trust you right our our cultures are

382
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:46,740
somewhat the same we we you know we come from the same place right we're all human and this is a a real way of

383
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:54,420
building a bond within our tribes and this is what we call our circles we call our circles tribes and this is one of

384
00:40:54,420 --> 00:41:00,980
the first steps to building that tribe and building that Bond within that tribe

385
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:10,440
all right and you could uh whoever like to go

386
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:16,880
first can just say your name and and read the struggle that you pulled out of the Hat

387
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:28,560
okay thank you yes [Laughter] and that's how much I appreciate you all

388
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,119
I'm missing the Raider game right now

389
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:40,460
so whoever would like to go first you can read the struggle

390
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:49,740
will I go first okay there you go it used to say your name and read it out my name's Alan

391
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:55,619
and the card says worrying about my health conditions

392
00:41:55,619 --> 00:42:02,400
um yeah I'm getting I'm getting older so there seems to be a lot of

393
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:08,280
a lot of little things that come up and I can imagine that they're a lot worse

394
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:13,859
than they might be and it's not only is it worrisome that uh

395
00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:18,960
they uh um will affect my the way I live

396
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:25,079
and and be painful and but also financially I often I really

397
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:31,859
get afraid that you know something if something's really bad enough it could ruin me you know because you know it's

398
00:42:31,859 --> 00:42:38,420
very it's very difficult to pay for medical care so I actually avoid

399
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:45,720
going to the doctors and I try to manage most of what I can on my own and uh

400
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:53,880
and not worry about it too much but it's not always easy thank you and I I also struggle with

401
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:59,220
that thank you thank you someone would like to read the next one

402
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:03,140
yeah okay all right

403
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:11,339
yeah mine says saying goodbye to someone I love

404
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:17,400
so I when I saw it I wasn't really sure what it meant does it mean that

405
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:24,540
someone broke up with you and you're ending your relationship with them or someone you love is dying

406
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:30,119
or moving away and I guess my response would be different for whatever the

407
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:37,440
situation is but if someone I loved was dying I would just want to let them know how much they

408
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:44,880
meant to me and make sure that I told them how much I love them and what they've added to my

409
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:51,000
life because I think it's really important to be real with people

410
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,099
if it was someone that was dumping me I guess

411
00:43:56,099 --> 00:44:01,740
um I would just it would be done internally I might tell them the truth

412
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:07,319
depending on how safe it felt but otherwise I would just appreciate them

413
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:12,480
in my head and maybe even I'm taking this course called a year to

414
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:18,780
live and one of the things you do is people that you have unfinished business with you meet them in your head

415
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:26,099
they may not be alive or they maybe you may not be able to talk to them and you tell them what they meant to you so to

416
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:33,960
me that was like a really amazing process because you're able to do the healing around it without actually

417
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:39,839
having to talk to the person if they're not available for you so I guess that's what I would do all right thank you

418
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:46,460
beautiful I will read the next one yeah right right behind you

419
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:57,900
I just retired I'm struggling how to live the rest of my life in a way that

420
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:03,740
is true to to my beliefs to make peace

421
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:09,240
EFI if this was something that I am facing

422
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:15,859
I would drop the question to my mind

423
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:23,960
and wait for it to come to me and so I would say to myself

424
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:34,079
how can I live a life that reflects truth and integrity about

425
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:40,700
my beliefs how can I make peace

426
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:48,359
and then the last one foreign

427
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:02,160
a yearning for mothers to have a voice to make herself known to

428
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:07,260
people who care about her and there's one word I couldn't read but

429
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:17,579
I think that's the gist of it um I think for me the key to

430
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:21,319
helping people have a voice

431
00:46:23,819 --> 00:46:30,300
is to is to listen um which I've learned

432
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:37,020
over the years is is not as easy as it seems

433
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:42,359
you know to become a good listener but I think that if

434
00:46:42,359 --> 00:46:49,260
um you can listen deeply to somebody and respond in a way that makes them

435
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:56,000
feel heard that will give them voice and uh

436
00:46:56,099 --> 00:47:01,800
and strength yes so that's that's my thought yeah thank

437
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:09,000

439
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:19,800

440
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:26,160
community in our tribes and just show how people that we all go through some of the same struggles in life and

441
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:32,280
