00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:19,639
hello everyone lovely to be with you and this Friday or Saturday if you're u in a

31
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:28,160
different time zone it's already morning or afternoon the next day so so for today's practice

32
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,960
cultivating meth uh kindness Goodwill the practices of the

33
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:40,400
heart I wanted to um combine two

34
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,800
invitations one is an invitation for rest for deep

35
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,199
rest um as a way to share kindness with

36
00:07:52,199 --> 00:08:00,599
ourselves to be kind to ourselves we don't always have to be doing doing doing so this is

37
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:07,000
um opening up to rest is an expression of kindness and

38
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:15,800
I want to couple that actually with the intentionality of engaging with kindness

39
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:21,159
in our choices we always have Choice points we always

40
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:27,919
have choices that we make in sometimes unintentionally sometimes intentionally

41
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:35,200
and I want to bring more a awareness to um to what's called in Buddhism volition

42
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,399
or volitional formations or Saras we talked about it this past week for those

43
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:47,519
who showed up to the 7 a.m. it's it's this sense of even mild or subtle

44
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:55,000
volitional choice that we make in our minds um all the time all the time so

45
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,560
bringing more awareness to that we can choose to be kind

46
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:07,480
gentle generous grateful Etc or we can choose quote unquote choose sometimes it

47
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:13,320
doesn't feel like it's a choice but really it is a uh byproduct of many many

48
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,920
choices we've made in the past um or choices that we've been engaged with

49
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:26,399
perhaps through our upbringing and we can start to notice it not to to self uh

50
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,600
flatulate and say oh I'm being mean to myself and just adding more salt to the

51
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,959
wound but just noticing and perhaps ever so slowly bringing more kindness making

52
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,440
a choice to slowly slowly change the uh

53
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:51,519
the flow of our future choices so ever so gently so but but it requires that we

54
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:58,600
first bring awareness to our choices in every moment not these big

55
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,839
Life Choices choices yeah those too of course but in these small tiny choices

56
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:10,440
that we make every moment how we react how we behave

57
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:17,800
so so with that let's make a choice to turn towards our

58
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:24,160
practice so sitting or lying down or standing

59
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:31,040
however it's comfortable for you

60
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:37,440
and letting the body making a choice a conscious

61
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,160
choice to relax the

62
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:58,000
body Relax The Mind relax the

63
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
heart

64
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:10,600
and let our posture to have a sense of integrity

65
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,720
uprightness and yet have a relaxed choose to have a relaxed attitude

66
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:30,959
relaxed posture in the heart a spacious posture in the mind

67
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:03,279
and with this spacious stance in the heart

68
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:09,959
mind receiving the breath Sensations in the

69
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:16,320
optimate one breath at a time to invite ourselves to

70
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,480
settle take refuge in this moment in

71
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
time

72
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:06,120
taking Refuge in quiet is deeply healing and

73
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:20,399
restful and we choose to

74
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:26,000
release thoughts preoccupations plans

75
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,199
overdoing can you release all that and make a

76
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:41,519
choice choose to be simple choose to rest invite the heart and mind to rest

77
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,160
and be at ease in this

78
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
moment

79
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:57,600
now we choose rest refuge in Simplicity as a radical act of

80
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,399
kindness to this being who is

81
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,519
me

82
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:30,240
release release release as an act of Med

83
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,000
especially releasing what's not helpful right

84
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:02,399
now War less care

85
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:07,799
Simple Kindness instead of pushing this being

86
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:14,919
to do and accomplish and doing and doing let it

87
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:20,120
rest let her him they

88
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:32,520
rest just as you

89
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:39,360
would lay a beloved child on their

90
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,039
bed a little baby let them

91
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:53,559
rest same gesture of kindness choosing this gentle gesture of

92
00:18:54,760 --> 00:19:00,320
kindness for yourself

93
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:49,600
as if each breath was rocking was

94
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:56,799
rocking lovingly rocking yourself in this crib with each in

95
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,120
breath and out breath

96
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:56,039
and we choose and we choose

97
00:23:56,039 --> 00:24:03,480
ease and we choose non- entanglement with thinking

98
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:08,319
wanting [Music]

99
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:15,679
worrying and we choose to put it down for just this moment put it

100
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:22,080
down and then this moment and then this moment stringing

101
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:29,799
these moments together not picking it up

102
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:39,640
choosing not to pick up the unhelpful patterns of the

103
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:45,399
Mind training ourselves in this supreme

104
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760

111
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:25,720
peace and quiet we just keep stiring it

112

PE

close to sit together let us

118

R [Music] relaxed say Audrey

139
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:47,919
you letting go says Aurora I love these Reflections bringing

140
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:53,319
them into the um

141
00:34:53,520 --> 00:35:00,599
space I like the peace and quiet quot says Jerry yeah me

142
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:10,000
too so keeping with this theme for choosing kindness choosing peace and

143
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:19,720
ease I like to invite us to see if we can stay in this space as we engage with

144
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:25,520
fellow practitioners not from a petty place so this can be really interesting

145
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:33,200
practice it can really stretch us if you tend to get into a heady place when you get into a social situation what if you

146
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:40,320
stay in this quiet space and in a container of fellow

147
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:46,480
practitioners when your turn comes explore maybe a few words come

148
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,599
from the space of quiet exploring for yourself for your benefit not for their

149
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:59,280
benefit not trying to speak to them you're just exploring out loud and maybe just silence comes up in which case you

150
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,960
hold yourself with care you choose silence and peace and you're held with

151
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,480
care silence and ease it's all good can also

152
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:17,200
um yeah you can you can explore the space

153
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:23,079
of relating with in a different way this can be really opening because we usually

154
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:30,119
get into a space we want to talk we want to share we want to share our opinions and in this relational space what if we

155
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:37,280
get into relational space with the intention to hold our peace hold the

156
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:43,359
peace and ease choosing peace um knowing that the other people in the space are

157
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:49,960
making the same choice so oh what an interesting exploration together you may

158
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:55,000
not say a word you might say a few words it doesn't matter see what feels

159
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:01,079
authentic and if it feels awkward maybe say that yeah there's peace and

160
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:06,359
there's some awkwardness just explore for yourself see what this could open up

161
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:15,319
it can unhook the Habit patterns we tend to have in social situations this can be

162
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:23,440
really interesting exploration can be a very quiet gentle exploration like a

163
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,880
Sandbox relational sandbox be curious yes

164
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:37,359
so so allowing again inviting us to engage small groups as

165
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:42,640
you speak offer a reflection about what's arising how you're feeling how

166
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:49,400
this is this exploration of choosing peace and kindness is feeling was

167
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:56,040
resonating for you again it's for your own exploration offer a nugget and put it in

168
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:02,520
the space for your benefit then let the next person do an exploration one nugget

169
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:10,400
the next person and then it comes back to you so you go around and around a few times it's not a long monologue you can

170
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:16,760
also say pass yeah you can just smile and or not even smile and just say pass

171
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:24,480
and maybe yeah maybe everybody passes maybe the second round you want to say something or not just share silence

172
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:32,680
together it's going to be so interesting anyway explore dear fellow fellow

173
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:37,440
practitioners I'm going to create the

174
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:43,800
rooms inviting you to explore [Music]

175
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:49,280

182
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:36,359

183
00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:43,440
small groups especially if you haven't spoken recently anything you like to bring into

184
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,880
the uh community space would be

185
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:57,599
lovely

186
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:15,920
I've been enjoying your your your talks this week in the morning and um uh that

187
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:23,680
the subtlety of how watching the mind is uh caught my attention and

188
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:31,119
u i i I didn't catch today so I missed that but I wonder if you have thoughts

189
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:38,000
on a little confusion about I'm going through some some difficult moods

190
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:46,280
emotions or around grief and so some may be like necessary to just be with it as

191
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:52,480
opposed to avoiding it completely which is impossible but how does that so is it

192
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:57,640
is it that watching the mind even though it's painful difficult sometimes

193
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:03,480
unpleasant to just be this is a good opportunity to watch though what what

194
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:09,040
might might get out of watching The Mind the subtlety of what it what messages

195
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:15,280
there may be there W yeah thanks Peter um so many

196
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:22,680
different different options for for especially with with being with grief

197
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:28,079
when there is loss of course grief is a natural response of the mind and heart

198
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:34,799
and of course sometimes grief can be complicated or contracted because there's resistance to the grief to the

199
00:50:34,799 --> 00:50:40,799
loss and and the various stages of of grief with bargaining and anger and just

200
00:50:40,799 --> 00:50:47,200
you know the the the challenging emotions which again could could be considered a natural part of grief and

201
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:52,280
yet um they're of they often get

202
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:58,839
um uh more it gets more challenging when there's more resistance and there some

203
00:50:58,839 --> 00:51:04,119
perhaps um if if there's lack of kindness or if there's more is more

204
00:51:04,119 --> 00:51:10,880
clingy so it can be helpful to see those but not as you said not trying to do

205
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:17,799
this in order to get rid of so make sure that that you don't have you don't end

206
00:51:17,799 --> 00:51:24,119
up with this um project of oh I'm doing this practice in order to get rid of

207
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:29,559
grief uh didn't hear that but but sometimes it can become a a subtle

208
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:34,680
second agenda um and it's wonderful because I did hear more that there is

209
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:41,839
this intention of learning from what am I learning if I observe my mind my heart

210
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:48,440
in the space what am I learning what am I learning about the patterns of this heart and mind what am I what can I

211
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:54,160
learn about um the the response of a

212
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:59,599
human being to griefing in general so it's both the personal and then the and then

213
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:05,480
Universal and can I take on this this seeing this clear

214
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:11,520
seeing as it is intertwined with kindness this curiosity which has

215
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:16,680
kindness with it so it's responsive sometimes it can lean into

216
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:22,520
the kindness and sometimes can lean into the Curiosity and there can be more of a

217
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:29,680
a a fiercer compassion like oh sweet hard you're really wallowing this okay maybe this is not helpful and sometimes

218
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:36,079
it it's helpful to say okay stay with this stay with this so always having compassion and kindness meta and

219
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:42,079
kindness intertwined in the Curiosity As You observe the State of Mind does that

220
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:49,319
does that help more questions yes thank you yeah thanks

221
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:58,000
Peter beautiful challenging opening to be human to go through all

222
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:04,040

223

different times yeah thank you any other Reflections or

224
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:23,400

choosing non [Music]

226
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:33,920
entanglement choosing to put it down when you start to steer it up noticing

227
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:41,079
that oh yeah the mind is just thinking and just like a you know like a dog that doesn't want

228
00:53:41,079 --> 00:53:47,599
to let go of a juicy bone it just like okay sweetie you can put it down it's all right it's not that juicy it's a

240
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:09,480
it breathe with it breathe around it trying to deny it you're not trying

241
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:13,920
to get rid of it you're not suppressing

242
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:21,960
it and you're not giving it energy to let it

243
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:28,680
proliferate you're just being with it just observing it it's like a little little child that's having a tantrum

244
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:37,039
just patiently being with it okay breathe be stable

245
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:43,280
breathe keep breathing keep watching

246
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:50,440
it breathing Let the Body the mind be calm spacious keep watching it as it

247
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:57,000
jumps up and down maybe throws a little tantrum smile

248
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:03,720
keep watching you can be with it and whatever

249
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:11,200
you decide is fine just see what's happening any any Reflections

250
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:17,640
Jean I think somehow talking about it out loud to you um and maybe you

251
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:23,760
responding it's sort of broke and I just it like I thought it would give me

252
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:31,440
relief to do to push that email and it it sort of broke and I just felt sad

253
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:39,359
just felt the sadness um in my chest and behind my eyes and I don't I don't want

254
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:46,079
that anymore right now I don't want the email anymore I don't have that drive

255
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:51,880
it's sort of um let me go and I just feel kind of sad now but um I think that

256
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:59,960
feels better yeah it's inter it's a different it's a it is a real relief kind of yeah

257
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:05,520
thanks for speaking to that now now it it might actually be that this is a

258
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:12,200
moment of insight and and thank you for playing you know inquiring together

259
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:19,599
in real time because it's both help also helpful for the community where these things come up because um in maybe that

260
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:26,000
gen in this case it was the sadness that was the Lynch pen of the agitation

261
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:32,520
but it wasn't seen it was kind of it was the energy behind and when we really pay

262
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:39,839
attention to what's on top this this energy of wanted wanted and then oh it lets go

263
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:46,680
it breaks as you said and we get to see what's what's underneath and and we can be with the sadness can I be with that

264
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:54,079
too with the same way with the kindness and generosity and uh see what's there

265
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:59,680
what's yeah what's the lesson there thank you

266
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:07,280
thank you yeah ah

267
00:58:07,319 --> 00:58:15,480
great and maybe one last reflection here from

268
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:26,799
Mima I want to to share something it's um I feel that by coming to happy hour

269
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:33,960
and I've learned so much from you and how to speak to myself um I almost want to cry right now

270
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:39,319
because I come from a really rough background most of my life that um to be

271
00:58:39,319 --> 00:58:44,520
kind to myself was something that was foreign and through happy hour and

272
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:49,640
through some your your teachings I've learned like I could get the teachings

273
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:54,760
from like the Dharma talks and stuff like that um Dharma seed but to hear you

274
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:59,960
you speak to yourself and to speak to us that way it's warmed my heart so much

275
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:07,119
that I speak to others that way now as well because that's how I speak to me now and so I am just so touched that

276
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:12,680
I've learned that um yeah my family members can't believe transformation

277
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:18,799
because of this the sweetness the kindness the the words and they're genuine I feel them it's like all that

278
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:26,359
other stuff like you told Gan right now was covering up that the goodness the kindness the comp passion that I just

279
00:59:26,359 --> 00:59:32,200
want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for that and everyone else thank
