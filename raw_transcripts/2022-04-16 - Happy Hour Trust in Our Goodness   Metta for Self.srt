7
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:46,320
sangha one large happy arasaka so so for today's uh scene

8
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,160
i'd like to invite us to um explore simple meta practice for

9
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,360
ourselves just simple meta it's very simple kindness

10
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,480
loving kindness care warmth for this person who is me

11
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,159
ever so simply um in

12
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:15,439
in the teachings in the concentric circles of how meta loving kindness is developed

13
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:23,360
traditionally the first concentric circle is ourselves we start with ourselves

14
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,400
in the west sometimes because folks have trouble starting with themselves we

15
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,360
start with a dear being and then we turn to ourselves just to prime the pump of the heart

16
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:43,040
and and yet the teaching the buddha has taught that

17
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,600
has said that if you search the entire world you wouldn't find anyone worthier than your own

18
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,520
kindness your own metta your own love so we are as worthy

19
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,840
as worthy not more not less just as worthy as anyone else just as worthy as

20
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,280
anyone else for care and love and

21
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:15,040
kindness so so yeah i thought for tonight we would just go back to the basics basics are

22
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:23,840
delicious very very nourishing to just hold ourselves in care and kindness so

23
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:30,720
um yeah i think i don't want to say much more to frame it i'll just

24
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,879
guide us in a meditation uh as always we start by settling in the

25
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:43,040
body with the breath for a few minutes to get grounded to settle

26
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,319
and then i will make some invitations

27
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,519
for practices and feel free to

28
00:02:53,519 --> 00:03:00,080
follow them or not adapt them as they work for you in this moment in time

29
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,840
giving yourself a lot of permission to care to care for yourself for this

30
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:13,120
being who is you this body this mind this heart this being with all the causes and

31
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,720
conditions of suffering and joy so

32
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:25,280
so with that let's practice together let's practice so i'd like to invite you to make

33
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,680
yourself comfortable you need to shift move if you need to lie down as long as

34
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,360
you're not going to fall asleep that's a perfectly fine posture too

35
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,280
or to stand up if you're super sleepy

36
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,440
i will give the instructions for sitting but see what your body needs in this moment

37
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:58,040
so arriving landing in this body in this moment

38
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,959
hello dear body greeting greeting this body

39
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,599
mindfulness of the body important

40
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,919
the basic foundation of our practice

41
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,720
always starting with the body feeling feeling our feet

42
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,840
on the earth

43
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:42,240
feeling our sit bones on the earth or the cushion or the chair in lieu of

44
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,400
the earth

45
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:32,960
feeling the source bones releasing under the earth

46
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,680
really connecting

47
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:47,120
the weight the weight of the upper body dropping into the chair

48
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:56,960
and turning our gaze inward the mind might still

49
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:04,000
have a lot of repeats from earlier today thoughts activities

50
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,840
it's okay nothing wrong with thinking per se

51
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:17,800
and in this moment we choose we intentionally bring our mind

52
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:28,240
invite our mind to give up to give away to relinquish

53
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,800
not because it's bad but because there's something better here stillness is so much better

54
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,080
stillness is so much more delicious internally

55
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,240
so we turn away from thoughts entanglements

56
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,599
come back thank you we'll come back but for now

57
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:57,440
we'll turn and we'll turn again we may need to turn a hundred times

58
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:04,400
turn away give up relinquish thoughts entanglements

59
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,199
and turn let let awareness turn internally

60
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,479
and let awareness connect with the breath in the abdomen

61
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,120
we give up go away give away the thoughts and entanglements

62
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:42,400
awareness needs something [Music] to connect to

63
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:51,280
to attend to let it be the breath as the anchor breath in the body

64
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,400
nourishing calming soothing

65
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,560
trusting that the simplicity of this moment is more delicious the stillness

66
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:53,120
more calming healing and figuring anything out in this moment

67
00:08:53,120 --> 00:09:00,639
and the mind is still the heart is full things will be figured out on their own

68
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,040
with a different mind einstein says we can't solve our

69
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:13,519
problems with the same mind that created them so bow to that mind thank you

70
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:20,839
not now i'll let there be a turning towards a calm quiet still

71
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,600
mind here just this breath

72
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:34,680
just this breath here just to spread

73
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:47,920
how can this moment be nourishing for this body for this heart

74
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,800
as if you're talking to yourself as a beloved other beloved child

75
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:04,519
sweetheart how can i take care of you in this moment how can i be with you present with you

76
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:17,720
give you my full attention no words or thoughts needed just to be

77
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,079
so

78
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,640
okay

79
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:04,319
and now if you wish

80
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,839
i'd like to invite you to

81
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:18,160
imagine as if you were

82
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,720
the wise or the wise kind

83
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,079
parent of yourself

84
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:38,160
seeing a younger version of yourself perhaps or not younger maybe the same age

85
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,360
the same way parents mothers fathers they see

86
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:51,839
coaches they see a potential they see the goodness they see a bright light

87
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,560
often in younger people or in others that they don't see they don't appreciate in themselves

88
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,558
knowing trusting there is this bright light about you

89
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:22,798
and it's hard for you to see it in yourself maybe let yourself be seen

90
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:29,200
by a compassionate being in your mind's eye but they see your brightness they see

91
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,720
your potential they see your goodness

92
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:45,039
and when i say potential here in this case is the beauty of your intentions

93
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:50,880
your intentions for cultivation [Music] for kindness for wisdom

94
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:58,799
for not causing harm in the word world for ethical conduct

95
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,520
that you try you try

96
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:13,520
they see in you what's bigger than you what's not diminished or diminishable

97
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:19,120
not diminishable by your suffering by your challenges

98
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:26,880
whether times you feel small lost in pain none of that affects

99
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,840
affects it at all

100
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:43,840
they see you or if it works the wise part of you sees yourself

101
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,480
however this being seen works for you

102
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,600
there is so much potential for goodness

103
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,720
for good kind thoughts words actions

104
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:27,679
so much potential in each and every one of us so much potential the future is not

105
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:33,760
written yet so much potential for goodness for acts

106
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,880
of service love kindness

107
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,720
not self-centeredness

108
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:33,639
may this person knows me may i

109
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:40,080
my inner goodness i appreciate

110
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:49,919
my inner potential for beautiful acts thoughts

111
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:58,159
deeds of kindness love care generosity

112
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,840
may i say myself for who real i really am

113
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:18,159
and if words come oh no you're not deserving you're not worth it

114
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:24,960
you don't have to believe the thoughts the judgmental thoughts just say thank you very much for your

115
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:31,039
opinion please come back later you don't have to believe them they're just thoughts

116
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:36,640
just thoughts no need to

117
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,840
give power to them

118
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:47,919
not getting in your own way may i may this person who is me

119
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:56,480
may i be safe from inner and outer arm

120
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:03,679
the harm i caused myself the inner harm and the outer arm

121
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:12,799
which i may not be able to control so knowing this wish for safety is

122
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:18,639
a wish an expression of kindness from myself it's not

123
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:27,000
clinging to the outcome just expressing kindness

124
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:34,159
good will towards myself with this wish without attachment to outcome

125
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:41,840
may i be safe from inner and outer arms

126
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,200

130
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:29,440
it's just an expression it's a gift we give to ourselves this wish

131
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:35,120
when you give a gift you don't expect something in return

132
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:42,480
in pure generosity this is pure generosity of the heart may i be well may i be happy

133

wrapping yourself in the blanket of love of care

159

rose or did not arise it's okay

164
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:21,119
let there be ease lack of judgment for yourself you showed up you tried so

165
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:26,800
all that matters we're planting seeds we don't know when they're going to

166
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:32,720
sprout non-attachment to outcome

167
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,280
may our practice be cause condition made support

168
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,880
awakening freedom of all beings everywhere including ourselves

169
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:50,119
may all beings be free may all beings be happy

170
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,599
thanks everyone thank you for your practice

171
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:15,200
so we have a few minutes any reflections any aha moments any questions

172
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:20,320
might have come up from this simple practice of mitta for

173
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:27,040
ourselves and the difference that at the beginning we started with seeing our own goodness

174
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:33,280
seeing our own potential and that's really important because we often see perhaps other people's

175
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:40,560
potential children's and then with adults or with ourselves we just see

176
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:45,599
faults we just see problems we just see what we do wrong

177
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:51,760
we have so much potential for goodness for kindness to see that it actually

178
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:57,280
brings it out when you clearly see and may want to reflect on the experience

179
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:03,520
you've had clearly seeing somebody else clearly seeing

180
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:09,280
their goodness their potential and that has that being seen has helped them

181
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:15,280
flourish just help them flourish maybe you've mentored a younger person at some point

182
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,560
in your life can you be that younger person you

183
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:27,040

oh oh can you hear me yeah thank you and i actually wanted

191
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:24,400
i actually wanted to comment on um the practice from wednesday

192
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,839
because i was very very surprised at how often

193
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:36,800
in the past two days the question how can i give service has come up in daily

194
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:42,000
life i i during the meditation during the and

195
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,640
the the framing portion i was like oh gosh i'm never gonna remember this and like i'm gonna get

196
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:56,880
down on myself for never remembering to ask myself that and i was i was seriously surprised how many

197
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:02,880
times it just floated to the surface and it it was like

198
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:09,200
it was like it needed it like needed as a kneading dough like needed my heart

199
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:16,640
like softened it for the past couple of days and it's been really important for me in

200
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:22,960
the past couple of days so i just wanted to thank you and give a reflection on that practice

201
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:28,480

203

00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,640
myself and to others thank you so much sarah for for sharing this reflection

205

206
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:56,880
like wow it just came up and kneaded your heart what beautiful metaphor needed your heart

214
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:48,079

223
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:44,400
it's a regular regular member of the sangha

224
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:50,800
any other reflections before we turn to to practicing together

225
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:58,640
in small breakout groups any other reflections questions

226
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:07,359
complaints anything is welcome for the benefit of everyone

227
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:16,640
okay space is quiet so i take that as a sign that maybe we're ready for turning into

228
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:22,480
small groups so so as i make small groups i'd like to remind us

229
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,920
uh the ways that we practice in the small group

230
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:34,000
is the purpose is to bring our practice into a sandbox not just from our eyes

231
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,200
being closed and we're on our own but actually interact in this same spirit

232
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:45,040
same space of loving kindness with others and not

233
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:51,680
get out of it like okay my meditation is ended now i can be mean to everyone okay

234
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:57,040
i'm joking but of course i made caricature out of it but can we relate to other human beings from that

235
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:04,240
space of kindness care can i be of service can i be kind can i see their light the theme tonight can i see their

236
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:09,280
light their goodness can can they see mine or inviting them inviting myself to

237
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:15,359
be seen not shying away i mean not boasting but just being as you are

238
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:20,960
so the invitation is you speak from your own experience alone um you don't

239
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:26,480
comment reflect pro ask probing questions manage the group

240
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,599
you just say simply from your own experience what this practice was like for you and if

241
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:38,960
you want to be quiet and hold space you can say pass and hold kind

242
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:44,720
generous space for others that's okay you have five nuggets some five things

243
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:50,240
just say one then the next person will say one and the next person will say one and they'll come to you and they'll just

244
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:56,160
go around it's just it's like a stone soup each each person contributes something

245
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:02,000
to this space of kindness relating to others and may be nourishing for you

246
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:09,280
and lastly let's uh do a person whoever's birthday is closest

247
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,560
to january first not the year but just date will start first speaking first and

248
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:21,280
then second and third and you get to interact a little bit in the space of meta that way just holding each other in

249
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:27,520
meta i think that's really where the rubber meets the road and you speak for your own benefit

250
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:34,640
really not to educate not to impress anyone so so the rooms are created i'm about to open

251
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:39,920
them take care of yourselves take care of each other here we go

252
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:48,880
okay the rooms are closed everyone's back so we have

253
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:54,560
a few minutes any reflections questions comments

254
00:44:54,560 --> 00:45:00,640
especially any reflections that might have come up any aha moments from

255
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:07,040
from being in the room uh interacting with others
