1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,320
welcome uh welcome folks good to be with

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:15,639
you yeah welcome to you all okay we'll uh we'll sit

3
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,719
so finding uh getting situated and finding

4
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,520
uh finding your posture

5
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,799
relaxing whatever can be relaxed

6
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,280
allowing any tension that remains to

7
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:58,000
remain and we relax in order to feel

8
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,840
more we relax in order

9
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:11,640
to give our nervous system a little

10
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:18,440
break we relax because

11
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:24,800
clinging always carries a kind of burden of tension

12
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,879
we relax because it feels

13
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:49,280
good and because it conveys to life our confidence that we can meet

14
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,800
it e

15
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,760
what would it be like if we were deeply

16
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,720
unafraid of our inner

17
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,680
life for

18
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:32,120
what would it be like if we just assumed our safety for these 30

19
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:44,960
minutes that it was okay to

20
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:52,759
deeply relinquish our vigilance

21
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,960
rather than Patrol

22
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,080
phenomena we surrender to

23
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
them

24
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
e

25
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,479
e e

26
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:15,159
um breath might be an anchor sound might be an

27
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:23,400
anchor the hands or feet or some pleasantness in your body might be an

28
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,560
anchor the anchor might be everywhere

29
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,760
but even as we incline our minds

30
00:08:51,760 --> 00:09:00,240
towards surrender relinquishment non vigilance

31
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:07,360
we're nurturing uh the

32
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,200
clarity of the attention high

33
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:22,279
resolution not foggy not mediated by dense

34
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
story

35
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,360
e e

36
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:39,760
our attention snags on phenomena like a hang

37
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,240
nail on

38
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:55,279
fabric we momentarily forget a

39
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:00,279
nature impermanence

40
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,839
and then we let

41
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,639
go knowing experience Moment by moment

42
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:25,720
but not holding it

43
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
still

44
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
e

45
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
e

46
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
e

47
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,079
e e

48
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,560
you're too busy

49
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:33,160
knowing to feel like you have a vantage

50
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,839
point too busy

51
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:04,040
knowing to keep tabs on who you are how you're

52
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,040
doing too busy

53
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,959
knowing to keep track of

54
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:38,639
the million things right and the million that are wrong in this

55
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
moment

56
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

57
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839

58
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840

e e

60
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:58,240
you get caught up not even not even the slightest problem

61
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,559
just forgive

62
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:11,000
yourself and SE that

63
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,240
ground and get busy

64
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
knowing

65
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
for

66
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640

e e

69
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:17,600
too busy knowing to have even the faintest

70
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,679
clue about who you are

71
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:45,080
about your strengths and

72
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
limitations

73
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440

82
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,120
e

83
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,120
e

84
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,039
e

85
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,039
e

86
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,000
e e

87
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:40,799
it's good to uh good to sit with

88
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:50,519
you so over the 12 years or so that I've been

89
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:58,960
teaching full-time um I've received a lot of of feedback

90
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:05,039
and uh I used to be featured in a kind of

91
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:10,760
video course that you know maybe 5 10,000 people would

92
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:16,880
take uh each year and uh to complete the

93
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:25,080
course the learning management system required people to give detailed

94
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:30,320
feedback so they could not get course credit unless yes they gave detailed

95
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,960
feedback on the trainers of which I was

96
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:41,679
one and this this is uh if you if you

97
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:48,799
think you truly understand anata read the feedback from 10,000

98
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:56,360
strangers you know so even still I've

99
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:03,279
always I've always kind of valued it uh even if sometimes

100
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:10,480
it's jangly or something but I valued it because it it illuminates you know it

101
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,799
the response to feedback illuminates the architecture of self

102
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:24,159
view the kind of sacred cows of self and we usually think like okay I'll

103
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:30,559
take in the feedback that's right and I'll refuse the feedback that's off base

104
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:37,880
and that's fair enough but I think from a Buddhist perspective

105
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:45,480
it's like regardless of whether the feedback is right or wrong if it highlights

106
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:52,799
defensiveness it's a value it's a value because wherever there's

107
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:58,039
defensiveness there's clinging and clinging can always lead us to to

108
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:04,840
harming self and other

109
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:11,720
so I say all of that as a kind of introduction to a little piece of

110
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:21,559
feedback that's been lodged deep deep in my brain maybe like medulla oblongata

111
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:27,158
deep kind of like the part that regulates breathing

112
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:33,720
you're rooting for me you're rooting for me you're hoping it's not that bad

113
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:39,519
you're hoping I'm going to be okay just just stop rooting stop rooting

114
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:49,320
it's about to get real so this person this guy turned out

115
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:56,240
to like me this is in La um but when he walked into the Dharma

116
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:06,799
Hall and saw me sitting up on the de his first thought was um who is this

117
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:15,119
middle manager of Kinkos about to give us all a Dharma

118
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:22,240
talk rip Kinkos you know

119
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:29,280
but yeah okay now maybe I laugh about that so

120
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,320
that I don't cry or I laugh to diffuse some kind of shame or something like

121
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:40,560
that but honestly when I heard that and when I say it it brings a lot of

122
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:47,358
delight it brings a lot of delight I I think because there's

123
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:53,760
something true about it there's something true about it and

124
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:01,359
this is not like my self-hatred talking this is not that W my my sense of self was not a

125
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:10,800
casualty in that moment at all but I do think that maybe I read a

126
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:16,359
little bit like a junior manager of

127
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:24,920
Kingo and I think I I think I read I think I read like that because there

128
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:31,359
are of course certain aspects of practice that are under

129
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:37,839
developed and so the dharma's a thousand beautiful qualities and if we cultivate

130
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:46,119
even a few we're fortunate right so I was talking with a a Dharma

131
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:56,560
friend and uh she also took the liberty of giving me some feedback you know just

132
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:04,079
just open open season on the esteemed leader of certain

133
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:11,839
Wednesdays okay so more feedback and um and she said you know

134
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:20,119
sometimes she uses a very simple map of capacities head heart

135
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:26,119
belly head referring to Clarity

136
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:32,200
discernment you know the kind of pristine kind of view conceptual

137
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:39,920
understanding coherence allows us to cut through the static and illuminate what

138
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:48,720
matters and uh in heart referring to uh kind of affective sensitivity and

139
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:55,680
empathic connection and love and Attunement and compassion this

140
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,880
realm and then belly

141
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,920
belly referring to

142
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:11,200
groundedness groundedness presence

143
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:18,160
earthiness the kind of weight the force of a person's

144
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:25,240
presence involves the belly involves a certain kind of deep

145
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:34,040
embodiment and this friend who I trust totally said you know Matthew kind of

146
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:43,400
have developed two of the three you can guess maybe which

147
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:50,640
underdeveloped belly belly kind

148
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:56,680
of the weightiness of uh the yeah the

149
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:04,160
the weightiness of presence so why why am am why am I

150
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:12,599
telling you all this am I using you as like a therapeutic mirror or something to you know to get whatever to

151
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:18,200
no no not at all telling you this

152
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:24,839
because a teacher cannot only share their wisdom

153
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:32,079
but uh also their delusion right we share wisdom and delusion because I

154
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:42,280
can't tell the difference between the two and so sometimes it feels reasonable just to kind of come clean oh okay I see

155
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:50,519
clearly their aspects of the path that uh are I want to keep

156
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,839
developing n said one one um one repays

157
00:38:56,839 --> 00:39:01,880
a teacher badly if one always remains nothing but a

158
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:07,680
pupil and so I'm telling you this because the student is expected to

159
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:13,599
exceed the teacher I'm telling you this because

160
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:18,880
it's um it's

161
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:26,359
fascinating how the Dharma kind of yeah or the Dharma grows and it's

162
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:33,680
somehow kind of can grow and accommodate our own Neurosis in a graceful way sort

163
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:39,079
of but it's like we can practice in such a way that there are certain aspects of

164
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:46,599
the path that we really don't notice and that image that I I I've

165
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:52,119
mentioned before of like you know when like a tree branch that has grown like

166
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:57,880
entangled with a power wire up on a telephone pole you know

167
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:03,119
and the electrical crew just deems like okay we're just going to have to cut

168
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:08,440
both sides of the branch and then there's that chunk of wood that's just

169
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:13,800
suspended by The Thin Line you know and I kind of I don't know

170
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:19,440
there's something about that image that makes me think of the ways in which

171
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:27,520
kind of like you know just the gnarled pieces of us just grow around something

172
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:35,160
uh sort of um force it to accommodate our our pain or

173
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:42,680
something and this is all fine it's like yeah generally it's good

174
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:49,160
to develop our strengths but then we got to double back to what comes less

175
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:55,760
naturally you know I'm telling you this because uh

176
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:04,359
because the Dharma is so wild it's so wild it has so many surprises in store

177
00:41:04,359 --> 00:41:09,599
for us I don't I don't know that those stop

178
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:15,680
you know but the unwillingness to be startled you

179
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:23,720
know is uh is maybe a sign there's something deadening in

180
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,280
us and so so

181
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,520
we yeah growth is always a little startling it's a little

182
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:43,640
startling we get kind of comfortable in one mode of practice and then the rug

183
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:49,359
gets pulled out from us we get we sort of like at some cruising altitude and

184
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:56,960
then some there's some turbulence something changes and the encouragement is just

185
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:05,480
like yeah to be open to being startled to be open to having some vision of who who we

186
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:10,599
are kind of like cracked open you

187
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:17,000
know we we practice

188
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:24,920
um yeah we cease to predict you know predict cease

189
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:33,520
predicting ourselves in the next week or day or

190
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:39,240
moment you can maybe sense the kind of openness of

191
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:48,200
that and so yeah growth is kind of startling sometimes you

192
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:54,040
know but we do not shy away from it you know that's kind of like the Dharma

193
00:42:54,040 --> 00:43:03,000
attitude I feel do not shy away from it we're here for too little time we

194
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:09,200
all are here for too little time die too

195
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:17,880
soon and so we trust that there's there's nothing nothing nothing you can

196
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:24,440
discover about yourself that will be a reason to love yourself less and you

197
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:31,920
know that in your bones then the self-exploration becomes

198
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,520
Reckless and

199
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:45,040
uh yeah becomes just

200
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:50,160
all all it's all dhama all

201
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:59,200
love so offer this for your consideration and uh we'll be uh back

202
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:04,359
next week okay folks
