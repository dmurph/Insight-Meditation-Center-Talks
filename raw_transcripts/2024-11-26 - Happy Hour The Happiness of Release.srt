hour and um yeah so many relevant themes to

23
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,239
practice with today it's the week of Thanksgiving

24
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:30,519
in the US which is a holiday for giving thanks it's also

25
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:38,760
giving season holidays are seasons of generosity of heart letting go and

26
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:45,879
letting go is both um you know what I love this this this word in poly might

27
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:53,319
have mentioned it before the word is chaga which is spelled c a g a so

28
00:02:53,319 --> 00:03:00,400
chaga is the movement of the heart that opens up opens and lets go so

29
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,159
it's both a gesture of Letting Go and you can imagine that letting go of

30
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:13,000
resentment letting go of you know if you're this F this week you're getting together as family where you see them in

31
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,200
a particular way Letting Go Letting Go opening the heart letting go of all of

32
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:24,519
that Letting Go letting go of stuff you don't need physical stuff emotional

33
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:30,360
baggage is just letting go putting it down putting it down chaga chaga and

34
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,920
it's the same word chaga which also

35
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,879
means um the heart a heart that is generous a heart that is giving because

36
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:48,439
it's the same action right it's the same action of opening the hand to give someone to someone else so it's

37
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:55,239
different from Donna we think of Donna which is the act of giving the the

38
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:01,720
giving itself or the gift that is given is Donna but chaga is a heart that is

39
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:09,000
generous that lets go so for me I when I learned this years ago I just became so

40
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,239
happy with you know the heart that lets go the same action of the heart that oh

41
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:23,160
just opens up and doesn't cling to things resentments and thoughts or whatever it is uh possessions is the

42
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,720
same movement of the heart that just you know get lets go to somebody else is

43
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:36,000
generous is giv so I've I've loved that so maybe we'll practice with that theme

44
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,680
tonight that's so many lovely theme so let's uh let's explore let's explore

45
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:50,680
together and oh and just to say oh maybe I'll say one last thing because um the connection to happy hour is this

46
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,280
movement of the heart chaga brings happiness Letting Go brings happiness

47
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:03,360
brings Joy have you noticed for example if you've claim clean up the clutter in your home and and you've given it all

48
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:10,000
away oh there's so much happiness and lightness and joy okay great I gave it

49
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,479
all away just cleared up woo same with like letting go of putting down

50
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:22,319
something that no longer serves in the heart and also generosity

51
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:30,600
when you give some something to someone when you give a gift you are the one who's happy like Yay you know you as and

52
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:37,440
the Buddha says that a happiness of generosity comes before giving the gift

53
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:44,160
while giving the gift after giving the gift while before you give the gift Oh yay giving them a gift the heart is

54
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,800
Happy are they going to like it maybe they doesn't matter you know you're going to be generous you can celebrate your own generosity while you're giving

55
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,039
it to give with a heart of happiness and after you've given to reflect on it and

56
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:02,319
allow this this chaga this this letting go this release into making someone else

57
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:10,800
happy to um yeah to to move actually as I'm talking about this I just realized

58
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,360
oh yeah this is this is one formula one way I can talk about it so chaga letting

59
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:22,240
go that makes you happy some well CH when you put something down when you

60
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,840
release you make yourself happy you may also when you that chaga

61
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:36,080
is an act of generosity you're giving something to others you both make yourself happy and others happy so so

62
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:42,599
just came up with that formula so chaga can show up in different ways anyway I'm excited by chaga as you can tell all

63
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:50,120
right so let's let's practice together let's land let's land in our

64
00:06:50,639 --> 00:07:00,440
postures let's arrive and let go let go what

65
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:08,960
Down release it's a release it's not a throwing down it's not

66
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:15,400
a disliking or hating it's none of that it's a release the same way that you

67
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:23,680
would release a helium balloon ah you let it go let go

68
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:33,479
of any tension relax relaxing into the

69
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,400
chair and when I invite you to let go of tension again not all of it is possible

70
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,520
but maybe letting go of tightening that we can let go

71
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:53,599
of if you're aware that some muscles are being held tight maybe you're holding

72
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,759
tight your forehead that you are not quite aware of

73
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:06,280
until I met anent oh yeah I can release can release my

74
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:11,919
eyes around the socket I can let my forehead oh my jaw

75
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:20,800
wow feel the tension there I can relax let

76
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:27,680
go of the extra tightness holding that's not needed extra effort that's not

77
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,400
needed right now

78
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:41,518
maybe your hands your fists are being clenched as Habit unbeknown to you can

79
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:49,360
soften let go of this tightening that's not needed

80
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,160
notice in your own way your body they

81
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:14,640
Holdings tightenings that could be

82
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,200
released let go

83
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:28,800
of release some more and then a little more challenge

84
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,639
yourself to release just a little more into

85
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,320
deep Letting Go

86
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:57,880
relaxation and letting go of thoughts there stories that keep

87
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:03,000
coming thank you smilingly release them right

88
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,680
now later I'll come back to you

89
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:18,800
later release as much as can be released

90
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,320
and see I how the mind knowing can connect

91
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:51,279
with the breath in breath and out breath there can be more release letting go with

92
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:59,120
every out breath that is our practice right now very simple

93
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,639
and each out breath is a new opportunity for release for letting

94
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:16,040
go maybe a thought has arisen a story don't need this one right now

95
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:24,199
release thank you release

96
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,040

139
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:50,600
me person who's doing this

140
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:58,679
practice and I like to invite you for the fast for the last few minutes

141
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:04,200
imagine releasing onto someone else something

142
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:10,880
you have maybe your time your affection your kind words maybe a

143
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:19,200
smile maybe a resource you have to another being or organization or

144
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:24,720
whatever comes up either something you've just done maybe recollecting

145
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:30,240
remembering this act of chaga letting go

146
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:39,000
generosity You' released you've given someone something you've had and see how

147
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,200
that brings ease happiness

148
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:54,480
expansiveness feel into it celebrate it it's the same movement of the heart

149
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:16,120
also appreciate that on some [Music]

150
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:25,679
level on some level there is not a giver or receiver of gift

151
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,879
it's all interplay it's all an

152
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:44,919
interplay of sharing goodness resources as we give we also receive

153
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:51,440
graciousness uplift in the heart appreciation the person who receives is

154
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:58,760
also giving gladness giving vulnerability to receive

155
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:08,159
opening themselves so it's such a deep teaching so many levels

156
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:15,799
here as we bring this practice to a close appreciating ourselves for having

157
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:22,640
showed up and releasing any Judgment of how this was or wasn't was

158
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,840
distracted it was this it was that it's okay let it go let it go you've done

159
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:33,440
your best you've showed up you've planted seeds trust it celebrate the

160
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,720
goodness and joining our hearts to share the goodness of our

161
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:45,919
practice this co-created goodness with all beings may all beings everywhere

162

[Music]

164
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,000
thanks everyone thanks for your

165
00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:17,880
practice so three prompts three Explorations that I'd like to invite you

166
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:23,120
to [Music] explore and one exploration

167
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:29,120
is one prompt is what was this practice like this practice of continuously

168
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:35,760
Letting Go which is quite a profound practice um it's actually one practice

169
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:41,360
of leading into concentration Som could be very strong practice of course your

170
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,720
mileage could vary and curious what came up for you explore what was it like to

171
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:54,960
keep letting go Let it go Let it go into spaciousness into ease not holding on

172
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:02,279
not being loyal to our suffering not being loyal to our stories that's the first prompt for the

173
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:10,200
first round just feeling us filling it into our bodies the second prompt is what would

174
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:17,360
be helpful to let go of to release right now exploring that is there an object

175
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:23,720
that would be helpful to let go of to feel lighter

176
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:30,960
um for your own sake and then the third prompt is is there something that

177
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,279
actually the second part could be object could be a grudge could be something

178
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:43,159
emotional or physical to release and the third is

179
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:49,519
um what would be helpful for you and someone else to release and an act of

180
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:55,399
giving an act of generosity that again could be an object could be your time

181
00:30:55,399 --> 00:31:02,720
smile forgiveness Joy calling someone up giving them your care

182
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:09,240
something that would benefit you and others so those are the three rounds of our

183
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:17,440
exploration tonight with the uh yeah as we as we engage with one another in the

184
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:23,880
breakouts and um and I'm going to pause the recording

185
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:33,519
and and talk about practicing meta in in small groups considering the groups as a

186
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:38,880
continuation of the meditation embracing compassion talking

187
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,399
staying on topic the three prompts I gave you in the three rounds first one

188
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:49,480
was remember what what the meditation was like second prompt what would be

189
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:54,519
helpful for you to let go of third prombo would be helpful for you and

190
00:31:54,519 --> 00:32:00,320
someone else as an act of generosity so those are three promps through three rounds you're going to go around and

191
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:06,840
round in three rounds as much as you get to be brief talk on topic be brief let

192
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:12,799
everyone share avoiding cross talk commenting on others all that okay so

193
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:19,840
I'm going to create the breakout rooms and as always want to invite you to practice kindness

194
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:26,120
generosity care meta look to yourself for yourself and for others caring for

195
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:34,720
yourself caring for others um this is really the small groups is where the meta hits the road the rubber

196
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:44,200
meets the road it's the where the mentor meets the road so all right so let's see how the groups

197
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:50,639
look and uh yeah let's you know maybe I'll hold

great thank you Nikki yeah thank you for sharing about chaga that was really

232
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:33,680
helpful for my practice something to Aspire to um yeah the practice for me

233
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:40,559
especially question two um I found myself coming up with quite a long list of things that I could

234
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:46,800
let go of and so I felt some overwhelm this is a time of the year

235
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:53,400
where I I tend to reflect on self-improvement and I'm at a time in my

236
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:59,640
life midlife I don't know it's like the double Focus I'm a time in my life when

237
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:05,079
I'm really focusing on what's how can I improve what's my

238
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:10,599
impact how can I live my vision how can I be of service to the world so it felt

239
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:15,800
like a lot um but it was a really helpful practice thank you yeah thank

240
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:22,400
you Jesse I appreciate um what you shared I I I'll tell you one thing that

241
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:29,319
your reflection uh brought up well many things brought up for me that that you know the beauty of of reflecting at the

242
00:45:29,319 --> 00:45:37,200
end of the year how can I preserve how can I um how can I Aspire aspire to be

243
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:43,040
um you know the best version of myself this being you know not competing with anyone else but myself and then what one

244
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:51,640
thing you said which is self-improvement and that I want to invite you to put a question mark next to um which might

245
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:57,280
seem kind of quizzical like wait what what what's wrong with that there's some

246
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:04,680
about the project of self-improvement in framing it that way that has could have

247
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:10,440
the sense of overwhelm that that you're describing that and also the sense of not

248
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:17,040
enoughness that I'm just I'm not enough and this is not good so I have to improve this thing who's me

249
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:24,680
self-improvement there's there's a particular frame that particular Trope that the Western culture can fall into

250
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:30,400
especially there's so many um you know um podcast and this for

251
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:36,319
self-improvement do this and do that and do this and do this and do I don't know 100 reps of this part like it just seems

252
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:42,760
like endless like it feels like we got to add o actually as I say that my heart feels kind

253
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:49,000
of contracted um feels like there's more and more to

254
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:55,880
add not to say there's excellent advice there's various things that e wonderful

255
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:04,160
habits that we do want to to um to take on wholesome habits and yet I think I

256
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:09,200
want to to um to advise you to be more

257
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:16,520
generous with yourself you know this being the the um perspective as of

258
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:21,680
aspiration allows for rest allows for letting go yet the frame of

259
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:28,720
self-improvement can be can become a little tight so just offering that for reflection if that's might be

260
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:36,200
helpful thank you Nikki thank you Jesse thank you so much

261
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:49,839
Richard while you're unmuting yourself I see Bill posted one of the Dharma teachers I listen to referred to the

262
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:58,079
subtle violence of self-improvement yep that's it yeah I wasn't gonna be that

263
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:05,920
um um yeah that oh what's the word I want to use um ex not explicit but

264
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:11,520
anyway yeah I'm more gentle in my choice of words but yes I I I agree with that

265
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:18,680
too there is a cell violence to it Richard you're up okay in my 20s I was

266
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:24,240
high up on a ladder and I started falling backwards I knew I couldn't stop

267
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:31,079
myself and without planning or whatever I just sort of automatically felt like a

268
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:37,559
ragd doile and I didn't hurt myself at all

269
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:43,079
you know it was like falling on cushions or something and and I've kept that

270
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:48,960
memory alive that sometimes when I meditate I

271
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:55,520
just recall that and just you know relax into it and let go

272
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:04,040
that way rather than one one little thing at a time kind of thing yeah yeah

273
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:12,280
yeah yeah I I so appreciate you raising that yeah that is one um meditation and

274
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:18,200
structure instruction that I use as well which is it's like falling backwards

275
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:23,960
like you're just falling you're you're letting go completely with everything in

276
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:29,319
your body you're letting go and I love that and I practice that Richard so I'm

277
00:49:29,319 --> 00:49:35,799
so glad you brought that up the idea of letting go a little bit is just to get that idea of what it feels like to let

278
00:49:35,799 --> 00:49:42,440
go so that one feels you know your practice one practices little by little by little so one feels safe enough to

279
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:49,160
just like complete body letting go so I'm so glad you have that memory felt

280
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:55,920
sense memory cuz that kind that kind of practice is very powerful very um

281
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:03,240
opening relaxing and and yeah uh centering that that complete embodied

282
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:11,280
letting go love it thanks Richard thank you and yeah for others who who feel

283
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:18,079
safe enough with all the other Letting Go than what Richard was pointing to and

284
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:26,319
that's yeah ex explore that please Diana

285
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:35,920
um I love this practice tonight the idea the the term Letting Go has almost

286
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:44,240
become an annoyance for me I've heard at least a 100,000 times from many of all

287
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:50,160
my esteemed teachers on tapes in lectures Let It Go

288
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:58,160
Just Just Let It Go like that so I'm sitting back like this Sly literally

289
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:06,720
how I go poof and and boing and it's gone whatever the it is and so in this

290
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:15,400
case tonight and a few other times and i' I've learned it was about process or way to

291
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:22,200
do it that was with breathing and it was that continuous

292
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:29,200
um staying with it um on and on that

293
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:35,599
helped measurably and I began to feel some peace come just staying with with

294
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:42,000
each time in that slow process and so I just felt such confidence in listening

295
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:48,559
to that and I thought obviously that can translate into the larger line it seems to me that

296
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:55,559
the other way that's come to me is is this when I can recognize when I recognize something that and I see

297
00:51:55,559 --> 00:52:04,240
something sometimes there's like a a recognition of something and then it just dissolves or something but um I

298
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:09,319
just love tonight's practice in terms of just healthful

299
00:52:09,319 --> 00:52:15,119
so I promise to try not to be so annoyed by hearing this all the

300
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:22,240
time I feel help is now what do I do great di yeah I love I love what you

301
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:29,680
said thank you so much for sharing yeah it's yeah so helpful for what you said because often when we hear the

302
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:36,480
instruction which is beautiful instruction very wise but often that comes up and I've heard many

303
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:42,359
practitioners over the years say like how do I let go what I like I want to

304
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:51,000
let go how do I like how how do I put it down so so yeah how do I do it so um so yes

305
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:57,799
there is a method it's it's it's you you observe what the mind what the body is

306
00:52:57,799 --> 00:53:03,079
is grabbing on you you become more observant and then ah you release you're

307
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:09,839
gently ever so release with the out breath with the body and it's a practice it's a training we learn more and more

308
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:16,720
how to do it and now that Diana you've you've practiced it what it means I

309
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:23,480
don't think you're going to become annoyed because you know like oh yeah that's what they're pointing to okay okay that's what they're talking about I

310
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:31,160

311

312
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:45,200
can unmute yourself thank you thanks Nikki um you

313
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:51,680
said something in the beginning about uh like letting go of objects that are we

314
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:59,799
don't use anymore but also letting go of this emotional maybe baggages that are not useful and

315
00:53:59,799 --> 00:54:06,400
that was really close to my heart like it really made sense to me and I realize that it's e like some of the things that

316
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:12,400
I need to let go are related to forgiveness and I find it much easier to

317
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:20,720
forgive others but it's very difficult for me to forgive myself um and I wanted

318
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:27,119
to ask for your thoughts especially because you feel like it's not always just being harsh on your self or like

319
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:34,359
self-improvement but also feeling that like I expect more from myself and just

320
00:54:34,359 --> 00:54:41,280
disappointed yeah yeah yeah thank ah thank you Sarah John I also see hearts

321
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:46,680
showing up in the chat for your practice and for you

322
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:51,839
yeah it is very common for all of us

323
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:57,480
human beings um forgiving others is easier than forgiving ourselves it's of

324
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:02,880
course it is we're harder on ourselves than anyone else

325
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:08,559
um and of course of course of course and of course we have high expectations of

326
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:15,079
ourselves and sometimes we look back and we think oh how could you how could I

327
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:21,160
how how oh and maybe the other person the person has forgiven us loves us no

328
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:28,960
it's it's okay with them for example in some cases that could be the case but still or holding on but how how could I

329
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:35,079
oh so so to understand to really

330
00:55:35,079 --> 00:55:40,839
appreciate that the version of you who was acting at that time the version of

331
00:55:40,839 --> 00:55:47,960
you whom you were at the time she was doing her best she was

332
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:56,839
doing the best she could at that time given everything she had given all the

333
00:55:56,839 --> 00:56:02,559
physical limited physical mental resources all the stresses she had all

334
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:08,720
the the expectations all the information she had everything like all the causes

335
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:16,520
and conditions that came to make that decision that happened at that time if

336
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:23,079
if you unrolled yourself your present you know hindsight is 2020 have much more information you can see better see

337
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:28,119
how things unfolded all that but at the time the

338
00:56:28,119 --> 00:56:35,079
person you were this this this dear poor sweet person who was caught in this

339
00:56:35,079 --> 00:56:40,200
challenging situation that was doing the best she could and that's the best she

340
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:47,440
could do at the time to forgive her for her limited ability for limited Vision

341
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:53,359
limited information limited resources limited all I forgive you you were doing

342
00:56:53,359 --> 00:57:00,720
your best I know I know I know I see you and you were doing your best I see you

343
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:06,400
and and let her let her be she's she it was hard enough for her whatever it was

344
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:12,280
it was hard enough doesn't need the older version of you to beat her up she

345
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:19,000
it was hard enough what she was going through I hope that was helpful thanks
