6
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:43,860
so for this week um I feel like I'm still writing along with

7
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:51,840
um the waves of the two-week Retreat that the guild taught in May

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,899
and so I'm going to channel some of the teachings from that retreat

9
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:03,059
and so this morning meditation will

10
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:11,640
um will be guided by a set of awards and that starts with R

11
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:18,360
and today I will start with relaxing

12
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,680
and so that's where we're gonna begin our guided meditation today

13
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:35,280
so if you like to join me um please allow yourself to settle into

14
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:42,720
a sitting posture that's a supportive of a sitting for about half an hour 45

15
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,380
minutes

16
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,920
to begin maybe take a few long deep breaths

17
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:04,680
as you breathe out and now the whole body

18
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,619
to settle towards the ground

19
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:22,140
may be allow the whole body to ever so slightly

20
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,640
began to relax

21
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:39,920
offer a guided body scan to relax the whole body

22
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:50,720
maybe feeling and sensing into the lower half of the body

23
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,319
feeling the feet touching the ground

24
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,599
maybe the sit bones making contact with

25
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,700
floor chairs bed

26
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,340
wherever you may be meditating from

27
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,500
relaxing the feet

28
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:43,220
relaxing the pelvic floor relax

29
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,819
whatever relaxing might mean to you

30
00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:00,440
for me it's a sense of settling down

31
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:09,799
allow the weight of a body to settle downwards

32
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:18,799
maybe a sense of letting go of any extra attention

33
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:24,800
unnecessary tension that may be a holding

34
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,960
holding the the legs the feet

35
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:47,940
so relaxation is not a demand

36
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,160
it's a gentle invitation

37
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,060
if the body doesn't want to relax

38
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,819
maybe relaxed about that

39
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:35,120
relaxing the lower half of the abdominal area

40
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:46,160
and relaxing the whole belly

41
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:58,940
just as if the breathing and freely flow

42
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:07,160
Valley can freely rise in the fall

43
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:34,220
there isn't any extra Construction

44
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:44,300
a gentle invitation to relax the construction

45
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:04,940
softening and a relaxing the lower back

46
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:10,220
however it might manifest itself

47
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:39,120
it could be just feeling the back

48
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,900
softening and easing up

49
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:04,038
relaxing the waist area and the upper back

50
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,139
allow the weight of the Torso

51
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:38,940
and settle simply by trusting the gravity

52
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,860
nothing to do here

53
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:58,580
softening and relaxing the chest

54
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,860
there may be a slight opening

55
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:37,160
softening the shoulders arms and hands

56
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:48,019
allow the shoulders to naturally drop

57
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:11,360
the body is naturally supported by the Earth underneath of us

58
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:22,160
there's no need for extra effort to hold up

59
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:39,380
relaxing the muscles around the arms

60
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,860
and

61
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:10,399
softening any tension that could be softened

62
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:29,300
relaxing the muscles around the neck

63
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:37,699
in the front of the neck sides and the back

64
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:58,399
relaxing the face muscles on the face

65
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:02,839
a jaw

66
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:11,000
they even soften the tongue inside the mouth

67
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,100
if it's a helpful you can't open the mouth slightly

68
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:33,899
and gently close release any tension

69
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:38,820
Construction tightness

70
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:49,339
soften around the eyes

71
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,440
and forehead

72
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,620
and sculpt

73
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:22,220
soften whatever may be softened right here

74
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:45,860
relaxing the mind

75
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:55,220
wherever the Mind might be located in your body

76
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:07,100
and relaxing the thinking muscles

77
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:43,019
as we relax the body and mind

78
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:49,260
you may notice that your experience become

79
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,920
clear

80
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,480
the whole body is at ease

81
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:18,540
the mind is at ease heart is open

82
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,500
soft

83
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:48,839
the movements of the Bride Sensations in the body

84
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:53,300
become fear

85
00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:00,320
visible felt

86
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:33,860
if you find your energy

87
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:40,339
energetic field feels a little dull

88
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:50,519
and you dial up a little clarity

89
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:58,519
without adding tension to the experience

90
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:59,760
the relaxed the mind and heart hello clear singing

91
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,380

92
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:55,100
if you find mention picking up again

93
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:01,880
or striving is present

94
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:11,640

95
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:18,720

and now your awareness to be relaxed

99
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:16,559
as if whatever arises and passes away

100
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:22,400
is a health by the field of

101
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,400
relaxed awareness

102
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:17,640
relaxed awareness already in it

103
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:26,779
as the flavors of kindness the flavor of tenderness

104
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:29,899
but

105
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,320
foreign

106
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:31,400
[Music]

107
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,820
foreign

108
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:54,609
[Music]

109
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:39,480
for this next part of the Garment if you wish to continue to be

110
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:46,620
kind of in the meditative mode um please continue to

111
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:53,279
sit in your meditative posture sometimes I feel that

112
00:31:53,279 --> 00:32:00,720
um the Dharma talks when being received in a meditative way it has a different

113
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:08,840
effect on Ami and so I offer that as a possibility

114
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:18,480
so this week's on darmeds that I'd like to Channel girls with them by reading a

115
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:26,700
set of stories a Tales from yo fransto's book called a monastery

116
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:32,120
Within and the

117
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:39,000
stories that I selected from this book form a theme

118
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,360
which was to do was the Dharma practice all right the Dharma path

119
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:55,260
in particular this is stories hopefully will offer some aspect of

120
00:32:55,260 --> 00:33:02,399
um the sense of a multi-faceted or multi-dimensional nature of the Dharma

121
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:08,279
practice I think for most of us if not all of us

122
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:15,799
sooner or later as our practice unfolds will come to realize that the practice

123
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:22,100
or the path that Dharma path we walk

124
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:27,779
is not what we think it may be like [Music]

125
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:33,720
so to me this is the case for me when I first started the practice

126
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:40,279
and I thought if I just read and understood

127
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:46,740
studied enough in my head then that'll do it

128
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:55,140
and so you know I did a ton of readings and studies and sutas the books and and

129
00:33:55,140 --> 00:34:03,840
disgusted them with groups in groups until when I feel like my head was about

130
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:10,260
to explode if there's more information but to be stuffed in my head

131
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:17,638
and so I realized that in the Dharma path is more than

132
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:23,580
sort of this information accumulation in my head

133
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:28,878
and so that opened me to extend or expand

134
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:34,200
my practice of field with meditative for

135
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:43,980
practice and the books also said it's important right it's um so I sat and meditated at

136
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:51,000
home on retreats until at some point I realized

137
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:58,680
well there is a more to the practice than this form also

138
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:04,020
and so the practice began to expand even further

139
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:09,599
included family life and particularly after my

140
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:14,480
son was born maybe that whole journey

141
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:21,680
included in my family caring for my family relationships

142
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:28,260
relationships with uh closed circles and then expanded to

143
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:35,280
relationship of other people I don't know well or I don't know at all

144
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:42,619
and so this practice began to expand in many different dimensions

145
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:49,619
I realized at some point I began to reflect how I choose to live my life

146
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:56,280
how I behave or speak and the attitudes I hold are living this

147
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:03,420
life and at some point I began to ask myself

148
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:10,500
what do I exclude so this is a long way to say that the

149
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:17,880
practice is a multi-dimensional or multifaceted and so the art of our practice is to

150
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:25,560
begin to open ourselves to this multi-dimensional nature of our

151
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:31,020
practice our path because all of those different dimensions

152
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:36,680
support each other and inform each other

153
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:43,619
and so each of the stories that I'll be reading this week points to some

154
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:50,520
dimensions of the practice that one may or may not have considered

155
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:56,640
and they're not exactly what you must do or have to do like what the stories are

156
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:05,160
pointing to but rather they serve as metaphors to point to how one might open oneself

157
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:11,420
up to the multitudes of the practice

158
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:17,099
and so as I read to the stories sometimes I'll be offering some

159
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:25,020
Reflections and commentaries and um you might this might be an invitation

160
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:32,820
for you as well and to incorporate some of your own reflections

161
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:39,950
so that's enough said I'm going to read the first story of this week

162
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:45,240
[Music] so this is called

163
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:53,640
inside out an engineer had been a regular and

164
00:37:53,640 --> 00:38:00,960
devouted visitor to the monastery for many years the meditation practice taught at the

165
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,839
monastery was the only thing that made sense to him in fact

166
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:13,500
the pragmatical logic of the meditation teachings give him hope that he would

167
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:19,980
overcome his chronic unhappiness and deeply felt pain

168
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:25,440
he tried all the meditation practices that the abbess taught him

169
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:33,060
he began each practice technique with enthusiasm only to have each end with

170
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:38,880
the same frustration he would encounter a wall he could not

171
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:46,920
pass the closer he came to the wall the more he would recoil back into trying to

172
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:54,000
think his way out of his pain offering him much support

173
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,000
the apis encouraged him to relax trust the practice

174
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,780
and to Simply feel his inner pain without reacting to it

175
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:13,560
after many years the Abbas decided a different approach was needed

176
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:20,579
during his next visit to the monastery that Abbas told him that if he wanted to

177
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:26,460
continue being her student and to be able to return to the monastery he would

178
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:34,380
have to take on a special practice once he had completed the assignment he

179
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:41,099
could then return for deeper teachings once more feeling hope

180
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:46,800
the engineer quickly agreed the app is said

181
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:54,720
for two years I want you to volunteer 10 hours a week at the maternity world at

182
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:02,520
the local hospital the hospital needs people to hold babies who are born prematurely

183
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:10,640
if they don't receive enough physical contact the babies will not grow healthy

184
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:17,400
when you have finished this two years please come back to see me

185
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:25,079
the man was quite perplexed by this instruction but because of his trust in the abyss

186
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:31,680
and his failure to find any relief elsewhere he plunged into volunteering

187
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:37,800
in the maternity world he was surprised at how small and

188
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:46,260
fragile the babies were that he helped he would hold them ever so carefully

189
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:53,520
he would watch their every breath because they all seemed in danger of a

190
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:59,339
stopping breathing spent a lot of time thinking about how

191
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:05,400
he would how he could more effectively care for the babies he held

192
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:11,099
but there was nothing more effective than simply holding them against his

193
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:16,440
chest after about six months

194
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:24,480
he started a feeling something quite new he started to feel a little spot of

195
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:32,599
warmth and the softness in the very center of his being

196
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:39,900
since this was a foreign experience that didn't fit any of the ways he

197
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:45,200
thought about himself he ignored it

198
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:50,520
ignoring it was the best thing he could have done

199
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:56,700
because it prevented him from interfering with the warmth by thinking

200
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:01,980
about it too much over the following months

201
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:09,060
the tender spot grew until it pervaded his body

202
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:15,859
as it did the cold dark wall around his heart

203
00:42:15,859 --> 00:42:23,780
slowly relaxed thought and dissolved

204
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:31,500
when he had completed his two years of a volunteering in the maternity world

205
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:38,640
the engineer returned to the monastery the office saw immediately

206
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:45,180
he was a changed man he was no longer desperate

207
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:51,660
and he was no longer trying to fit everything he experienced into a

208
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:58,619
conceptual framework now he wanted to learn what else the app

209
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:04,859
is had to teach giving him a new instruction

210
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:13,200
the app is said to him when you meditate don't think about what is happening

211
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:18,359
father let your awareness be seated in the

212
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:24,960
tender warmth you feel in your body if you do this

213
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:30,599
any meditation practice you do will be fruitful

214
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:35,359
the man found this to be true

215
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:51,960
so what might be the walls that blocks the deepening and the richness

216
00:43:51,960 --> 00:44:00,240
of your Dharma path in this story The Abyss is the one who

217
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:07,140
offered the new instructions to the engineer but for each of us

218
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:14,640
the abyss maybe ourselves we may have to discover

219
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:21,800
the wall and new possibilities for ourselves

220
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:29,940
and like myself at some point of my journey I realized

221
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:35,000
more study more reading

222
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:39,619
it's only going to build a thick wall

223
00:44:41,339 --> 00:44:47,420
and so I had to open two new dimensions of the practice

224
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:55,400
and similarly just like this engineer often we may practice using a lot of

225
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:00,660
conceptual framework that we learned about we don't quite

226
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:08,760
know to how to practice in an embodied way and so for this engineer holding the

227
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:14,040
premature baby and a softened and opened him up

228
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:22,520
to get in touch with his own direct embodied experience

229
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:29,460
and so for each of us we may have to discover

230
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:37,220
because you know the pointer of a holding baby in some different ways

231
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:48,319
so for many of us we know that the

232
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:53,640
drama path often is described as a three-fold

233
00:45:53,640 --> 00:46:00,540
practice of asila samadhi and panyas and so sometimes

234
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:07,460
maybe the ethical Dimension is challenging

235
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:14,760
and this can be a wall for ourselves and maybe sometimes we have to cultivate

236
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:21,480
ethical conducts in order for other dimensions of a

237
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:32,339
practice to come along so it's quite rich and there's a whole territory and my invitation today is

238
00:46:32,339 --> 00:46:39,780
um to discover and open your practice in

239
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:45,359
multitude of ways and I will continue tomorrow

240
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:51,240
in this way so thank you everyone for your

241
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:59,060
presence and your practice and may the spring benefit to yourself

242
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:06,119
and to all beings everywhere thank you everyone

243
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:09,440
have a wonderful day
