1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:08,960
so good morning everyone it's a delight to see all the

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:15,960
uh comments um I read them all and I really appreciate them

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,600
um and it's great seeing some very old friends there too

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,680
so good day good good uh morning afternoon evening for some

5
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:36,960
[Music] um and uh we'll go ahead and start with um you know uh a little bit on feeling

6
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:44,960
tones or vana of thinking and um beta is a poly word

7
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,039
that's translated as feeling tone it's a very fundamental way that we

8
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:57,199
experience the world through our senses and through our mind uh when a sensation

9
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:04,158
arrives it's either pleasant unpleasant or neither pleasant or pleasant some

10
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,520
people call it neutral um it's immediate it happens

11
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,880
right away and it's much simpler than an emotion

12
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,600
it's important because this is how clinging arises we experience something pleasant

13
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:30,479
and if we don't pay attention we often just want more of it and we start grasping and trying to get more um

14
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,159
um but staying mindful of the level of the feeling tone and keep us from

15
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:44,240
grasping at what's pleasant at what we enjoy um and conversely the same is true

16
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,680
something's unpleasant it's very easy to fall into want into pushing it away

17
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,360
getting rid of it um for the first 10 minutes of this

18
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,360
meditation we'll emphasize noticing the feeling tone of our experience just as

19
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:08,720
simple as what we feel pleasant unpleasant or neither and don't worry about being

20
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,920
correct sometimes it's like well it's it's almost pleasant or uh you know

21
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,959
that's fine you know sometimes it's subtle it's really what you notice now

22
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,760
whether you label it correctly and sometimes it changes the same um uh

23
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:34,840
warmth that felt really good a moment ago can feel uncomfortable um so however it is just

24
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:41,200
notice this moment pleasant unpleasant or neither and just try to do this in a

25
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:48,080
relaxed way um without adding too much to the meditation so we'll do just the

26
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:57,519
first 10 minutes we'll focus on this um so let's take a comfortable but

27
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:04,680
alert posture settling settling into our

28
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,959
seat gently closing the

29
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:16,519
eyes and begin by taking a few deep

30
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:24,360
breaths and with each ex each each exhale relaxing a little bit more

31
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:33,720
relaxing into your cushion or chair to the earth that supports us all

32
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:47,240
now allowing the breath to return to normal you might get a sense of the whole

33
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:53,960
body and allow the attention to meander freely throughout the

34
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,638
body relaxing any obvious

35
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:05,680
tensions you might check the head the face the

36
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:12,960
shoulders the belly the

37
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:18,080
hands whatever can be relaxed

38
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,880
now finding the breath within your body allowing your

39
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:22,800
attention to rest on the breath just settling into the rhythm of

40
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,039
the breath

41
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:18,199
now shift the attention to notice the mood of the mind the mind

42
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:24,080
state just a larger environment of the mind in which all the sensations of the

43
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:31,720
breathing of the body are occurring how does the mind

44
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:41,120
feel is it tense or relaxed spacious or

45
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,840
contracted tired or

46
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:58,440
alert calm or agitated however it

47
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,319
is just noticing it

48
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,080
i said resistance or

49
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:19,240
accepting don't need to pick any words just notice how it feels

50
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,800
now shift the attention back to the sensations of

51
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:57,720
breathing allowing the sensations to come and go

52
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,760
but briefly notice the feeling tone of the breath it can change with every inhale

53
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:14,680
and exhale is this inhale pleasant right now is it unpleasant or neither

54
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:48,080
if any other compelling physical sensations arise also briefly notice their feeling

55
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:55,080
tone pleasant

56
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,160
unpleasant neither

57
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:49,560
and just for the next couple of minutes if any thinking becomes

58
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:54,640
obvious notice if it's pleasant or unpleasant

59
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:01,839
are you enjoying the thinking is it pleasant is there some stress there is

60
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,440
it unpleasant and you can easily change

61
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,760
from one to the other see if you can observe these

62
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,839
feeling tones without getting carried away by the content of the

63
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:24,839
thoughts or by any reaction to the thoughts

64
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:40,839
if no significant thinking arises just rest on the breath

65
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:11,360
now we can just return to keeping it very simple returning to the rhythm of the

66
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:17,760
breath but maybe your mind will notice a little

67
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,959
bit more easily the pleasant and unpleasant

68
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:31,040
qualities that arise with all our sensations all of our

69
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:43,959
thoughts just resting in our breath

70
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:41,080
if your tension has drifted or gotten

71
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:46,760
lost just gently welcome it back home

72
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:30,429
[Music]

73
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:43,520
so Um this morning I'm going to talk about a little bit about internal white speech

74
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,559
and um but also uh how vdana the the

75
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:53,720
feeling tone um of our inner voice affects

76
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:59,440
us um so

77
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:05,520
um vet and I it is that our experience is either pleasant unpleasant or neither

78
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:11,440
and we tend to cling to the pleasant and push away the unpleasant and usually not

79
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:17,600
even notice the neither pleasant or unpleasant but as the mind slows down uh

80
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:23,600
it's much easier to see that feeling tone of our sensations and we can relax into them

81
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:29,840
however they are and not get pulled into them uh life is filled with unpleasant

82
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,120
sensations they're not going to go away it's not like we can manipulate our life

83
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:41,519
for things to always be pleasant uh so the idea is not to have one over

84
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:47,640
the other but to be at peace with however those sensations

85
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:54,320
are um but one of the uh reasons we get caught in our thinking is that we're

86
00:31:54,320 --> 00:32:01,279
unaware of the thinking the feeling tone of our thinking um worrying and negative judgment

87
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:06,960
thoughts regrets they tend to be unpleasant thoughts like anticipation

88
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:13,159
maybe thinking about loved ones gratitude they're they tend to be

89
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:21,360
pleasant and uh when we get into um our thinking often um can come in patterns

90
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:28,640
of thinking for many of us and um the patterns we get caught by and for

91
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:34,480
instance uh in particular during meditation uh so some of us really uh

92
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:42,799
fall into planning we might f plan and replan the same thing many many times uh now

93
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:47,919
planning in itself can be pleasant or unpleasant and it's helpful to know

94
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:53,519
what's feeding the pattern um I like to plan often planning

95
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:59,039
is fun planning a project planning a vacation maybe planning what we'll do

96
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:04,960
later that day um you know and sometimes we may do this during meditation because

97
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:11,519
we're bored we're bored which is unpleasant it's slightly unpleasant we

98
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:17,039
tend to think there's nothing happening but something isn't quite quite pleasant

99
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:22,320
and we become aversive to the boredom we push it away by entertaining ourselves

100
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:29,200
with planning um or maybe we're feeling really good which is pleasant and when

101
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:35,519
we feel good in in our daily lives we're used to doing something with that energy and and so we want to plan what we're

102
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:41,720
going to do next so we're excited and so um we get caught by the feeling

103
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:48,799
good um but planning can also be fueled by anxiety by trying to control things

104
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:54,159
it's usually unpleasant and usually not useful you know maybe we're having

105
00:33:54,159 --> 00:34:01,640
friends over for lunch and uh we need to plan the menu and we've already sort of planned the menu but then we find

106
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:07,279
ourselves doing it over and over and over again all the details uh there can

107
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:14,158
be attention a compulsiveness to this kind of planning um in working with repetitive

108
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:20,240
planning it can be very helpful to notice if it's pleasant or unpleasant am

109
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:25,398
I enjoying it or is it stressful

110
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:31,440
so um in this path most of us um have

111
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:37,760
put some effort in practicing wise speech in our in our daily lives and

112
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:44,679
maybe have even refined our speech making our speech kinder more honest

113
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:50,760
um maybe we've noticed the separation we create between people when we're

114
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:56,960
gossiping or how our heart feels more closed or maybe how frequent complaining

115
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,920
is stressful and fatigues the other person and actually decreases

116
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:08,400
empathy decreases the connection between people

117
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:14,920
you know how unskillful speech can strain relationships it can isolate

118
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:19,440
us it can erode our sense of

119
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:27,119
selfworth one way of thinking about wise thinking in meditation is as internal

120
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:33,200
wise speech and the effects of internal speech are even more extensive than our

121
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:40,640
verbal ones so the guidelines um that the Buddha

122
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:47,240
offered for why speech can apply just as well to our internal speech to our

123
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:55,200
thinking um though it's not so easy to refrain from from those things but it uh

124
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:01,880
one of the ways that can be helpful though is when the guidelines are expressed as four simple

125
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:08,359
questions is it true is it helpful is it

126
00:36:08,359 --> 00:36:14,240
kind is it the right time let's take a little time to look at

127
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:20,720
those um um you know I've known practitioners who

128
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:26,000
think to themselves I can't concentrate and they'll do that over and over in

129
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,040
their minds you know and they believe it you know and um had a student I worked

130
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:36,640
with and um and he told me you know I just can't concentrate you know I just

131
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:42,400
get lost constantly uh so I asked them to close their eyes and pay attention to

132
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:48,000
three breaths and then open their eyes and uh lo and behold they were able

133
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,920
to do that but the story that I'm someone who can't concentrate just

134
00:36:53,920 --> 00:37:01,720
discouraged him stopped him from applying himself and even if you didn't get past three breaths that's

135
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:10,680
concentrating and we still settle three breaths distracted three breaths distracted we can still settle the

136
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,839
mind um so is it true whatever we're saying

137
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:21,119
to ourselves is it helpful and so if we're planning

138
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:27,200
something for the 10th time you know um we might be telling ourselves a story we

139
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:33,280
got to get it just right but is it helpful it's usually not it's usually

140
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:40,359
not especially during meditation um and is it

141
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:45,880
kind the quality of the voice putting down on ourselves is not

142
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:51,200
kind repetitive thoughts of not being good enough are not kind would I speak

143
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:58,320
to my child that way um in the 70s um 70s there was a

144
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,520
period of time when in some circles it became very popular for people to

145
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:11,280
practice brutal honesty a particularly direct and unfiltered form of truthtelling without

146
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,800
consideration for the recipient's feelings the idea was they're responsible for their own feelings i'm

147
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:25,240
just going to tell the truth and it often caused harm it often uh broke

148
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:31,040
relationships sometimes the truth might hurt and sometimes we do have to tell

149
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:36,960
painful truths but it can still be communicated with kind

150
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:46,320
intentions um is it the right time and uh sometimes something might be

151
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,880
true it might be kind it might be helpful and really deserve

152
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:57,920
attention but we're meditating uh it's not why we meditate to to figure these

153
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:03,520
things out it's not the right time and in meditation we can just very

154
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:08,560
easily say "Oh not now." It can come out of respect

155
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:16,240
uh for the thoughts for the idea you know I'll think about that later that's worthy of reflection and we put it aside

156
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:22,720
for later not a rejection of it but just a putting it

157
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:28,160
aside um you know it's just like in a relationship

158
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:37,200
uh you might have something you really want to say and you know it's true it's kind it's helpful but it may not be um

159
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:44,640
uh something that your partner wants to hear when they first wake up in the morning it's not the right time in your

160
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,320
mind it's like oh it's really it's really alive but they're still groggy

161
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:58,640
give them some time um so these are the the aspects of um of wise speech that

162
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:06,680
really can be internalized um to help develop more helpful

163
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:11,240
thought thinking processes

164
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:19,440
um so um you know some of the patterns repetitive patterns we can fall into you

165
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:26,800
know when a particular theme keeps reappearing in our thinking you know such as I mentioned planning we can use

166
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:34,720
those four questions whenever we're caught in one of those patterns one of those eddies just by adding the question

167
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:41,599
it adds a little bit of space it adds a wholesome element to the

168
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:48,520
moment another common pattern might be worry you know what if thoughts

169
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:52,839
imagining excuse me

170
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:06,960
um imagining um unwanted future events it can be really helpful to

171
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:15,079
notice the emotion underneath some form of fear or anxiety to attend to it is it

172
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:21,280
true often not i like to remember what Mark Twain said um some of the worst

173
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:28,079
things in my life never happened um and it might be true but

174
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:34,680
it's a kind when we bring kindness to worry it begins to change

175
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:41,000
it is it helpful are we going to make things better with worry with rehashing

176
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,760
rethinking um and if it's something worthwhile

177
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:53,560
considering meditation is not the right time

178
00:41:53,560 --> 00:42:00,720
um so another pattern that's really common is um impatient thoughts which

179
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:07,160
are not pleasant usually and they're not helpful and in fact they can cause

180
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:13,359
harm this seemingly harmless kind of repetitive thought pattern can have a

181
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:18,680
great impact on us it tells us the present moment is not worth

182
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:25,680
experiencing that the present moment is not okay it's not enough and it creates a sense of

183
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:31,839
contention with our experience which adds tension and stress

184
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:41,040
so when we see this repetitive thoughts you know you know how much longer before the bell you know or um or however uh we

185
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:47,200
might be impatient um there's always like an underlying

186
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:54,599
aversion or pushing away the present moment experience and can we turn to

187
00:42:54,599 --> 00:43:01,720
it um you know we might ask ourselves what is it we don't want to

188
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:07,599
feel in daily life how often are you waiting for something to be over waiting

189
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:13,200
in line waiting on hold on the on the phone waiting until the person you're

190
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:19,079
talking to gets to the point all that waiting is supported by

191
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:25,520
thoughts thoughts that ignore the value of the present moment

192
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,520
so can we get interested in that

193
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:38,280
moment and um you know one other

194
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:45,839
um pattern that many of us um have repetitive is judgment just a recurring

195
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:53,800
kind of um uh judging ourselves other situations we even judge or

196
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:59,079
judging you know and what's really important is that

197
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:05,079
um how to tell the difference between judgment and

198
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:11,839
discernment for instance the judging mind sees what's wrong with anything right uh what's wrong with ourselves

199
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:17,800
what's wrong with someone else and the discerning mind might notice what's

200
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:25,839
wrong uh but it's nonreactive it's with an easy heart um

201
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:31,400
it's reactive judgment has a meanness to it it's not

202
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:37,680
kind for instance um you know as a boss if you have to evaluate an employee you

203
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:45,079
have to know their strengths and weaknesses but there doesn't have to be any unkindness in seeing their

204
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:52,000
weaknesses and so when we view ourselves and um we do have weaknesses you know

205
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,520
that's we practice that's what we practice because we're we still have greed hatred and delusion that's why we

206
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:05,760
practice so it's there so do we need to um can we be discerning about it oh yeah

207
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:12,319
that that that jud that quality of mind that um that way that I didn't do things

208
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:19,440
the way I wanted to do them um you know that's what happened and if it hurts I

209
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,560
can bring compassion um but there's no need for that meanness

210
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:30,880
of judgment that harshness of judgment and not to push away when it

211
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:37,280
happens you know we can be uh kind about our judging

212
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:44,079
mind you know and and lastly of the of the patterns I want to mention regrets

213
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:51,520
Because sometimes we dwell on painful things from the past and they come up over and over can be a very very deep

214
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:56,640
habit that darkens our minds and when they're painful memories

215
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:04,240
can we bring kindness and compassion to the pain of the regret this is dooka you know even

216
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:13,119
though it happened 20 years ago it's still it's dooka right now when we remember it it's pain it's painful and

217
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:18,640
when we're hurting we deserve compassion and

218
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:27,520
kindness so lastly I want to say um you know most thoughts come and go uh and

219
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:33,760
they're just ephemeral we just they just go away very very quickly we can't hold

220
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:40,640
on to it it's gone before we know it incredibly brief but repetitive thinking patterns

221
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:47,280
are sticky they don't flow easily if we continue with it it gets stronger the

222
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:53,440
more we do it the more it's easy to do it but we can attend to those when they

223
00:46:53,440 --> 00:47:02,560
show up with care and with kindness and maybe we can ask if it's true if it's helpful if it's kind if

224
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:09,720
it's timely so I'll just end with

225
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:16,040
um my wishes for all of us may this SA be filled with loving

226
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:21,400
kindness may we be happy may we be

227
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:27,480
peaceful may we be free may our good will spread to

228
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:34,839
all beings everywhere thank you
