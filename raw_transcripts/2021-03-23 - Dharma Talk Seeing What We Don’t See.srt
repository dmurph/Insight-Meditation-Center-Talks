1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,199
so

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:08,000
good evening or night or morning

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,639
i think many of us know that the essence

4
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,480
of mindfulness practice

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,680
is to notice things in our experience

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,720
and when we first start paying attention

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,519
to our body and our emotions and our

8
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:26,720
thoughts

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,279
we discover all kinds of things that

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,480
were

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,640
there anyway but that we weren't

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,680
noticing before

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,040
sometimes people tell me

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,480
that they wish they hadn't started

15
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,040
mindfulness practice because

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,920
as soon as they started looking they saw

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,520
some things that they

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,000
didn't want to see or you know weren't

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,160
so excited about seeing

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,680
various speech or actions going on that

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,360
maybe they didn't want to know that they

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,079
were doing but i tend to take this with

23
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:00,879
a

24
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,000
a bit of a grain of salt a bit lightly

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,479
because i think people really really do

26
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,439
want to see

27
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,960
these things about themselves

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,720
and as we as we practice further

29
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,240
we may start to notice that we have

30
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,560
a favorite set of storylines

31
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,270
and ways of thinking and

32
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,920
[Music]

33
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,600
habits of speech that we use in our life

34
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,720
for example

35
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,320
we could call all these things patterns

36
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,520
you know we have various patterns that

37
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,640
come frequently in our experience

38
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,360
it's quite common that we see that and

39
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,479
often

40
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,680
there's a sense that these kind of are

41
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,159
going on their own you know because they

42
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:52,799
were there

43
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,280
before we were noticing them so they

44
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,159
have they run

45
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,280
on their own under certain conditions

46
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,399
okay and often

47
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,159
what they're about is rehearsing

48
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,679
and refining and reinforcing

49
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,400
uh the story of our life or the story of

50
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:12,959
me

51
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,280
if you will so this aspect of our

52
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,040
experience is what could be called

53
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,040
samsara in buddhism there's this

54
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,160
term samsara that means these

55
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,680
habitual karmic kinds of patterns that

56
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,440
are going on in the background

57
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,519
pretty much by themselves many of them

58
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,800
are a form of dukkha because effectively

59
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,160
they're just reactive

60
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,319
they they're just going on in the

61
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,519
background

62
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,280
they tend to deviate from what's

63
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,519
actually unfolding in experience and

64
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,480
and kind of take on a life of their own

65
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,519
like when something happens and we start

66
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,239
it reminds us of a challenge that we're

67
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,840
having and suddenly we're no longer

68
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,840
paying attention to what's happening

69
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,000
we've moved into our thoughts about oh

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,159
that's like that difficulty and then we

71
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,879
go off on that and we've deviated from

72
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,480
the present moment

73
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,000
that's how we often discover these

74
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,920
things in meditation is there the ways

75
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,959
that we

76
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,400
fall away from present moment

77
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,680
mindfulness so that's essentially

78
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,920
a kind of dukkha of being disconnected

79
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,879
from

80
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,920
the ongoing flow of experience and these

81
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,319
have

82
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,120
um they're said to have a deadening

83
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,400
effect on the mind

84
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,200
tamapada verse 21 says

85
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,599
the heedless or those who are not paying

86
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,680
attention the hebrews are as if

87
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,280
already dead wow so we're starting out

88
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,720
on kind of a

89
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,040
you know

90
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,599
the part of mindfulness that isn't as

91
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,080
attractive but i want to then say oh

92
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,159
the other thing that we'll notice as we

93
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,519
start practicing

94
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,599
and we'll notice it more and more

95
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,599
because it's enabled through mindfulness

96
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,480
practice

97
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,120
is that we aren't only reacting there

98
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,239
are actions

99
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,239
that are more in the realm of freedom

100
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,840
they're unique in the moment responses

101
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,519
to what's happening

102
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,079
that come from paying attention so we

103
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,440
start to see more and more

104
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,240
also as we practice mindfulness that

105
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,800
there is a freshness and an aliveness

106
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,160
to the way we meet the moment

107
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,120
the mind can be vibrant alive connected

108
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,720
to what's going on

109
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,800
sometimes we surprise ourselves that we

110
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,160
say something

111
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,520
quite wise simply because we were paying

112
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,479
attention

113
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,759
more carefully than we had been up till

114
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,800
now

115
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,240
so it's quite um kind of exciting to see

116
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,240
those things to know that the mind has

117
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,960
this

118
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,520
capacity to really meet experience some

119
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,199
of the time

120
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,600
so it's important in our practice to

121
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,680
start being able to discern the

122
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,440
difference between what we could call

123
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,720
pattern behavior and free behavior so

124
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,800
we start to learn what it feels like

125
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,560
when the mind is just

126
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,880
doing its habitual thing and what it

127
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,600
feels like

128
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,160
when it's um attentive and responsive

129
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,039
and

130
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,280
doing things that are appropriate to the

131
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,600
to the situation

132
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,520
so then we start seeing that there's

133
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,639
that contrast

134
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,680
those are the sort of two main ways that

135
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,960
we could operate

136
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,000
then we might start to get curious what

137
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,080
am i not seeing so you know what

138
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,800
what i'm not seeing could hold me back

139
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,720
you know what i'm not paying attention

140
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,120
to

141
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,120
these patterns that run and i don't

142
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,400
notice when they slip

143
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,039
in so i can start to wonder what am i

144
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,160
missing here

145
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,440
or how can i see what i don't see

146
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,120
it's the question i want to address

147
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,960
tonight how can we learn to see

148
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,680
what it is that we're not seeing about

149
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,319
our

150
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,440
speech actions thoughts the very things

151
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,560
that mindfulness was

152
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,880
intended to see we weren't seeing

153
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,880
certain things before we started what

154
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,960
else might we not be seeing at this

155
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,600
point

156
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,280
so it's an interesting question in

157
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,639
spiritual practice

158
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,600
how could we see what we're not seeing

159
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,840
so this is the realm of ignorance

160
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,639
ignorance isn't some kind of stupidity

161
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,160
or something or we didn't

162
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,039
read enough or learn enough about it

163
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,960
ignorance is what we're ignoring

164
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,240
it's what we're habitually not seeing

165
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,840
and so um it's difficult to let go of

166
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,319
things that we don't even know are there

167
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,600
we can sometimes but often it's helpful

168
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,919
if we're able to have some way

169
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,080
of directing our mind toward being able

170
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,120
to see

171
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,120
the things that we're not seeing of

172
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,720
course there are plenty of times when

173
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,400
what we're not seeing will come and find

174
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,120
us

175
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,280
you don't have to worry it will that

176
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,720
will happen but

177
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,840
it can be interesting to have some

178
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,599
techniques for looking into what it is

179
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,440
that we may not be seeing

180
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,479
so i want to offer three places tonight

181
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,840
that we can look for

182
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,360
what we're not seeing to see what we

183
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,199
don't see

184
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,479
okay so the first one is

185
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,240
to take the direct approach and

186
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,080
literally try to notice

187
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,440
things that we have not been noticing so

188
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,560
we can try to identify areas that we're

189
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,639
not paying attention to

190
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,199
sometimes it's possible to literally ask

191
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,479
about this

192
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,560
to spiritual friends there's there's a

193
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,960
wonderful story in the sutures

194
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,240
that's a conversation between two monks

195
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,599
between aniruddha and sariputa

196
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,000
who are friends they've been practicing

197
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,319
together for a long time

198
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,680
and anuruddha comments to sarikuta

199
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,639
that he knows that he has attained

200
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,000
clairvoyance

201
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,080
and he has excellent energy and

202
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,440
concentration

203
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,560
and yet he is not awakened

204
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,879
so this may not be the realm that we're

205
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,240
practicing in but

206
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,479
this is where anuruddha was so even when

207
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,400
you're close to awakening you may still

208
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,080
know that you don't know things

209
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,000
and so he's kind of puzzled you know he

210
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,759
comes to sariputta and he says i know

211
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,840
i'm not seeing something i've got

212
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,000
all this good stuff happening in my

213
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,960
practice

214
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,520
and yet i'm not awakened you know what

215
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,319
is it that's

216
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,319
going on and so sorry puta is a good

217
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,759
spiritual friend

218
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,839
and he deftly points out that anuruda's

219
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,599
attitude toward his accomplishments is

220
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,680
revealing certain things about his mind

221
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,120
so for example he's

222
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,039
revealing that his mind still contains

223
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,200
some conceit and some restlessness

224
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,959
and some remorse and so it would be good

225
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,600
if he would abandon these things and so

226
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,519
anuruda is grateful that his friend

227
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,000
pointed

228
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,240
out what he was not seeing and he

229
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,839
practices in line with that

230
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,640
and becomes an arahant becomes awakened

231
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,279
as these

232
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,320
stories go but it's it's kind of a sweet

233
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,399
suit up because it demonstrates

234
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,240
that one of the things that our

235
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,760
spiritual friends can do

236
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,200
for us is that they might be able to see

237
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,240
what we haven't yet let go of and find

238
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,279
the right way to

239
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,720
encourage us so it can be useful

240
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,240
at the right time of course to reveal

241
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,320
to our spiritual friends where we think

242
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,360
we're stuck

243
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,160
and actually ask for some advice about

244
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,640
that

245
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,279
you can do this with teachers also so

246
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,240
that's kind of the direct approach

247
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,800
it may also be that we sometimes have to

248
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,680
try to discern what we're not noticing

249
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,480
in a more indirect way and we can do

250
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,200
that

251
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,640
by just observing what other people

252
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,120
are noticing like our teacher our

253
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,320
friends our partner

254
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,760
our colleagues i'll give an example

255
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,399
there was a time very early in my

256
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,320
practice when i was at a

257
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,360
buddhist gathering and there was a cart

258
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,480
being passed around the group for a

259
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,640
sangha member who was ill

260
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,560
and the group wanted to support her by

261
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,079
sending her a card

262
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,920
so i didn't i was pretty new to the

263
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,200
group i didn't really know

264
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,480
all the people but i remember thinking

265
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,200
that

266
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,040
uh noticing that this was nice

267
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,560
you know and thinking oh this is the

268
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,040
kind of group that sends cards to people

269
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,720
and i thought about the person a little

270
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,240
bit that i knew her

271
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,640
and so i was kind of on a pragmatic

272
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,560
practical level like that that was what

273
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,000
i noticed about the

274
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,399
situation and then as the card was

275
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,680
passed around

276
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,440
um one of the people in the group um

277
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,800
looked at the card and exclaimed with um

278
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,440
put her her hand to her heart and said

279
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,360
this is such a beautiful buddha

280
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,760
on this card it was like she was really

281
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,079
touched by the beautiful buddha image

282
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,720
that was on the card and i realized at

283
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,440
that moment

284
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,600
card had already gone by me that i

285
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,760
hadn't even really noticed the picture

286
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,640
on the card i just i didn't even look at

287
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,519
that

288
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,240
aspect of it and so i was intrigued that

289
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,920
she had seen this

290
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,440
and maybe at that time i was pretty new

291
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,959
to practice i don't know that i would

292
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,959
have called a buddha image beautiful

293
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,800
you know it was a buddha but i would

294
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,399
recognize it but

295
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,079
but to sort of put my hand to my heart

296
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,760
and say it was beautiful

297
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,440
i don't know that i would have done that

298
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,880
and so that

299
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,880
um kind of that little incident was one

300
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,800
of the triggers for

301
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,360
an investigation in my own practice into

302
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,120
the quality of faith

303
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,800
which is something that i had not been

304
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,120
paying really any attention to it sort

305
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,200
of wasn't my style

306
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,399
but because of that i wondered you know

307
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,320
what am i missing here and so i looked

308
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,240
into that and i i learned quite a bit

309
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,639
about faith by trying to open to it

310
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,040
and now i have this buddha which i think

311
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,480
is very beautiful

312
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,680
so things change over time

313
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,760
when we notice new things so this is um

314
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,079
important to be intrigued by what other

315
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,279
people notice that we don't notice

316
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,399
so that's one area where we can

317
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,800
look is you know what is it that i'm not

318
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,279
noticing

319
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,160
so then the second area that we might

320
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,600
look at

321
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,880
is what we don't question

322
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,720
okay well we don't question so this has

323
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,160
two different aspects to it the first

324
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,440
is there might be areas

325
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,560
where we simply don't think to question

326
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,920
more deeply

327
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,600
you know it's like we just don't think

328
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,200
to ask any questions

329
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,720
and again there's a story in the suntes

330
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,880
there's a story about an elderly man

331
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,399
whose name was nakula pita

332
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,399
and he comes to see the buddha

333
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,200
and he points out to the buddha when he

334
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,920
arrives

335
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,120
that it's quite a rare event

336
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,200
for him to be able to come and see the

337
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,240
buddha

338
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,800
so he says i am old venerable sir

339
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,240
aged burdened with years advanced in

340
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:16,959
life

341
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,399
come to the last stage afflicted in body

342
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,519
often ill i rarely get to see

343
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,320
the blessed one and the biggus worthy of

344
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,839
esteem

345
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,720
the monks worthy of esteem let the

346
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,600
blessed one

347
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,480
exhort me venerable sir let him instruct

348
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,120
me

349
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,279
since that would lead to my welfare and

350
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,600
happiness for a long time

351
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,560
so it's special for him to get to see

352
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,440
the buddha

353
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,839
and because he's kind of old and often

354
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,440
sick and it's probably hard for him to

355
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,720
get there

356
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,240
so the buddha first of all agrees with

357
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,800
him

358
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,680
that this is indeed a rare event and he

359
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,240
gives him a teaching so the buddha says

360
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,360
so it is householder so it is

361
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,399
this body of yours is afflicted weighed

362
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,279
down

363
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,399
encumbered if anyone carrying around

364
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,360
this body

365
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,519
were to claim to be healthy even for a

366
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,560
moment

367
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,040
what is that due to other than

368
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,320
foolishness

369
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,959
it's quite straightforward so then he

370
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:19,440
says

371
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,600
therefore householder you should train

372
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,279
yourself thus

373
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,480
even though i am afflicted in body my

374
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,639
mind will be unafflicted

375
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,760
thus you should train yourself so he

376
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,199
gives a pretty concise

377
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,519
teaching even though i'm afflicted in

378
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,600
body my mind will be unafflicted

379
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,680
it's a great teaching by the way one

380
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,320
that can be unfolded for a long time

381
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,839
and so nakula it is said delighted

382
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,360
in the teaching of the buddha he was

383
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,480
very happy and he departs

384
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,600
and then later as he's leaving um

385
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,720
he comes across sarikuta the same monk

386
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,040
who was uh giving anuruda advice

387
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,800
in the last example and he comes upon

388
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,160
sorry putta who comments how he looks

389
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,600
very serene

390
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,920
and you know wow householder your

391
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,279
faculties are serene he says and

392
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,519
says oh yes and he repeats his whole

393
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,519
conversation with the buddha

394
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,120
and sorry puta admonishes him

395
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,240
actually and he says didn't it occur to

396
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,519
you householder

397
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,160
to question the blessed one further as

398
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,560
to

399
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,519
how one is afflicted in body and mind

400
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:31,839
and

401
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,440
how one is afflicted in body but not

402
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,759
afflicted in mind

403
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,160
didn't you think to ask what it means to

404
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:40,959
be

405
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,759
afflicted or unafflicted in mind when

406
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,519
your body is afflicted

407
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,199
and nikula peta says well um

408
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,560
no i didn't think to ask that actually

409
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,880
and so then he um asks for further

410
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,040
instruction from sariputa

411
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,079
so uh which sorry puta then

412
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,639
gives a whole discourse on unfolding the

413
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,240
the meaning of this very

414
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,920
concise teaching that the buddha gave so

415
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,320
um

416
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,759
it may be that um there are areas of the

417
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,440
teachings where we're just sort of

418
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,680
passively taking them in

419
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,240
but we are actually meant to engage with

420
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,600
the teachings

421
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,320
and either by literally asking questions

422
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,399
or by at least investigating in our

423
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,399
practice and trying them out and

424
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,480
hoping and prodding and seeing if they

425
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,880
work and how they work for us

426
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,240
so we're not really meant to

427
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,600
let's say swallow things whole um

428
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,120
and that doesn't mean that we need to be

429
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,880
asking questions all the time you know

430
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,519
things do

431
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,199
unfold at their own pace um but it's

432
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,120
you know there might be areas where we

433
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,360
have some some question you know we

434
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,000
never really

435
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,199
understood that teaching about dependent

436
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,240
origination

437
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,720
or not really sure what not self is

438
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,120
about

439
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,600
you know instead of continuing to just

440
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,920
hear these teachings we could

441
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,319
ask some questions about them dig a

442
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,160
little deeper sometimes

443
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,880
so sometimes what we don't question can

444
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,520
reveal

445
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,640
areas that we have not been paying very

446
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,760
much attention to

447
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,760
in our practice then there's a deeper

448
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,558
or a second aspect of what we don't

449
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,839
question

450
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,280
and that points toward the assumptions

451
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,120
that we're living by which can be

452
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,200
serious blocks in our practice and

453
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,039
they're very hard to see

454
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,039
it's actually quite hard to see the

455
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,960
assumptions that we're living by

456
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,640
you know the kind of the lenses that we

457
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,919
have over our eyes over our practice

458
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,160
over our way of being in the world there

459
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,280
are certain things that we're just

460
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,840
not questioning about that so

461
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,640
assumptions

462
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,520
lurk in generally in our thinking and in

463
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:55,760
our

464
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,880
interpretation of events

465
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,840
and one way that we can reveal them is

466
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,160
to

467
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,559
ask questions so i'm going to give i'll

468
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,480
give a specific

469
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,640
example suppose that we are

470
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,039
angry about something and we could

471
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,520
you know it's fairly common that we get

472
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,440
irritated at least or sometimes we

473
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,039
actually get angry about something and

474
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,080
we know that

475
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,160
you know that's something that's really

476
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,600
bothering us

477
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,919
and so we could just say mindfulness of

478
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:28,640
anger

479
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,679
anger feel it in the body

480
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,160
anger and then wait for it to go away

481
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,600
eventually

482
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,360
but we could also do some some

483
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,679
investigation of that and we might

484
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,679
you know we might look a little bit more

485
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,600
carefully or of course what we might do

486
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,760
is just justify the anger and say well

487
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,679
i don't have to look into that anger

488
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,840
that's obviously justified that person

489
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,600
is clearly in the wrong that social

490
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,160
situation is clearly unjust

491
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,919
no need to question further however

492
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,120
if you're interested here's a um

493
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,760
a train of thinking and asking that can

494
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,760
be quite revealing

495
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,799
so if we're angry we are typically

496
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,600
in opposition to something that's kind

497
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,520
of what the state of anger is about it's

498
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,960
an opposition

499
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,799
so we may not even know what or we may

500
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,080
or why we assume that that's useful so

501
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,960
when we're feeling angry or oppositional

502
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,960
it can be interesting to ask

503
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,840
a set of three questions so the first

504
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,240
one

505
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,240
is what am i opposing

506
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,000
and it might be that we think sort of

507
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,679
casually think that we know what we're

508
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,919
opposing i'm opposing my sister

509
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,400
or something but it's not exactly your

510
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
whole sister that you're opposing

511
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,080
what precisely is it that you're

512
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,600
opposing and

513
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,919
look a little bit more carefully and

514
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,240
then um

515
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,160
you'll check into that and then the

516
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,240
second question is

517
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,600
do i need to oppose it

518
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,640
so i need to oppose that

519
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,360
so then that calls into a question this

520
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,120
stance of opposition

521
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,720
it doesn't say that you're not going to

522
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,559
do anything or that you should approve

523
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:10,960
of it

524
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,559
instead it only says do i need to oppose

525
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,520
it

526
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,240
which then just automatically opens up

527
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,720
oh

528
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,360
might there be other responses or might

529
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,400
there be

530
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,520
other avenues to bring about

531
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,559
what i would like to see changed

532
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,799
as opposed to as opposed to opposition

533
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,799
so you know might there be other

534
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,320
possibilities

535
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,960
for this situation we hadn't ever

536
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,640
questioned that we might not have ever

537
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,559
thought there was any option besides

538
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,360
simply

539
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,520
opposing this thing that i don't like

540
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,000
that is unpleasant

541
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,200
so then the third question

542
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,200
is opposing even called for here

543
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,640
you might still think that you need to

544
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,360
oppose it is opposing even called for

545
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,400
here

546
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,080
so then we're sort of calling into

547
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,520
question whether

548
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:09,440
opposing could have uh positive results

549
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,840
usually opposing creates more conflict

550
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,720
actually

551
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,320
that tends to be its nature

552
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,280
so these questions can help to you know

553
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,720
they're not meant to

554
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,559
say that you're wrong or that the other

555
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,080
person is actually

556
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,200
good or that you know the whole there

557
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,559
doesn't need to be anything

558
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,960
done it's just a way of teasing into

559
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,039
what we might not be questioning

560
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,679
about our way of being in the world we

561
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:36,799
could do this in

562
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,200
all kinds of i picked out anger but all

563
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,400
kinds of dukkha so cases of desire

564
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,360
what am i desiring do i need to desire

565
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,000
it

566
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,440
is desiring even called for here

567
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,559
or cases of confusion or other

568
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,200
such things any kind of dukkha really so

569
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,200
don't be satisfied with surface answers

570
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,159
to these questions

571
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,919
and kind of see if you can go deeper

572
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,600
so another approach that people have

573
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,880
to discovering about their thinking

574
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,360
is a set of repeating questions

575
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,559
so you can ask why is that

576
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,240
important if you think something is

577
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,679
important it's up you're

578
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,320
obsessing about it thinking about it i

579
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,000
can ask why is that important

580
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,360
and you'll get an answer and it's

581
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,240
probably true but then you ask

582
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,039
and why is that important and you'll get

583
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,640
another answer

584
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,360
and you ask and why is that important

585
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,400
and it

586
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,679
draws the mind down toward the values

587
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:40,080
that we

588
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,880
have and what it is that is really

589
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,200
important to us in that situation

590
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,080
and that can help a lot in understanding

591
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,919
first of all how we're thinking about

592
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,039
situation and what it is that's really

593
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,360
driving that obsessive thinking we can

594
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,120
learn a lot about our practice and our

595
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,720
mind

596
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,159
some things that we weren't noticing

597
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,159
before

598
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,440
so we have what we don't notice

599
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,600
but we don't question and then the third

600
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,760
way of approaching seeing what we don't

601
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,720
see

602
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,159
is what we don't laugh about

603
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,200
so what we don't find funny tends to

604
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,320
reveal where our identity is invested

605
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,919
it is not that everything should be

606
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,760
humorous but

607
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,880
if we can't find any lightness in some

608
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,840
area

609
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,480
it's worth investigating to see if

610
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,320
there's some kind of sticking point

611
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,440
there for us it's likely a place where

612
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,960
we're identified

613
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,480
the buddha points out in um similarly of

614
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,039
the snake suta majima 22

615
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,640
that any form of identification

616
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,919
is dukkha it will eventually

617
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,720
bring dukkha that may or may not be

618
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,679
clear to us

619
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,720
but it's worth investigating these areas

620
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,200
that we

621
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,960
can't find anything light or humorous in

622
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,200
so it's very worthwhile to develop a

623
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,080
sense of humor

624
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,640
in our practice many things in the mind

625
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,080
are actually kind of funny

626
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,880
including many of our patterns we can

627
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,480
have a little lightness and say uh

628
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,240
there's that one again yes

629
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,960
um that can be very helpful sylvia

630
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,320
borstein says

631
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,799
that we need three things in practice

632
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,159
gentleness

633
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,840
precision and humor and i think she's on

634
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,720
to something

635
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,799
you know we need to be so gentle with

636
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,559
this habituated

637
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,000
stressed mind but also precise

638
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,760
about questioning its assumptions

639
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,919
and in the end we have to find it

640
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:44,960
somewhat humorous

641
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,159
about how recalcitrant it is to be

642
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:48,880
changed

643
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,559
and how tricky it is about reasserting

644
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,600
its

645
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,880
graspings and identity we don't have a

646
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,320
sense of humor we may not have the

647
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,080
patience to

648
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,159
continue to work with the mind

649
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,159
there's a wonderful there was a

650
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,760
wonderful 20th century

651
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,679
thai forest teacher named ajahn

652
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,360
bhunatasa

653
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,880
who was a boxer before he became a monk

654
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,640
so that was his first profession is that

655
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,640
he was a professional boxer

656
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,760
and then he ordained and he um practiced

657
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,840
for a while and eventually he became a

658
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,360
well-known teacher and had his own

659
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,640
monastery and

660
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,480
trained a lot of people including some

661
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,360
of the western teachers that we now have

662
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,520
in our tradition here

663
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,039
and but because he was a boxer earlier

664
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,679
he retained a somewhat belliger

665
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:40,320
belligerent

666
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,039
heir let's say about him so he could

667
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,400
sometimes come across

668
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,760
as rough or blunt he didn't really

669
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,559
oppose

670
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,320
in the way that i was just talking about

671
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,000
in the previous example

672
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,240
but still he had that kind of roughness

673
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,440
about him

674
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,720
and sometimes um sometimes people would

675
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,720
take offense at it in certain ways and

676
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,520
think that

677
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,679
a spiritual teacher should only be kind

678
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,600
and gentle and warm and

679
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,840
so forth and if somebody challenged his

680
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,360
demeanor sometimes

681
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,760
autumn budadasa would just roar with

682
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,720
laughter

683
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,159
and he would say oh that's just my

684
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,520
personality

685
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,640
so he had learned in his own heart to

686
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,960
make peace with just the way

687
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,600
his mind was still kind of a boxer in

688
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,360
certain ways now he was of course quite

689
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,320
free inside

690
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,640
and wasn't caught up in that identity

691
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,200
but he recognized that his personality

692
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,120
still had that and had a certain amount

693
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,960
of likeness about

694
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,360
just how he was that that air and that

695
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,840
helped other people to lighten up then

696
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,840
you know if they were concerned about

697
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,840
that and he just laughed and

698
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,880
was gentle about it then they would say

699
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,679
oh okay

700
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,120
it's just his personality

701
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,360
so i teach from the suttas fairly

702
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,200
frequently and

703
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,440
one thing that i look for in people as

704
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,840
they develop in their practice and

705
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,840
in their study is sometimes or often

706
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,360
there will be a point where people

707
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,159
realize that the sutas are hilarious

708
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,080
some of them some of the suitors are

709
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,360
hilarious

710
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,039
you get to the point where you can

711
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,039
imagine the scene

712
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,880
going on and there's somebody asking

713
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,399
this question or

714
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,000
questioning the buddha in a certain way

715
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,840
or misunderstanding what he's saying in

716
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,799
a certain way

717
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,559
you just you can just imagine the scene

718
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,320
you think ah

719
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,640
wow you know it must have been funny to

720
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,600
be there

721
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,120
so i thought about trying to give an

722
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,200
example of this but then i decided that

723
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,399
it's something that we really have to

724
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,080
come to on our own

725
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,840
but if you've never thought of the

726
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,679
polycannon as funny

727
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,799
i recommend trying it and and just

728
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,320
seeing some of the lightness in the

729
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,080
exchanges that the buddha has

730
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,960
with people so it's clear to me at least

731
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,559
that the people who compiled the

732
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,159
discourses

733
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,559
had some sense of humor and how it got

734
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,240
presented

735
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,520
so we've talked tonight about

736
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,559
trying to have some way of seeing what

737
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,440
we don't see

738
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,159
of opening up our practice so that we

739
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,200
can notice

740
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,320
more which is what mindfulness is about

741
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,039
it's about noticing more things noticing

742
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,320
different things

743
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,240
seeing the mind in different ways so

744
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,159
that we can continue to

745
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,279
untangle the knots that com that

746
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,240
bind our heart in various ways so

747
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,640
looking into what we don't notice

748
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,200
looking into what we don't question and

749
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,880
looking into what we don't

750
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,080
laugh about can be wonderful ways

751
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,240
of broadening and also deepening

752
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,399
our practice and also keeping it fresh

753
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:45,679
and alive

754
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,399
so this is talk is especially if you're

755
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,480
feeling a little stale in your practice

756
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,480
or like it's always the same or you're a

757
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,399
little stuck or dry

758
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,159
we go through periods like that it's

759
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:57,520
normal but

760
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,360
it's good to have some ways of finding

761
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,200
new areas of the mind to to look into

762
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,399
so i hope this is giving you some some

763
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,720
sense of that

764
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,679
i wish you a very good evening and

765
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,000
ongoing practice

766
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:24,240
well everyone
