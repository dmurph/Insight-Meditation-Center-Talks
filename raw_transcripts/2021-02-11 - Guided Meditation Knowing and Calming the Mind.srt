1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:08,639
so warm greetings everyone and welcome to our meditation time

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:16,160
and now one of the principles of mindfulness meditation

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:23,760
is or one of the potentials is to be equanimously mindful

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:32,078
of everything that no matter what the experience we're having it's possible to have a relaxed calm

5
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:39,040
clear recognition that this is happening and in relationship to mental activity

6
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:47,039
the topic of this week thinking uh mindfulness meditation is

7
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:54,079
not making an enemy of our thinking it's not uh condemning it to some place where

8
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:01,600
it's not supposed to exist at all and we're supposed to get rid of it it certainly can calm down thinking and

9
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,640
it's quite nice to have it become quieter and stiller sometimes there seems to be

10
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,000
thinking stops entirely and it can be very peaceful but that's not necessarily

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,119
the point the point of mindfulness meditation is to see clearly without being for or against

12
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:26,000
the experience being for and against that's uh

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,520
you know that that is a different capacity of the mind it's a different function of the mind

14
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:38,000
that sometimes has a role and sometimes doesn't but for mindfulness itself it's just a

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,000
simple being present for our experience so with that as an introduction

16
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,280
nist maybe just close your eyes as you are and think that the principle for

17
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,040
mindfulness meditation is that you're allowed to come as you

18
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:07,280
are to come as you are meditation and and so when you sit and close your

19
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:15,520
eyes one of the possibilities is begin first by just noticing how you are

20
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:23,840
without any effort to meditate just notice how you are right now

21
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:31,680
what's happening for you and your body what's happening for you

22
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,959
in your heart and what's happening for you in your mind

23
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,160
and to

24
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,720
particular for the purposes of today

25
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:04,080
without any idea to be any different notice your thinking

26
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,879
allow yourself to think whatever you have to be thinking but just to become aware of it be

27
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:16,840
curious a simple recognition of what you're

28
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,840
thinking

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,799
maybe a little bit as if you could step away step backward a few steps

30
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,400
and then turn around to look at yourself look at your mind

31
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:46,319
as if it's thinking

32
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:53,360
thinking in words thinking in images sometimes just that clear recognition

33
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,640
and allowance to think

34
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:05,360
the thinking quiets down or even stop sometimes it'll come back so just take your time

35
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,159
and notice how it is

36
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:17,439
and notice the energy of thinking the pull of it

37
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,519
is it strong is it weak

38
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,400
do you have an attitude about your thinking

39
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:43,600
are you do you relate to your thoughts as if they're

40
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:51,759
you know you relate to them in a friendly way in a hostile way

41
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,840
in different ways

42
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:11,440
and what it would be like to neither be friendly nor hostile

43
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:19,520
and certainly not indifferent just present and seeing

44
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,560
in the way that you would maybe look at walking down the street

45
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:35,600
you might look at a tree here look up in the sky and watch clouds

46
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,840
sail by

47
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,240
and is there any physical sensations connected to thinking

48
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,800
is there pressure or attention

49
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,879
contraction

50
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:09,199
is it the experience not what you're thinking about but the

51
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:15,600
experience of thinking in and of itself as an experience as something that

52
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:22,560
this has sensations or you can feel it in some way

53
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:35,840
is it pleasant or unpleasant

54
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,240
and now thinking of thinking of thoughts you're thinking imagine your

55
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,160
thinking are like bubbles thought bubbles

56
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:01,360
take a deep full breath as you exhale let those bubbles float

57
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,840
away

58
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:17,840
deep breath in relaxing the mental activity

59
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,919
relaxing the pressure and tension

60
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,720
and now continue thinking

61
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:42,960
as the mind wants to think but can you think in quieter ways

62
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,520
can you think with a quieter voice or calmer images

63
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:56,240
maybe you let the images recede a little bit further away from you

64
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,319
or they slow down the quieter thoughts

65
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:09,680
slower thoughts adjusting the volume and the speed of

66
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,840
your thinking

67
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:32,240
and then instead of letting yourself think whatever you wish to think about

68
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,479
choose what you think about and what i'd suggest is you choose to

69
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:44,399
think instructions for meditation

70
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,920
maybe i'll give you some now you can repeat them to yourself

71
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:57,199
in a quiet calm thinking or you might have variations

72
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,120
gently softly

73
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:13,680
take a few fuller breaths and as you exhale

74
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:23,839
relax your body

75
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:36,160
as you exhale softening the shoulders

76
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,839
releasing the shoulders

77
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,839
as you exhale softening the belly

78
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,839
letting your breathing return to normal

79
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:21,360
as you exhale soften the muscles of your face

80
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:33,839
around the eyes and the forehead

81
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:45,200
and soften what can be softened in the area of your brain

82
00:10:45,200 --> 00:11:01,839
even if it's softening around the brain

83
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:18,160
and then to settle into the experience of the body breathing

84
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,720
and for these minutes you'll accompany your breathing

85
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:32,399
maybe imagining that your you and your breathing are walking along

86
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,519
holding hands so there's continuous contact between

87
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,959
awareness and the breathing breathing

88
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,839
and the awareness

89
00:11:53,440 --> 00:12:00,000
and without leaving the attention to breathing if

90
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,600
while you're breathing mindfully you notice that it's easy to relax the

91
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,839
body more you might do so

92
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:21,279
if you notice that there's a feelings of well-being or contentment or joy

93
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:31,600
allow it to grow mix allow it give it space in your body

94
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:40,560
and if you notice it's possible to relax the mental activity the thinking muscle

95
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:50,839
without leaving your breathing maybe on the exhale relax the mental

96
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:56,079
activity but all along accompanying your

97
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:02,160
breathing awareness and breathing walking along

98
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,839
hand in hand

99
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:09,839
softening your thinking slowing your thinking down

100
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:18,480
quieting your thinking and with your thinking quieter

101
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:25,199
maybe it's easier to relax the mental activity

102
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:37,839
the drive the push the pressure

103
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,720
an image for relaxing the mental activity

104
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,720
is that of a flower bud that goes from being tightly closed

105
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:37,840
to opening up wide so the inside of the petals

106
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:47,919
open to the wide open sky in space so we relax the mind

107
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:56,639
and intuit or feel the vastness of quiet space

108
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,480
all around

109
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:12,000
and in that space we stay rooted in the breathing

110
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:21,840
relaxed and open receiving the experience of breathing

111
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:13,200
maybe you can assume that for these next minutes there's nothing that you need to think

112
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:20,480
about even though you might think there's no need to

113
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,280
no need to invest any importance in your thinking

114
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,840
and there might be a greater contentment available

115
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:45,600
by dropping into your body to feel what is more tender and soft and

116
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,600
open in your body

117
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,000
the quiet still place within

118
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:05,840
through which you could be breathing from which you can be breathing

119
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,640
thinking can be a powerful storm

120
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:15,440
howling wind and thinking can be a soft breeze

121
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:22,720
a soft refreshing breeze that lightly moves through us

122
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,440
and with the lightest softest

123
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:36,960
maybe almost insubstantial or imperceptible thoughts

124
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:44,960
have thoughts of good will for others

125
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:55,679
maybe thoughts of wishing them well wishing them happiness and peace

126
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:03,039
and see how softly is there from a still tender place

127
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:12,880
within that you can silently in your mind atone

128
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:19,919
evoke thoughts ideas wishes of goodwill

129
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:30,159
for others

130
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,320
maybe they're even just half thoughts

131
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:47,279
in a way that opens you up your heart opens you to a care

132
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:59,840
a tender care respect and valuing of others

133
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:05,440
and may a soft quiet tender

134
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:12,480
kind regard for others be something that you touch into

135
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:18,720
throughout the day today it doesn't have to be dramatic

136
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:27,679
it doesn't have to be obvious to others

137
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:35,039
from the quiet place within simple quiet thoughts of well wishing

138
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:43,120
for others and may it be that

139
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:51,519
the benefits of this 30 minutes together meditating

140
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:57,440
may those benefits be shared with others either directly or indirectly knowingly or

141
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,158
unknowingly

142
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:11,360
and may it be that this meditation supports the possibility of others being

143
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:18,559
happy may all beings be happy

144
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:24,320
may all beings be safe

145
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,799
may all beings be peaceful

146
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,840
may all beings be free

147
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,518
you
