1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,679
greeting friends greeting greetings and welcome

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:15,759
so [Music] today we are going to continue our exploration

3
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:22,960
practice first and our exploration of this profound teaching of karma

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:30,000
in in our practice in our um in our daily life in our understanding

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,440
and experientially not as a concept not as fate not as destiny that's been passed down

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,840
magically unexplicably from some unknown past life

7
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,399
but as an empowerment as a way that we can shape and form who we are

8
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,320
so so um

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,359
i'm going to start recording here one moment

10
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,600
there okay so technicalities out of the way so let's

11
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,640
uh let's start sitting together let's start sitting together and i'll

12
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:24,720
say more so i'd like to invite you to to arrive to arrive in your seat

13
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,320
in this moment in time

14
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,439
here

15
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,840
here

16
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,039
inviting awareness to be bright

17
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,920
to be bright

18
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,440
and expansive not as something you do

19
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:30,599
awareness is always on we don't do awareness

20
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,879
but as if

21
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,680
you're landing you're sitting you're resting

22
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:12,440
in knowing of what is here already

23
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,519
aware knowing your intention

24
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:56,519
in this moment why am i here

25
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,320
aware of this body

26
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:32,080
awareness infusing the body

27
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,440
all the nooks and crannies

28
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:51,199
and if and when the awareness knows sensations of tightness

29
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,960
holding it engages with the intention

30
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,479
to release to relax

31
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,919
to let go

32
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:27,680
knowing that a relaxed body allows

33
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,479
for a relaxed spacious mind

34
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,960
letting there be bright awareness of the breath

35
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:20,120
being received in the abdomen calming soothing settling

36
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:29,960
stabilizing [Music] connecting and rooting us to the earth

37
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,960
what kind of intention is operating in this moment

38
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:20,440
what kind of intending for the actions in the mind

39
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,240
and heart

40
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:48,680
and what kinds of actions of the mind and heart are actually being performed

41
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,519
and remember thoughts are actions

42
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,839
of the mind

43
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:40,480
and if we realize that the intentions or actions

44
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:49,279
of the mind in this moment are not what we really would like to create

45
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:56,160
for this being who is me what we want to create form

46
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:03,399
make form formations

47
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,920
our only chance is through awareness

48
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:18,560
through mindfulness to know to understand to see

49
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,480
to see and pause

50
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,279
and make a new choice

51
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:51,079
a choice that can shift and change this karma

52
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:47,920
each moment with each action

53
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,240
internally and externally actions of thought

54
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:01,600
speech which may be internal speech the body we form ourselves we shape

55
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,519
ourselves we fashion ourselves

56
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,920
in the future moments to come

57
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,200
if in this moment challenges are arising

58
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,319
can we be kind can we choose to be kind

59
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,160
can we choose to be accepting allowing non-reactive

60
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,880
spacious gentle

61
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,519
loving

62
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:24,600
loving to this body to this heart to this mind

63
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,920
and with whatever rises

64
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,600
gentle gentle

65
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,959
spacious awareness

66
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,320
loving releasing

67
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,720
forming wholesome formations

68
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,839
one breath at a time

69
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,840
if you find your mind has wondered

70
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:53,360
perhaps thinking about thoughts you don't really want to be thinking about

71
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:59,600
not in this moment not period

72
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:07,440
becoming aware and maybe dropping in the question so lovingly to

73
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,280
yourself oh sweetheart sweetheart what are you creating

74
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,799
what are you creating

75
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:25,200
what ossified patterns of the mind are you creating in this moment darling

76
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,320
let go sweetheart let go let's

77
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:36,000
create wholesome moments

78
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,840
wholesome formations

79
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:40,480
if you want to create patterns of kindness then be kind

80
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,600
if you want to form formations

81
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:03,559
patterns of wisdom then be aware

82
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,480
not sleepwalk

83
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,400
in this moment

84
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:12,520
as we approach the end of the sitting

85
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:25,919
can we connect with a desiring with a

86
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:33,760
with an intention for kindness generosity towards ourselves

87
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:41,440
without judgment for whatever rose or did not arise we've done our best

88
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:47,840
given the causes and conditions passed down previously

89
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:54,559
can we create wholesome karma in this moment

so greetings greetings friends friends from around the world this blue

113
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:11,279
planet hi good moment good day lovely to be with

114
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:19,039
you if not in space but in time and if not in time if you're listening later

115
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:25,840
in heart space connect in the heart space of the dharma together

116
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:34,880
so today i would like to continue to share some reflections about karma and

117
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:41,679
i've been weaving some of the reflections in the guided meditation so that we can

118
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:47,760
experiment we can experientially

119
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:55,440
explore this teaching of karma again not as this magical

120
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,960
thing that has been passed down to us but as an empowerment as the way

121
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:09,440
we create we fashion ourselves in the next moment our future selves

122
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:15,599
so this teaching of karma as i mentioned

123
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:23,839
yesterday just a very quick review to remember because repetition helps us

124
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:29,679
remember three parts three intertwined parts of

125
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:37,679
the same thing karma being the decision to do something

126
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:43,839
number one number two the action that carries it out and the action can be

127
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:49,358
the action of the mind of speech and

128
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:54,960
actions of the body and these could be internal external and

129
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:01,680
the third aspect of karma is what is made what we make the result of the action

130
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:07,599
so the intention action itself and what is made

131
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:12,800
and what i mentioned yesterday is that [Music]

132
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,839
in pali this this expression

133
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:26,160
one forms formations one constructs constructions one fabricates

134
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:32,640
fabrications it's so powerful and to think this again in the

135
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:38,320
terms of a a potter in in the suttas

136
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,760
karma is like into a potter creating creating a piece of pottery so

137
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:49,760
that acts of creation intending to create to form to shape

138
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:57,839
and then what is made the pot that then is an ossified karmic relic i love how andrew

139
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:05,280
olenski puts this ossified karmic relic that's put in the kiln and we take forward it's

140
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:12,800
become who we are so what i like to add today well many

141
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:20,320
things but we'll see how how much time we get is um

142
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:28,480
one way one other way perhaps to consider this idea of karma is

143
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:36,800
is that in every moment of course in every moment we are shaping we are fashioning

144
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:43,839
ourselves so for those who have young ones or have

145
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:49,200
had younger ones in your lives children cousins

146
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:55,920
nephews uh nieces the younger ones you know when you care for them you want to send them

147
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:02,640
into the future you want to send them into the future with the best possible gifts

148
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:08,800
so imagine your future self your future self as your child

149
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:15,119
as your most important precious child this being this being who is you

150
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:21,040
whose care is entrusted in you first and foremost

151
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:29,200
you need to care for this being for their well-being for their body brush their teeth comb their hair

152
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:34,560
you know wash their body feed them take them to the dog you know really

153
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:39,599
really take care of this being wouldn't you want to send them into the

154
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:44,240
future the future version of yourself

155
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:50,920
equip them give them the best gifts possible

156
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:58,960
don't you of course of course and the way to do that is what we make

157
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:05,920
what we make for this being who is ourselves what we make what

158
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:12,480
you know what sandwiches do we pack in their lunch box and send it into the future is it junk

159
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,839
food or is it wholesomeness is it wholesomeness what kind of food for the

160
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:25,520
heart do we pack for ourselves for our future selves and that's in the teaching of karma what

161
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:32,320
do we make what do we fashion in this moment with our intentions with our actions

162
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:38,640
again actions of the mind speech internally externally actions of the body in the world

163
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:45,800
and the relic what is made what is created that's sent forward

164
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:52,880
and western thought is often concerned about

165
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:59,680
what we do in the world with our actions to bring about external

166
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:07,839
changes that we intend whereas buddhist thought is equally concerned is equally

167
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:13,040
concerned with how we affect our own well-being with

168
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:19,680
the decisions we make how we are changed by our own actions and

169
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:25,599
this is profound how are we changed by our own actions

170
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,839
so karma is mainly about how we shape ourselves and how we

171
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:36,960
are shaped by ourselves through our actions

172
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:43,280
moving into the future and neuroscience these days of course

173
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:48,640
tells us that our brain is plastic our self is plastic

174
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:54,640
and just as the brain shapes the mind the mind shapes the

175
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:03,040
brain and we and our intentions are conditioned by our dispositions

176
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:09,119
and our dispositions in turn condition our intentions

177
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:15,280
our actions are merely a go between

178
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,920
our intentions and our dispositions

179
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:27,599
i love this this part especially i love how andrew olenski puts this that

180
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:33,200
that our actions are really the go-between because our dispositions again i'll say this

181
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,800
again it's so beautiful our our dispositions

182
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:45,280
[Music] our intentions and our intentions

183
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:51,520
condition our conditioned condition are

184
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:59,200
our disposition so they they both the intentions and dispositions are conditioned by each other by the past

185
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:07,119
uh dispositions and intentions so so okay so you might think okay well wow

186
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:12,400
okay how do we how do i change this how do i change this in the middle of this

187
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:17,680
and that's where awareness mindfulness becomes key

188
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:24,640
becomes key every moment of awareness we have the chance we have the option we

189
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:31,599
have the privilege to shift to change

190
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:36,720
so if you find yourself as i was guiding as i was suggesting in

191
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:43,440
the guided meditation if you find yourself wait wait sweetheart do you really want to be thinking about

192
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:49,440
this you become aware do you really want to be creating this kind of creation

193
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:56,640
form this kind of formation because it will become the tendency of your mind the tendency of your brain the tendency

194
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:03,760
of your heart use whatever frame you want this will become your tendency the more you think about this the more you

195
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:11,040
are this way it will become more and more so sweetheart again not with with anger because you don't want to be

196
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:17,440
creating you don't want to be creating formations of anger

197
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:22,960
formations of hatred for yourself you don't want to be doing that you want to be creating

198
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:29,920
formations of kindness oh sweetheart do we really want to be thinking about this right now is this really good for us for

199
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:36,800
our future software our presence no it isn't all right darling let's let's think about let's let's

200

201
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:47,440
karmic formations let's create some wholesome karmic formations

202
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:54,000
the same not just in meditation but in daily life in the midst of

203
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,359
um whatever is happening say in a moment of anger

204
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:05,119
if it's acted out whether it's acted out it's verbalized or unexpressed and

205
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:10,560
seething you know we're layering a thin layer of anger

206
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:16,319
and and because and more angry disposition is being created

207
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,119
ossified

208
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:28,720
and a moment of kindness a moment of kindness to ourselves

209
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:35,359
