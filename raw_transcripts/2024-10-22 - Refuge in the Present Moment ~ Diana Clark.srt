1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,759
good evening it's nice to see you

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:14,160
all so tonight I want to talk a little bit about there's this way in which we

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,800
can approach our meditation practice in a similar way that we approach

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,240
everything else in our life everything else that we've done with a certain

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,439
amount of striving and like just kind of like goal oriented I got to get this

6
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:35,600
thing I got to get more peace I got to get more freedom I got to get more ease

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:43,360
hurry it's this way there can be a certain amount of pushing I mean of course we we might say

8
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:50,079
of course we are because this is a way in which we can push towards other goals in our lives whether it's professional

9
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:56,359
goals or maybe there's in a time which some academic goals or maybe fitness goals you know all these types of things

10
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:02,480
which we might do and we have a certain amount of

11
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,600
striving but what's a little bit different with the meditation practice

12
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:14,479
is that often with this striving we're not noticing that what's happening is

13
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,040
often there's this measuring that's happening am I there yet have I gotten

14
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,600
there yet am I peaceful yet is this easeful is am I is the Mind settled am I

15
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,680
happy yet there's this certain measuring

16
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,720
and if there's measuring that means you're not there yet so there's always

17
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:42,520
this sense of lack this is subtle but something that's getting reinforced again and again if we have this sense oh

18
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,960
I got to be somewhere else I got to have some other

19
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:55,079
experience like and then suddenly what's happening right then is this is the

20
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:00,479
wrong experience whatever it is because it's not the one that we had in this goal

21
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:09,160
and not only that it can go further it can have this sense of this well there's something wrong with me or the sense of

22
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,599
inadequacy in fact we could say that happens anytime there's a in a recurring

23
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:21,280
measuring of oneself or one's experience and so this having this like

24
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,640
wanting to push towards a goal creates the conditions in which this is subtle this isn't necessarily obvious but

25
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:33,640
there's this always sense of like oh I'm not there yet

26
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:40,920
and is there's something maybe wrong with this moment cuz it's not that other moment that I've dreamed of and dreamed

27
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:47,280
up and am aiming towards and it's this sense of

28
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:54,319
inadequacy or insufficiency about oneself often shows up and that of course is creating the

29
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:01,400
conditions in which there isn't peace and ease and freedom

30
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,159
so there's this way in which we aren't maybe noticing the way that the way that

31
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:14,159
we're approaching our meditation practice is creating the conditions in

32
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:20,239
which there isn't as much up settling or peace and ease that might other be

33
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:28,159
otherwise be and so maybe in addition to what I

34
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,560
was saying if we have this kind of like striving and this real strong goal

35
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:39,760
orientation I don't want to say there's anything wrong with having goals but in particular if we're bringing this sense

36
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:47,920
to our meditation practice also implicit in this which can be subtle is the sense of yeah well I'm

37
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:54,400
going to get it later yes this this uh sense of ease or happiness or whatever

38
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,000
it's going it'll be happen later it'll happen later again kind of taking us away from

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,319
this present moment so if we there's a sense of this present moment isn't right

40
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:12,120
and that something better is going to happen in the future this kind of disconnects us from

41
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:18,720
what's actually happening this moment and that's so much what

42
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:26,960
meditation practice is about right it's just to be here for this moment is to be with whatever our

43
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,120
experience is to to be present for whatever is

44
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:39,360
arising we would say this is what mindfulness is is just to be able to meet each moment with some awareness not

45
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,080
being lost in thoughts or completely

46
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:52,160
disconnected and I think uh many of you won't be surprised if I say that I have a poem by Rosemary

47
00:04:52,759 --> 00:05:01,639
traumer she's so great and um it's called waking up

48
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,440
and at the beginning of the poem uh she has a

49
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:14,199
epigram and it's a quote from John terrant who is a zen teacher and EP I

50
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:22,080
think it's called epigram those little thing that's often at the foot at the at the top of a chapter she says uh so John

51
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:30,120
tarant the zen teacher is saying wait a minute what if this is it

52
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:37,360
so Rosemary traumer is writing a poem in response to this it's called waking

53
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:44,000
up this is it I think as I lie in bed

54
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,520
not wanting to leave the warmth this is it my feet meet the cold

55
00:05:51,520 --> 00:06:00,680
wood this is it I water the Orchid this is it I boil water make tea

56
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:09,680
I think I'll be a better person tomorrow this is it me dreaming a Fresh

57
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:18,319
Starts this is it defuzzing the sweater this is it paying bills

58
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:26,280
answering mail frying eggs washing pans no life but this

59
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,560
one no fresh start but

60
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:41,599
here this is it the cat sits on my papers this is it the phone doesn't

61
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:46,720
ring this is it the floors need

62
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:54,840
mopping the letter needs written the class needs planned this is it me wishing I could be

63
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:00,440
more perfect this is it

64
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,759
this this only only

65
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:12,479
this this is it this flutter in my chest when the sun enters the room the natural

66
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:18,680
leaning toward the light this is it this

67
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:29,039
silence this cold this warmth this longing this song on my lips

68
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:37,039
so waking up by Rosemary traumer she's pointing to being present

69
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:44,680
for every experience I was talking about having these goals during meditation

70
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:51,159
practice and she's pointing to let just be present for your whole life whatever

71
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:57,960
is happening I love this line defuzzing the sweater it's like such

72
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:07,479
a you know I don't know it's kind of a funny thing such a mundane thing but it's also

73
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:13,440
just this recognition of something so simple and maybe it represents taking

74
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:20,080
care of ourselves in some kind of way defuzzing the sweater just to be present for

75
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:27,960
that but something that I really appreciate about this poem is that it's she in there's no

76
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:34,959
sense of like hurried there's no sense of like something else should be happening or there's no sense of uh

77
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:40,279
trying to get somewhere this is just ordinary things watering the

78
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:47,920
Orchid frying the eggs washing the pans so there's also a sense of

79
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:54,040
ease not not not so much of a sense of striving but just a like okay this is

80
00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:00,200
the next thing that's arising can we meet it can we be present for it

81
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:06,519
sometimes we think like mindfulness practice or whatever practice we should be doing is you know should happen in a

82
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:14,760
special meditation posture sit on the floor or some kind of way and this Palm is called waking

83
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:20,760
up and I love how she does a little play on words it begins with this is it I

84
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:27,240
think as I lie in bed not wanting to leave the warmth so this is her literally like waking up from

85
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:36,000
sleep but also this waking up to each moment to one's life

86
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,000
otherwise we're always trying to be somewhere else or be someone else or do

87
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,720
something else and our life is passing Us by while we're busy trying to go find

88
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,519
this peace and ease and freedom there's a few more things about

89
00:09:54,519 --> 00:10:00,040
this poem I'd like to highlight I appreciate this first line it says

90
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:06,360
um this is it I think as I lie in bed not wanting to leave the

91
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:12,519
warmth she's recognizing this mental attitude not

92
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:18,360
wanting so often we are just don't even notice this we're not even tuned in or

93
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:25,240
sensitive to this but she's recognizing oh yeah there's this resistance to

94
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:31,240
what's going to come next or this this pushing away or uh maybe yeah just

95
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:37,040
generally not wanting to do something not wanting to leave the

96
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:43,000
warmth but then she does and the next line is that uh but my

97
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,800
feet meet the cold wood and then we might even say uh in

98
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:55,720
this uh poem that there's just a little bit of walking

99
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:02,440
meditation those of you who are have here on Wednesday mornings or I've done day longs on Saturdays or I've done uh

100
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:08,680
residential Retreats know that in addition to sitting meditation there's walking

101
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:16,160
meditation and she's talking about this you know when her feet meet the cold wood so often with walking meditation is

102
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:25,839
just feeling the pressure on the bottom of our feet while we're just doing ordinary things walking and watering the

103
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,839
Orchid and then there's this something here that I think is just

104
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:39,320
fantastic she has this line I think I'll be a better person

105
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,959
tomorrow I think I'll be a better person tomorrow okay I'll take care of all

106
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:50,600
these things that uh will support me having more peace ease and freedom later

107
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,680
I'll take care of that later but then the next line she

108
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,800
says I have to this is it me dreaming of

109
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:07,279
freshh starts so then again she's recognizing oh yeah okay the mind was drifting off

110
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:14,279
and thinking like okay tomorrow things are going to be different maybe fantasizing and then she

111
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:21,040
comes back no this is it just recognizing that in fact this is what the mind was doing it was off

112
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:27,120
fantasizing or about being a better self so often when we have a meditation

113
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,760
practice or we have this idea of being present for whatever our experience is

114
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:40,800
we often aren't thinking about being present of the not only the specific contents of

115
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,440
our thoughts but of the way the maybe type or category earlier she was having

116
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:52,920
like not wanting there was this like subtle sense of resistance and here she's pointing about I think I'll be a

117
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:58,199
better person tomorrow there's this uh also a little bit of resistance like

118
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:03,959
okay it's not going to happen now it's going to happen later but this idea

119
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:10,560
of what is what is it this is it me dreaming of Fresh

120
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,800
Starts so kind like fantasizing I just appreciate that she's

121
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:24,800
through all these lists of things that happening through the day some of them are her mental States this maybe flavor

122
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,959
of the state so

123
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:35,839
this whole idea of just being present with whatever

124
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:42,399
our life is doing Rosemary trauma she's having all these uh lists of ordinary

125
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,720
things so often with this uh in this tradition and this lineage we practice

126
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:57,480
to be with uh sensations of breathing is often if I were to sit up here and to

127
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:04,279
give a guided meditation I would start as probably with mindfulness of the breath or mindfulness of the body the

128
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:10,480
bodily Sensations different days I do it I would do it differently and this how I

129
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:17,759
when I was doing a lot of guided meditations I would do it that way but sometimes what we don't uh point

130
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:25,800
out so much is that in meditation just like in daily life we can open up our

131
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,920
experience so maybe we're just with the breath or or bodily experiences feeling

132
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:37,920
the pressure of the chair cushion against the body for example and then just open it up after

133
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,120
there's a little bit of settledness happening to just be with whatever is

134
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:49,680
arising including this I'll be a better person tomorrow and then noticing oh

135
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,920
yeah this is it me dreaming of Fresh Starts just noticing oh yeah the mind is

136
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:02,519
going there and coming back and just noticing yep that was the mind

137
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:08,639
doing whatever it was doing okay sometimes we have this idea

138
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:16,519
that to be present is to be present with like clear tangible experiences that have edges

139
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:24,000
that have a a beginning and an end and a some way in which it's um you know very

140
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,160
clear but I'm pointing to something that's a little more diffuse and maybe

141
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:35,160
even subtle or even vague or maybe unclear in some kind of

142
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:42,480
way so there's this whole idea of being

143
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:49,800
present as a as a support for having this is it often what we're looking for

144
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:56,000
instead often is actually instead here and then there's this idea that we

145
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,920
have in this Buddhist tradition about taking Refuge

146
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:08,560
often it's in the Buddha Dharma and sa but just even this whole idea where

147
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:14,600
is it that we find safety where is it that uh we feel protection protected in

148
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:20,560
some kind of way because this whole idea of

149
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,800
Refuge being is a place where there's can be some safety and we can find

150
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:34,120
that being in the present moment has a certain amount of safety like to just be here with what

151
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:40,319
we're experiencing in this moment in a simple easeful way as best

152
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:49,000
we can is a way in which there we can notice how so much of the I

153
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:57,199
what we're afraid of or what's maybe exac exacerbating is our thoughts our ideas

154
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:03,559
about things or our belief about things but actually the experience that's happening right

155
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:09,240
now can just be this experience that's happening right

156
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:15,000
now so I like this uh uh notion of

157
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,360
refuge and maybe safety as um maybe like

158
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:28,120
sitting underneath a big giant tree maybe a tree that has a big limbs on it

159
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:33,840
and maybe there's some uh rain outside and you find yourself underneath

160
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:41,600
a tree that you're protected in some kind of way but it's not like you're completely separate and

161
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:49,320
isolated I'm hoping that this sound is not something problematic was no I I I you feel I

162
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:56,919
don't think you need to thank you though yeah maybe Jim thank

163
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:02,559
you just want to make sure that whatever it is that's happening out there is uh

164
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:09,400
not something that we need to I don't know do something

165
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:16,640
about so this idea of Sheltering under a large ancient tree one thing that I like

166
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:23,320
about it is like chances are you'll get a little bit wet less wet than if you were out there but you're not

167
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:30,280
disconnected from what's Happening you're still experiencing what's happening but you're there's also a s a

168
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:35,919
certain amount of feeling protected and sheltered as well cuz sometimes we feel

169
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:41,159
like oh in order to be safe I have to completely remove myself and create a

170
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:48,400
barrier between me and whatever it is is feeling threatening but in this way this idea

171
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:54,640
like no I I can still be in I can be here but also feel a certain amount of

172
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:00,120
shelter with this with the with these branches that are reaching out and plus

173
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:07,520
there's something about just being with trees that uh can be some uplift in the

174
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:14,080
heart I know for me it's that way having spent some time with trees

175
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:20,400
today there's such Something Beautiful about it and we're so lucky right to live here in an area where there's

176
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:27,559
Redwood trees and oak trees and so many beautiful trees this way of I don't know feeling

177
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:32,720
the steadiness maybe that they offer as a

178
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:39,799
certain kind of Refuge but also we could say that going for Refuge like even this

179
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:46,000
recognition that to want to be with a

180
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:53,520
I'm using this word protection or safety I'm not sure these are the right words but maybe there something within

181
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:59,039
you that feels like like this this

182
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:07,159
movement in towards that direction it's of been found in the heart it's like this heartfelt movement

183
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:12,720
towards you know I'm going to go in this direction where

184
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:20,559
there's recognition of more ease or more peace it's this can be something

185
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:26,159
that we want to do like wholeheartedly or maybe the heart is touched in some

186
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:32,039
kind of way we want to go refuge in this

187
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:40,600
direction but I would say that this I'm saying like going this direction another word we could use like having this

188
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:47,080
orientation and I'd like to suggest here that we could have this orientation towards being in the present moment and

189
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:52,159
as a place for refuge and refuge is

190
00:20:52,159 --> 00:21:00,720
an direction we can think of this idea of going for Refuge is this turning towards

191
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:07,320
in this uh particular way and maybe this gets highlighted if we talk about it's

192
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:12,480
the opposite of feeling lost it's the opposite of feeling like there's no like

193
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:19,960
I don't know what to do and which direction and feeling completely disoriented it's more like okay maybe

194
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:29,400
everything isn't clear yet but I know that this direction is towards greater I'm using

195
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:35,960
these words peace ease Freedom well-being

196
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:44,799
happiness and there's this way that when we're present for our

197
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:50,080
lives it does bring this kind of safety and

198
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:56,320
well-being I know that uh I've certainly spent so long the so many years of my

199
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,440
life not being present trying to be anything but present trying to get out

200
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,640
there and make something happen or just or just distracting myself or

201
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:14,000
entertaining myself in some kind of ways and there's this way in which we can kind of get in this habit

202
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:22,640
or maybe this way of this um it just becomes I don't know to just

203
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:28,760
not to to be disconnected to be not connected with ourselves becomes just

204
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:37,360
the way we think that life is about or it just maybe there's not as much

205
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:45,159
uh uh energy towards just being with our

206
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:52,960
experiences and when I say experiences I'm pointing to often something very simple just like sense experiences

207
00:22:52,960 --> 00:23:00,120
feeling the for me I'm feeling like the uh the fabric are underneath my hands

208
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:06,000
here sounds that of that car leaving visual

209
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:13,720
field looking seeing what's in front of me here our experiences can be this

210
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:19,200
simple and just coming back again and again to our sense

211
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:25,000
experiences this is a way to show up for our lives to have some Refuge is to just

212
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,240
be with our experiences and then there's a way in which the mind is going to Pro I said no no no no no it can't be that

213
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:36,720
simple there has to be you know more there has to be something about this it

214
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:44,840
has to mean something or but what would it be like to this

215
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:52,880
be completely embodied with our life we discover that there's actually

216
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:59,840
some uplift that happens in the heart when we're can just meeting whatever is arising just meeting in the next moment

217
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:07,679
in whatever way so is this going for refuge in the

218
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:12,720
present moment is like just orienting towards the present moment finding the

219
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:19,159
protection finding the safety in the present moment and then maybe I'd like to add a

220
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:28,520
little bit more to this I would say be in the present moment and and having this orientation

221
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:36,159
towards not causing harm not causing harm for oneself not causing harm for

222
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:43,559
others and if you're with the present moment in the present moment you start to become more and more sensitive to the

223
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:49,440
harm that you that's being caused to others and to

224
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:56,559
yourself and so this maybe I'm saying and adding this on top of this not causing harm but maybe in some ways it

225
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:03,200
just flows naturally when you're you start to become a little bit more sensitive to like oh that that felt

226
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:10,520
awkward that conversation I had with so and so or oh it's

227
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:18,559
um trying to always look good is exhausting and uh and I'm it's harmful

228
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:25,679
in some kind of way the way that I'm getting obsessed about always having to look good or and I don't know there's so

229
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:31,799
many different ways this can show up but there's this way towards orienting

230
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:37,320
towards not causing harm flows naturally out of being present because I would

231
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:44,679
also say that this being present is kind of also what's skillful and helpful and

232
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:51,200
beneficial opposite of harm so these are going together our

233
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:59,039
let's say our ethical behavior and this choice this uh

234
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:05,960
inclination this orientation towards being with what our experience

235
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:13,960
is there's this way that just this repeated

236
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:19,320
orientation is transformative it's so easy to be

237
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:27,120
dismissive of just okay I'm going to let go of that thought train and I'm just going to be uh with uh this felt

238
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:33,080
experience of the chair or the cushion against the body in this moment okay I'm GNA let go of that

239
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:40,880
thought train and just uh turn towards uh my thoughts and there's this way we can think like surely that can't be that

240
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:48,600
can't provide a way towards greater ease and freedom it turns out a

241
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:54,039
can it turns out that so much of our suffering is in our

242
00:26:54,039 --> 00:27:00,559
thoughts and taking particular thoughts holding on to them and thinking like okay this one's true all those other

243
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:06,480
ones that I've been having aren't aren't necessarily true but this one is this one is

244
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:14,360
true but what if there's a way in which we just kind of let all of them go and just be with our

245
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:20,279
experience where's the there might be discomfort in the

246
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:26,760
body there might be pain but that's not the same as

247
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:32,200
suffering the suffer uing is the I got to get rid of this I got to fix it it's

248
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:40,000
so and so's fault and this is some terrible thing that's going to happen and I got to fix it right

249
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:48,600
now but can we just be with yeah this is uncomfortable and it feels like

250
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:59,240
this so this kind of like this Refuge we might say is this

251
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:06,518
orientation and orientation this Refuge finding the Refuge in the present moment

252
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,799
experience sometimes I'm telling people when they're describing some difficulties that they're having in

253
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:22,399
their lives like I'm telling them you know it could be really helpful just to feel your feet on the ground just feel

254
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:27,640
your feet on the ground just this very simple thing and that's part of the way

255
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:34,120
that kind of disrupts the momentum of thinking and uh brings the attention to

256
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:40,080
some tangible felt experience and often I'm giving this

257
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,880
experience because I myself have found this very helpful back when I was uh

258
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:52,399
working and uh and having to attend a lot of meetings and stuff and I had first heard this idea and there'd be

259
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:59,360
meetings that were like uncomfortable and like a lot of stuff was happening on and a lot of Mis Behavior people blaming

260
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:04,840
other people or whatever but just this idea of like oh just feeling the feet on the ground and it's like oh no I'm

261
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:10,760
actually here and this body I don't have to get lost in my thoughts

262
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:16,840
and spill out some unskillful language or something like

263
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:24,679
this so this poem this is

264
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:30,600
it maybe there's a Maybe This Is It orienting towards these ordinary

265
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:37,399
experiences defuzzing the sweater and watering the Orchid maybe it's not only

266
00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:44,480
a way we could describe some Freedom it's it what we want or maybe

267
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,600
it's also the way to have this Freedom maybe it's the goal the means maybe

268
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:58,720
they're the same I'm going to read this poem again

269
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,960
and the at the beginning of the poems it says wait a minute what if this is it by

270
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:10,840
John tarant this poem is waking up by Rosemary

292
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:47,159
especially in the theme of your talk about everything is

293
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:55,440
practice and practice is all the time you know and

294
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:01,200
um not thinking there's going to be a magic moment where you know you're going

295
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,559
to feel you know enlightened or great joy I

296
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:11,679
mean you those things will happen I think but understand that the practice

297
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:18,799
is so much of the routine and the everyday yeah yeah except you know I

298
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:24,039
might use a little bit different language because you're saying the practice is the everyday in the routine

299
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:29,679
but as soon as we use this word practice we're kind of like separating out like okay here's something that's practice

300
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:35,600
and then there's everything else so I think what's being pointed to here is like it's just our

301
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:42,600
life and we do have not to say that we don't have formal meditation practices too but I think that what's being

302
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,880
pointed to here is yeah it's just being present for whatever is

303
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:52,440
arising agree great thank you

304
00:33:53,960 --> 00:34:00,600
s thanks beautiful poem every Monday I'm thinking

305
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:08,760
I should buy a copy of this Rosemary TR book it's not here's the beauty it's not a book it's all on the web every day she

306
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:17,320
she uh posts a new poem and so online online that's 100% online oh I can copy

307
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:24,560
them but what I wanted to say is as you were reading the poem and saying that I'll be a better

308
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:32,280
person tomorrow uh I could the the I saw it was a little different that I saw her uh

309
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:37,358
smiling a little bit with a little impish smile saying that because we

310
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:44,760
often uh uh hoping for a fresh start uh thousands of times perhaps but

311
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:51,919
this time she caught herself this time she saw what she was doing so I thought oh that's very

312
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:58,960
nice I'm not sure that's what she meant but that's what I heard nice nice thank you thank you like she noticed like oh

313
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,920
yeah tomorrow there'll be a fresh start nice thank

314
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,400
you maybe over

315
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:18,320
here thank you uh yeah I had a similar thought as you who just spoke uh in that

316
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,640
I would maybe I'm a little cynical here but I thought she was kind of being

317
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:31,320
like like a little satirical over how the the narrator was like kind of making

318
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:37,800
a big deal out of nothing things like in the sense that like this is it like I

319
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:43,480
have to mop right now like like and maybe I I picked that out because I kind of relate and that when I meditate I

320
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:49,400
sometimes try to like tune into every little thing to the point that it almost feels more artificial and less like the

321
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:54,480
raw experience more like me trying to pick something out of nothing um and

322
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,560
like also with the your tone of voice like that this is it this is it like she's always like unsatisfied with the

323
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:04,599
last thing and like oh like I kept messing up and doing it wrong but like

324
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:10,880
now I have this fresh start but like oh that one didn't work so this is the real fresh start like she kind of keeps

325
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:16,280
being kind of like oh there I had been doing something wrong and so now like

326
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:21,520
there's something to fix and so I'll fix it now but that was never fixed um which

327
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:27,359
is funny CU that's kind of somehow the opposite of the the main interpretation but somehow I feel like

328
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:32,839
both both can be true here that it's like more I don't know skeptical but

329
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:39,319
also more like wholesome that another in another sense like how you explain she really is just like very content with

330
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:45,119
everything yeah experiencing everything so I don't know there's kind of two sides to it nice nice so you're implying

331
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:50,680
that there was this like no not that other one this is it something like this

332
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:55,720
oh yeah yeah kind of yeah it's you know I uh didn't know how to read this like

333
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:02,920
this this is it this this is it or this is it like like how to read this and I

334
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:10,359
think what you said about my tone of voice is true like I could have uh you we could uh uh do this in different ways

335
00:37:10,359 --> 00:37:15,880
the way that it gets uh read but yeah not I'm not criticizing the way I

336
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:21,839
thought it was interesting how it kind of made it seem like very much like like always trying to one up the last one

337
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:27,760
kind of like this is it like this one so I don't know but and and maybe would that

338
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:33,200
discount what had happened before or like saying okay no no no sorry I thought that was it but that's not now

339
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:39,160
now this is it yeah kind of the vibe I got but I see I see open to

340
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:44,440
interpretation yeah yeah right the this is part of the beauty of poetry right we don't have to say no this is the only

341
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:49,960
one truth here but uh I appreciate uh

342
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:57,079
this little I'm calling it epigram I think it's what it's called the at the beginning wait a minute what if this is

343
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:03,079
it wait a minute what what if this is it

344
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:08,280
like all these other things are that I'm thinking are going to be out there and

345
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:14,240
saying well wait what what if it's right here or maybe it could be the next

346
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:20,560
thing very nice thank you thank you are you familiar with this PO

347
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:25,760
apparently you are yes yes yeah I'm sorry can you use yes you do there's

348
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,960
people online oh I'm sorry didn't realize that excuse me

349
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:40,160
thanks uh the reason I asked that whether or not you were familiar with her is that I'm not and uh uh I'm

350
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:48,640
curious is she you've read or heard a lot of her stuff is she into meditation yes so do

351
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:56,040
you I F it sounded to me like she probably was in my interpretation of it with no knowledge of her in just in

352
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:02,160
hearing it for the first time was that she was trying to tell us that

353
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:07,720
each of those things is it and individually without all the Clutter of

354
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:14,440
the day-to-day I got to do this I got to do this oh hell I was supposed to be here 10 minutes ago and what happens if

355
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:19,680
Mary's still mad at me when I see her this weekend and you know instead of

356
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:26,359
that just being able to sort of be in the midst of a practice

357
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:33,000
and a knowledge each of those things as simple as some of them are making tea or

358
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:40,720
just the very simple things to be able to stop everything else and make tea and

359
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:47,599
that's it then the next thing will be it so it sounded instructive to me rather

360
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:53,640
than um an expression of frustration yeah yeah thank you that was the way

361
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:59,319
that I was holding it as well yeah thank you

362
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:10,079
anybody else have a a comment or you you have one Jim and then and then maybe

363
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:16,400
yeah this is fairly short having a luxury of having a computer right here in the internet it

364
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:22,720
occurred to me when you were talking about Rosemary traumer yeah that thinking back to the 70s when I

365
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:30,200
took German that in German tra is room is dream so I was thinking Rosemary

366
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:36,359
dreamer oh very nice I don't know if it's spelled the spelling is different for her name than the the German word

367
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:44,440
that was a thought that came it was it for a while thank you I think Peggy behind you

368
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:49,920
had to um it's interesting

369
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,800
that about the tree um I love that analogy of Refuge gender

370
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:02,400
and I different meditation tradition that I went to this morning the teacher

371
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:09,599
read a rosemary Traer poem and I was like oh my God and it had trees in it too oh there we go it was um it's just

372
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:14,760
cool to me that that you both would mention it and um

373
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,960
also I love the In This Moment being

374
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:25,319
here with this and uh the last I decided to turn my TV

375
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:33,119
off for a few days which normally I can never do unless I'm away from home in some lovely place but so I decided to do

376
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:39,000
that and what I kind of noticed is a lot of daily activities I think you know oh

377
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:47,040
this is boring this is a drag I got to finish this so I can do this and when I just stop and kind of be present with

378
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:55,160
what I'm doing it's not boring anymore it's actually kind of peaceful and relaxing so I just

379
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:02,359
wanted to say that beautiful beautiful thank you thank you it turns out that this is exactly what happens right if

380
00:42:02,359 --> 00:42:07,640
we're just present with what's happening it turns out to be fine yeah it's a

381
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:13,880
setad of this sense of we have to be elsewhere or should be elsewhere we having different experiences nice yeah

382
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:20,440
although sometimes some feelings come up there's some hard things in my life and but it's kind of okay it's better than

383
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:29,119
when they're at a distance yeah that's right hope that made sense I did that made sense for thank you

384
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,680
so maybe one last comment or

385
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:49,960
question okay okay so wishing you all a wonderful rest of the evening thank you
