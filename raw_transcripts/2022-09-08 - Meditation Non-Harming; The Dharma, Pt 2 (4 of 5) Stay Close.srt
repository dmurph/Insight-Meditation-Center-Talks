so um i want to uh

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,559
begin a little story from the sutras this morning before the meditation and

10
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,320
i'll continue it tomorrow so hopefully you'll forgive me and

11
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,000
there is a some kind of celestial being that comes

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,600
down to visit a young monk who's starting to meditate and the celestial being says um

13
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,680
you're young in the prime of life you should go go out and enjoy sensual pleasures

14
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,600
why do you abandon what is immediate and directly visible

15
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:32,799
here and now for this dharma practice and the monk says

16
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,400
no it's not not the case i'm not abandoning what is directly

17
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,520
visible here and and and immediate now the dharma is directly

18
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:51,680
visible the dharma is directly present now immediate and it goes

19
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,680
through it like this and then there's the deity sit that says well

20
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:04,799
explain yourself and the monk uh can't explain himself so i'm new so you have to go talk to the

21
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,160
buddha so that's the part for tomorrow but the end of the buddha explaining all this to

22
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,160
him to the to the celestial being the celestial being um summarizes

23
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,760
the teachings the summary it's you know the answer to all this

24
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,599
and that's what i want to read um

25
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:37,480
oh no yeah here here it is okay

26
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:44,080
one should do nothing mean in all the world

27
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,480
not by speech by mind or by body having abandoned

28
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,160
sensual desires mindful and clearly comprehending

29
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:03,280
which one one should not pursue a course that is painful and harmful

30
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:10,800
one should not that's why i wanted to read to not pursue a course that is painful and harmful

31
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:18,720
so this practice that we do the way that it's immediately beneficial

32
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,720
visible here and now to be seen for oneself

33
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:31,280
is a practice of non-harming we see something about the dharma when

34
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,120
we harm ourselves and so the dharma is seen there if we see it as dharma so we see it as a

35
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:44,400
teaching something to learn from something to practice with so suffering and pain and discomfort and

36
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,560
despair that we might feel in the dharma we don't have to see it as unfortunate

37
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,239
we see it as the dharma oh this is this is true this is what's happening i

38
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:04,799
see it clearly now and we practice with it and we learn the practice of non-harming

39
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,159
thorough non-harming radical non-harming

40
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:18,160
non-harming in all directions including not harming oneself and that's when we really discover

41
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,759
that this dharma is uh

42
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,199
is visible here it's now immediate

43
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,840
it is

44
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,680
it is onward leading it is to be experienced by the wise

45
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:48,320
and it is um so um so that's what we'll do today maybe that

46
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,919
can be a orientation for your meditation

47
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,840
the practice of non-harming and there's a way in which

48
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:09,039
letting the mind be distracted lost in thought while not directly harming

49
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:17,038
is a little bit stressful it's a little bit of a tension it's a little bit away from the place of freedom and peace

50
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,560
and so this guideline to sit with non-harming

51
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:30,400
quietly and if you do harm yourself it's with being mean or being

52
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,720
something um don't add harm on top of that

53
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,840
see the dharma in it don't believe it

54
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:50,720
but dharma it don't don't don't participate in it

55
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:57,919
but see it clearly for what it is and then you're seeing the dharma

56
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:03,880
so with that we'll sit quietly thank you

57
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,559
as we come to the end of this sitting

58
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,400
maybe to take a few moments in your own way

59
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:49,039
to appreciate that the heart of the dharma

60
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:57,440
that is visible here [Music] now

61
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:06,000
that you're invited to take a good look at that is onward leading

62
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,279
and something to experience to be experienced by the wise to experience by yourself

63
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:20,760
at the heart of this dharma is non-harming

64
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:29,679
non-harm not harming ourselves not harming others

65
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:36,240
not harming self and others not harming the various communities

66
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:43,360
groups were part of and not harming the entire world

67
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:52,880
and may it be that as we end this meditation that the meditation serves as a basis

68
00:27:52,880 --> 00:28:00,919
for a better understanding of harm and not harming

69
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,480
that we see the dharma

70
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:15,200
or to see the dharma in harming means we don't believe in the harming

71
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,640
anymore the activity of hurting someone

72
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:27,200
we know there's another way there's non-harming

73
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:35,120
the entire dharma can be discovered on this path to

74
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:40,960
fuller and fuller manifestations of non-harming

75
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:47,039
may we live for the non-harm for the benefit

76
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:53,120
for the welfare of this whole world

77
00:28:53,919 --> 00:29:00,399
may others experiences experience the blessings of non-harming

78
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:06,799
may others experience the safety of non-harm

79
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:12,600
may others experience the peace of non-harming

80
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:18,720
and they may others be free of all forms of harm

81
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:37,869
may all beings be happy [Music]

82
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,158
thank you

83
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:53,279
so today we come to the fourth characteristic of the dhamma

84
00:29:53,279 --> 00:30:00,000
the dharma and that is that it's up

85
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:06,559
and most commonly it's that's understood as it's onward leading

86
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:12,960
and i like this translation of the word

87
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,240
there are other meanings of it the ancient commentaries they discussed

88
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:25,600
some of the different meanings they can have these days uh bikibodi the great

89
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:32,080
translator of our suttas he's translating it as applicable applicable

90
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:38,159
that the dhamma is something that you can immediately apply you can use it's usable

91
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:44,880
and which is also a very nice idea it's immediately used you can use it

92
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:51,360
and so and another meaning of it is that um

93
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:57,440
is that the dhamma is something it's immediate and now

94
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,880
and approachable something to be to approach something that's nearby

95
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:10,080
something to be close to stay close to um we're guided close to it

96
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:16,480
so these kind of different meanings so the idea of onward leading i'm very

97
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,960
fond of because when we practice it's not a static thing that we sit and

98
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:29,440
practice nothing to think of onward leading as something that has almost a natural quality to it it

99
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:35,440
moves along without my effort so if i

100
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:41,760
float on top of a current in this river it's onward leading it carries me along

101
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:47,519
if i stand on a conveyor belt you know that these walking i don't know

102
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:52,720
sidewalks that they have at the airport i see them at the airport um you stand there and just carries you

103
00:31:52,720 --> 00:32:00,799
along you don't have to do the walking so this idea of being carried along unfolding by the dharma

104
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:07,440
and the you know it's not the mystical or strange thing i like to understand it

105
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:14,480
very simply that the dharma is to see the dharma to be

106
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:21,120
it's visible here now just really see it to take a good look at it what's happening here now

107
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:27,600
one of the things we start seeing is the tensions we hold the holding patterns in the body and the mind we

108
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:34,000
start seeing the strain the stresses we carry with us and

109
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:42,480
and there's something about showing up and being really present for tension for stress for holding for that

110
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:48,320
um something begins to release it's hard it's a sooner or later it's

111
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,679
hard for the system or psychophysical system to

112
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:58,880
relax uh to to hold on to keep being tense

113
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,080
under the gaze of mindfulness of awareness

114
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:09,440
it's kind of like we can't do two things at once we can't be fully present

115
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:15,039
and fully tense and fully engaged and holding on and clinging and so

116
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:21,200
as we devote ourselves to being present to being aware that part of us there's less energy

117
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,399
available to be tense too tight to hold on to be to cling

118
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:32,480
and so then it begins to relax and soften sometimes we see what we're holding on

119
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:38,720
to and we let go of it and something relaxes and that relaxation of the system mind

120
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:44,720
heart body is onward leading because it heightens heightens the sensitivity

121
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:51,919
to recognize more clinging to recognize the remnants that what's you know what the next layer of tension

122
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:57,600
or strain that we have it heightens our attention to notice when we bring in more strain again we

123
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:03,519
get tense again and now you can see that in meditation sometimes very clearly where they were

124
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:08,960
pretty relaxed and at ease and then we have a certain thought or memory and we

125
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:14,878
feel tightening up someplace maybe the whole body or we brace ourselves in some way

126
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:20,800
and we can see we're getting involved in an idea a story and the effect it has

127
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:27,118
and sometimes it's it's in seeing it so clearly it's possible to let go of it say i don't need to be involved in that

128
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:32,800
story i can let go of those thoughts and let it go and the body relaxes a little bit

129
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:38,240
and so um so sometimes it's a practice that we do

130
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:45,440
because of this heightened sensitivity that we get more and more aware of it and so as we relax we're more sensitive

131
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:53,280
as we relax there's a momentum towards greater ease towards greater letting go not clinging

132
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:59,280
and our whole body begins shifting uh they say that with a lot of stress

133
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:05,280
a lot of stress that are uh biochemical

134
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,640
makeup inside of us changes there's more cortisol stress hormones and different things

135
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:17,280
and they're not good for us but as we have ease and de-stress the system moves towards kind of a homeostasis of health

136
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:23,119
and well-being more or less and so there's this onward leading towards health to spiritual health

137
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:30,160
psychological health even to some degree his physical health that can happen through this

138
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,760
and so at some point this movement towards letting go uh begins to feel like it's happening on

139
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:42,800
its own and it feels like we're kind of on the gentle slide or in a current that

140
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:48,240
all we have to do is stay out of the way don't interfere with it and with the whole system moves towards greater and

141
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:54,800
greater ease greater relaxing letting go opening up and it's remarkable to feel this it's

142
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:00,160
almost impersonal it's almost natural quality to it

143
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:07,520
and it's kind of very inspiring to feel this not selfhood of this process of the dharma unfolding within

144
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:12,720
us we have our role for sure but that we can't engineer it we have to

145
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:19,599
kind of enable it to allow it and and stay close to it

146
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:25,680
and uh so this dharma that we stay close to is one of the meetings of panayako

147
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:32,160
something to stay close to and i love this idea that we stay close to the dharma

148
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:37,920
keep it close in stay close remember it

149
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:43,280
it's the most important thing for our life because it's more important than anything

150
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,800
not because other things are unimportant but because they sit at the center of a

151
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:54,560
really healthy way of being with things that are important in our life the important things in our life if

152
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:00,480
they're worthwhile stay important but with the dharma being the most important

153
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:07,440
we actually have more to offer the other important things we we have in our life

154
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:13,520
and with the dharma being most important there's a quality of freedom that comes

155
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:18,960
with how we connect and be with people we people we love we can still love them

156
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,240
fully maybe even more so but there's a quality of freedom of non-expectation of

157
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:30,640
non-demanding maybe a non-neediness that goes along with it

158
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:37,040
so onward leading um then pick a body now as i said translated as applicable

159
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:42,240
so as we see the tension the holding that we have

160
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:48,560
we see it clearly that shows us what we can do what's useful we

161
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:54,800
see where we can let go of and sometimes we can't let go of the tension the holding itself but we might

162
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:00,000
let go of our self-criticism that we might have

163
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,040
oh i'm such a terrible person i'm bad buddhist because i'm clinging

164
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:11,280
maybe that can be let go of and we're still holding on to something but we're more at ease with

165
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:17,119
being tense more at ease with our attachment and it doesn't mean that we're

166
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:22,400
condoning or celebrating and participating wholeheartedly in our attachments

167
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:28,000
but it does mean that we're not adding more suffering on top of it and this is a beautiful quality i think

168
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,240
of dhamma practice of this kind of acceptance this kind of non-uh

169
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:39,599
movement would be not being troubled by all the challenges we have all the

170
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:47,280
faults that we have a few of us have a few faults uh inner personal faults and

171
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:53,760
i kind of like to think that every human has it it's not even personal it just comes with being human being

172
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,520
and so to to not be troubled by that and the same time to see it and to know

173
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:06,880
it and not to cause any harm because of it and as long as we don't cause harm

174
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:13,280
it's fine to be who you are no harm to yourself no harm to others

175
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:20,880
that's it's profound because it's an alternative to how much harm is being caused in this

176
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:26,480
world it's phenomenal the amount of harming that goes on even in the most subtle ways even among

177
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:32,720
people who love each other there's harming going on and it would be a radically different

178
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:38,320
world if we stop that so even for one person to come to that place of not harming

179
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:44,079
is just an amazing thing close to that so

180
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:50,480
upanayako this onward leading quality of the dharma

181
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:56,400
also means the dharma is applicable it's something we can apply ourselves to

182
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:02,400
we can apply ourselves to the stream that carries us to greater and greater freedom

183
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:08,800
and it's something to stay close to stay close to the stream stay close to this practice stay close to this thing that

184
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:14,880
can be visible right here that is now

185
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,000
that is a good to take a deep look at it yes look at it deeply

186
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,040
stay close to that so that you can experience what the wise

187
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:32,720
experience to be experienced by the wise and that will be the topic for tomorrow

188
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:39,359
so thank you and stay close so today

189
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:45,040
stay close to non-harming

190
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:51,760
and and if that means that you're seeing clearly the way that you harm

191
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:58,000
try not to be troubled by that and don't participate in it

192
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,839
see it clearly don't add problems on top of it but to explore this world of harming and

193
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:10,319
unharming stay close to that and you'll find there you'll see the dharma there

194
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:17,560
that's where the dharma can be found so thank you very much
