1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,679
continuing on this series of the seven

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:06,880
factors of awakening

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,160
the factor for today is joy

4
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,600
and joy is the particular joy that's a

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,800
factor of awakening

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,920
is really a product of doing the

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,000
practice

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,039
of mindfulness so it's not a

9
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,160
joy that comes from reflection and that

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,840
wonderful things are happening to us in

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,000
the world

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
it's really a joy that rises out of the

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,120
practice

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,160
doing the practice really engaging in

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,160
the practice in a kind of sincere

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,200
wholehearted way

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,360
and i'd like to think of this joy as

18
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,199
being also

19
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,760
a expression or enactment or

20
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,600
manifestation of our freedom

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,080
that grows as we do the practice of

22
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,720
mindfulness

23
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,040
and that these seven factors of

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,400
awakening all can be seen as

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,080
enactments of freedom

26
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,119
and rather than waiting for freedom to

27
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,680
occur in a big bang of enlightenment

28
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,360
down the road if we just huff and puff

29
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,119
and get concentrated enough and still

30
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,079
enough and then eventually

31
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,600
maybe by magic there'll be a big aha

32
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,400
moment or a

33
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,159
big transformation moment

34
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,000
and now you live happily free for the

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,079
rest of your life

36
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,119
you have it made in enlightened

37
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,799
retirement

38
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,759
it's much more i think valuable to

39
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,520
appreciate

40
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,119
that we're beginning to move

41
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,240
we're taking a seed a a little

42
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,399
of freedom the potential for freedom

43
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,920
inside of us

44
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,920
and germinating it caring for it

45
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,760
carefully in the greenhouse

46
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,720
tending to it carefully transplanting it

47
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,040
out into the world

48
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,920
and letting it grow and develop and

49
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,879
mature

50
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,840
into something into freedom full freedom

51
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,520
because then we're beginning to take a

52
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,280
little bit more responsibility for this

53
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,400
freedom thing

54
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,599
ourselves rather than thinking that you

55
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,040
know something else is going to do it

56
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,439
for me

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,319
and so these lit beginning to to

58
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,120
recognize

59
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,840
little movements of freedom that we all

60
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,239
use

61
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,440
all day long in fact i would

62
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,480
venture to guess that

63
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,040
most of us have more moments of freedom

64
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,400
through the day

65
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,440
than non-freedom

66
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,040
but the reason we don't feel like we're

67
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,080
free is that we prioritize

68
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,440
our our attention we let our attention

69
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,800
prioritize or focus on

70
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,120
the ways that we're unhappy or the ways

71
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,720
of what we want

72
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,480
what we don't want we get swept

73
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,840
up into the world of thinking where in

74
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,560
the thinking there's not much freedom

75
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,440
more often than not for people we're

76
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,000
kind of

77
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,400
hijacked by our thoughts our concerns

78
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,840
our fears our desires

79
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,799
and so it might seem that in the

80
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,920
important ways

81
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,879
psychological ways that we're not free

82
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,440
but there are plenty of ways that we are

83
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,840
free

84
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,760
when you if you sit down in a chair

85
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,680
you have a fair amount of freedom about

86
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,519
how you adjust yourself into that chair

87
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,280
and you probably never really gave me

88
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,439
much thought to how you sat in the chair

89
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,720
and how you adjust your

90
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,840
yourself to be comfortable

91
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,280
but that movement of sitting down and

92
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,080
choosing how you sit in the chair

93
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,560
is an expression is a manifestation of

94
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,199
some freedom

95
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,800
reaching forward to open your front door

96
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,880
is an expression of freedom that you can

97
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,479
do that there are people who can't do

98
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,440
that

99
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,479
for all kinds of reasons

100
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,000
there's lots of little moments of where

101
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
you choose to do something and there's a

102
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,120
freedom in doing it

103
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,919
as we start doing mindfulness practice

104
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:44,560
to begin

105
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,520
recognizing how mindfulness itself

106
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,880
can be an enactment of freedom

107
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,600
and that's hard to do if mindfulness is

108
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,800
burdened

109
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,240
by shoulds and shouldn'ts and gotta do

110
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,000
better and supposed to get somewhere and

111
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,759
am i there yet then

112
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,520
i'm not a good meditator and someone

113
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,680
else is a better meditator or

114
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,759
i'm supposed to bear down and really

115
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,199
strain and

116
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,120
what's important they say is continuity

117
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,960
of mindfulness so i'm really gonna when

118
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,000
i'm mindful i'm just

119
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,479
just gonna be mindful i'm gonna you know

120
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:19,360
really push

121
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,479
and make strong effort you know and

122
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,240
really strain

123
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,800
so all this extra stuff comes along with

124
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,360
mindfulness

125
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,560
a moment of mindfulness is something is

126
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,039
phenomenally simple

127
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,000
and if just just to know in the moment

128
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,759
what's happening

129
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,759
and in fact you have many of these

130
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,919
moments throughout the day

131
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,759
where you know something without the

132
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,039
burden of anything

133
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,800
more thing more complicated than knowing

134
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,440
that it's doing there

135
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,479
chances that you open that door

136
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,080
half the time at least when you open the

137
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,720
door you just know you something inside

138
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,800
of you no it's a door

139
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,000
no it's a door handle and it's not

140
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,319
anything more complicated than that

141
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,160
you know comparing your door handle to

142
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,759
your neighbor's door handle and who has

143
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,039
the better door handle and

144
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,000
i should have a better door handle it's

145
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,880
just a door handle

146
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,240
but the practice of mindfulness is also

147
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,880
the practice of appreciating

148
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,520
that simplicity of awareness in the

149
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,919
moment

150
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,639
and seeing can feel an enactment of

151
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,120
freedom

152
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,080
there's freedom in that knowing before

153
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,000
all the extra stuff is added on top of

154
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,160
it

155
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,960
and then the ch the freedom to choose

156
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,680
to investigate as soon as you choose to

157
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,840
investigate to look more carefully

158
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,599
to recognize more carefully what's here

159
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,080
you're not being swept off in your

160
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,840
thoughts you're not being swept off in

161
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,440
your

162
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,280
agendas desires wishes there is

163
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,520
it's a little movement i'm choosing not

164
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,479
to be

165
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,800
the old way i'm choosing to take a

166
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,840
better look

167
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,560
give a second look to what's happening

168
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,840
and that's enactment enactment of

169
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,720
freedom

170
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,599
effort being having to do with choices

171
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:20,720
choosing the

172
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,240
endeavor which is more healthy for us

173
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,080
as soon as we make a choice towards

174
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,840
health towards skillfulness to

175
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,960
wholesomeness

176
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,080
we're enacting our freedom

177
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,479
as i keep saying we don't recognize it

178
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:35,440
so much

179
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,440
because many of us carry with us this

180
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,919
huge huge huge backpack

181
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,199
everywhere we go of shoulds and

182
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,479
desires and agendas and self-concepts

183
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:47,720
and

184
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,720
self-criticism and aversion and all this

185
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,840
stuff that we carry along

186
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,680
and so we don't because of that heavy

187
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,479
backpack we don't recognize

188
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,680
the ease and simplicity and freedom in

189
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,039
these choices

190
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,400
to move in the healthy direction

191
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,319
so part of this practice is begin

192
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,479
recognizing

193
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,160
something that's probably there in to

194
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,960
some degree all along

195
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,199
the enactment of freedom the expression

196
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,199
of it

197
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,720
and that brings us to joy

198
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,039
the word joy is pity p-i-t-i

199
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,039
and it means usually translates joy

200
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,039
sometimes as ecstasy sometimes as

201
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,320
rapture

202
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,440
but that's a particular theravada slant

203
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,560
on this or a

204
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,440
meditation slant on this word pity it

205
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,320
could also mean

206
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,360
pleasure it can mean delight

207
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,480
enjoyment in sanskrit

208
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,120
the pretty the sanskrit word can also

209
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,519
mean

210
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,640
friendliness and pleasure and affection

211
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,880
which i think begins showing that it's a

212
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,360
it's an emotional quality

213
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,880
sometimes pure you know it's it's in the

214
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,640
we're tapping into an emotional

215
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,000
connection to the practice

216
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,519
and to being free and what's being

217
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,920
present that comes from a kind of an

218
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,720
emotional contentment

219
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,360
a contentment i'm doing a practice i'm

220
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,839
practicing a path of freedom

221
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,360
this is worthwhile this is a

222
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,480
healthy thing to be doing

223
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,760
and we're enacting the freedom which

224
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,000
feels so good

225
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,200
to feel like we're not

226
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,279
entangled trapped caught in things

227
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,440
because the awareness the mind has

228
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,040
become free

229
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,839
in the enactment of these freedoms and

230
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:46,399
so

231
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,959
the continuity of this free act of

232
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,399
mindfulness the continuity of

233
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,680
mindfulness

234
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,279
of concentration tends to give birth to

235
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,839
a variety of different kinds of

236
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,440
contentment joys happinesses

237
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,640
and there's different all kinds of

238
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,120
different types

239
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,600
but some of it is simply like it's like

240
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,240
if you go to

241
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,200
you slide down a long long slide there

242
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,440
is a joy of that freedom of just letting

243
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,600
go and going

244
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,959
and it's just a delight

245
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,720
so the same way if you can have the

246
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,000
continuity of these moments of freedom

247
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,640
continuity of choosing and engaging and

248
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,519
being mindful

249
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,880
and aware there's a feeling that oh

250
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,640
we'll start to getting a more taste for

251
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,920
that freedom

252
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,519
and it feels like not necessarily a

253
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,600
slide but the same kind of

254
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,560
the continuity gives birth to a joy and

255
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,160
delight and

256
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,600
boy am i lucky this is a great thing

257
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
it's not so evil it's not so much we

258
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,120
evaluate that

259
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,560
we you know it's not like we think ours

260
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,640
think our way into that

261
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,000
but there is a delight a joy a gladness

262
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
just in the in the freshness and the

263
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,279
you know it used to be in the united

264
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,880
states this did

265
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,200
there was a reference point to the joy

266
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,360
of driving on

267
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,000
an empty open freeway open highway

268
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,399
you know we don't think we be forgotten

269
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,640
what that is like

270
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,000
but this you know this joy this open

271
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,959
you know free free highway of meditation

272
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,240
of practice

273
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,160
and the amazing thing about this is that

274
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,440
then it doesn't matter as much

275
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,440
whether what's happening to us is

276
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,440
pleasant and unpleasant

277
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,240
because we discover how to be free and

278
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,519
be mindful aware

279
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,720
investigate make healthy choices this

280
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,200
inner freedom is discovered even when

281
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,440
things are unpleasant

282
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,360
even when things are in the world around

283
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,480
us are not so

284
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,000
good and what an amazing

285
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,560
thing to have discovered that because we

286
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,600
know how to be mindful

287
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,079
because we know how to investigate and

288
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,920
make choices and

289
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,399
appreciate that we're doing this there

290
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,360
can even be

291
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,480
joy and delight when conventionally when

292
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,839
the world expects us or

293
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,800
even our people and our people want us

294
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,480
to be miserable

295
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,800
you're supposed to be miserable when i'm

296
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,920
miserable so you're supposed to be

297
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,519
miserable

298
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,600
we're supposed to commiserate in her

299
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,800
commune in her

300
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,000
miserableness isn't it terrible things

301
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,560
are awful

302
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,760
so what happens as we start moving

303
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,240
through these factors of awakening and

304
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,160
when i say what i'm about to say you

305
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,600
might decide to get off the

306
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,720
factor's awakening path because what

307
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,639
happens is when you get far enough along

308
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,680
it

309
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,360
you won't be inclined to complain

310
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,839
anymore

311
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,079
because you have something much much

312
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,079
better to do

313
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,200
much more wonderful to do the enactment

314
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,040
of your freedom through mindfulness

315
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,360
investigation

316
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,560
effort endeavoring and

317
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,120

thank you
