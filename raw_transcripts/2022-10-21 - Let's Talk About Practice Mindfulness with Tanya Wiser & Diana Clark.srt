1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:06,540
well so there's what song Go means to me and there's probably what the formal

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,660
definition of Sangha is in the formal definition of Sangha from the time of the Buddha it really meant

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:19,500
the community of enlightened monks and nuns who had um sort of gone to the home become

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,900
homeless right to that all they do is have their robes and their arms bowl and

5
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,960
they live off of food that's given to them day by day

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:37,500
and they sleep in parks and things where they're they're invited to sleep

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,920
um and that was initially the term how what it meant and the word Sangha is one

8
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:51,059
of um or Sangha is one of what they call the three gems there's three gems in the the Dharma one

9
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:57,719
is the Buddha the teacher the second is the Dharma the teaching the the teacher

10
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:03,960
you know what the lessons the practices and the third is the community

11
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,979
the Sangha the community and you know we don't have many monastic

12
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:18,240
nuns and monks in our day and many of us who are teaching now are not uh where we

13
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,720
live you know lives where we have homes and jobs and so it's life has changed a lot the

14
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,799
community has changed a lot here in the United States um I guess that never really was that way

15
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:38,700
so it didn't change here but it has evolved and um so now I use the term song God to

16
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:45,180
represent spiritual friendship and the people who come you know to IMC

17
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:52,020
when we come together we create a Sangha and it is that Sangha that

18
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:58,560
um created the space it made it happen so that's what I mean

19
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,200
you want to add anything Diana that was great I just thought I would uh

20
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:11,459
yeah it's a good one I actually um just last night I had written up a document for submitting on something and

21
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:16,520
Gil said do you think maybe you should Define the word Sangha

22
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,420
so so it's a theme Gill stole my thought

23
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:31,140
hi Anne Rose good to see you so are we ready to meditate

24
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:38,099
great so I thought the way that I would um give instructions is sort of a

25
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:43,379
combination of telling you and walking you through it

26
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:49,160
so when we when we when it's time to meditate these are some of the things

27
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:54,239
I've taught been taught to do or I do and so I'm just going to sort of you

28
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,360
know there's we all find our exact own way so this is not like I'm not telling

29
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:08,160
you the exact thing that every person does here but I'm telling you things that are taught a lot and you can adapt

30
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,280
in a way that works for you if that makes sense and so also I'll give you instructions but I also want to give you

31
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:20,280
permission to adjust the instructions so if I say a word that

32
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:27,120
doesn't land right to you or I invite you to try something and you're like no

33
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,879
please trust what's right for your practice

34
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:38,400
so the first thing is kind of this decision we're going to meditate

35
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:45,739
I'm going to be mindful so that's really the very first thing we're going to sort of make this choice

36
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:52,379
and one posture we can be mindful in is sitting which is what we're all choosing

37
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:57,900
to do tonight so we're gonna bring awareness into

38
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:04,620
sitting down and the posture that we take and

39
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:12,420
you know think about what how you might be sitting right now

40
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:17,579
if you were about to meet with someone important

41
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:23,160
how would you show up how would you feel what would your posture be

42
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,380
if this was somebody important you were going to connect with

43
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:33,660
there's a little bit of extra lift right a little bit of

44
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:40,080
I don't want to use the word formal but a little bit more upright

45
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:48,360
in our posture because we're interested and we want to be respectful too

46
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,720
so guess who we're gonna show up for like this ourselves

47
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,360
we're important our our awareness is important

48
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:07,139
so finding a posture for eating feeling the feet supported by the Earth

49
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:16,639
the sit bones supported by our cushion or chair our backs are upright

50
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:25,380
and feel into your body feel it sitting here we want to be comfortable too

51
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:31,860
and so take a moment to see if you need to adjust your posture in any way

52
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:37,740
it's great to do that that's right back and forth on the sit

53
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,780
bones you might Lean Forward lean back

54
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:48,539
you might bring your shoulders up and roll them back to help open the

55
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:55,080
chest for breath ah

56
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,120
and feeling maybe feeling that there's more a sense

57
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:06,960
of weight you're more connected to gravity as you bring your awareness inward

58
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,400
and into the seating

59
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,840
the next thing that can be helpful it's like inviting a mindset that will

60
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:26,960
support us in our practice so I'll mention a couple of qualities

61
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,039
faith and inspiration

62
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:39,180
so as we show up can we have faith that this is important

63
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:46,020
that for whatever reason we got ourselves here we wanted to be here

64
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:54,060
and we don't know exactly what's going to happen in the next hour and a half but can we stay connected to a sense of

65
00:06:54,060 --> 00:07:00,259
inspiration and faith that it's worthwhile

66
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:08,520
you might if you have a reason for being here you might connect with

67
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,740
that like I want to suffer less

68
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:19,380
or I want to have more freedom from my thinking

69
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:24,660
where I want to be able to respond differently to my emotions

70
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:30,020
or I want freedom I want to be liberated

71
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,819
the next quality I'll invite you to connect with is the quality of being

72
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:57,599
interested curious or receptive

73
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:03,060
being curious about how this is going to unfold because no meditation no two

74
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:10,080
meditations are the same and the journey here

75
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:17,460
is to stay present awake to what's happening

76
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:26,220
in our direct experience curious about the next sensation

77
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:32,539
sound thing that arises

78
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:47,220
were often taught that it's helpful to have some sort of an anchor

79
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:53,180
some sort of a way to help ourselves not get lost in thought

80
00:08:54,120 --> 00:09:01,140
an anchor just like an anchor for a boat helps the boat not

81
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:08,160
drift out to sea or crash up onto the shore an anchor in meditation

82
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:15,500
helps us to stay as close as we can to the present moment

83
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,959
and it could be sound breath

84
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:27,420
or Sensations in the body most often

85
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:34,019
it's the breath but we all find

86
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:39,959
what's easiest for us to connect with in a way that helps us

87
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:43,579
stay here

88
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,660
paying attention on purpose

89
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:58,279
in the present moment

90
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:06,920
to whatever you can sense into what you can experience

91
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,700
right here right now

92
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:30,720
and just like the ocean has waves we have thoughts they will come

93
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,540
and sometimes we'll get moved around by them Carried Away by them

94
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:43,640
that's the nature of a mind that thinks it's not a problem

95
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:51,139
but is it possible for the period of this practice

96
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:58,700
to prioritize being with our direct experience

97
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:05,420
overthinking about

98
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:16,019
over planning over conceptualizing

99
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,079
can you let thoughts just happen and be an experience

100
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:30,360
without getting carried away by them

101
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,060
agreeing or disagreeing with them

102
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,339
over and over again we might just invite ourselves

103
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:55,160
to reconnect with our anchor our breath

104
00:11:56,579 --> 00:12:03,439
we might try what we call a noting practice

105
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:12,300
that might be something like saying in with the inhale

106
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,220
and out with the exhale

107
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,760
very simple noting

108
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:54,079
and as you breathe in

109
00:12:54,899 --> 00:13:01,579
out feeling and knowing the sensations of breathing out

110
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:52,139
you might try noting by just saying the word now

111
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:59,760
helping your mind Orient to this moment or hear right here

112
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:06,320
in this In This Moment in this body

113
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:14,639
or even this is saying what

114
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:21,899
happens in your own experience experimenting with curiosity a little

115
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:28,860
bit with these different ways of noting and seeing what happens inside of you

116
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,720
how does your mind respond

117
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:48,180
this is about learning learning how to be aware and with your

118
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:56,480
mind not controlled by it

119
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:05,060
and not wrangling with it either

120
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,199
just here

121
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,880
just now

122
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:16,920
and if the mind is busy thinking it might be possible

123
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:23,220
to just sort of breathe through the thinking just letting the thinking happen and

124
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:28,920
still feeling the breath still knowing now

125
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,680
the mind can have thoughts it's okay

126
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:41,160
and you can be right here just now just this

127
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,800
breathing right through it right with it

128
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:38,360
paying attention on purpose

129
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,480
and giving preference to our direct experience

130
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:52,020
direct experiences the feeling of breathing The Sounds

131
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:57,799
you're hearing Sensations in your body

132
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:31,320
the Mind might be just making little thoughts

133
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:36,780
it can be like little clouds in the sky just

134
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:43,460
floating around doing their thing

135
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:48,860
and we can be like the sky

136
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,520
this guy doesn't care if there's clouds

137
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:04,020
it's wide and open spacious

138
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:13,760
it's patience

139
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,059
just breathing here

140
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:49,559
letting the thoughts be thoughts the sensations be Sensations

141
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:55,679
just letting things be you don't have to try and control them

142
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:03,860
or change them just breathing with it and through it

143
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:46,340
Breath by breath maybe three breaths in a row

144
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:53,880
just three seeing if you can stay intimately connected with the

145
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:59,840
inhale the paws and the exhale

146
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,520
three breaths in a row

147
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:14,528
[Music]

148
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:29,159
thank you so before Diana gives our talk I wanted

149
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:36,600
to just see how that was for you questions frustrations

150
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:43,200
Pleasant unpleasant experiences we've got a mic here and

151
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,539
um for the people out on YouTube hello and the other people who listen later on

152
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:54,000
would you be willing to use the mic and it's just here are a couple of comments

153
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,200
about how that was

154
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:08,480
Tara thank you

155
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:19,440
I'm wondering if it's normal to feel like you're falling asleep and you're kind of in and out of this dream state sort of hard to tell if it's sleep or

156
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:25,559
thoughts is that normal anybody else ever feel

157
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:31,679
that way yes so we get used to we get we get

158
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:37,620
exposed in this different way to all these different mind States right and that's one of them

159
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:43,860
and um you know it can be kind of pleasant did you find it a little bit Pleasant yeah

160
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:51,539
and um do you feel like you were able to be aware enough of what was happening as it

161
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:54,080
was happening

162
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:01,980
it's okay this time not so much it felt pretty sleepy more sleepy yeah so you

163
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:08,940
know you got lost and you know sloth and torpor right which is a one of the hindrances

164
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:15,179
can be quite Pleasant and you know um and one of the things we can do if we

165
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:21,360
find that is we stand up or we open our eyes

166
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:28,980
or we take off our sweater so we're a little cold you know these are some of the things to help bring energy or more

167
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:35,940
um yeah a little more kind of energy into the experience not quite so

168
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:41,779
comfortable thank you Tara thank you

169
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,880
Tara thank you Tara

170
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:58,200
I kept finding myself uh hunching over and then

171
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:03,720
I would need to remind myself to sit up and be important because that feels

172
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:11,460
better it just it's easier and feels more open when you're sitting back

173
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:19,620
and attentive but if I don't pay attention to that I end up creeping forward and forward and then I

174
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:24,779
should remind myself to sit back great observation do you want to say anything

175
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:27,740
about that Diana

176
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:35,340
[Laughter] I you know I mean you're you have a

177
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:40,919
habit right of Leaning forward and part of that is

178
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:46,440
you know the computer and the phone and some of it made us might also just be

179
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:53,880
part of your habit and so those habits become automatic and

180
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:59,820
so you it's so wonderful you're noticing it during your meditation and it's just okay

181
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:06,299
yes important let me just open back up and slowly over time we just keep coming

182
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:12,779
back and back and yep we get to create a new habit yeah I liked what you said

183
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:18,779
about important about you know sitting with someone important and then

184
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:24,900
that person being yourself that helped remind me to sit up straight

185
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:33,539
Tracy beautiful all right maybe one thing that I will add is um

186
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:40,260
the manner in which we're sitting like for me I notice when I'm sitting here with my back against that I'm a little

187
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:46,500
bit more leaning forward and then it makes it easier to do this than if I'm sitting

188
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:51,900
um probably the reason why I sat on the floor probably is because my feet don't touch the ground and I don't want to put

189
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:58,320
my bare feet on something so but um when we're sitting with maybe like the pelvis

190
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,720
is just tilted a tiny bit forward then it's easier to be upright because that's

191
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:09,419
kind of like how our spine is meant to be but chairs these days are they don't

192
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:17,100
allow that like you're going back or something like this so it can just to work with our anatomy to be if it's

193
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:22,500
possible for some people you know they need the back support to support their back but to it to be a little bit more

194
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:29,940
upright and that will also help with sleepiness if I ever feel sleepy meditating it's when I'm leaning using

195
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:36,900
the backrest that's just for me personally so just something else that might be helpful

196
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:42,419
yeah and this yeah and you know finding the right posture this is definitely

197
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:47,880
something that takes practice like we try this oh that didn't work so well try that that doesn't work so well or

198
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:54,360
something like this so and I just sit on the floor because my legs aren't very long and it's a way for

199
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:59,940
me to sit upright so I just wanted to maybe build a little

200
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:05,039
bit on what uh Tanya was talking about here with regard to meditation

201
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:11,880
and trying to use this word anchor and I like this word so often with mindfulness

202
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:18,299
meditation like when we're formally in a meditation posture and with our eyes closed that kind of thing we choose an

203
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:25,020
anchor and what we mean by that and as Tonya said most often teachers will talk about the

204
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:30,240
breath but it doesn't have to be the breath it can be sounds or bodily

205
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:37,080
Sensations and what do we mean by anchor so I find myself kind of doing this with my hands so the anchor is here and we

206
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:42,960
rest our attention on it the experience of breathing like for

207
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:48,059
example like feeling like that this little stretching that happens around

208
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:54,659
the chest and then the de-stretching the unstretching you know

209
00:29:54,659 --> 00:30:00,299
so what is the actual experience so we're not thinking about it we're like

210
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:07,340
feeling what does this feel like so this is our anchor and we've kind of like rested attention on it

211
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:12,740
Perfectly Natural that the mind is going to wander and start planning or

212
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:18,600
fantasizing or commenting or something like this and then you'll be oh wait I'm

213
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:25,919
supposed to be meditating okay and then it comes back and then you know the mind is going to do this again and then oh

214
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:31,919
right I'm meditating and then you come back so this is kind of what's happening is the anchor is this place where you

215
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:37,020
always come back while the mind is like going wherever the Mind goes right the

216
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:43,320
future the past or whatever's happening so choose an anchor meditation teachers

217
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:49,020
love to talk about the breath but can also be just sounds even though we're

218
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:56,340
not talking it's very common that there are sounds you know outside of the classroom or just people shuffling their

219
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:01,860
poster or people doing whatever they're doing you know so the meditation Hall

220
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:07,740
actually can be quite noisy even though nobody's actually speaking

221
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:15,179
or Tanya talked about bodily Sensations so an obvious one and an easy I

222
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:21,600
shouldn't say easy right because this is simple but it's not easy right if you noticed right doing any of this that the

223
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,940
mind is going everywhere except on the anchor but to just be um

224
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:35,340
with like the feeling of the chair or the cushion against the body so like feeling that pressure that sensation

225
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:40,860
can be another anchor so it turns out that you can

226
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:46,080
actually anything can be an anchor we're talking about the breath

227
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:53,220
because it's always available and because it's changing that makes it a little bit more interesting so it's a

228
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:59,340
little bit easier for the mind to land there on the breath

229
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:05,820
so one thing that about mindfulness practice that's different than perhaps some other just general meditation

230
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:12,779
practices but mindfulness meditation is that in something that we like to say is

231
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:19,620
that there are no distractions that I believe to say that that doesn't we don't have this word of distraction so

232
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:24,720
much so what that means is if you have this anchor the breath

233
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:31,140
and the neighbor's dog is barking or that Ding dog bark bark bark bark oh

234
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:38,880
it's supposed to be meditating bark bark bark bark you're like oh this dog then you come over here right you may have

235
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:45,120
other language that you use or something and then bark bark bark this dog like wow I'm never gonna

236
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:51,360
meditate don't they know this is my only time I have today to meditate and there's a little anger and whatever it

237
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:57,480
might be and we come back to the breath bark bark bark and then instead of this fighting with

238
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:03,179
it you just shift the anchor to be barking

239
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:09,120
oh the dog is barking in groups of three it

240
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:15,899
feels like this my body maybe every time there's a little bark maybe I feel this really slight little

241
00:33:15,899 --> 00:33:22,200
tightness or something like this or whatever reaction is and we might notice

242
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:29,220
that there's some emotions that are coming up and maybe a flood of thoughts where we're just paying attention to the

243
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:37,200
to the working in a relaxed easy way and part of the trick here is the

244
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:44,220
relaxed easy way because we want to of course we do we want to control our

245
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:51,139
environment and making it be as best as possible for meditation

246
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:59,039
that's not possible right we don't get to control the experience so instead we kind of like just fold it into our

247
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:04,880
meditation practice so you can switch and just bring that into your experience

248
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,618
or maybe you stay with the breath and then just as Tanya was saying make a

249
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:16,440
little note it could be the note could be sound so you just say quietly in your mind

250
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:22,260
sound come back to the breath sound come back to the breath

251
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:29,760
or maybe spark or dog or something but it doesn't matter what the word is

252
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,919
what's really helpful is just like placing a note on it is a way that we

253
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:41,280
can stop getting tangled up and involved with it with a big story making like that dang dog or I wonder what kind of

254
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:47,460
dog it is it reminds me of that dog that I had when I was little and right and then off we go right

255
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:55,220
so that's part of mindfulness meditation is this idea that we can fold anything in

256
00:34:55,220 --> 00:35:01,740
discomfort in the body sounds that are happening whatever it might be we can

257
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:06,960
turn towards them bring some open-mindedness

258
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:13,440
[Music] um attention and I kind of like some of the language that you were using Tonya that

259
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:19,320
uh you started off talking about like inspiration and Faith the faith being

260
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:24,359
this belief that this is beneficial it doesn't have to be faith in a anything

261
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:30,920
else so this that kind of maybe uh

262
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:37,500
warm-heartedness or softness or something like that as opposed to kind

263
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:42,540
of like okay here's this um the anchor and then there's then we

264
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:49,440
notice spark bark bark and then oh I'm supposed to be mindful of dang it what am I gonna get Mindful and like holding

265
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:57,480
on to the breath as much as we can there's a way in which we might like use as type of a sledgehammer or our mind or

266
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:03,359
kind of come back in a way that has a little bit of aggressiveness or a little bit of

267
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:10,079
energy a lot of energy to it and we notice this when

268
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:16,380
if when the bell rings if there's this sense of oh thank gosh

269
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:23,280
then that means there was a little bit too much energy because you can't sustain that right for very long so and

270
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,339
this is definitely the art of practice is finding the right amount of energy

271
00:36:28,339 --> 00:36:35,280
this is something that it's not like at one time you'll figure out okay not too

272
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:42,540
much not too little okay perfect I got it dialed in I know how to do this now it's something that we will always have

273
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:50,040
to be adjusting depending on what the mind's doing how the body feels Etc so this is something that's just integral

274
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:57,720
and to meditation practice is figuring out the the strength or the amount of energy I

275
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:03,900
don't even know what the word is exactly in which we pay attention and this is something that perhaps we

276
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:09,119
never even thought about before but we can explore and

277
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,940
discover as we do this meditation practice

278
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:19,039
are there any questions about what I've said so far

279
00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:30,920
there was a lot of words and I was speaking kind of quickly but

280
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:39,960
hello Diana hello Tanya thank you um you know when I first started at IMC

281
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:46,200
was June June 30th but uh and now it's October 20th and but I've been

282
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:51,839
meditating you know for six months straight and I

283
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:57,240
would say that the energy part of it at least the beginning and even now

284
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:03,660
obviously because I'm no way I'm still like learning and all that stuff but I

285
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:10,079
find that there are some sittings that I don't wait for the Bell anymore and it's

286
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:15,420
nice and I'm or you know even with this meditation when Tanya was guiding it I

287
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:22,380
was having like an imaginary conversation and I'm like oh go back to the breath and it wasn't so much the

288
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:29,099
dang it why didn't I and I'm like okay just be still it's cool I don't have to

289
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:34,859
and also if I when I'm breathing sometimes I'm not forcing I'm like oh go

290
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:40,920
back to the breath but let's don't have to force it or do whatever and I was kind of reverting

291
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:47,760
back to like just the counting because it's what I was accustomed to so it's just really nice it is like the the

292
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:55,320
from it just it's working he's like you're the beginning like beginning guide to meditation at IMC and

293
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:01,079
then establishing the practice and continuing I get it it's like I don't

294
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:08,040
know if that's the right way to say it but it's I I'm very very excited thank

295
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:12,859
you thank you for sharing that ah

296
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:18,900
this because you have a good teacher right because uh Tanya's been here on Thursdays

297
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:25,440
and sage has a maybe somebody on YouTube I would like to introduce a question from the Beyond

298
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:31,980
um the Beyond yes thank you something um someone was picking up uh actually

299
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:38,220
they posed this question before the dog analogy but I thought it would be related and helpful

300
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:45,440
um this person is asking like how to like is there a way to notice your thoughts while meditating without

301
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,579
judging them one way or the other so instead of judging Sensations how do we

302
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:55,619
be with our thoughts and not judge though yeah either to be with our thoughts

303
00:39:55,619 --> 00:40:00,900
so um there's a lot of things we could say I'll just say a few things one when

304
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:06,180
you're lost in thought no problem because you're lost in thought you don't even know that you're

305
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:12,180
going to be supposed to be meditating right so okay that's there's nothing to be done right you're lost in thought

306
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:18,180
two if you find that there's uh like there's this real momentum behind the

307
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:24,720
thinking it's just going on and on and on and or sometimes it's the same thing I gotta remember to do this don't forget to do that okay I gotta remember to do

308
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:32,040
this or we're rehearsing a conversation we had before planning or whatever it might be whatever it might be there's a

309
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:39,540
few things we can do one is to kind of to maybe unhook us

310
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:45,960
from the content is to just generally ask this question oh

311
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:52,980
are these images or are they sounds like what are thoughts

312
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:58,920
so we go we kind of let go of the content of the thoughts and look more at

313
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:07,560
the process of thinking because the process of thinking is happening right here right now so just

314
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:15,200
this like the gentle inquiry are these images or are they sounds and sometimes

315
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:20,700
shifting our relationship to thoughts in this way can interrupt the momentum of

316
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:26,400
the thinking thinking thinking thinking so sometimes that works and sometimes you might have to do it a lot like oh

317
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:32,460
okay here's this image and then we could ask questions about the images are they

318
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:37,560
in color are they clear is there a projection screen where is it if there

319
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:44,339
are sounds what is the sound or whose voice is it rather or you know something like this

320
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:49,380
and then maybe the third thing I'll say about thoughts and trying to just gonna

321
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:55,920
probably do a lot of teaching about thoughts when you did the intro class and you will again on November so there's a lot that we can say about it

322
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,920
but maybe I'll just um drop in

323
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:07,260
is there any motion that's fueling the thoughts I think there's something that's

324
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:13,520
underneath that's keeping those emotions that those thinking that thoughts going

325
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:19,800
for example often when there's a lot of planning happening and I know I've experienced

326
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:26,280
this a lot that oh there's a little bit of like fear or apprehension underneath it

327
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:31,500
because I'm trying to make sure that I can take care of everything so that I

328
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:37,260
don't have to because I'm afraid of what might happen if it's not going to go the way I want it to or something like this

329
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:43,500
so just this gentle inquiry so what I'm describing is in meditation

330
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:51,420
is a bit different than what we might do with journaling or psychotherapeutic setting with meditation it's more just a

331
00:42:51,420 --> 00:43:00,019
gentle just dropping in of the question is there an emotion that's fueling this

332
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:06,300
and then we just kind of like open and wait we do not like go and figure it out

333
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:14,480
this is our mind's habits are of course we want to figure it out because we want that thinking to stop but the power here

334
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:20,220
isn't asking the question it's not in finding the answer the power

335
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:26,160
isn't asking the question because there's this way of when we ask the question I go like this

336
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:33,660
with my hands because it's a way in which there's like being open to learning something open to something new

337
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:40,920
open to what might happen next so it might be that the answer bubbles up

338
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:46,740
and it might be that it doesn't and both are fine it's just asking the

339
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:52,020
question is a way I would again kind of interrupts the momentum of thinking so

340
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:58,400
those are just a few things that I'll say so thank you for that Sage

341
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:08,540
on behalf of the internet we're grateful thank you

342
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:14,180
yes that's right thank you Iris

343
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:22,260
um I feel like if you go through those steps and you

344
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:27,380
still feel very maybe like attached or the thought just kind of doesn't let go

345
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:33,180
how do you work with that I think maybe that causes me more attention and

346
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:41,220
anxiety when I go through the steps and it's like still there I can't it's not going away yeah

347
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:47,819
yeah it may not go away right that's the um Tony was talking

348
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:53,400
about habits of mind right we have habits of mind and there's so much of

349
00:44:53,400 --> 00:45:00,240
invested in our thoughts many of us are in our living thinking right and we've been educated so we get rewarded for

350
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:09,599
thinking so there's a lot of pressure behind it but it can it can when we can get to

351
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:16,560
where we um where the Mind settles down and the

352
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:23,220
thoughts maybe are going to the background and then they might get wispy and blend

353
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:28,619
soft while we're having like the anchor in the foreground so there might be a little bit of these thoughts floating

354
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:34,079
around while we're with the anchor but it could also be where there's just a

355
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:39,440
lot of thinking and then we can talk about well what supports

356
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:45,440
waking up out of thinking and coming back to the anchor

357
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:53,099
mindfulness supports mindfulness and maybe that leads me into one of the

358
00:45:53,099 --> 00:46:00,300
last things that I want to say here is that this is a skill I would say is

359
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:06,720
something that you know and we've all learned how to do things we all learned how to tie our shoes we all learned how to drive we all learned so this is

360
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:11,880
something that does take a little bit of practice with

361
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:18,240
but there's a um a way in which if we bring mindfulness more and more into our

362
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:25,020
experience then it just becomes easier to become mindful the more we do it not surprising just like everything else

363
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:30,060
right in our life so maybe I'll just say

364
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:36,599
um this that it's often when we talk about mindfulness meditation we talk about sitting on a

365
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:43,859
cushion being in a posture but we can be mindful all day long or we can do it in any

366
00:46:43,859 --> 00:46:49,380
posture we we are in doing whatever we are doing eating

367
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:56,520
maybe we take part of a meal or a whole meal every day and just be really present for the experience putting the

368
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:01,579
fork and the food feeling the arm moving tasting it something like this

369
00:47:01,579 --> 00:47:08,400
or we um talking about posture in the body maybe the feeling of the body moving as

370
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,740
it walks it could be mindful of that so it doesn't take any extra time but just

371
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:20,040
bringing our mindfulness to things that we're already doing and then that makes

372
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:25,560
a giant difference that when you come to sit on the cushion having had those

373
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:32,700
experiences of mindfulness and in other settings helps when you get to the cushion was that helpful Iris that was

374
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:39,540
yeah I think so okay I do think maybe I'm trying to force myself to not think

375
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:46,920
like there's like actually setting causes more tension because of the thinking and like the mindfulness

376
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:54,900
so yeah so is this okay Tony if I just say it went so then uh maybe one thing that um

377
00:47:54,900 --> 00:48:00,060
I can point to here is so there's I'm just going to make this up you have the

378
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:05,220
anchor and then you're lost in thought and then you wake up like oh right shoot

379
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:11,940
I've been I'm thinking I'm not supposed to be thinking and then what can be helpful is to

380
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:17,339
notice that second beat to like waking up and then notice the attitudes it's

381
00:48:17,339 --> 00:48:22,680
not uncommon to kind of have this little like oh shoot dang it

382
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:29,099
and just notice what that feels like that's mindfulness too okay and then

383
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:34,200
begin again in a Gentle Way as as best you can

384
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:39,839
and so this can be really and this is very common what you're describing I'll say and I certainly had lots of this

385
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:46,380
absolutely so just notice like Oh waking up out of being lost in thought and then just

386
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:52,319
notice the attitude or the tone or the word or something that like I should

387
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:58,079
know how to do this by now everybody else is probably completely enlightened or what am I doing here I shouldn't even

388
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:06,119
come here you know whatever stories we all make up right crazy stuff sometimes so just notice that like oh that's more

389
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:11,940
thinking and then come back to the breath so you can notice like the attitude or the tone and maybe there's a

390
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:18,599
whole little quick little story that happens when you realize that you've been lost in thought yeah that sounds

391
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:27,119
good thank you thank you Iris thank you Diana you're welcome Tanya

392
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:33,420
um so the next part would be to do some small group discussions but um you know

393
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:39,540
this is pretty important what we're doing right now clarifying what to do and what practice is so I just want to

394
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:45,660
make sure um your questions you feel like you got enough answers to any of your questions

395
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:53,040
before we move into the breakout groups okay great so why don't we do two groups of well

396
00:49:53,040 --> 00:50:01,380
one Richard you in or out of groups today okay two groups of four

397
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:06,540
um and um so it's easy enough just as long as you guys I don't think you know

398
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:12,359
each other so the u4 can come over here and Richard can go with these so you

399
00:50:12,359 --> 00:50:19,200
guys make a you go that way Tara Tara Tara great

400
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:24,420
okay and um so the first I'm gonna have you do first thing I'm going to have you

401
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:29,579
do as you sit down in your circle is number one when we're connecting in the

402
00:50:29,579 --> 00:50:37,680
circle we're still practicing mindfulness we're going to still be aware of what's

403
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:44,040
Happening as it's happening and one of the nice things is to stay aware of your posture

404
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:51,180
so try and stay upright so not leaning too far back and not

405
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:56,220
leaning too far forward we want to maintain kind of a balance of staying in

406
00:50:56,220 --> 00:51:01,500
our own bodies even as we're listening to others right staying grounded and

407
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:08,940
connected to our our experience and and then very is whatever you can be

408
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:16,079
aware of so talking oh I'm I can feel my vibration of the sound in my mouth you

409
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:21,599
know I'm aware of that as I'm talking or when I'm listening

410
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:27,420
um the feeling of hearing or the impact of the words emotionally on my mind or

411
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:32,700
my body or my heart so just trying to help yourself stay

412
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:38,819
aware as you're speaking and listening so the first invitation now while

413
00:51:38,819 --> 00:51:46,020
practicing mindfulness is to go around the circle and if you each share your name

414
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:54,200
where you're living and why what inspires you to practice mindfulness

415
00:51:54,200 --> 00:52:00,780
then just go around the circle and you know maybe take up to a minute half of

416
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:07,319
30 seconds to 45 seconds let's say per person so not long

417
00:52:07,319 --> 00:52:14,339
um and I'll be watching you to see when both groups are done so whoever has the longest hair maybe they could start in

418
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:16,700
the group

419
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:26,180
hi my name is

420
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:21,720
foreign it

421
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,720
is

422
00:55:44,839 --> 00:55:52,440
a different settings today

423
00:55:55,500 --> 00:56:00,740
to wake up

424
00:56:01,619 --> 00:56:05,838
great and so

425
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:10,339
I have no idea

426
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:35,540
they're like in this kind of shift and focus thank you

427
00:56:37,339 --> 00:56:40,640
mostly I think

428
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:23,760
go ahead and finish your sentence yeah don't finish your sentence yeah make

429
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:29,819
sure yeah okay so one more question for you

430
00:57:29,819 --> 00:57:36,240
and what I would like to do is invite you to um I'll tell you what the question is

431
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:43,700
which is what might happen if you practiced mindfulness every day

432
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:50,339
and then so Ann Rose just answer what comes up for you like one thing that

433
00:57:50,339 --> 00:57:56,900
might happen and then Iris you you say one thing right and then

434
00:57:56,900 --> 00:58:04,680
Mustafa you say one thing and you just kind of keep going around and around spiraling around right makes sense so

435
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:12,480
you don't have to say everything that might happen just the thing that comes up that feels oh this you know

436
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:19,260
um and if you have a hard time with that one you could also sit you know just say you could offer what you might want to

437
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:24,480
do to help yourself practice mindfulness okay and we'll just do this for about

438
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:31,260
five minutes and so just you know talking sharing an idea letting the next person and letting yourself be inspired

439
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:37,460
and impacted by what you hear other people say all right

440
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:44,580
cultures

441
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:06,900
you know how do you make it fresh

442
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:09,738
everything

443
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:20,758
just checking in how was the you feel is this a good time

444
01:09:20,759 --> 01:09:28,258
to shift yeah you guys too sure thank each other and then let's make a

445
01:09:28,259 --> 01:09:33,980
circle so pull your chairs let's make a more intimate Circle here

446
01:09:37,819 --> 01:09:44,178

447
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:51,718
yeah great yep beautiful

448
01:09:53,759 --> 01:10:01,400
do you guys mind scooting up a little closer yeah there we go

449
01:10:10,730 --> 01:10:15,400
[Laughter]

450
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:27,900

451
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:33,480
yeah yeah great

452
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:42,420
great so um now we get to just share with each other a little bit about what came up for you

453
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:48,780
um maybe you know I I tend to believe that it's really useful to restate

454
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:53,820
something that was important to you kind of helps you your mind take it in is

455
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:59,640
important and helps you remember it and it's also then gets to share with people

456
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:04,679
who weren't in your group and they get to hear maybe something new

457
01:11:04,679 --> 01:11:10,440
um so is anyone willing to start and then we'll just pass it in a circle the mic

458
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:16,460
does anyone have something they'd feel inspired to share to start

459
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:24,800
construction thank you Tracy thank you

460
01:11:25,739 --> 01:11:30,780
so I'm inspired it by Manuel who

461
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:36,960
was surprised and and I loved it he was surprised that he was able to this is

462
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:42,780
first time amazing quiet his mind and he was surprised when he when his mind was

463
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:48,179
still and that was so inspiring to me I just I

464
01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:53,280
I loved that so that supported your practice made you

465
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:58,980
feel inspired yes great and so why don't you choose to pass the

466
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:06,140
mic one way or the other okay thank you

467
01:12:08,179 --> 01:12:14,159
and you do have to hold it up to you sure okay uh

468
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:19,639
no I mean so far it's been a really great experience

469
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:29,460
it really confirms that I'm in the right track of because I'm in the process of rebuilding my life I guess I've actually

470
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:35,280
starting a new life I think it's a correct word and uh

471
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:42,960
paying attention and developing new ways of connecting with people

472
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:49,159
um compassion tightness and things like that probably are going to help me a lot

473
01:12:49,159 --> 01:12:57,060
in mindfulness you know the give me the opportunity also to slow

474
01:12:57,060 --> 01:13:05,880
down and just pay attention to what I really want or what I don't want so that's

475
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:11,060
that's what I'm getting from beautiful thank you

476
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:26,340
what am I supposed to talk about um if there was something that you

477
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:33,659
connected with that you heard that you felt was inspiring or supportive oh yeah yeah so the fact that you know everybody

478
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:42,800
here is here showing up and the best they can best we can

479
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:49,020
and uh I'm inspired by that I mean the fact

480
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:55,860
that uh you all have busy lives you know and you do uh you know you're out there

481
01:13:55,860 --> 01:14:01,140
every day doing whatever you're doing having families working you know all of that

482
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:06,300
and you still take the time to come and work on something this significant which

483
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:12,020
is to learn how to you know create a more

484
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:19,140
compassionate kind you know world that we can all live in and be in together you know especially in this culture

485
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:25,980
today where we have some divisiveness that comes up in different places so it's you know just being able

486
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:31,620
to commit to that in our lives and to make it a priority it feels pretty

487
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:38,400
inspiring to me very inspiring so and that this place is run by all

488
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:44,820
volunteers like Diana and and uh Tanya and you know and Richard

489
01:14:44,820 --> 01:14:51,239
yeah and me and other people and Sage you know so the fact that you know this

490
01:14:51,239 --> 01:14:56,460
place can't happen if we don't all decide to help make it happen so

491
01:14:56,460 --> 01:15:05,300
I'm grateful for that so that's inspirational great you can just hand it to Sage leave it on yeah thank you

492
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:14,640
thank you um I think once stood out to me was a

493
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:20,460
like you would expect um quite a bit of our discussion centered on ways that we can

494
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:26,340
Shore up like what I would call like hesitantly like perceived

495
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:31,620
shortcomings and things like that um but we really like blows me away is

496
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:37,320
like you know like Richard said like everybody's here and like despite the fact that so much of what we

497
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:43,199
like do and like think and our lives come

498
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:49,860
from like seeds that we planted forever ago or seeds that aren't even our responsibility like people are like

499
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:55,199
committed to like doing the work to make changes

500
01:15:55,199 --> 01:16:00,659
and uh even to get to like resistance like in

501
01:16:00,659 --> 01:16:05,300
choosing to show up when you don't want to like that's right you're impressive

502
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:17,820
I just forgot the question all right yeah just put the mic up to your mouth and what it what was did you hear or say

503
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:22,920
connect with anything that inspires you to practice mindfulness here

504
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:29,040
uh well I mean it seems like we even though it is different between us it

505
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:34,860
seems like we're all kind of here for the same thing and and that's in itself the most inspiring

506
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:41,760
thing is just everyone here we're kind of going through the same things but in different ways beautiful thank you

507
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:44,360
Mustafa

508
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:52,199
to be reminded of all the different ways it's helped people

509
01:16:52,199 --> 01:16:59,520
recently of kind of I feel like for the first time I've put her right her like lack of motivation with practice

510
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:06,960
um so these like reasons all kind of help oh that's great I was that's so nice and that's um you know the the

511
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:12,659
support of Sangha right we really can help each other Inspire each other

512
01:17:12,659 --> 01:17:18,380
remind each other we learn from each other thank you

513
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:26,820
ah I'm very grateful I think gratitude was the one thing that also came up for the practice and for everyone's just

514
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:33,420
kindness and receptiveness and being non-judgmental like because I know I can

515
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:39,000
say things that are kind of well any anyhow so I'm just I I just really like

516
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:46,020
that I can be who I am and not feel pressured to just say something to impress people I

517
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:53,460
just need to say something I I don't need to I want to say something just because for the sake of this for my

518
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:58,460
practice and for my betterment thank you thank you

519
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:04,500
um I think what resonated with me is just feeling like so much of what I have

520
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:11,219
felt kind of internally through meditation or mindfulness as being like kind of named or labeled as like the

521
01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:17,159
experience of it and the process and it feels really wonderful just to hear this

522
01:18:17,159 --> 01:18:23,940
commonality that we share as humans and you know just these little experiences

523
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:30,000
and things that I've had it's like oh that's what that is and you know when you were talking about mindfulness and

524
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:35,400
just to hear from you Richard that you've been you know doing this for so many years and you have and you have

525
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:43,500
these little moments or these little epiphanies where you feel a shift and it's like oh yeah I've had that too and just to to fill that you know Collective

526
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:50,900
sharing of inexperiences I really love that yeah that's nice

527
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:57,540
full circle yeah and so we have you know little time if

528
01:18:57,540 --> 01:19:03,380
there's um any other questions

529
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:09,960
that people want you know to ask um or anything else you want to share

530
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:17,960
about practicing mindfulness I'm not required it's just optional

531
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:30,540
so um we all tend to drive in California

532
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:36,719
you know like there are people that I've had come out here for different events

533
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:43,320
from the east coast and I say to them you know there's no public transformation transportation from where

534
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:49,199
you're going to be working you know you need to and they just don't quite get it

535
01:19:49,199 --> 01:19:54,840
and so one of the things that can happen here in California is you're going to drive

536
01:19:54,840 --> 01:20:01,880
the driving is one of the best in my experience this is my experience mindfulness

537
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:07,620
realms to work with because first of all you're going to

538
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:14,480
make it safer for everybody you know if you're mindful and

539
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:22,679
it just it's wise to to bring mindfulness into driving and I don't

540
01:20:22,679 --> 01:20:28,739
think we do it quite enough we get caught in you know radio shows or whatever we're

541
01:20:28,739 --> 01:20:35,219
doing we're not paying as much attention as we should be we're you know we're thinking about other things instead of

542
01:20:35,219 --> 01:20:40,679
knowing driving is like this boom now I'm driving

543
01:20:40,679 --> 01:20:46,080
right and I know what I need to do as I'm driving

544
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:53,280
so it's it's um it's sort of I don't know if it's it's like a little bit of a evangelist about

545
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:58,620
it to be honest because I'm always scared when I'm driving to be honest

546
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:05,280
there's a lot of fear I'm experienced I experienced quite a lot of fear as my mindfulness grows like

547
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:10,620
what's really underneath this fear you know a lot of fear because it's

548
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:15,719
dangerous you know it's really a dangerous thing and we just take it for

549
01:21:15,719 --> 01:21:22,620
granted so you know like I could go on all night but I don't plan to thanks thanks for listening yeah it's a great

550
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:29,280
reminder that we can practice doing anything we can be mindful in everything

551
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:34,219
we do and um

552
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:40,620
I think that's shift to I'll say one thing that um

553
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:46,320
when we ring the bell three times just so you know we're ringing the bell for

554
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:52,739
the Buddha the Dharma and the Sangha so you know that's what it's three Bells

555
01:21:52,739 --> 01:21:59,100
right I thought yeah and at the end of any meditation or

556
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:05,159
Dharma talk or event or Retreat whatever you do there's something called dedication of

557
01:22:05,159 --> 01:22:11,219
Merit and this is um this comes out of the the whole

558
01:22:11,219 --> 01:22:16,440
philosophy of generosity and the whole Devotion to do our

559
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:21,960
practice for all beings that we're doing this for the benefit of ourselves

560
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:28,140
for others and for both and so at the end of a practice period

561
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:34,860
we dedicate the Merit of our practice and we dedicate it to all beings without

562
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:40,500
exception right that's the overarching theme and there's lots of

563
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:46,260
ways to do that but one of the things we've been doing here

564
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:52,560
is you know I can say let's dedicate the benefit of our practice to all beings everywhere

565
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:58,080
and there's probably a lot of beings we don't even think about that don't come to mind

566
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:03,179
and so on Thursday nights we've been doing a communal dedication of Merit

567
01:23:03,179 --> 01:23:10,199
where we pass the microphone around and each person can offer a being a type of

568
01:23:10,199 --> 01:23:17,340
being or a group or a cause an animal just something short that is on their

569
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:22,380
mind that you would like us to remember and acknowledge and that we want the

570
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:29,640
benefit of our practice to go to them too and it helps us all bring more beings into our mind so

571
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:36,239
and we'll do that now and and then at the end of that we'll Diana will ring the bell three times

572
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:42,420
Richard please start I can't so I'd like to dedicate a practice

573
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:49,620
tonight to members of the Sangha that are you know quite mature

574
01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:56,520
and one of them is Stephen uh Browning he's an artist and you may if you're

575
01:23:56,520 --> 01:24:02,960
lucky someday see some of his work he's phenomenal Woods uh called wood print

576
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:09,900
artist and he's going blind and deaf at the same time so

577
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:15,920
and his partner Pat so that's what I'd like to dedicate to them

578
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:27,420
I wasn't prepared because he connected me with something that happened with me not long ago I

579
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:34,020
so I'm dedicating my time here tonight to my mom who unfortunately passed away

580
01:24:34,020 --> 01:24:41,219
oh time ago recently and so that's

581
01:24:41,219 --> 01:24:44,000
beautiful

582
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:56,219
I'm going to dedicate this to my boss Catherine

583
01:24:56,219 --> 01:25:02,640
who needs a lot of kind thoughts

584
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:10,400
I'm dedicating my practice tonight to my two sons Liam and James

585
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:18,980
I would like to dedicate this practice to anyone feeling lonely or isolated

586
01:25:19,590 --> 01:25:26,340

587
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:30,840
any of the overthinkers nice

588
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:41,420
um I dedicate this to work honestly that's where I'm lacking the most

589
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:47,780
um May the benefit of our practice

590
01:25:49,199 --> 01:25:55,320
be for the highest good of incarcerated people living in cages across America

591
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:58,638
may all beings be free

592
01:26:01,860 --> 01:26:08,480
