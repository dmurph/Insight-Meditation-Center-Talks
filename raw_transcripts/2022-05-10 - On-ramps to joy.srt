1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,640
so tonight i want to talk about

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,000
dharma gladness dharma joy

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:22,240
and there's lots of different flavors or ways of experiencing dharma joy but

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:29,359
and we'll talk a little bit about that different kinds but in particular i want to talk about um

5
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:35,920
dukkha and faith and their relationship to dharma joy

6
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,000
and just to kind of give you a little bit of a description

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,120
and a simile of what um i'm feeling into through my practice

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,680
around this is kind of uh imagine that um

9
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,440
the dharma joy the dharma gladness that i'm talking about is um

10
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:07,360
it's just that little those little like many off often many smaller moments

11
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,799
of uh delight surprise connection

12
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:19,520
that feeling of being fully present right of like wow feeling the sun on the skin

13
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:26,960
something really simple or a bird right landing somewhere where you can see or

14
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,920
um just that somebody's eyes making connection with yours right just

15
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,119
it can be um it's it's a really a moment of meeting

16
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:46,720
meeting our experience in the moment and it comes with some degree of upswelling

17
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,520
and so i kind of have this image of

18
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:02,719
maybe a river or something um that's flowing right the present moment of

19
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:08,039
flowing this movement and then there's all these little

20
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:13,120
tributaries or kind of it's funny in my imagination um

21
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,200
the river is up higher than these other things this is just because of the feeling of it right

22
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,800
and sometimes we're more in the muck of

23
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:31,599
things we're more in the mind and worry and more in the dukkha of life

24
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,640
and it doesn't feel like we're gliding along in that sort of clean smooth

25
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,680
feeling joyous kind of presence

26
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:51,280
but there can be this kind of weak might be

27
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:58,480
kind of in the muck a bit and something can happen something can come along something can shift and we

28
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,800
can feel this upwelling this upwelling and this lift and then we get to be in that current of

29
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,239
the moment and so um

30
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:16,239
this is sort of like the simile is you know the slower

31
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:23,360
muckier places can be where we get stuck in things and we're having some degree of suffering or we're

32
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,840
clinging and we're just not really in the flow

33
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:35,599
and as we're going along if we remember if we notice what's happening if we have some clarity about what's going on

34
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:41,599
if we see we're suffering the first noble truth we might be able to recognize what we're

35
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:47,360
clinging to what we're holding on to and when we see

36
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,680
we're clinging when we see with wisdom that we're kind of stuck

37
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:01,599
if we have been practicing and we've watched this dynamic we know

38
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:07,439
we know that if we keep clinging it's only going to get worse

39
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,799
and so we let go and then that letting go is that

40
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:19,040
possible moment of upswelling the faith the belief that if i shift in how i'm relating to

41
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:28,120
my experience yeah i can move more freely

42
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,639
so this is the little simile that i'll kind

43
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,400
of come back to and i'm going to

44
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:47,840
move through these three things this the dukkha the faith and then the dharma joy

45
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:57,120
and i'm going to read you a little short quote about the joy and then i'm going to talk

46
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,280
about the suffering and then the faith and then back to the joy

47
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,160
so tar brock says that joy arises when we are open to both the

48
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,840
beauty and suffering inherent in living like a great sky that includes all

49
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,039
different types of weather joy is an expansive quality of presence

50
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,840
it says yes to life no matter what

51
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,440
so saying no to life might be the equivalent of suffering

52
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,639
right when we say no to what's happening

53
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:46,080
in the dhammapada there's a couple of verses that kind of talk about the mind and

54
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:53,520
happiness and they go like this the mind hard to control

55
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,280
flighty a lighting where it wishes one does well to tame

56
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:07,840
the disciplined mind brings happiness the disciplined mind brings happiness

57
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:14,479
here's another one the mind heart con to control flighting a lighting where it wishes

58
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:21,000
one does well to tame the watched mind brings happiness

59
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:28,479
when it comes to dukkha and kind of seeing where we are caught in life

60
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:34,720
sayadaw utinia says we need to learn our lesson there's no shortcut

61
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:41,280
we really have to find a way to relate to our suffering in a way that

62
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:48,319
you know helps us choose joy choose happiness instead

63
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:55,680
so watching the mind right learning to watch the mind and

64
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,759
sort of like watching your footsteps you know choosing where you're going to place your feet we can

65
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:07,599
be like that with our minds we can choose what what trains of thought we're going

66
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,880
to follow what rivers we're going to choose to ride

67
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:21,599
and as we watch the mind and see kind of get to know its contents its habits its patterns

68
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:28,240
that's it's like you know in that boat on the river we become more skilled

69
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:35,039
getting more and more clear oh if i go down this tributary it's going to be really sticky

70
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,440
and we should we can choose not to go that way

71
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,360
the buddha um talked about five spiritual powers or five spiritual

72
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,599
faculties and that these are said to be incredibly important for our practice to move

73
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,360
forward and they are faith energy mindfulness concentration and

74
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,879
wisdom and they're progressive um we start with

75
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:11,599
faith it's necessary for us to step into the practice

76
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:18,080
and it's like an on-ramp it's on the on-ramp to the flow

77
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,720
and um

78
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:36,479
so what happens when we get caught and are suffering you know why why don't we

79
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:43,440
just if we know the way out why don't we always just choose to

80
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:51,440
be happy or easy or whatever not so not so simple but

81
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:59,120
made me think about um like this idea can you think about a moment

82
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:08,200
a very mild stress suffering dukkha you might have experienced recently

83
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:16,000
and just notice whether you were aware of it

84
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:25,519
and then notice if there was any tendency to either kind of just resign

85
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:32,640
or resist either just say oh

86
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:39,040
well i'm gonna just do it wrong anyway so i might as well just go for it and be you know

87
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,560
suffer here or you know no i don't want it to happen

88
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:51,839
that way i don't want it to go this way i don't want to feel the way i'm feeling the resistance

89
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:58,720
very often when suffering happens we either give up resign or get

90
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:05,600
indifferent or we rebel or resist it's very often our response is

91
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,519
well mine is it yours you notice is that familiar

92
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:17,360
in your practice to that sense of resigning giving in or

93
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,200
giving up or resisting trying to fight reality

94
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:31,120
i saw one head nod yes does that mean i'm not not talking i want to make sure i'm talking to all of you

95
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,720
all of you i need to change what i'm saying if i'm not getting you right right so

96
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,600
okay so there's an alternative

97
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,360
relationship we can have which is this one that you know when

98
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:55,760
when we see suffering when we start to learn to see it as

99
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:02,560
um oh i'm holding on to something i'm struggling i'm hurting

100
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:11,040
it's like feedback it's that simple it can be seen so simply as just

101
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,800
stop wait look what's happening notice pay attention

102
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,800
wake up a simile for suffering that i really like is um

103
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,079
similar to the river thing but this is on the side of a freeway

104
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:33,279
highway usually you ever drive down the highway and you start to

105
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:41,200
veer off the road and you hit those rumble strips on the side that kind of like make your tires

106
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:47,279
vibrate and your car bounce really quickly i kind of think about suffering is like

107
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:54,000
rumble strips it's when we're veering off the course when we're moving you know moving off

108
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,519
the path it's like this natural feedback that we're

109
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:05,920
going the wrong way and we can [Music]

110
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,959
we can resist and just keep trying to you know

111
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:16,320
drive on the rumble strips because we think we should be able to drive over there you

112
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:22,560
know or we can give up and drive off the road right or we can go

113
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:28,240
oh this is really irritating but thank you for waking me up

114
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:34,639
thank you for like giving me feedback that i'm about to drive off the road here

115
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,839
doesn't mean we can think you know we have to feel like it's a pleasant experience or

116
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:47,920
but we can be grateful we can have faith that they're placed there for a reason that they're there to

117
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:55,519
help us stay on the road we have a choice

118
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:09,839
another way yeah i like to think about the this relationship with suffering is a very

119
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:17,040
from a very uh kind of a i guess a therapy-minded position which

120
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:23,600
is um when we are when we're hurt

121
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,880
when we're you know in a situation where we're being harmed

122
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:35,120
the fight-or-flight response comes up right which is typically

123
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,880
we either fight it right so we're resisting it same thing

124
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:46,160
or we're running away right those are the two main responses

125
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:52,399
to being attacked or harmed to fight or to run

126
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,760
and then the other response is to freeze right when we haven't been effectively

127
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:03,040
able to escape or fight back we tend to go into a neurological state

128
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,720
of freezing and to me this is kind of the same thing it's just that the

129
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:15,040
dukkha that we're experiencing in life or the stress is is not something you know

130
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,399
like being attacked but our nervous system responds similarly

131
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:31,440
so if we can start to see suffering in a

132
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,920
different way maybe a radically different way

133
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:43,839
we can see that it's like it could potentially be that on ramp

134
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:49,600
to joy it helps us

135
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:57,199
see we have a choice and if we know we don't have to suffer

136
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:02,240
if we know we get to choose it's really natural to feel a sense of

137
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,440
faith and hope right when we recognize i can do something

138
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,120
right here i can shift how i'm relating to what's happening

139
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:20,560
there's a wow like how amazing is that

140
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:29,040
and that can be like a that transition from the suffering with

141
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,560
the faith to that joy

142
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:41,519
so the faith is what grows in us as we start to see ourselves over and over again

143
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:47,440
um seeing how we make things life make life more difficult for ourselves or easier

144
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:55,839
for ourselves right when we engage with the practice and we're paying attention to our lives

145
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:02,720
we can notice what the practice does for us it we can notice that it helps us

146
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:09,120
be more present be more connected be less afraid

147
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,920
be less anxious be more open

148
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:23,680
some of the things that also can support our faith in the practice are reflections on the buddha the dharma and

149
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:31,920
the sangha right so the teacher who got free the dharma the teachings

150
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:37,600
and the sangha this is a sangha look at this the source of inspiration

151
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:45,360
aspiration support and can help us grow our faith

152
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:54,880
i think faith grows in when we we take in this kind of goodness

153
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,800
take in the goodness of the practice

154
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:10,720
and said that in the samyutta nikaya it is faith that is one's partner

155
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,240
and wisdom that instructs

156
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,558
and faith is one's greatest wealth

157
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:34,080
do you feel you have faith in the dharma the sangha or the buddha

158
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,840
do you feel you have faith in your practice and that it can help you or that you've seen

159
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:46,240
others does that support you yeah

160
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:53,200
it's a precious precious thing for us and um

161
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:00,240
yeah you know seeing even seeing somebody else in their goodness or seeing how they've changed through

162
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:06,880
their practice can grow our faith when we can't see it in ourselves

163
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,440
keep looking around

164
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,640
so this faith is the supporting condition for gladness for joy

165
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:27,520
it helps us stay on the path stay present and helps us keep choosing this radical

166
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:33,520
act of turning toward turning toward turning toward

167
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:43,280
and lamont she wrote she has a quote i'm going to read for you which

168
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:49,280
i love she says almost everyone is screwed up

169
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:55,520
broken clingy scared and yet designed for joy

170
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:01,440
not great i think that's just such the greatest quote just you know we've all got the

171
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:08,960
stuff going on and we're designed for joy it's right there it's right in us the capacity

172
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,720
to experience connect to feel and i don't just mean like you know you

173
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:22,240
don't have to be like fireworks going off just that that feeling of that flow that feeling

174
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:28,559
of presence that feeling of it can be like wonder right aw

175
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:35,519
appreciation joy is the heart celebration of life

176
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,840
and uh

177
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,919
anthony demello says that you know

178
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:54,559
so there's this idea that we've gotta say yes to the joys and the sorrows right to connect with life we don't get

179
00:19:54,559 --> 00:20:02,480
to say no to the dukkha if we shut down to difficulty we shut ourselves down to joy

180
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,600
as well right we have to sort of learn how to be with it all

181
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:15,360
so anthony demelo says when there is absolute cooperation with the inevitable

182
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,640
this is when we're really in our practice absolute cooperation

183
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:29,360
with the inevitable this idea that where we're not trying to

184
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:35,840
resist that we're already depressed resist that we're already

185
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,840
anything we're here we're right here we're in our moment and when there's absolute

186
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:49,120
cooperation with okay here it is right this this that is kind of like

187
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,600
that on-ramp to the freeway to the joy

188
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:01,480
we we can't divide the present moment into good parts and bad parts

189
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:09,840
we disconnect one from one we disconnect from both no i don't mean

190
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:16,559
i don't mean we aren't discerning in our lives i don't mean i mean talking about meeting that the

191
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:23,200
moment this moment that's already arising i don't mean don't be discerning about

192
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,320
your plans or your jobs or who you do things with

193
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:34,480
discern discern discern choose wisely but you know once we're here

194
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,840
we're here this is it you know this is it

195
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:46,480
this is now this is what we've got so once we're right here

196
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:53,840
we don't get to press erase life is additive not subtractive

197
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:07,039
so joy is that openness that includes both the joys and sorrows aliveness and openness available to the whole play of

198
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:14,559
existence the thing to remember is um

199
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:23,440
you know joy and gladness don't come first right um fearlessness follows fear

200
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:29,600
practice follows forgetfulness seeing follows not seeing

201
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:35,760
peace follows truth you know it's like the gladness can follow the suffering

202
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:42,080
the faith and the suffering it doesn't have to come first right

203
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:52,559
faith is there to help us remember help us see there's another way

204
00:22:52,960 --> 00:23:00,399
an alternate route a different way than habitually responding and reacting

205
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:09,039
there's a man named ross gay and he wrote a book called the book of delights and he

206
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:14,159
he decided to write this book and so he went about it like every day going into

207
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:20,799
life looking for little delights and of course it was a wonderful experience for him

208
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:26,640
because the more he looked the more he saw right and he's just like

209
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,720
tumbling into delight after delight but one of the amazing things that he

210
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:40,320
says that he puts together is that our suffering and our our joy

211
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:48,320
are not so separate and one of the things he says is what if we joined our sorrows

212
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:55,279
what if we joined our sorrows i'm saying i'm saying what if that is joy

213
00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:02,840
when we really come to ourselves really come to this experience we join

214
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:07,200
it instead of resist it

215
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:13,600
what what kind of a mindset would write such a thing right

216
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:19,720
what has he experienced that he could say that

217
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:25,919
i wonder you know i i was thinking about this and

218
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:34,559
i thought about being with somebody who was dying actually

219
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,320
somebody who i love deeply and being with them

220
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:47,279
so present with them right so here you know this is a sorrow right this is

221
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:52,400
a loss and being with him and being in that

222
00:24:52,400 --> 00:25:01,640
sorrow with him was a joy it was such a joy it was so alive

223
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:11,799
he was dying but what does that mean he was the most alive person i knew at the time

224
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,919
joko beck charlotte joko back she has some nice quotes on

225
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:30,640
joy and differentiating it from happiness and she says joy doesn't mean the same thing as

226
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:36,320
happiness happiness is the up up up

227
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,760
i like that up up up joy

228
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,600
is the peace and what is

229
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,480
the reality is that when we experience the moment fully for whatever it is joy

230
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:58,320
is revealed you want me to read that again yeah okay

231
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:04,000
joy doesn't mean the same thing as happiness happiness is the up up up

232
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,200
joy is the peace and what is the reality is that when we experience

233
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:16,440
the moment fully for whatever it is joy is revealed

234
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,799
yeah so like how do we have that mindset

235
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:38,840
right what do we need to do to support ourselves you know

236
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:54,799
i like the quote right from from was it tony morrison designed

237
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:59,919
designed for joy what if we believe we're designed for

238
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:05,120
joy that it's right there that it's right there that it's

239
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:11,120
accessible that it naturally arises

240
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:17,600
it's not something that we have to make happen

241
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:23,600
rather we have to be available for it willing

242
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:29,360
to let go into it to receive it

243
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,480
and there's something right there a friend was talking about

244
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:42,240
uh giving a talk on dharmajoy and how everybody was so resistant to feeling

245
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,600
joy for me that's that negative negativity

246
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,880
bias in our brain right there's this part of our brain that's always more biased toward the

247
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:58,399
threat what might be negative and it just wants to pay more attention

248
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:04,480
to that so this is where i think we have to make ourselves available we

249
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:11,120
have to recognize that deeply ingrained survival strategy

250
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,399
that's not doing us so good anymore and step back

251
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:23,840
and go okay yes yes to joy yes to gladness yes to receiving a teeny

252
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:29,279
tiny moment a sip instead of maybe 24 ounce or

253
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:35,840
super size me drink right it's it's it's a small bit maybe bit by bit but how do

254
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:41,240
we keep saying yes right

255
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:54,799
so i want to just invite you to take a moment close your eyes

256
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:02,000
and just just see if you can connect see if your mind can offer you

257
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,919
a memory or the imagination

258
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:15,279
of an experience of this kind of dharma joy that gladness or happiness

259
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:22,080
this aliveness maybe even might be a word that could be used

260
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,120
it often feels spontaneous

261
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:32,158
just sort of like a gift that pops up

262
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:40,000
just connecting with that whatever comes up and notice what does it feel like in

263
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,919
your body as you recall or imagine

264
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:58,240
what do you notice how willing are you to sip it

265
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:05,760
to breathe into it to let it soak in to come in deep

266
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:14,919
how quickly is the mind ready to dismiss it and rewrite it or move on

267
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:29,840
maybe also take a moment just thinking about the rest of your

268
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:36,480
evening tonight imagine what it would be like if you

269
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,679
really received

270
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:48,880
the teeny tiny little gifts of ease and well-being

271
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:54,480
just the softness of a pillow or a blanket

272
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:59,600
the flavor of your toothpaste or the clean

273
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:05,919
clean water that you drink clean water what a gift

274
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:11,600
what would it be like to really open to each of these little

275
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:18,399
sips tonight and lay down and put your head on your pillow and

276
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:24,158
just feel it flowing through you all these little gifts

277
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,278
may it be so for you may it be so

278
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:49,120
i wonder if any of you um would like to share anything

279
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:54,640
about a question or reflection at this point

280
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:01,360
we're winding up i have a few more quotes i can share but if there's anybody that feels

281
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,480
inspired to share anything right now i'd like to create space for that

282
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,840
jim has a microphone so if anybody wants it he will bring it to

283
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,840

284
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:28,278
okay here we go thank you

thank you tanya um i think you're right that

286
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:44,720
when i'm meditating and i feel

287
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:53,279
a moment of [Music] mindfulness or awareness

288
00:32:53,279 --> 00:33:01,279
i think there is some joy there but i think that what happens is that i

289
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:06,399
i do tend to dismiss it and and to say um

290
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:12,720
oh well this is this is the the most that i can that i can feel and there's and there's

291
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,720
so much more that i'm not able to access

292
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:25,919
rather than just appreciating the joy that is there

293
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:32,000
thank you for sharing that it's like it's sort of again this image of this river and you

00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:38,079
were speaking about joy was um i always park about the same place uh

305
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:45,599
when i go to my office it's about five minutes from my office and i walk on this nice uh residential street and

307
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:57,839
listening to whatever i'm listening to and just uh seeing the birds or seeing the sun often

308
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:02,960
and just having those five minutes

309
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:09,119
just brings me right there

310
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:18,560
yeah one of my most profound i shouldn't call it that but a very

311
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:24,000
memorable retreat experience was just walking meditation

312
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,680
right but then a little bird was in the bush and it popped out

313
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:35,599
and i just was had the gift of a flood of like delight

314
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:41,839
it was such a simple thing but you know here i maybe was just practicing with trying to

315
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:47,520
be present so i could receive the gift but it was really profound

316
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:53,680
really small little things very moving and helpful right starting your day that

317
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:59,839
way every day what a nice choice what a nice gift

318
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,119
anyone else feel inspired

319
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:27,760
thank you natalia thank you dear sangha um i really appreciate

320
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,960
you showing the difference between happiness and joy because i feel like happiness

321
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:39,680
is almost like a semi-permanent or permanent expected expected state of being that i've never been able to get

322
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:45,040
to but i do experience joy frequently throughout the day

323
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:50,880
it's really helpful to know the difference oh beautiful yeah charlotte jokobek has another

324
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:58,640
sentence in there about how you know in the west in america we're like so conditioned we have so much

325
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:04,320
you know we have so much material and access to all this stuff and we're just

326
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:10,400
kind of grown to have some sort of expectations that we should be happy and we should

327
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:17,119
just we should be happy because we have things it's just not that's not happening that's not joy

328
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:23,119
i'd much rather have joy much rather have joy so i'm really

329
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:29,280
really grateful you've shared that thank you thank you so much

330
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:42,640
any other comments questions reflections

331
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:54,720
no worries if not just creating enough space for you to decide if you want to go for that microphone

332
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:02,760
just receiving just the delight of this sharing the space together

333
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:22,240
let's see yeah maybe i'll just say um

334
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:28,079
to notice the flavors of of gladness

335
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:35,359
the shades of gladness the colors of gladness of joy there's

336
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:40,960
it's it's a huge range actually

337
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:47,720
and you know the mind because of its orientation toward the negative

338
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:56,960
it it can very easily skip over anything that is neutral to slightly positive

339
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:03,280
even even really like positive feedback or

340
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,400
nice things that can happen if we don't attend to them if we don't

341
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:13,599
meaning give our awareness to them our appreciation if we don't receive them

342
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:18,720
let them come in they slip through they're just gone they

343
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:24,960
don't get committed to memory they don't get that attention they just slide on but

344
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:31,920
one trip one awkward moment

345
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,079
gets a lot more attention a lot more of our awareness

346
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:44,400
we're much more inclined to tell somebody about something that was hard

347
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:50,079
even couldn't find parking i had to drive around the block for you know

348
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:56,640
six times and but then they got out and they got to walk for five minutes in this beautiful neighborhood

349
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:03,520
and they don't even mention that they just talk about how they had to drive for you know too long to find

350
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:08,800
parking it's just the way the mind tends to operate

351
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:14,800
it's how it's evolved and how it's been conditioned it's not bad

352
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:23,359
but we need to we need to watch the mind that's what brings us happiness we start to learn how the mind operates

353
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:28,400
and we then can start to learn how to relate to it in ways that

354
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:34,720
are on ramps to joy so

355
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:41,280
i feel like that's probably the last thing i should say may you all choose on-ramps to joy

356
