1
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:53,120
so a warm hello from Redwood City

2
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:04,680
and the topic this week for meditation and for that little talks is equanimity

3
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,100
and one of the very important aspects of equanimity

4
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:15,120
to cultivate or to think

5
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:24,240
develop Equanimity is um to realize something very profound and very wise about the nature of choice

6
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,699
that people have choices that they the choices that they make

7
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:34,800
and this is true in meditation as well and we I don't think we have much talk

8
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,919
about choice in the context of meditation maybe because it brings up

9
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:46,199
too much the thinking and reflection and perhaps

10
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:52,440
too much self-consciousness where we're really trying to let go of self-consciousness and really settle

11
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:58,259
down and not think so much about what's happening but really get focused

12
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:05,699
and clear and recognize what is happening so the however choice is operating all

13
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:13,680
the time for us and one of the opportunities in meditation is to as the mind gets

14
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,440
quieter and still learn more focused is to see how much choice we have

15
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,780
and then to carefully lovingly

16
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:32,699
peacefully make choices and it can be as simple as a choice to

17
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:41,039
it's you're better off spending time with your breathing and getting focused then thinking about

18
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:48,060
um you know what websites might be interesting to visit today

19
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:53,400
and um and so you know you the thinking about websites can wait

20
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:59,940
there's a better choice to stay here with the breathing it might be a choice about how we return

21
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:06,840
to the breathing if we don't see we have a choice some of us might jerk the Mind back we might be

22
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:13,979
angry for being distracted and thought but if we see the moment of choice we see we have a choice about how we relate

23
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:19,680
to the mind being distracted How We Begin Again with the breathing and we

24
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,319
have a choice to perhaps relate to the thinking mind as a friend in a friendly

25
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:31,020
way or as a as a wayward friend who said friend you know that's not the direction

26
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:38,219
to go and come back here come with me um keep me company here so I can return to

27
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:44,580
the breathing something that's Kinder and softer and gentler than the harshness of maybe jerking back

28
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:50,880
or being upset with oneself and then coming back to the breath in a way that's peaceful

29
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:57,300
not in a hurry not aggressively not with high expectation but a simple matter of

30
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:03,839
fact peaceful way but also committed way to be back with the breathing

31
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:10,920
we have a choice when we're focusing on the breathing whether to do with laxidasically to do it without to kind

32
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:17,399
of complacently without much effort kind of wishful thinking oh I hope something helps me to stay on the breathing

33
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:23,220
or we have a choice we can make the choice to come back so okay I'm here I'm going to plant myself here

34
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:31,019
I'm going to organize my very being okay I'm going to be here and the best I can

35
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:39,660
lovingly peacefully I'm going to really try to stay connected to this as if uh maybe I'm carrying

36
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:45,120
caring for a young newborn baby and in

37
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:52,080
my arms and I just want to make sure I don't drop the baby I want to make sure the baby feels safe and held and cared

38
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:58,640
for and and I just really stay and be present and feel it

39
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:05,040
so a choice and the choices you make are consequential in meditation

40
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,800
so how can you use your capacity for choice for recognizing Choice as you

41
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:18,180
meditate so that it helps you get more peaceful and settled how can you make choices in meditation

42
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:26,160
to support you to be present at ease calm peaceful and really kind of

43
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,260
engaged in a peaceful and relaxed way but in a in a

44
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:36,959
dedicated way just this this is the most important time to make a choice

45
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:42,839
that this place where you're sitting now this is the most important place this is

46
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:48,180
the most important time this is where your life at your

47
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:54,600
attention your life force is most valued most beneficial

48
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:00,360
and to make a choice to really stay here with us

49
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,880
and if you don't want to make that choice if you have other things you would rather choose to do I think about

50
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:12,959
what websites to go on or plan the day and things like that and it's really clear then you maybe

51
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,120
know oh this I have a different preference I have a different purpose

52
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:23,220
and to be clear about that maybe changes your relationship to meditation or maybe

53
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:29,700
supports you so to take a meditation posture and

54
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:37,399
assume a meditation posture and to

55
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:43,320
choose a posture that is the best of your ability will support you

56
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,940
during this meditation time

57
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,699
and if it's comfortable for you you can close your eyes

58
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,420
and to have the choice the decision to

59
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:14,839
cultivate an ability to be present in this body at this time

60
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:25,700
and express that choice in taking a few gentle long deep breaths

61
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:33,180
and perhaps as you exhale maybe exhaling with a either vocally or

62
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:38,000
silently with a kind of ah

63
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,600
ah where that ah is it real

64
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:50,639
support for really being here and feeling here

65
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:57,959
if you do that loud uh uh maybe the way that the sound vibrates

66
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:04,700
from your vocal box and down into your bodies

67
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,720
carries you into your body

68
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:21,079
As You Are to relax the shoulders and the body here

69
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:29,959
and then to let your breathing return to normal

70
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:39,660
and to become attuned

71
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:44,000
to your exhales

72
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:51,720
a little bit more refined attention to the body

73
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,720
exhaling

74
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:04,620
perhaps ever so slightly letting yourself exhale a little longer

75
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:11,399
than usual not so much that it's a strain but just maybe for a moment more than

76
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:18,839
you would otherwise choosing to let the exhale be more

77
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,740
complete

78
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:35,639
and then as you do so to also relax places in your body that

79
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:41,240
can be softened and released

80
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,320
the muscles of the face

81
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,779
the muscles of the shoulders

82
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:07,699
maybe softening the belly

83
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:20,000
and if possible if there's a softening the hands and the arms

84
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:44,399
and then for the next few breaths being attuned to the inhale

85
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,500
really feel what it's like to inhale from the very beginning

86
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,459
to the end

87
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:02,699
and you have some choice about how you experience the inhale

88
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:08,519
maybe choose to the attitude to have towards it

89
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:14,760
to be one that's allowing non-judgmental

90
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:24,860
maybe just simply curious or

91
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:32,639
generous allowing it to be just the way it is and you choosing

92
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,860
to receive it or to know it

93
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:43,339
just as it is

94
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:05,420
sometimes I've imagined the inhale is like

95
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,438
riding as some kind of

96
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:20,100
some kind of vehicle that takes me up to the top of a hill

97
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:25,039
and then the exhale is uh sliding down

98
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:37,520
when it's time to Exhale choose to be there

99
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:43,260
for the full slide The Full Experience

100
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:49,260
be there peacefully allowingly allow this

101
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:55,940
way of this part of breathing to unfold on its own

102
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:48,900
and then as we continue sitting the mind wanders off or something new

103
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:55,740
happens notice at what point you have some choice about how to

104
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:02,220
respond or to that and as soon as you notice you have some

105
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:07,620
choice choose the peaceful choice

106
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:12,620
choose the ease will ease easeful way

107
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:21,299
of engaging your attention yeah it choose the peaceful way

108
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:24,620
of being mindful

109
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:42,179
when and as you get quieter and Stiller appreciate there's more choices to have

110
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:48,080
for being attentive peacefully

111
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:57,360
to concentrate easily

112
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:07,559
and you have a choice about how often you choose

113
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:13,279
be relaxed and at ease no hurry

114
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:21,780
but don't linger and use your ability for choice

115
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:30,539
to choose the peaceful mindfulness the easeful concentration

116
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:36,380
as we sit now in silence

117
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:03,260
your freedom is found in the choices you make

118
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:14,658
and if you don't make choices consciously your mind will choose for you

119
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,398
in a way that you're not really free

120
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:32,659
to find the peaceful place where wise choices can may be made

121
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:37,940
for using your attention

122
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:46,740
to choose to be in the present moment peacefully consciously

123
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:53,480
mindfully is the path to Freedom

124
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:19,520
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

125
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:28,339
to appreciate that to love is a choice

126
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,279
to be compassionate is a choice

127
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,880
to be kind and have good will as a choice

128
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:51,500
it's a choice by where for how we where we put our attention

129
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:57,619
what we choose to notice in other people and

130
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:02,059
what we choose to notice in ourselves

131
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:11,339
and if kindness and good will love and compassion

132
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:18,680
is valued then a peaceful Choice can be

133
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:27,180
to look upon the world to look upon others with

134
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:31,280
kindness with good will

135
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:40,460
not waiting until we just happen to have good will or it's an accident that we have it

136
00:36:41,339 --> 00:36:46,619
and it's an action to have good will and compassion

137
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:54,180
you don't have to feel it necessarily it's a choice of how we look

138
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:59,480
how we are present for our experience

139
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:05,460
and so as we come to the end of this sitting I'd recommend that to the best of your

140
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:11,820
ability you choose to look out across the world to the

141
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:18,920
people you know and others with kind eyes

142
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:25,640
with an attitude of Good Will and generosity

143
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:37,680
and to value our connection

144
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:46,520
our interconnectioned with others the mutualities of Our Lives

145
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:57,960
and then to have the desire to share

146
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:04,380
whatever benefits you have from meditation today whether those benefits are known or

147
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:09,960
unknown choose to share it with others

148
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:17,460
in the way that we do with the dedication of Merit May whatever benefit and Merit that has

149
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:24,420
come from this meditation today may I look for opportunities

150
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:30,960
small and big to share it with other people

151
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:38,280
if I'm calm may I bring some supportive calm to others if I'm Wiser

152
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:43,740
may I bring wisdom if I'm more able to choose to be

153
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:51,480
friendly and kind of generous let me do so in the

154
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:56,119
in the ways in which I communicate with people today

155
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:03,420
May It Be that the way I choose to live my life

156
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:12,859
is one way or the other knowing or unknowingly for the welfare and happiness of others

157
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:17,299
may all beings be happy

158
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,500
may all beings be healthy

159
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:31,640
may all beings everywhere be free

00:39:56,339 --> 00:40:02,420
so good day and

163
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:08,700
I suddenly find myself feeling I think quite happy to sit here

164
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:14,160
I think because of the topic of equanimity Equanimity Brahma viharas

165
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:22,140
that I'll be speaking about so this is the second talk in this series on equanimity

166
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:28,700
and um the um

167
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:34,980
so that as a form of care for others an attitude of caregiving and attitude of

168
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:41,940
kindness Goodwill for others uh Equanimity is when that Goodwill

169
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:47,760
is equanimous or not reactive or not um

170
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:55,740
agitated when at Goodwill is not influenced by any kind of pursuit of Desire of wanting

171
00:40:55,740 --> 00:41:03,480
something and uh and not caught up in repulsion or pushing away or not wanting something

172
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:09,500
and so and this comes into play particularly

173
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:15,800
importantly when it's hard to have good will for people it's hard to have pure

174
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:21,119
love or kindness for people because of the circumstances they're in

175
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:28,020
and um and so one of them is that uh when people make choices

176
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:36,240
for themselves that are not for their own benefit and the um and to have Equanimity for

177
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:42,740
people who make choices that uh or for their even they're they're harming themselves with a choice

178
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:49,200
that's their choice and that's their agency that's their choice to make a

179
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:55,800
choice in a sense even if it's unconscious the choices they're making and but the choices of Their Own

180
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:01,980
and so how how our Goodwill comes into play when people are making choices of

181
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:09,000
poor choices is part of the part of the domain of the of this uh Brahma Brahma

182
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:16,380
vihara of equanimity so it doesn't make you know so certainly we can feel compassion for people

183
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:22,200
but the idea that you know to try to help them and want to help them and when

184
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:27,540
they're making the choices that are going in the opposite direction it's kind of exhausting for the person who's

185
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:35,160
compassionate and maybe maybe pointless uh to have appreciative joy for their

186
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:41,820
Joy when we know they're making bad choices we know that suffering is coming is also challenging for the person who's

187
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:47,040
wise and sees what's going on but to be able to see this person is

188
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:52,740
making choices there are unfortunate choices they're going in a poor Direction

189
00:42:52,740 --> 00:43:02,520
I still keep my heart open to them I still have this Good Will and care about them but it doesn't and I harm myself if

190
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:09,420
I get all agitated by it if I get contracted around it or if I keep pushing to be compassionate and try

191
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:15,780
everything I can to help the person or if I go along and celebrate with them when what they're doing is actually kind

192
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:23,220
of quite harmful even though they have a kind of a joy um and uh so how now to harm ourselves

193
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:28,920
uh with our Good Will is a little bit the domain of equanimity

194
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:36,359
so the word Equanimity in Pali is upeka and it has that it comes from the root

195
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:41,819
verb to see to view to up to observe

196
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:49,380
and it kind of uh the etymology of the word kind of means to have an overview of the situation and I think of it as a

197
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:55,859
bird's eye view and so to not be lost in the in the details of everything but kind of have

198
00:43:55,859 --> 00:44:02,640
the overview of everything so we see it see it we can see it with wisdom and see kind of the bigger picture of it so

199
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:10,980
we're not caught in the details so uh there are times when people for example uh will do you a favor and they

200
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:18,420
you come to work or someplace and a colleague says you know I had a really difficult night last night or that's

201
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:24,960
very hard you know I have a family who has covid people are dying or you know

202
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:31,500
or that my child was up all night and throwing up and having fever and

203
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:38,460
and uh and they come to work and they say they say you know it's had a hard time and I'm really irritable

204
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:45,300
and uh and you say oh thank you for telling me and then if you find that there expressed some irritable kind of

205
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:50,760
tendency uh that um you're much more forgiving of them you say oh you know

206
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:56,940
they've had a hard time you have the overview of why they are the way they are and so you they're more you're more

207
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:02,819
have more space for them to be that way they've warned you they've been kind enough to warn you and let you know and so you kind of get out of the way okay

208
00:45:02,819 --> 00:45:09,119
that's just that's that's today they're that way and you feel for them you have compassion for them

209
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:16,619
a little bit so you you kind of equanimous about how they maybe say a mean thing or they cut you off going to

210
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:21,780
the bathroom because or something um whatever it might be

211
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:27,660
and so in that sense there's an overview of this equation a bigger picture of it and so we're more equanimous and we're

212
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:36,359
at ease with how what to do so upeka is a wisdom Factor where our

213
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:41,579
understanding of the situation is really useful for having that granimity to

214
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:46,680
Simply hold ourselves in an equanimous way is probably not so helpful if

215
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:53,220
because holding and assuming something which is not really true for ourselves can also be exhausting and be harming

216
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:59,819
for ourselves so to under to begin kind of finding how do you have that bigger picture how do

217
00:45:59,819 --> 00:46:06,599
you have the view the understanding of circumstances and of other people so that when we have good will for them

218
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:11,700
when it's appropriate we have Equanimity meaning we don't get agitated we don't

219
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:20,099
get Restless or upset or contracted and and so one of the one of the classic

220
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:29,099
teachings in Buddhism is that everyone is has their actions as their

221
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:35,880
own and um uh the uh everyone people their

222
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:41,640
actions no one else makes like for your your actions are your own actions that

223
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:47,520
no matter your circumstances where you found yourself in life there's a lot of unfortunate things that happen to people

224
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:54,300
we get sick and in all kinds of ways or we end up living in a war zone or some

225
00:46:54,300 --> 00:47:00,900
ACT some a car drives into us we're doing nothing wrong but someone else maybe is not paying attention they run

226
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:06,540
into us and we're injured and so those are not our choices to have these things happen

227
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:13,980
but uh but when we choose to we have a lot of choices and how we choose to

228
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:20,460
respond to any of that how we choose to live our lives we're always at a moment of choice

229
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:26,160
and when we are practicing mindfulness we start seeing more and more the places

230
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:32,220
of choice more and more we we notice that there's actually a lot of choices Moment by

231
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:37,500
moment if we're not mindful we're just on automatic pilot we don't see that we

232
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:43,020
have choices about how we stand and how we look at people and when we speak and

233
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:49,380
when we don't speak and how much food we eat or don't eat it just we're automatic

234
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:56,040
pilot a habit comes into play or craving comes into play or aversion comes into play

235
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:01,800
and it's a it's driving the the boat we are not in charge

236
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:07,859
but when we see the place of choice because it's just clear in the quiet

237
00:48:07,859 --> 00:48:14,540
open mindful mind then when we exercise that choice

238
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:20,040
we it's up to us the consequences of that choice

239
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:26,280
so if I uh see a a you know a

240
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:33,660
a thorn sticking up out of the ground and I see it I know it's there and I choose to step on it and if I cut my

241
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:38,940
foot in his blood that was my choice to do that because I

242
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:45,240
I chose to step on it that's a kind of dramatic example but if

243
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:51,000
you see you have a choice about what you're going to say and you feel angry and you're going to use a swear word

244
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:57,839
with someone but you see you clearly have a choice if you say the swear word and the person

245
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:05,099
gets angry back that's partly a consequence of your choice that that happened or that person walks away and

246
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:14,099
doesn't want to talk to you that was partly a consequence of your choice but if you see that choice then

247
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:21,300
and then you can say well wait a minute I have a choice here what choice do I want to live by what is my deepest

248
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:27,180
Choice what's the deepest value as I want to live by here what's most important for me a pause and look and

249
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:32,700
choose what that is and uh and so

250
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:37,980
um when we want to have we see that other people have Choice as well

251
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:44,400
and we can't be in charge of the choices other people make and we might support them we might help

252
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:51,839
them advise them all kinds of things we might do but ultimately people make their own choices

253
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:57,540
and when they make choices which are not wise for them they are they they it's

254
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:04,619
it's their consequences they're going to have to live with and if those consequences are unfortunate it's

255
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:11,819
heartbreaking sometimes but to not get our our good will our love for them

256
00:50:11,819 --> 00:50:17,700
tied up and dependent on the choices they make

257
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:24,420
so that we don't exhaust ourselves with our compassion we don't kind of regret the ways in which we

258
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:30,359
celebrated with them or um you know and so to have good will

259
00:50:30,359 --> 00:50:35,700
with this overview of looking at people or make these people that I love that I

260
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:42,000
care for they're making choices and those choices are not wise

261
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,700
and so I have to allow them I have to be generous enough certain generosity to

262
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:52,980
give people the autonomy the Dignity of making choices of Their Own

263
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:58,140
and then they have to live with the consequences I will offer what support I can I'll try

264
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:05,460
to be supportive but I'm not going to be responsible for the all the consequences of their

265
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:11,760
poor choice they're going to have to live that out themselves to some degree exactly what degree how much we're

266
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:17,760
involved and don't involved has a lot to do again with uh the consequences we

267
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:23,220
think will come about by offering our support for someone if we think we can

268
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:28,260
actually turn the boat turn them in a new direction or help support them to

269
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:35,460
come to a new way of living maybe it's really great to offer a lot to them but there's you know but not to but be very

270
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:40,559
careful we don't harm ourselves in that process and this is why mindfulness is so

271
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:48,839
important to really track ourselves and see what's going on inside of ourselves and we have choice we make choices as

272
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:55,260
well and can we choose the peaceful choices it doesn't mean the passive choices it

273
00:51:55,260 --> 00:52:01,920
doesn't mean that uninvolved choices it means whatever choice we make can we do

274
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:07,140
so without the the negative alternatives

275
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:12,180
to equanimity can we do it without a

276
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:17,460
Pursuit without chasing something wanting something

277
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:22,500
getting something and kind of getting caught up in that need for something to happen

278
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:28,140
and can we do it without a repulsion or contraction or reversion

279
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:34,440
or pushing away or closing down or pulling away in horror or something

280
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:42,359
can we do it without being restless and without being agitated can we do it with the mind at ease

281
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:49,260
and if we mind is at ease then the Good Will as as Equanimity and it becomes the

282
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:54,559
Equanimity Brahma vihara so um

283
00:52:54,559 --> 00:53:00,240
beings are so I'll read you the very famous

284
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:06,359
almost it's used liturgically in Buddha about Buddhism about this that I see it as an understanding appreciating

285
00:53:06,359 --> 00:53:13,980
people's place of choice um oh maybe I don't uh

286
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:19,640
maybe I lost it here um

287
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:27,180
beings are beings have beings have actions

288
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:34,500
I take as being choices as their own they have actions as their Refuge they

289
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:41,420
have actions as their Heritage and they have actions as their

290
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:47,040
as their closest relative as their what they're connected to

291
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:54,900
so actions and choice are closely related here and so be careful with the choices you

292
00:53:54,900 --> 00:54:01,680
make and not to be hamstrung not to be inhibited not to be

293
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:09,180
um passive in some kind of negative way use your choices so whatever you do in

294
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:16,260
the world you do without hurting yourself so you say at ease

295
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:22,200
stay peaceful stay equanimous in a way that allows the

296
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:27,660
best qualities of who you are to be shared with the world too

297
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:30,740
thank you very much
