1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,839
good evening let's see this microphone doesn't feel

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:16,160
quite right there we go

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,720
good evening welcome welcome

4
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,560
so i'll do a little guide in meditation

5
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,840
here

6
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,239
and just settling in

7
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:59,839
to this experience right now

8
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,438
i remember somebody once describing it as

9
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:27,840
getting the mind and the body in the same place

10
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,240
and to do that it can be really helpful to

11
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,840
feel into the body the bodily experience

12
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:55,840
just in general how does it feel in the body right now

13
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:08,800
maybe there's some tiredness some restlessness some achiness

14
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,360
as best we can we welcome these experiences

15
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,840
maybe not welcome in terms of invitation but they're already here

16
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:37,840
so acknowledging what's here

17
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,920
and feeling the body breathing

18
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:19,840
the movements associated with in-breaths and out-breaths

19
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,319
maybe you feel that in the belly in the chest

20
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,959
maybe sometimes the ribs even around the back

21
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,640
or maybe the air going in and out of the

22
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,840
nose

23
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:41,199
and when the mind wanders we just very gently simply

24
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,840
begin again

25
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:33,840
and if we notice an uncomfortable sensation in the body

26
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,880
can we make room for it as best we can that is

27
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,320
not hating it or trying to shove it away

28
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:57,440
but to somehow recognize that it's actually there

29
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:07,840
and can we befriend it or

30
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,080
somehow allow it to be there

31
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:21,840
because it is there

32
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:37,440
and if we can bring our awareness to our experience

33
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,440
even if it's an uncomfortable one

34
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,720
and somehow we don't get lost or swept away

35
00:06:52,800 --> 00:07:00,639
or carried away when we're with bringing awareness to

36
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,840
our experience

37
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:17,840
accompanying our experience in some way

38
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,759
and each time we accompany or bring awareness

39
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,759
to an uncomfortable experience

40
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,840
we learn something

41
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,800
we learn it's possible

42
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,640
to bring our awareness

43
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:55,839
to that which perhaps we want to avoid

44
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:11,839
and we also learn that somehow it's okay

45
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:19,200
after we bring our awareness like we survive in some kind of way there's a

46
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,839
little bit of confidence or

47
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,680
familiarity

48
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:37,600
of being with difficult experiences so even if

49
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,920
at that particular time the particular instance we bring

50
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:51,040
awareness to an uncomfortable experience

51
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,440
maybe it seems insignificant

52
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:04,399
but this is exactly exact precisely how

53
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,440
we grow our capacity to be with difficulties and

54
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:19,839
gain confidence to be with difficulties

55
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:56,640
and as we gain familiarity

56
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:04,399
with being with difficulties as we gain confidence

57
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:11,440
being with difficulties just by

58
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:19,200
being with difficulties in meditation even minor ones feeling that

59
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,519
itch rather than scratching it

60
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:31,039
noticing our reaction to the neighbor's dog barking

61
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:38,720
these simile seemingly small little movements

62
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:45,679
really make a difference as we train so to speak the mind and

63
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:53,039
heart to be able to hold

64
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:58,080
these difficulties

65
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:05,279
because all of our lives have difficulties and if we can hold them more and more of

66
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:11,760
them not only does our life unfold

67
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:18,559
differently but it enables us to help others

68
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:25,200
maybe to recognize when they are in difficulty or to be an exemplar of

69
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,039
how to show up in difficulties

70
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:39,440
so may our practice together be for the benefit of all beings

71
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:55,840
everywhere without exception

72
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:41,520
good evening good evening welcome welcome wherever you are whatever time it is

73
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:46,158
whether it's evening when you're listening to this or not

74
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:54,480
so today i just um finished the last class of a course

75
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:02,960
called the path of fearlessness so this topic of fear

76
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,399
as something that i've been thinking about it's on my mind and on my heart a little bit

77
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:18,000
this how how we work with fear how we are with fear how fear shows up

78
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:26,559
and of course there are different types of fear one is uh due to imminent danger

79
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:34,640
that is uh seeing a rattlesnake while we're out for a walk or a car that's veering over into our lane

80
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:44,799
or something like that so some real imminent danger there's that type of a fear like some bodily harm might happen

81
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:50,480
soon and then there's also maybe i'll say and i'm not talking about that so much

82
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:57,840
that's a natural response and it's important and helps keep us alive

83
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:04,240
it's uh an appropriate response but we also might have some fears that

84
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:12,080
are less pressing don't have a fee not so much associated with some imminent danger maybe just a fear of

85
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:20,640
public speaking is not so uncommon or

86
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:29,840
fear of being seen a particular way you know not doing the right thing or something

87
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:37,919
and also we and so maybe i'll talk a little bit about that today sorry and but also

88
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:44,640
there is we could distinguish between fear and anxiety and there's a number of

89
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,679
different ways in which we might make these distinctions but one way

90
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:55,679
is to say that fear has a clear object i'm afraid of public

91
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:03,919
speaking and i feel this dryness in my mouth or jitteriness in the body or something

92
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:10,320
like this maybe it's a little aside i'll say

93
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:18,640
that there was a time in which my head this really increased heart rate

94
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:24,799
would be beating really fast and before i really understood it i just assumed that it

95
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:31,279
meant that i was afraid and so then i started making up all these things that i was afraid of

96
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:39,679
but then when i when that kind of got taken care of i realized oh it was i was misinterpreting

97
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:45,120
this rapid heartbeat as i was afraid

98
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:51,360
so there is fear that has this bodily experience

99
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:58,399
most often our hearts don't beat quickly for no reason but to distinguish between fear and

100
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:04,960
anxiety anxiety also can have an increased heart rate or

101
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:11,839
but anxiety tends to not have any particular i shouldn't say this maybe it's a more

102
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:19,760
diffuse maybe it's not so clear what we're anxious about

103
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:26,720
anxiety tends to be maybe a little bit more pervasive or a little bit more

104
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:32,240
um touching different areas of our life but maybe not you know maybe in some

105
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:38,079
ways that those distinctions are artificial but maybe it's an invitation for you

106
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:43,760
to discover for yourself the relationship between fear and anxiety

107
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:51,440
and so i would like to talk a little bit about fear this evening and

108
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:58,960
and some of the ways in which working with fear can be really beneficial and not

109
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:06,480
only because it's a difficult experience and not only because i don't think anybody wants to feel

110
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:14,240
afraid so for the most part it's something that we're trying to manage so that it'll go away but

111
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:20,720
there can be something really valuable about working with fear

112
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:29,680
in addition to learning how to be with difficult experiences and in the guided meditation

113
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:35,839
i was suggesting that when we do look when we do gain capacity to be with

114
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:44,320
difficult experiences it really can be a great support for our life and i would say fear in particular

115
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:50,640
as something that can be a support for us but i would say it really can be a

116
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,680
support provided where it's not overwhelming

117
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:02,640
if it's overwhelming then of course we need to take care of that and one way to

118
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:09,280
stop feeling overwhelmed is to feel the experience of fear in the body maybe

119
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,480
it's rapid heartbeat maybe it's a dry mouth whatever it might

120
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:20,240
be and as best we can to allow the fear to be there

121
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:28,960
and in some ways maybe even allow the fear to be

122
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:36,560
okay to be there as best we can as best we can

123
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:44,240
and then if we can allow the fear to be there maybe we can become curious about it

124
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:50,000
and learn a little bit and investigate it not so much that we have to figure

125
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,880
everything out while we're in meditation but at other times when we're off the

126
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:02,720
cushion perhaps to get curious about it

127
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:10,000
so to help us explore fear again this is maybe not so much on meditation

128
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,760
during meditation and not so much when we're feeling overwhelmed by it

129
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:24,160
but in other areas of our life to help this exploration i'd like to share a poem

130
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:32,560
and i'm just going to share the first part of this poem this poem kind of unfolds as a

131
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:40,320
short story so the first part of this poem this poem is called hello fear

132
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:46,960
it's by rosemary trauma and the first part of the poem goes like this

133
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:54,640
there i was making tea in my kitchen when fear hit me like a school bus

134
00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:02,839
i didn't need a scientist or therapist to tell me it hurt i screamed ah i shouted

135
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:08,400
no but after smashing into me fear just opened the folding

136
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,839
glass door of the bus yanked me on then plopped me into a green

137
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:21,599
vinyl seat i love this i think it's very um evocative this idea of you know fear is

138
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:28,800
never invited right we never really wanted it just comes careening in and

139
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:36,720
and i think it's uh this poet she's choosing to use a school bus as kind of like the vehicle

140
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:42,480
i'd like to suggest that we might use examining being curious about investigating fear

141
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:49,839
as a vehicle and i'll unpack this a little bit as we go but i think that the poet rosemary trummer

142
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:55,920
we can think about his school bus maybe in some ways we were younger

143
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,440
we were children when we were on school buses so there's a part of us that feels young

144
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:10,320
and vulnerable when we feel fear but also buses carry a lot of

145
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:16,720
people so we don't know how many other people are on this bus but

146
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:23,200
maybe there's a whole lot of people when we get pulled onto this bus of fear

147
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:28,880
and maybe we don't notice them at the time because we're feeling fear but

148
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:35,760
might there be a way in which we can imagine connect to this common humanity that

149
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:41,599
fear is something that humans experience it's a good thing it's helpful for us it

150
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:48,960
keeps us aware of the rattlesnakes and the car veering drifting into our lane

151
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:56,960
but also to just maybe there's some support and knowing that there's others and

152
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,000
maybe the others that can accompany us with our fears

153
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,680
and also i appreciate in this poem that the fear just arrives

154
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:14,720
the bus with fear on it arrives and they get yanked on they open the door of the bus and we get yanked on

155
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:21,760
sometimes we feel that way right when we have difficult experiences we feel like whether we want to or not

156
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:28,640
like we get whisks whisked away and off we go

157
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:35,119
so that the poem continues so she's on the bus on the green vinyl

158
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:41,359
seats i'm laughing because that's my memory of school buses also with green vinyl seats

159
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:49,359
i don't know if they still do but so the poem continues i'm scared

160
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:56,640
i said yeah fear said because i'm scary yeah

161
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:02,960
i squealed as the bus careened through the couch through my bedroom through the

162
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:10,880
splintering dining room table so in this poem the school bus is

163
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:18,560
carrying fear with our protagonists the poet perhaps or maybe ourselves and going through all

164
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:25,040
the areas of a person's life the couch the bedroom the splintering

165
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:33,040
dining room table and in the same way i'd like to suggest that working with fear

166
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:39,599
can take us to many areas of our lives sure we might experience fear in all

167
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:45,960
areas of our lives but i want to suggest that working with fear being curious about it

168
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:52,240
investigating learning how to be with it can also touch so many different areas

169
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:58,240
of our lives in fact maybe it provides a window working with fear

170
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:04,560
provides a window into our inner life maybe some emotions that have been

171
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:11,920
tucked away that we've been kind of afraid to feel or maybe

172
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:19,839
if we work with fear we start to notice some of the stories that we've created about who we think we

173
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:26,319
are or the purpose of our lives or what we value because when we start to work with

174
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:33,920
fear we get a view of what are we trying to protect often fear fear arises when we feel

175
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:41,920
threatened so what what are we trying to protect so examining fear is a way in which we

176
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:49,119
might gain some clarity about some of our inner life and what's important to us

177
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:55,839
and maybe some ways in which what we're really holding on to isn't so helpful

178
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:03,280
working with fear also helps us to realize the way in which our fears might be limiting our

179
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:09,359
freedom in ways that we didn't appreciate we

180
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:15,520
might not be aware of the role fear has until we are asked to really examine it

181
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:22,720
i know for me that i noticed for quite some time early in my meditation practice there was an awful lot of planning going

182
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:29,280
on you know as soon as you know i was just spending my time planning you name it i was planning it what i was going to do

183
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:35,839
next and what i was going to eat next and what i was going to get at the grocery store

184
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:44,079
you know all these things the emails i was supposed to be sending all this stuff right maybe some of you can relate to this or

185
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:49,760
recognize this and it wasn't until that i really started to

186
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:57,280
examine i started to see oh there's fear underneath this planning i'm trying to

187
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:05,359
make myself be safe i have this idea as long as i just plan everything i'll be safe

188
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:12,160
i see this showing up sometimes in my dharma talks too that i try to plan them and then you know

189
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:19,200
maybe i get a little too stiff then but just the ways that we try to be plan

190
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:24,960
or prepare or take care of just because there's a little bit of

191
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:31,838
fear there somehow just recognizing the fear makes it a little

192
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:37,520
i don't know it shifts our relationship just if we're aware with it then maybe

193
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:43,200
we're okay i heard that earlier today if we bring some awareness to what's

194
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,838
happening then there's some confidence that can be there

195
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:55,359
so working with fear can also reveal some of our underlying beliefs some additional underlying beliefs may be

196
00:44:55,359 --> 00:45:00,800
that we have these beliefs that were only validated through the eyes of others

197
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:08,240
so it's so important how others see us and we're afraid that we won't be seen in a complementary way or

198
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:15,599
maybe we have the belief that it's dangerous to be strong and competent

199
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:22,560
so examining fear might highlight some of these things that otherwise maybe we wouldn't get

200
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:29,040
illuminated we wouldn't notice them we might notice some of our patterns of

201
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:36,240
reactivity oh yeah i get i'm a little bit afraid when

202
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:44,000
the refrigerator doesn't have is running out of food i feel like you know this sense of lack and i won't

203
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,359
have enough for i don't know we we we all have our own things that

204
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:55,440
we have some patterns of reactivity or second arrows we might notice oh yeah

205
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:01,599
fear shows up here or maybe anxiety shows up here

206
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:08,319
if we start to investigate fear we also might notice how there's this vicious cycle of fear and

207
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:15,200
clinging and fear leads to clinging

208
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:22,000
through identification clinging to a sense of self or clinging

209
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,560
to wanting to have things a particular way that's why we're planning right that things have to be a particular way

210
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:34,079
so that we can feel safe and then with this clinging through

211
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:39,280
identification and then with identification this leads back to fear

212
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:45,040
as we observe the objects of our identification under threat because of

213
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:53,359
course they are changing so whatever we're identifying with doesn't stay constant it doesn't stay

214
00:46:53,359 --> 00:47:00,720
steady it's not as predictable as we wish it were so fear and clinging fear

215
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:07,200
and clinging is this vicious cycle we know that clinging is a source of

216
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:13,760
suffering but maybe sometimes it's helpful to look at clinging like from the side view

217
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:21,520
and maybe one way is to look at fear again not when we're feeling overwhelmed

218
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:28,240
and not when maybe in our meditation practice maybe it's just enough to notice there's

219
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:36,079
fear but maybe outside of meditation to talk about it think about it journal about it kind of get curious

220
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:39,839
about the role fear has in our lives

221
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:49,359
maybe i'll say some other areas of our life that working with fear might travel

222
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:54,640
through is our relationship with death this of

223
00:47:54,640 --> 00:48:00,400
course is a natural fear that humans have

224
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:08,000
but to if we are looking at fear we could look at our relationship to death

225
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:14,160
we are all going to die we know this intellectually all of us know this

226
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:22,079
but maybe we can start to reflect on death in a way that allows us to

227
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:31,680
approach the dying process in a way that's sacred in a way that's liberating

228
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:38,800
and perhaps when we examine our fears and we look at our fear of death maybe

229
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:46,960
we decide that we'd like to do some death contemplation practice marina sati practice

230
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:55,119
a highly esteemed well-established practice in the buddhist tradition of contemplating our death

231
00:48:55,119 --> 00:49:01,599
not in a morbid way it turns out to be really beautiful and touching practice

232
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:08,640
i'm not going to talk about it here some of you are familiar with it i'll say i know that nikki mercafori has

233
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:15,440
taught some death contemplation practices but allow us to kind of reclaim that

234
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:22,319
part of ourselves that's afraid of death and instead kind of experience the peace

235
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:28,160
and ease of the wholeness that comes when we can

236
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:34,960
no longer fee be afraid of the fear of death have the fear of the fear

237
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:40,400
and also the peace and calmness that can come when we align ourselves with the truth of

238
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:47,599
reality we know things that have the nature to be born have the nature to die

239
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:52,720
but somehow it's part of the human experience that we don't really think

240
00:49:52,720 --> 00:50:00,480
about it so inclu so that leads me to the next

241
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:06,960
section of the poem so here the poet or the protagonist is

242
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:12,480
um speaking to fear and she says

243
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:22,079
what if i lose everything i said to fear yeah said fear what if you do

244
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:30,640
and who will i be when everything changes yeah said fear who will you be

245
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:35,920
then he opened the door and shoved me off the bus and i was standing again beside the

246
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:41,760
familiar green counter teacup in hand not a drop

247
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:47,359
spelled so the person finds herself at the

248
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:52,839
beginning right she was making tea in the kitchen when the this bus

249
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:58,599
arrived but working with fear like builds some

250
00:50:58,599 --> 00:51:03,680
self-confidence i think um once we realize that

251
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:11,920
yes we can be with fear and we can examine our fears then that we don't

252
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:18,480
maybe the the fear of fear starts to diminish we realize oh yeah

253
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:24,640
okay it's uncomfortable perhaps but we can do this we learn to like trust the

254
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:30,640
practice trust the awareness trust having some curiosity

255
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:38,079
about what's happening what our experience with fear is and this uh expands into wider and wider

256
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:44,880
circles in the world how we are in the world the confidence that we gain from having working with

257
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:50,720
fear and then no longer fearing the fear starts to leak out

258
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:57,040
in different um areas of our life in so many different ways

259
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:04,880
and maybe we can also be inspired by um had the buddha

260
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:10,640
he worked with fear some of you know and part of the stories he talked about how he had fear

261
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:16,799
before he was awakened i think i talked about this in a dharma talk a number of months ago

262
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:22,240
and he said when he felt fear he just kept practicing

263
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:29,440
until the fear went away and then after awakening

264
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:35,920
the buddha is not somebody who is afraid he speaks with confidence

265
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:43,920
and he speaks about he's confident in his knowledge he he knows he has seen and

266
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:50,079
knows and he wants to share it with others so it's possible to go from somebody

267
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:58,400
who's experiences fear to having some confidence we might also think of the nuns

268
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:05,200
from ancient india and they're liberation poems that are captured in the tarikata

269
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:12,640
some of you are familiar with this and these um and these nuns they express

270
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:17,760
themselves with warmth and calmness and with confidence

271
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:23,200
even though they also in some of their poems are describing some really difficult emotions

272
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:29,119
and some fear but they found their way to some

273
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:32,480
confidence and more freedom

274
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:40,720
so then the this poem continues building on this

275
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:48,960
who will you be he shouted so fear is shouting to the protagonist

276
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:54,640
who will you be he shouted from the half open window

277
00:53:54,720 --> 00:54:01,760
i took a deep breath ah not knowing how to answer

278
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:09,039
good fear said as if uncertainty were a gift

279
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:16,880
and who fear said as the bus peeled away who are you now

280
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,480
who are you really

281
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:28,880
good fear said as if uncertainty were a gift

282
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:34,960
so pointing to that working with fear

283
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:41,359
helps us not only to gain confidence where things are uncertain and that

284
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:48,319
maybe to trust the practice and some of those experiences but also to recognize

285
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:54,559
that uncertainty that is to be open

286
00:54:54,559 --> 00:55:01,839
to what's actually happening to have some flexibility some fluidity

287
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:09,040
with how things are and with how we are

288
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:20,000
one of the key buddhist teachings of course is that there isn't a solid stable permanent self

289
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:26,480
instead actually there's uncertainty there's impermanence things are changing

290
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:33,200
there's the uncomfortableness that goes with that but there isn't a solid self

291
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:39,359
and i talked earlier about this vicious cycle of fear and clinging and identification

292
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:45,760
that some way identification we could say is a way in which we're creating a self i'm the one who has this

293
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:52,079
experience or i'm the one that has to get rid of this experience

294
00:55:52,880 --> 00:56:00,400
so we can just notice how fear and clinging identification and maybe like a

295
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:06,319
sense of self that feels really tight and are really separate from everybody else they go

296
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:13,920
together so if we can relax our fear we can relax

297
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,880
our separateness this sense of separateness

298
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:26,318
and being fearless

299
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,839
can be a profound gift to the people around us

300
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:38,799
the willingness to have the difficult conversations the willingness to be with people who are

301
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:47,119
dying or really sick or the willingness to not know to not know the answer to have

302
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:52,480
uncertainty and and instead of being dogmatic or having

303
00:56:52,480 --> 00:57:00,400
really strong views that we have to trumpet everywhere say loudly

304
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:07,760
but just to instead have some openness some uncertainty and have some

305
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:14,559
fearlessness that allows us to just be with what is

306
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:24,480
so fear as a vehicle working with fear can be just a really

307
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:32,240
great way that can complement a meditation practice and might help support us discovering more and

308
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:37,520
