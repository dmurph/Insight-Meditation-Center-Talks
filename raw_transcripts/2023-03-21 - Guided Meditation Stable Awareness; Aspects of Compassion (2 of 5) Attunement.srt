00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,619
hello welcome welcome to

2
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:27,119
our meditation together as a community and hopefully uh you appreciate that

3
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,520
there are so many people meditating at the same time and with the same

4
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:39,899
orientation is here towards IMC and teachings and

5
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:45,000
meditation and so welcome

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,059
so as an analogy if there are two people standing on a

7
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:58,020
Hilltop and one person is standing quite skillfully on one foot maybe even

8
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,239
they have strong that one foot is quite strong and the first game is then under

9
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,880
Tippy Toe and to stand for a long time and the other person has both feet

10
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:16,200
firmly rooted in the ground and uh and a strong stance like spread

11
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:23,460
apart a little bit and then if a strong wind comes on the hill strong gusts

12
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:29,460
they'll both experience the wind the intensity of the wind the wind itself in

13
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,680
the same way they're just as sensitive to it just susceptible to it

14
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:42,299
but the ones standing on their tippy toes one Tippy Toe is not going to have the stability

15
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:49,020
to be able to withstand upright in the wind will be pushed over

16
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,060
the one who has both feet kind of wide stance strong stance rooted rooted

17
00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:03,479
stance maybe even their knees bent maybe even leaning against the wind will experience the wind just as much as

18
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:08,640
the person standing on one foot but the person rooted on the hillside

19
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:16,260
won't be pushed over so in the same way we can be sensitive

20
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,739
to all kinds of things and we can be sensitive in such a way

21
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:26,760
that our own experience our emotions our thoughts our feelings the world around

22
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:33,180
us what's happening with other people two people can be experience it to be

23
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,940
sensitive equally sensitive to what's coming their way but one of them is doing the equivalent

24
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:45,900
of standing on their one foot or standing on their tippy toes and the other one is doing an equivalent

25
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:52,500
of being rooted firm because the ballast has a grounding

26
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:58,680
is kind of very very stable on their feet on their metaphoric

27
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,440
feet and both of them will experience life

28
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:11,040
events the same way the same way the sensitivity to it but the impact it'll have very different

29
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,580
one people will feel like the life events the inner life is just too much is overwhelming

30
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:26,340
and they might blame the event the other person will find it maybe Intense or challenging in some ways but

31
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:32,519
they're able to keep their balance and they're able to stay stable and so

32
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:39,000
they're not thrown off balance by it and uh and they feel content and

33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,440
confident that they can have a stance that supports them and is less inclined

34
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,659
to say the events are overwhelming because they have the stability to

35
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:59,760
handle it so awareness can be on Tippy Toes or awareness can be

36
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:07,860
well grounded rooted stable and and depend someone can be equally

37
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:13,260
sensitive equally kind of a sense of awareness to what's happening but have

38
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:19,139
this very different stance very different rootedness to the experience

39
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:24,960
so when we set to meditate we want to kind of tune into this as well

40
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:31,680
do we feel stable do we feel grounded and that can be partly physical

41
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:39,000
a posture a stance a way of feeling the way to the body so that we're rooted here

42
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,120
it could also be with the awareness where the awareness doesn't it's not like a

43
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:54,560
you know cotton ball that just gets pushed around in the wind awareness has a kind of stability a kind of kind of

44
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:01,919
rootedness a kind of both an openness but but uh you know as

45
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:07,020
a kind of a presence of being rooted and here yes I'm aware

46
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:12,419
and this is where and it kind of I kind of this image of the weight of awareness

47
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:18,900
awareness has no weight but the weight of presence the weight of being present

48
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:24,240
the awareness is kind of settled into the Torso especially

49
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:31,259
settled into the belly here a place where things are

50
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:36,539
unstable is when we're aware but the awareness is rooted in our thoughts and

51
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:42,600
ideas and our stories and Imagination then we get tossed around

52
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,660
but if awareness is connected identified with the body

53
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:56,539
can be a lot easier so to assume a

54
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,180
stable posture for meditation

55
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:14,900
close the eyes and to feel the weight of your body

56
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:23,340
especially feel where the weight of your body rests on a chair on a cushion on the floor

57
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,960
whatever is supporting that weight

58
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:37,139
and taking some long slow deep breaths and on the exhale

59
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:45,740
letting go into that support let the weight of your body be received

60
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:53,180
by what holds the body the weight of the body

61
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:16,380
and taking a few more deep breaths gentle not too much but doing so in a way that as you

62
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:24,240
inhale your belly goes out relax your belly

63
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:32,220
the diaphragm will as you breathe in is pushed down and that pushes everything in the belly

64
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:39,960
down and out so to relax the belly and if the belly gets

65
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:47,039
pushed out there's a broader base at the bottom of your torso

66
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,699
providing support for the upper torso

67
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:06,419
then letting the breathing return to normal and still allow the belly to expand

68
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:11,240
expand and relax as you breathe in

69
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:27,120
the belly doesn't have to do any work to move it's being moved by the diaphragm

70
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:36,979
it's letting the belly kind of be pushed and then pulled in

71
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,440
and then on the exhale relax in your body scan through your

72
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:58,200
body see you with poetry but parts of your body can relax

73
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:06,019
and as you do so relax and let the weight of your body settle a bit

74
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,600
and then letting yourself settle into your breathing

75
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,820
and feeling the breathing the body breathing

76
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,660
in a rooted way and as if

77
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:33,060
the breathing in the Torso the movements of the body in the Torso

78
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:38,600
is a ballast is a kind of strength and stability

79
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,660
and to be centered more in your body your torso

80
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:56,000
then in your thinking mind here

81
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,440
and as you're mindful as you're aware

82
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:30,380
whatever you're aware of be aware while rooted in the body

83
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,720
be aware so that the body

84
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:41,899
provides a ballast for your awareness

85
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,959
so awareness doesn't get pulled into our thoughts or feelings

86
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,959
or doesn't get pushed around by them

87
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:03,380
so awareness can do its work of just knowing and recognizing

88
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,440
from a place of stability

89
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,040
unmoved by The Winds of the world

90
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,620
thank you

91
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:07,700
can you relax your belly your torso

92
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:14,240
and let the weight of your body settle a bit

93
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:22,460
in order to provide more stability

94
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,500
for mindfulness in the present moment

95
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:51,200
and then as we come to the end of the sitting to take a few moments to

96
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:57,539
really let yourself be stable here in your body in your heart

97
00:27:57,539 --> 00:28:03,299
your mind is if there is strong ballast

98
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:09,740
heavy ballast that keeps you rooted grounded

99
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:18,799
so you're not pushed around by The Waves by the wind

100
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:25,460
by circumstances in life you just hear in the middle of this

101
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:30,500
tall firm strong

102
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:38,240
and from the stability to gaze upon the world kindly

103
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:45,120
to gaze upon the suffering of the world the people you know

104
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:51,440
people in your area people far away

105
00:28:51,960 --> 00:29:00,360
to gaze Upon This World suffering from a place of stability

106
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:08,640
careful to watch if you lose a stability

107
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,919
by being swept up into the mines alarm

108
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,620
the mind's distress the minds

109
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:27,960
worries in the stability of the body

110
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:33,360
gaze upon the world kindly compassionately

111
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:40,380
as if that is a phenomenal gift to give the world

112
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,520
just that

113
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:51,899
gazing upon the world with compassion the eyes of kindness the eyes of

114
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:59,340
compassion wishing may all beings

115
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:03,740
be free of their suffering

116
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:11,899
may all beings be free of all forms of affliction

117
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:19,820
may all beings be free of war and oppression

118
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:26,340
may all beings be free

119
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:33,740
of hostility from others and to others

120
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:43,580
may all beings live in peace profound peace

121
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:47,899

that troubles the heart may all beings be happy

123
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:05,430
[Music]

124
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:09,260
laughs

125
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,080
thank you

126
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:26,520
so hello and welcome to this second talk on

127
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:32,220
elements of compassion and by having all the elements of

128
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:37,799
compassion together then compassion can be effective compassion can be uh

129
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:44,039
treasure can be nourishing for ourselves and hopefully beneficial for others

130
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:49,220
and so these five are awareness Attunement

131
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:54,600
appreciation aspiration and action

132
00:32:54,600 --> 00:33:02,100
so today talk about this Attunement but the Attunement is built on the

133
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:07,860
capacity for awareness and one of the things I tried to convey

134
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:13,440
in yesterday's talk about awareness it's not just simply a matter of being aware

135
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,600
but it's also possible to be aware in a way that is stable

136
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:25,820
rooted aware in a way that awareness is autonomous

137
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:34,140
independent from what it is aware of so that if you someone says something

138
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:39,899
you clearly hear it and know it but the awareness is kind of like you oh you

139
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:45,679
know this is happening but the awareness doesn't get ruffled where an assistant gets pushed around

140
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:54,120
doesn't get agitated parts of you might get agitated but you know that oh there's agitation

141
00:33:54,120 --> 00:34:00,539
parts of you might be afraid you know there is fear and that the awareness itself is not

142
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:08,280
afraid awareness doesn't get pulled into anything we don't and part of it if we do that by

143
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:14,398
managing not to identify with the thing like oh this is me or lean into it or

144
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:19,440
get glued to whatever thoughts feelings emotions events are happening

145
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:26,940
awareness is like this Still Point in the middle of the storm or the Still

146
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:32,099
Point in the middle of everything it's not becoming aloof it's not

147
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:38,460
becoming indifferent it's not becoming um

148
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:44,760
uncaring it's the opposite that when awareness can be free

149
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:51,679
autonomous independent so we know whatever is happening then we're able to

150
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:57,420
meet everything with wisdom also we can meet it with stability when

151
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:04,680
awareness is stable and free then when we encounter the world we can

152
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:10,079
figure out how to attune ourselves in the right way for the circumstance

153
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:16,800
so the analogy I gave in meditation like to do again that if two people are standing on a

154
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:24,359
Hilltop one is standing on one foot on their tippy toes and the other is standing

155
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:32,520
both feet both flats from the ground so his feet spread apart it's very stable kind of a strong stable position

156
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:37,980
if a strong wind comes along they're both impacted by the way to equally

157
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:43,859
and however the one in the tippy toes the one foot is going to be blown over

158
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:51,480
the one who has sustable footings feeds widespread apart can withstand the the

159
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:57,500
impact of the Wind what can happen in that kind of situation if he uses a metaphor for

160
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:04,440
Human Experience in life is that both two people can experience

161
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:11,400
life events equally but the person is doing the equivalent or standing on one foot will say I'm a

162
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,560
really sensitive person I'm so sensitive I pick up everything

163
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:23,520
and in a sense it's true but both people might be sensitive but what equally

164
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:28,980
sensitive but one has a strong grounding and rooted and the other doesn't and the

165
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:34,260
one who doesn't is the one who kind of will attribute the issue to Too Much

166
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:41,579
sensitivity too much stimulus coming which is definitely sometimes can happen but it's a whole different way of living

167
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:47,220
if you find that stability of awareness here because then you can

168
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:53,579
figure out now given if you know that and have that then you can figure out what direction to face Against the Wind

169
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:58,980
you can figure out how to stand and how to lean and how to attune yourself to

170
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:05,640
the wind so the wind doesn't blow you over so once we have ability to be balanced

171
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:12,300
rooted in awareness then that's a fantastic foundation for

172
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:18,300
what leads up to compassion and the next thing is to be attuned

173
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:23,700
to the suffering of others and and I like the word attune quite a

174
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:29,160
bit because there's a when we use the word empathy

175
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:35,220
many people will interpret it as being feeling what others are feeling

176
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:42,540
and uh and some people who feel like that's really what you're supposed to do when you have compassion you have to really feel the other person suffering

177
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:48,300
and some people do that they do feel that other people are suffering but I don't know if that's that's not

178
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:54,480
Attunement Attunement is to be very sensitive to

179
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:01,079
the inner feelings of oneself the residence the the tune into the other

180
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:07,079
person taking in all the information and what's there and because we're rooted in awareness

181
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:12,180
the Attunement is how do we dial in so we have just the right

182
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:19,980
Attunement just the right way of being present for someone people don't necessarily need you to

183
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:25,020
feel their suffering fully what mostly what they need is someone to

184
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:31,380
be accompanied them to be present and to understand them in fact to feel people suffering so much

185
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:37,380
that it becomes your own you're not really available to help someone else well

186
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:44,280
some people might appreciate it because they feel that's not alone but there's other ways of accompanying people then

187
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:49,380
kind of experiencing the same thing they're experiencing through them through some kind of empathy

188
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:56,339
and so Attunement and I like it because in the old days when I was growing up we had radios that

189
00:38:56,339 --> 00:39:01,619
you would tune into a radio station and you had to turn the knob you know just

190
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:06,720
and um and to get just the right wavelength and if you had just a little

191
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:12,359
bit uh either side of of the wavelength that the radio station was coming in you

192
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:18,540
get a lot of static so the same thing as we attune ourselves to other people we're finding that place

193
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:25,859
where there's not a lot of static there's not a lot of leaning in or pulling away a lot of spitting out and

194
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:33,420
thoughts a lot of reactivity but finding the place to be and this is why the stable awareness is so important because

195
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:40,099
it's with that awareness that we can kind of find like how do I really

196
00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:46,140
understand this other person how do I really sense them or be with them in an

197
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:51,839
effective way that's useful for them and for me so Attunement is not just simply

198
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:58,680
experiencing people's emotions Attunement is the question how do I be present for this person's emotions this

199
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:04,980
person's life this person's suffering in a way that's supportive for them and supportive for me

200
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:12,180
so there's a kind of uh choice there's a kind of agency there in how we experience the suffering of

201
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:19,020
others if we don't feel like we have an agency we're supposed to just experience the suffering of others or we just that's

202
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:25,200
what we kind of do automatically then then we're not finding that place

203
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:30,900
of agency of choice and this is why the stable awareness

204
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:36,660
gives a possibility to start finding what could how can we be here in a wise way

205
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:41,880
and start feeling confident in this Attunement process this having the

206
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:48,900
question what's the wise way of being here what should I be aware of here with this person and we get a lot of

207
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:54,720
information from other people who are suffering and it's clear that some people want you to sit next to them some

208
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:02,400
of them wants to have a listener who listens to them as they talk some people just want someone to bring them a cup of

209
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:08,460
tea some people want to be left alone and there's you know so you want to be

210
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:13,980
attuned what's the need here what's and then as you feel that need or feel what's maybe appropriate

211
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:19,619
to like okay now how how do I communicate with this person how do I

212
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:25,500
share my presence with them do I Sit Close do I sit far away do I

213
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:32,640
um do I just uh do I do I really listen do I ask simple questions

214
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:37,680
um and if you're not doing that you don't have that kind of closeness with the suffering of the world and say it's

215
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:43,200
through the news or something you've heard about far away um there's very little direct maybe

216
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:49,320
information to be attuned with but still that a question can still be there how

217
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:55,079
given what I know how to obey how do I be attuned how do I be present and

218
00:41:55,079 --> 00:42:00,960
attentive so it'd be helpful in this situation help over them and helpful to

219
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:08,760
myself and if we get overwhelmed or anxious or upset or we allow it kind of to to feel

220
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:14,339
it in such a way they were on our tippy toes standing on one foot then it can be overwhelming and

221
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:19,440
confusing and and upsetting distressing

222
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:26,820
but to be attuned also means attuned to oneself and the question for oneself is how do I

223
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:34,320
be present for this person that I know who's going through some really hard time who's not sitting in front of me is

224
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:39,599
maybe in someplace else how do I be attuned and a big part of it

225
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:45,900
when you're alone away from the person might be how do you attune yourself

226
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:52,440
so you can be present and aware with that place of stability balance strength

227
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:57,660
find the awareness that's calm and available

228
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:02,940
steady and

229
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:09,359
able to make choices able to if the time comes to be attuned and ask

230
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:14,700
the question what is useful here how do I help this person what what does this

231
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:22,740
person need what kind of attention presence does this person need and so there is an acute or strong sense

232
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:29,760
of kind of knowing recognizing maybe even feeling in some resonance way what the

233
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:35,339
other person's feeling but it's not feeling their suffering

234
00:43:35,339 --> 00:43:40,800
if we're suffering because someone else is suffering it's probably not empathy

235
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:47,040
it's probably that's our own suffering and that needs our compassion

236
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:53,280
to find our ability to be present for that in a stable way and ask the same questions for ourselves

237
00:43:53,280 --> 00:44:00,240
how do I effectively attune myself to the suffering that I'm having

238
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:06,060
so I don't sink in it so I'm not pushed around by it so I'm not standing on one foot with it

239
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:12,180
how do I find the stability how do I find the how do I answer the

240
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:17,339
question what's a useful way for me to be with a suffering

241
00:44:17,339 --> 00:44:23,640
because as soon as you ask that kind of question the question of how to be attuned how to be usefully present

242
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:29,700
you're beginning to separate yourself from being glued to

243
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:36,900
the suffering being kind of immersed in it it's a it's a expression or a growth of

244
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:42,359
our kind of autonomy or Independence or freedom

245
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:47,520
to ask how do I attune and if we ask how do I attune to my

246
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:54,839
suffering and someone else it's deeply respectful it's a way of caring very deeply

247
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:59,940
because without respect for oneself without respect for others I don't know

248
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:05,960
if it's going to be compassion and so that'll be the topic for tomorrow

249
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:13,619
appreciation so awareness Attunement and with the Attunement having appreciation

250
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:21,960
and respect for the person we're with or for themselves and uh and that's a really critical uh

251
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:28,980
element for it to be for a compassion to be healthy clean and nourishing

252
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:36,200
for everyone so thank you

253
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:43,380
um and um if you want to do some

254
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:51,060
exercise today based on what I'm said experiment through the day about uh your

255
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:56,760
best understanding what I mean by Attunement be with people and see if you can be

256
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:05,040
attuned to them not identified with them what does it mean and uh and attune this

257
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:10,319
one of the things it means is to what kind of presence was useful for them

258
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:17,339
what kind of presence allows me to be in the circumstance without any static

259
00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:23,880
with some balance and stability so experiment with that maybe in small

260
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:30,000
ways in the place and times that are not so challenging so you get a feel for it

261
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,780
thank you
