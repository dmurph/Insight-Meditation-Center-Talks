just uh breathe and land in your

13
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,319
body think whatever thoughts or feel whatever feeling things need to be

00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:35,760
thought or felt in order for you to

15
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:45,799
become available to the Majesty of this

16
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,680
moment

17
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:54,360
directing uh attention to the feeling circuits of your

18
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:04,720
body kind of building BL blocks of uh mood and

19
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:11,639
emotion state of a affective

20
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:18,960
arousal often along the uh front axis of your body face throat

21
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:27,360
chest belly but um an affective feeling State

22
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,038
might cover the entire of your

23
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:43,800
body may be relatively stable or flowing maybe Pleasant or

24
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,360
unpleasant maybe subtle or

25
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:06,140
intense but feeling encodes a certain kind of

26
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:13,680
[Music] motivation intentionality moving towards

27
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:32,240
way and one of the the capacities we

28
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,120
cultivate in meditation

29
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:44,120
practice is to let feeling be

30
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:54,399
feeling and to uh renounce

31
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:01,160
the ways we narrate feeling find an

32
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,120
object for

33
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,000
feeling the ways are longing finds an object the

34
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
ways our aversion finds an

35
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:24,120
object the ways that our body experience kind of blossoms

36
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:31,120
into a feeling thought Loop

37
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,160
and so here we

38
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,040
practice

39
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:01,120
feeling without the consolation of

40
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
narrative

41
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,399
narrating or feeling

42
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,680
life staying oriented

43
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,120
to threat an

44
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,600
opportunity a very natural thing to

45
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:52,000
do Keeps Us feeling more

46
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:03,440
secure so to gently renounce The

47
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:10,879
Narrative the attempt to to read the Tea Leaves of our feeling

48
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:20,839
body feels uh vulnerable

49
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
exposed

50
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,959
and so it's natural for us to continually act out our

51
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
hypervigilance

52
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:15,680
what is this feeling what does it mean what do I want what must I

53
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
avoid

54
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,199
but uh

55
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:55,160
maybe feels okay to experiment with uh

56
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
defenselessness

57
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,279
knowing feeling is

58
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,519
feeling

59
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:20,559
to uh to feel feeling to be mindful of feeling is to

60
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,559
feel

61
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,600
feeling to do

62
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,080
this begins

63
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:53,960
to soften the

64
00:20:53,960 --> 00:21:00,120
compulsive energies that usually come along

65
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:05,760
with uh the feeling

66
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:12,960
narrative cluster the ways that that

67
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:19,640
feeling when met unconsciously creates a kind of

68
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,760
imperative a

69
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
command

70
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:43,720
now we're not trying to listen for the command but just

71
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:52,360
feel in this way we begin to uh soften

72
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
something

73
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,640
begin to open to the

74
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:22,679
possibility that nothing needs to

75
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:29,960
happen right now

76
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:47,200
that we'd be okay if nothing

77
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,200
whatsoever

78
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
happened

79
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:45,000
this way we uh learn to distill

80
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,679
out the wisdom our

81
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:59,519
body from its compulsivity

82
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,640
this uh helps us live

83
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,440
well

84
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:15,200
okay um what's good to practice with

85
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:22,240
you uh so yesterday was

86
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:30,200
um confidence and uh humility these kind of uh pairs the pairs around kind of

87
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:35,679
more assertive qualities of mind more receptive qualities of Mind how they

88
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:43,480
work together so yesterday confidence humility um and uh

89
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,760
today uh effort and

90
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,760
effortlessness so I was alluding to to kind of effort effort we we make in the

91
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:04,840
the SI right to to actually um to feel our feelings to feel

92
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:11,760
feeling life with and and in a sense renounce the need to understand

93
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:19,000
everything Moment by moment to narrate it to know its Origins its trajectory

94
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,120
all of this take some effort

95
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:29,960
and evolutionary pressures have have exerted very potent effects we're

96
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:36,519
animals it's so easy to forget cuz I wear v-neck but it's like I'm an animal

97
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:42,440
I'm an animal you know and we're not far

98
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:50,039
from you know from chimps and um we love predictable things and pleasure and

99
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:57,279
security and um nibana was not at the top of

100
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:03,240
Evolutions to-do list right peace happiness that's just one lever that

101
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:10,720
Evolution pulls and effort effort is um is a major

102
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:17,120
theme in the sutas because for Animals such as ourselves

103
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:23,200
you know um greed hate and delusion is often the path of least resistance right

104
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:31,200
like I I joke that my my habits my bad habits require

105
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:37,279
precisely zero effort

106
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:45,039
zero deep growth uh in other words is not always comfortable it takes energy

107
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:50,760
and we're renouncing uh less satisfying forms of

108
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:56,039
of pleasure for deeper forms of well-being and that gesture of

109
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:04,519
renunciation takes takes effort uh especially in the kind of

110
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:11,000
training period you know which maybe is our entire life but but it there may be

111
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,120
a trend towards more effortlessness but especially as we're establishing a

112
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:22,080
practice it's like a lot of effort the Buddha described anger for

113
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:28,159
example like that this beautiful phrase with its honey tip and poison

114
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:33,880
root and to we know the honey we know the poison

115
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:41,759
to forgo the honey takes effort our problematic

116
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:49,399
habits always have some honey even the most painful mind States there's some

117
00:33:49,399 --> 00:33:55,760
honey there's some Solace you know even in our guilt

118
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:01,279
Even in our self-hatred there's often like a kind of soothing underbelly to it

119
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:06,840
the honey but this path is against the

120
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:14,040
stream and uh we're using we're leveraging our effort

121
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:20,760
to to renounce now uh one way that

122
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:28,800
teaching teaching functions is that uh the teacher says what they need to hear

123
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:35,398
I I don't think my Dharma talks are like purely Matthew directed pep talks

124
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:42,240
but it'd be good if I listened you know um friend of

125
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:48,320
mine Dharma teacher was like listening to one of his own talks you know and uh

126
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,960
his response in listening to it was like whoa that guy really sounds like he

127
00:34:53,960 --> 00:35:01,960
knows what he's talking about right and um to actually take our own best

128
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:09,520
advice involves energy involves energy we we uh

129
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:17,480
um yeah need to need to kind of draw down on a finite pool of our energy in

130
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:24,640
order to listen listen to ourselves right and

131
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:30,040
uh um and

132
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:37,680
uh so effort yeah effort is very clear

133
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:47,720
um but we can't just be told to to Bear down yeah if

134
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:54,240
um if if that's all we ever do if all we if

135
00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:00,599
what we think of as practice is just bearing down the effort side of this

136
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:09,040
dialectic uh one of the effects is only only ever bearing down leads us to

137
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:16,960
overvalue willfulness and somewhere early early in

138
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:26,319
my practice maybe I don't know maybe just right as it began Veria and sakya diti got

139
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:32,680
tangled together varia energetic Vigor the effort side

140
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:40,839
sakya uh selfie uh my my effort my effort the

141
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:47,440
very sense that kind of like inner sanctum the the imagined headquarters of

142
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:53,079
my effort got yolked to the sense of me

143
00:36:53,079 --> 00:37:00,400
some kind of like deficient being that needed to fiercely

144
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:06,960
exert his will and my my kind of effort and

145
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:16,520
striving was was this like total tangle of of dhanda longing for the

146
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:23,640
Dharma and then conceit the melodrama of

147
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:29,440
self and so part of why we we have to experiment with this other side of the

148
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:35,079
dialectic of effortlessness is that uh we must

149
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:40,520
all uh witness the limits of our

150
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:48,760
willfulness and so the inquiry what what does effort look like on the other side

151
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:55,599
of your willfulness what does effort look like on the other side of your

152
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:01,359
willfulness so part of the emphasis on

153
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:08,880
effortlessness is to actually perceive the selfing in our

154
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:18,200
effting but part of effortlessness is is just we

155
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:25,119
we can't always be told to make more effort remember to be mindful to pay

156
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:31,040
attention to be present to let go of Cravings to let renounce the honey to

157
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:40,760
keep choosing the wholesome it's too much tired I want a nap right too

158
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:45,800
much that's why I always kind of shudder when I hear the some some of the sort of

159
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:52,839
mindfulness instructions like that feel like always so effortful and I just know

160
00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:58,680
that it's not sustainable it's not sustainable and it's like okay I want to

161
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:05,359
be close to the Dharma right now I really do but the only way I can be

162
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:12,040
close is if uh what I can do is something close

163
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:17,200
to effortless you know the only way I can be close is if

164
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:23,000
if it doesn't ask a ton of the kind of effort

165
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,640
system and many of the actual fruits as we

166
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:36,040
train as we train um many of the fruits of the practice actually don't require effort

167
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:44,240
to to keep up we develop Dharma habits traits and traits are about

168
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:50,440
effortlessness just like the traits of you know greed hate and delusion take

169
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:55,960
no no uh no effort uh we develop good

170
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:03,560
habits good habits and we begin to entrust our Dharma practice to those good

171
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:10,520
habits it's famous piece from uh William James says so far as we are mere bundles

172
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:17,319
of habit we are imitators and copiers of our past selves it follows first of all

173
00:40:17,319 --> 00:40:23,440
the teacher's Prime concern shall be to ingrain into the pupil that assortment

174
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:30,119
of habits that shall be most useful to them throughout life education is for

175
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:37,240
behavior and habits are the stuff of which behavior consists goes on to say the great thing

176
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:43,720
in all education is to make our nervous system our Ally instead of our

177
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:51,680
enemy it's very very beautiful to make our nervous system our our Ally instead

178
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:58,318
of our enemy right

179
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:07,480
to uh we maybe say like Dharma Dharma it's about effort but it's also

180
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:14,160
about making our nervous system our Ally and here we don't

181
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:22,880
go um we don't go against the stream we enter enter the stream enter the stream

182
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:31,599
it's kind of strange uh um two sides of the way stream is

183
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:37,960
used we are we're propelled uh propelled by the

184
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:44,839
momentum of of goodness the effortlessness of awareness

185
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:52,520
not not marshalling the attention that excuse me that takes effort to

186
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:58,160
Marshall the attention even if it's just subtle that that takes

187
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:05,440
effort but there is a quality um of the the kind of an

188
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:11,920
effortless quality of over awareness that we have more access to effortless

189
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:19,520
access it it it doesn't we don't have to burn attentional caloric

190
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:28,319
calories you know the the kind of like we we there's no attentional burn in

191
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:33,640
awareness and that's not something we control but we gain more and more access

192
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:40,520
to that the the kind of deep nourishment of

193
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:47,800
it and we talk a lot about choice and making choices uh in Dharma and

194
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:53,000
mindfulness giving us room to choose these things but the truth is that

195
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:00,599
making choices is tiring um and in my practice I I don't really

196
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:06,960
notice that I exactly make better choices it's much more like the menu

197
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:13,119
options are better that takes less

198
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:19,960
effort the nervous system uh is an ally when wholesomeness

199
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:25,079
wholesomeness becomes more pleasurable than un

200
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:32,760
wholesomeness not wholesomeness is like some idea some should some ought any of that no

201
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:38,119
wholesomeness wholesomeness actually becomes more

202
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:43,839
pleasurable right and the Dharma Dharma practice is a kind of Behavioral

203
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:49,880
modification where usually we're motivated by honey but we actually

204
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:55,760
condition ourselves train ourselves train the animal of our body to learn

205
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:03,400
from the poison we get very clear on the poison we do not blunt the experience of

206
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:09,400
the pain of acting out in this way or that way with

207
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:16,160
unconsciousness and that that that begins to to the Dharma functions as a

208
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:21,280
behavioral modification program it begins to create its own natural

209
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:30,520
incentive structure right we the the the pain of being

210
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:37,720
unaligned becomes more poignant and then Letting Go Letting Go

211
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:47,000
feels like less effort than holding on When Love um increasingly becomes the

212
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,920
kind of default position of the mind it's hatred rather than love that takes

213
00:44:52,920 --> 00:45:00,119
effort nervous system becomes our Ally than our

214
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:07,720
enemy offer this for your uh consideration and um look forward to

215
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:15,359
being with you tomorrow okay folks thank

216
