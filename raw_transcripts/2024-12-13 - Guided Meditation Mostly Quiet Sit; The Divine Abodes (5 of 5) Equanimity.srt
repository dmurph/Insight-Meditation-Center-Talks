e

13
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,879
e e

14
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:28,720
uh sensing into where feels appropriate to

15
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:53,439
attend we take our cues from

16
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,680
the teachings from the Buddha from the

17
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,680
lineage

18
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:11,599
but in an important sense we actually have

19
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:16,159
to blaze our own

20
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:30,320
path we have to find how the the Dharma will incarnate

21
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,560
in our

22
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,639
life

23
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,639
e

24
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,639
e

25
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
e

26
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
e

27
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
e

28
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
e

29
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,479
e e

30
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:36,600
it's all phenomena as if the the budha were whispering in your

31
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,720
ear to let

32
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:56,200
go to not be afraid of

33
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
Silence

34
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

35
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

36
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
e

37
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
e

38
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
e

39
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
e

40
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
e

41
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

42
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

43
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,040
e e

44
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:02,360
just letting the uh silent presence of the

45
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,920
S support

46
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:16,720
you kind of network of goodwi and care

47
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:40,240
just to remember how much ordinary goodness there is in the

48
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,839
world let that soothe your heart

49
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:21,438
make the letting go feel uh

50
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
safer

51
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

52
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

53
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

54
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

55
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

56
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

57
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,600
e e

58
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,120
we offer a kind of radical

59
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:50,880
permission for the conditions of our life to be as they are in this

60
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:03,240
moment and in another moment later

61
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:08,720
today rest of our life it'll be wisdom that determines

62
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:14,278
the relative balance of passivity and

63
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:25,919
activity to say yes deeply to this moment does not imply

64
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,519
passivity for all time

65
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,840
it is to

66
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,880
uh cease disputing what has already

67
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,880
Arisen

68
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
now

69
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440

to yeah know enough of of your names that um it doesn't feel like uh

83
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:05,399
weird substitute teacher gig where students are kind

00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:37,960
Kevin helping edit Gil the steadiness of Gil over all these years to uh sustain

88
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:43,840
this people involved with you setting up the YouTube thing Paul the treasure you

89
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:51,679
know uh um doing accounting work with donations and just a there's a lot I'm

90
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:58,320
leaving out a lot anyway point is actually takes a lot of Goodwill and

91
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:05,279
kindness just to be here together and I'm uh appreciative of

92
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:09,640
that so

93
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:23,679
um ajin ajun basa wishes that um that uh all beings

94
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:29,320
dance at ease in the breeze with Minds left

95
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:34,440
silent by laying to rest all

96
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:45,640
things and uh dukka has displaced Dua which has

97
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:53,480
displaced Dua and in a way it's hard to keep track of

98
00:30:53,480 --> 00:31:00,639
all the things we might worry about is so much

99
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:11,360
to uh care about so much to to uh to love and it's almost like uh

100
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:17,240
our nervous system wasn't really designed to care all the time it's how

101
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:22,840
it feels to me it's like I don't

102
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:28,880
think ER this system was designed into care

103
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:37,840
all the time equinity is uh love in the face of the

104
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:45,639
endlessness of samsara the ungovernability of

105
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:51,480
suffering and because we can influence sometimes it lures us into the delusion

106
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:58,679
that we govern something so equinity still

107
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:08,480
but not rigid aent suito said kind of quiet love

108
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:16,200
respectful and this capacity is so important because the central biological

109
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:21,440
impulse is really to

110
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:30,000
influence conditions to influence this realm s and to act upon the world to control

111
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:37,799
conditions this runs very deep maybe is the deepest impulse in an

112
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:44,039
animal and we need to find ways of

113
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:50,240
resting and so equinity is is um is important

114
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,840
and but it's not alone it's in uh deep

115
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:01,159
relationship with compassion they they really need each other one

116
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:08,799
without the other be very awkward so compassion is

117
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:15,519
essential and caring is costly caring is

118
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:20,720
costly so this is uh there's a whole backstory to this but there's a research

119
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:27,240
study from a couple years ago um the author right many suggest empathy which involves sharing others

120
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:32,600
experience can be biased and exhausting whereas warm compassionate concern is

121
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:39,600
more rewarding and sustainable if compassion is indeed warm and a positive experience then people

122
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:45,360
should be motivated to seek it out when given the opportunity here we ask whether people

123
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:51,159
spontaneously chose to feel compassion and whether such choices are associated

124
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:58,960
with perceiving compassion as cognitively costly across all studies we found that

125
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:05,760
people opted to avoid compassion when given the opportunity reported compassion to be

126
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:12,000
more cognitively taxing than empathy and

127
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:19,079
Detachment and opted to feel compassion less often to the degree they viewed

128
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:24,000
compassion as cognitively

129
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:32,919
costly so these are uh meditation naive people people have

130
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:40,158
not practiced and I'm sure we can get better

131
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:48,398
I'm sure compassion can be less costly I'm sure compassion can be more deeply

132
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:55,638
rewarding but I don't think the cost is ever

133
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:03,640
zero and so how do we balance our love and our

134
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:11,400
peace and I I can kind of sense The evolutionary mismatch in the sense of

135
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:17,200
like what what helped my beloved monkey ancestors

136
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:24,920
Thrive doesn't totally work in 2024 in

137
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,920
Berkeley it's just intense to care to care about one's life to care about

138
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:40,520
others to care about the world to care about people wherever they may be in

139
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:44,040
time future

140
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:54,079
Generations so equinity is about uh purifying the nature of our

141
00:35:54,079 --> 00:36:00,640
care of making it sustainable of loving

142
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:07,119
efficiently of relinquishing inefficient suffering a kind of suffering that feels

143
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:15,040
like our heart has to do but it's doing no good for oneself for

144
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:20,280
others a flower not meant to bloom all

145
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:28,040
the time we can consider sleep

146
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:35,440
which has real risk real opportunity cost a pervasive sense of disconnection from

147
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:41,160
the environment right totally

148
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:47,920
undefended but necessary for our functioning for for our you know brain

149
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:53,960
health for learning for growth sleep's important and what's the equivalent of

150
00:36:53,960 --> 00:37:01,240
sleep for our heart our heart needs to rest too and maybe

151
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:09,160
equinity is a kind of deep rest for our heart our heart

152
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:15,160
needs moments of being unstimulated but unstimulated does not

153
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:23,200
mean closed or collapsed you know we we try to rest

154
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:30,599
through more stimulation we sort of Chase one intensity with another compulsive

155
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:38,079
technological use whatever may be we we sort of cocoon in

156
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:43,480
unconsciousness and I'm not entirely dismissive of that that's a kind of

157
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:50,880
rest but our heart is still highly stimulated even in the

158
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:59,440
Cocoon of unconsciousness and equinity is is a kind of true rest

159
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:06,160
teach us to Care and not to care TS Elliot writes and it sounds harsh what

160
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:11,078
do you mean teach us not to

161
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:17,040
care we practice caring but also uh

162
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:24,960
the appreciation that um our wishes do not govern the first Noble

163
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:34,760
Truth and in some moments it's actually skillful to put down the all of the

164
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:41,359
wishing the the Buddha was worried about uh

165
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:47,280
nihilism um in

166
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:53,240
emptiness Experience One experience is highly interchangeable with

167
00:38:53,240 --> 00:39:00,480
others in a sense the raw material of samsora does not matter matter much at

168
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:08,760
all a sight is a sound is a sensation Pleasant is unpleasant is

169
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:16,280
neutral it doesn't matter at all and sometimes people get the sense

170
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:25,440
that uh that LE that that nothing means

171
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:33,000
anything and on the other side we we often live with the sense that everything means everything but between

172
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:39,359
nothing means every anything and everything means

173
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:45,839
everything we find our life it's the middle

174
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:51,599
path this is a kind of balance of equinity and

175
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:56,680
compassion and the equinity one of its functions it seems

176
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:03,040
to me is um is to

177
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:10,880
to purify or compassion to distill out

178
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:16,319
the what is not pure gold in

179
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:23,760
it and so equinity is a kind of crosscheck in a way a a practice of

180
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:29,880
purifying the nature of our care such that our compassion

181
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:38,480
becomes less compulsive less maybe we say

182
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:43,359
codependent less grandiose less

183
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:54,319
self-righteous there's something about moving between uh compassion and equinity that

184
00:40:54,319 --> 00:41:00,040
helps illuminate those grizzled bits of

185
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,839
whatever in our

186
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:17,599
care equinity uh I sometimes say is is

187
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:22,800
about refining our relationship to

188
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:31,240
helplessness even when All Is

189
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:35,079
Lost all is not

190
00:41:38,359 --> 00:41:45,280
lost so we we want to

191
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,920
find a posture for our

192
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:58,280
heart that is not collapsed not nihilistic

193
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:06,400
not apathetic but a way of resting in the

194
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,720
face of our nearly complete

195
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:22,400
helplessness and can we do that in a way that doesn't harm our heart

196
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:35,640
and as we do this as we refine our love purify our

197
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:42,880
care um the actions arising from equinity become more potent

198
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:49,720
have greater moral force greater persuasive Force than those actions

199
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:56,000
arising from clinging or the compulsive versions of compassion that we enact

200
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:04,160
often and so we zigzag our way

201
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:14,078
through caring and not caring through our power and our

202
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:22,799
helplessness we do our best to

203
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:27,680
uh live a good life

204
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:34,440
