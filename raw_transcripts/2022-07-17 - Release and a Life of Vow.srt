1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,839
so there's two things i want to talk about today and

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:13,040
two things i want to talk about because i want to talk about the relationship between them

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:19,119
and the first in simple language can be talking about freedom or liberation and that's kind of

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,160
many people understand that that's really central to this buddhist practice

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,880
but the one that is not mentioned very much is the idea of bow

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,399
kind of idea of a commitment and these two go together so

7
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:42,480
and but val has a very interesting kind of part of the unfolding of practice for

8
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,079
some people when people first come to practice they're interested

9
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:54,640
and the interest is what engages them and that interest might be driven by a

10
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:02,399
need so we will hope that somehow this practice will make a difference for the need the suffering that people have

11
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:09,119
as people practice at some point there becomes something in the family of commitment that happens

12
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,400
that people or decisiveness or clarity this is what i'm going to do i'm going to do

13
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,040
this meditate every day i'm going to give myself over make somebody a priority for my life and

14
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,040
exactly where that priority how strong that priority is how strong that commitment is or how big it is is very

15
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,840
individual but at some point it's like okay this is this is more than just an interest now

16
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,960
and for some people it becomes a life and then but at some point the commitment

17
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,240
changes to something else where it becomes uh something like a vow

18
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,759
and i'll talk more about what that means but the many religions have vows you know people who are ordained how to take

19
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,439
vows people get married have bows a vow is

20
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:05,040
something that is affirming an aspiration a wish that arises from

21
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,319
within that's not something we take from the outside and put on like a coat

22
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:17,280
but rather it's a recognition that now something is there's a call from the inside the recognition that now

23
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:24,400
there's something that is flowing animating us energizing us from the inside out

24
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:33,120
and the vow is the recognition that this is this is where i'd like to live this is my orientation this is my direction

25
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,120
and so and this points to how with practice that practice changes over time we change

26
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,599
over time with it with a freedom there's also a kind of a

27
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,680
correspondingly i list a three-part step that goes on the first is the beginning

28
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,519
a lot of the practice has to do with relaxing relaxing for some people is not

29
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,200
spiritual enough so we can call it calming maybe that helps

30
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,760
a settling a tranquilizing a calming of all the agitation the busyness of the mind the heart

31
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,159
calming and relaxing has a lot to do with healing healing that which is fragmented or

32
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:21,360
hurt or wounded inside of us and so um but there's a relaxing that

33
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,879
goes on as the relaxing deepens at some point

34
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:32,959
there's a letting go so there's a clarity that some things that we've been doing

35
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:39,040
are not something that we want to do anymore and there's a letting go that happens

36
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:45,360
and uh and that letting go is a choice at some point there's come to a point okay enough of this this stop doing this

37
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:52,239
i'll stop doing this and and then

38
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,680
but then with enough letting go there is release

39
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,680
and release is a whole different animal than letting go because release is not something you can

40
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,360
do but rather something we allow for so i want to talk about these two

41
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,640
different things so there's freedom side and this vowel side

42
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,799
so in the freedom side the letting go

43
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:27,520
sooner or later becomes very important some of the letting go just happens some people are surprised as they meditate

44
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,960
how much of their ordinary life and concern just settle away and recede into the background

45
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:40,400
and if that's done clearly enough strongly enough there's um people experience themselves being alive

46
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:47,040
in a very different way than they've ever done before many people or many you know maybe for

47
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,479
some people it's like oh i haven't felt that way since i was four or five

48
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:59,199
and that's one of the things that happened for me is that as i started sitting meditating more

49
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,479
i started feel having sense of well-being that i hadn't felt since i was a little

50
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:10,960
kid i said oh i know this i recognize this and um and so it's kind of a was kind of

51
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,320
a little bit of a homecoming it was a little bit like the busyness of life the

52
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:22,479
challenges of life the all the different preoccupations that i'd slowly acquired and built up and

53
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:28,800
made a whole you know complicated world for myself and to live

54
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,320
in it wasn't so dramatic it wasn't like i even knew i was doing it

55
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,240
but as i meditated and got and just simply kind of stayed with the breathing let go of my thoughts came to the

56
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,360
breathing set up quietly slowly these things receded

57
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,639
far enough away that i started to experience myself in a radically different way than i had

58
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,680
before and one of the consequences of that

59
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,680
is that when some of the things came back which they almost always did

60
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,960
the usual daily tendencies i had attachments i had the

61
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,759
selfishness i had the conceits i had the stories i had about myself and others

62
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,840
and all that they said to come back some of them just didn't seem to be so

63
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:28,479
important anymore or valuable or even healthy to have and there became a desire to let go of

64
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:34,720
them not live by them anymore and some of them i was able to put down

65
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:41,280
some of them i changed the way i lived so i wouldn't be caught in them as much as i had before because something the

66
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:47,759
very lifestyle that i was living supported certain attachments so i shifted my lifestyle so those

67
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:54,479
attachments wouldn't be so easily supported as this practice deepened then for me

68
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,759
then the it became not clear that the letting go

69
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,039
that sometimes happened on its own without me trying to do it was something that i could also

70
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:11,680
sometimes choose to do and so i learned to let go of certain things and some of the

71
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,880
things were things of the world which were not healthy to do but some of what i learned more and more

72
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,319
was it wasn't about the world and anything in the world it was really letting go of the clinging

73
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:28,160
the holding in the mind and that was a big revelation to realize

74
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,680
that that's where the real issue is to let go of how it was holding on

75
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,199
and the advantage of seeing that is then you don't have to let go of things in the world unless they're

76
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,840
unhealthy some people who are into this buddhist practice and letting go let go of things

77
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,199
that shouldn't be let go of but what we can do is rather than clinging to them

78
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:57,840
some things we can keep but we hold them with an open hand and the advantage of holding things with

79
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,360
kind of the equivalent of a open hand is that some things are worth keeping

80
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:11,440
appropriate to care for and have in our lives and there's no need to let go of them they're valuable

81
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:17,680
but uh reality sometimes has other ideas and sometimes

82
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:24,000
they go anyway and then if but if we're not holding on

83
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,759
tight it's a lot easier when things go

84
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:36,320
and so it wasn't your choice to have them go it wasn't because you wanted them to go maybe the opposite you didn't want them

85
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,839
to go but still with this life that we live sometimes they go

86
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:47,839
you know people die all kinds of things just happen

87
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,600
we don't know when the san andreas fault is going to blow here in california right

88
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,600
and if it goes there's a lot of changes coming about here in california

89
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:06,839
and i bet and uh and so things are things will go away

90
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:13,600
but the the freedom from clinging makes a huge difference how we navigate

91
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:20,480
that then and how we work with the changes in life so we learn to let go

92
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,680
but we come to a point in this practice that we do buddhist practice

93
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,519
where it's clear that we have to stop

94
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,880
doing the letting go because letting go still can still be

95
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:42,399
represent having control you're in charge i'm the one who's letting go

96
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:49,760
and that can only go so far because before we feel that it doesn't make sense to do that anymore it's actually not possible anymore

97
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,959
one of the places kind of like one of the places of holding on

98
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:01,360
is control and to

99
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,120
let go of control is to stay in control in a paradox so at some point you have

100
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:14,160
to so the letting go becomes at some point in practice it becomes letting be

101
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,200
allowing and this can feel like a very profound part of practice especially when

102
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:26,800
practice is quite subtle and strong that there's a there's a form of letting go that involves no letting go at all

103
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,640
but just letting it be it's kind of like stepping back and having a wide spacious perspective of

104
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,560
the situation of ourselves what's going on and learning how not to be troubled

105
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:45,360
irritated by what's happening even our clinging we let it be we allow it

106
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:52,079
because to constantly be involved in letting go of our clinging is to somehow be going in the wrong direction which

107
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:57,120
becomes clear as we go along it's kind of like

108
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,240
sanding rough wood you can you sand it with coarse

109
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,800
sandpaper first but then you have to stop using the coarse sandpaper to use finer and finer finer sandpaper

110
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,000
and at some point if you keep using sandpaper it doesn't work you have to just use a

111
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,079
cloth and so the same thing letting go letting go letting go

112
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:27,200
it can work for a period of time until it's no longer the right grain of sandpaper the right grain of

113
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,560
activity and at some point letting be allowing

114
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:38,480
and letting go of control then something

115
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:45,839
that only then can release happen release is very different than freedom

116
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:52,240
we can we can talk about uh fighting for our freedom asserting for freedom demanding our

117
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,760
freedom release you can't fight for release

118
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:06,000
for your own release you can't fight for the release of the heart release of the mind you can't uh lobby for it you can't

119
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,160
assert it it involves an allowing we let go enough

120
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,440
to be and allow for something that's not in our control

121
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:24,320
and this point where different people in practice come to this place of letting go of control at different points some

122
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,519
people really early they're struggling with this some people it's quite well advanced in

123
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:35,040
their practice but at some point the idea of the controlling is trying to

124
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:42,000
control so everything is safe controlling so that you know i get what i want controlling so that i

125
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:49,360
know certainty and trying to avoid uncertainty many things we're trying to avoid with control

126
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,639
avoid feeling our fear our distress we have to let go

127
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:01,279
and then that that makes room for something to happen that's not our doing

128
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:07,920
all we have done is put the conditions in place for it a deeper release

129
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,319
in that the deeper this letting go happens the deeper this release happens

130
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,760
uh it influences the other movement of practice which is i'm

131
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,480
referring to as interest commitment and vow

132
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:31,360
that as we practice there's interest in the beginning

133
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,639
and then somehow the practice begins to show that it works

134
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,880
something begins shifting and changing in us and for each person that shift and change is a little bit different it's

135
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:51,360
very personal but at some point we recognize oh i'm different because of this

136
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,399
and uh one way to some people to recognize this if they're if they're able to meditate

137
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:02,800
every day for some time maybe for a few years or even six months

138
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:09,519
to make it maybe more of a manageable goal and then stop for a week

139
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:16,160
stop for a month and then see how life is different because of that and some people say wow you know i

140
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:21,920
didn't realize how important meditation was because without it i tend to i'm not so

141
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,279
calm or i don't see so clearly i remember i was suggesting it to a long

142
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:33,920
time practitioner who done a lot of retreats and that he should stop meditating for a month

143
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:40,160
and he started crying it was so important for him and i think it was important that month

144
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:46,079
to really see what was going on in a deeper way and it wasn't necessarily seeing something difficult it was seeing

145
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:52,959
something very profound and important within himself that he hadn't quite understood

146
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,480
and so there's a shift that happens and so with that shift comes a

147
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,959
commitment maybe a commitment to let go of the things which are unhealthy that

148
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:11,040
we do a commitment to do the things that are healthy for us especially spiritually

149
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,240
healthy but then you know because that's you

150
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:23,519
know that commitment has more to the world of what we do where we have some control

151
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,880
as important as commitment is it can only take us so far

152
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:34,399
and at some point when the release is deep enough when the letting go is deep enough and we're in touch with something

153
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,440
very you know very much in touch very connected to what's happening here and

154
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:45,519
ourselves in the world there's a source for

155
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:51,759
an aspiration for a wish for a dedication for doing something

156
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:58,160
that is almost impersonal and that it doesn't belong to that part of the mind or the ego

157
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:04,480
where we kind of ration think things out or trying to improve the self or doing it

158
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:11,680
it's not it's not really about self anymore but it arises from some place that's it may be inside

159
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:17,120
that's not exactly personal it is personal in the sense that it's within us

160
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,120
but not in the usual way that we think about ourselves as there's some people talk about a

161
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:29,759
calling there's a calling there's i love the word aspiration because uh it's connected to the word

162
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,199
breathing like respiration so it's something deeper that wells up

163
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:41,040
there's something that begins flowing or rising or some feeling of this is what

164
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:47,440
is important this is what my life is about this is what i want to do

165
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:53,680
so for me when i was uh a zen practitioner in the monastery

166
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,399
i spent a year kind of living close to this junction

167
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:06,400
this place of the vow of this really what was most important for me what was the most meaningful thing i could do

168
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,400
with my life and trying to grapple with it and understand it and

169
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:18,558
i didn't do it continuously i did it um every five days more or less

170
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:24,798
because the monastery i had a five day week and the fifth day was the day off and then i would go for a hike in the

171
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:30,000
mountains most of those days and that's where i was kind of checking in and grappling

172
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,080
with this what i was going to do with my life and what was important for me and

173
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,400
and uh what arose was something that uh

174
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:48,240
surprised me in that it it it arose within

175
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:55,039
and it was like oh of course this is what i'll dedicate myself to

176
00:17:55,039 --> 00:18:01,200
but the decision was made before my mind said that the decision happened in the heart

177
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,400
something shifted and changed and the decision was for me was to

178
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:13,360
dedicate my life a vow to work for the ending of suffering in this world

179
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:19,360
that's what that's what my system had come to there was nothing else that was more important

180
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,400
and the vow was not something that i took on

181
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:31,600
knew the vow was simply the expression of what was already happening to me

182
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,360
this movement this dedication and uh

183
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:44,240
and partly the idea of vow was it was came to me because at this at the zen practice the vows are very

184
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,440
important part of the tradition and uh and there they have something

185
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:55,440
called the bodhisattva vows which is uh goes something like this there's four of

186
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,280
them and so the vow to um

187
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,440
it says beings are innumerable

188
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:15,919
i vow to save them all liberate them all desires delusions are inexhaustible i

189
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,039
vow to end them all

190
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:27,200
dharma gates are boundless i vow to enter them all

191
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,559
buddha's way is unsurpassable i vow to become it

192
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:38,480
so it's like the impossible dreams or song maybe it's like you know

193
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,960
uh beings are numberless i vow to save them all it's ridiculous right i mean

194
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,240
who's going to do that i mean in some ways that could be seen as phenomenal egotistical

195
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,360
dedication like you know you're going to try to say well being you but you have some kind of

196
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,720
messianic complex that and um

197
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,559
but it's not it's it's uh the way where it was understood was that

198
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:12,320
in up two different ways one was uh there was a certain way in which the

199
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:18,880
you're going to keep coming back to a mind that's liberated and so we're freeing all beings in our

200
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,720
minds maybe freeing them from our attachments that was one understanding

201
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,480
the other understanding is that yes it is impossible to do this

202
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,919
but succeeding in this then is not the point what's the point is

203
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:41,679
this is what we're going to do this is the task

204
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:48,799
this is dedication this is the life that we're dedicated to without concern that you know we're not

205
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:55,039
going to get to that many people before we die and so the same thing with delusions our

206
00:20:55,039 --> 00:21:01,280
delusions are inexhaustible it's very humbling to realize that to have this idea that someday you'll

207
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,480
come to the end of all your delusions is maybe a kind of a conceit or kind of

208
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:12,400
a problem but to always practice always be looking at the ways that we

209
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:18,400
have delusion and those of us paying attention to our society these days

210
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:25,520
will appreciate how many delusions we live in that were unconscious unconscious bias

211
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:33,919
that we live in our society and that you know we're coming beginning to kind of slowly get a handle of and

212
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:39,520
but maybe there's no end to understanding them and they're endless so but so the dedication yes

213
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,720
i'm going to keep looking keep discovering my delusions keep working and willingness to look at these

214
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,400
difficulties that's the task dharma gates means the dharma practices

215
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:56,720
dharma experiences dharma openings that we can have are endless

216
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:04,640
the point is not to come to the final one the point is just keep practicing just that's the dedication

217
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:10,840
and the buddha's way is unsurpassable i about to become it become the buddha kind of

218
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:16,720
well it's impossible but that's what my life is about so i don't know if this is satisfying to

219
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,000
hear but this idea that vow it doesn't is not about succeeding at

220
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,159
anything but the vow is that orientation the dedication of a lifetime the what's most

221
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:33,600
meaningful and some people find something very clear

222
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:39,919
and it can be wide-ranging you know it's for a buddhist teacher who made it commitment to this buddhist practice the

223
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:47,039
way i did it can sound like maybe like this is what everyone's supposed to do but no i mean it could be that there's

224
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:53,440
all kinds of ways of living a life many many ways some that are that

225
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,960
are kind of not so obvious or very subtle or very

226
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,960
personal in different shapes there's a room for all but the point being that as we practice

227
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,480
we might discover more and more what is most meaningful for us

228
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:17,679
because what is less meaningful or unmeaning not meaningful begins to be shed begins to settle out begins to

229
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:23,840
recede and when our distracted mind when our preoccupied

230
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:33,039
mind when our fear and our ambitions and desires get quiet tranquil settled

231
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:39,360
what is left in there what is left here what is left as being the most

232
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:45,200
meaningful the most important for us that we want to live by that we want to

233
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:52,559
that's we want to do i have his faith that this practice we do as much as involves a settling and

234
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:58,960
letting go a connection showing up here in a very full way

235
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,640
it does not lead people to be couch potatoes that's not the point

236
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:10,000
uh just to end up just being someone who can now happily peacefully

237
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:18,640
you know has no desires no wishes and just you know okay i guess sit here on the couch and just

238
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:26,159
smile and breathe i think that is not possible i think that as we connect and drop in deeper

239
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:31,360
and deeper and deeper to what's here the heart

240
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,799
is set up the heart has been created for in ways that uh very different than you

241
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:42,400
probably would have imagined if you're caught up in the social constructs and values that

242
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:48,559
we inherit from our society and our families and to discover what that is in your

243
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:54,640
heart what is most meaningful what is the most animating what brings you alive what is

244
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:01,039
it that gives your life the most meaning that is enduring that really really

245
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:07,440
makes you helps you sing or help something really come forth

246
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:14,559
and so that i call that the vow the vow that we can live by to devote

247
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:21,200
what we're devoted to or dedicated to and for some people it involves making choices between

248
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,840
different things that are good things to do i had to make that choice for myself

249
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:35,279
because i was dedicated my my youth to go back to graduate school

250
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:40,559
to work on the issue of soil conservation in this world of ours

251
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:47,360
i had studied agriculture and soil science and i knew that toward the hue one of the huge challenges of our

252
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:53,440
world was the amount of soils that were being devastated eroded

253
00:25:53,440 --> 00:26:00,000
and we needed to do something about and not too many people knew about this huge issue

254
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,480
and so that was what direction i was going and that's still a very worthwhile thing

255
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:13,200
to do so i had to choose between this buddhist path at some point and doing that

256
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,400
and i chose the buddhist one so that wasn't that was part of what i was doing that year reflection what's most

257
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:26,000
important here and then the advantage of having a vow

258
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,760
or even her commitment and dedication is that

259
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,240
you wake up in the morning and you know what you're doing you know what you're about

260
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:44,640
you it's a there's a clarity in this world that's very very hard to know what to do sometimes and sometimes it's hard

261
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:50,480
to know what's meaningful and what's important it's hard to know what to choose to do

262
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:56,960
when there's a vow it's like oh this is what i'm about this is what i do this is what i'm dedicated to

263
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,080
it's a ballast it's a foundation

264
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:09,039
it's a teacher when it's difficult to live by the vow then you have to look at it more deeply

265
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:17,600
it's a it's a protection it's an inspiration it's a

266
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,960
it's a guide for a life

267
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:30,080
a purpose and uh so to live the vow

268
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:37,360
and so the question is you know what is that for you what might it be for you

269
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:43,360
some of you might not be ready for that question in the way that i'm i'm talking about about today

270
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,480
where val has to do you know it really comes at the end of a series of practice

271
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:54,240
and really developing but at some point you might come to the place it might be

272
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,919
a very natural stage that you come to it's not like you have to rush ahead now because i talked about it

273
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:05,520
but you'll just feel and sense inside of you that something is moving you something

274
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:11,120
is becoming so important for you that something is going to shift

275
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,399
some choice decisions can be made some dedication

276
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:22,640
and that some of that is not a choice some of it is not you controlling the situation

277
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,840
but you're allowing something that maybe is a surprise to you

278
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:33,760
to surface and call you or speak to you or animate you

279
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:41,520
and you might have to make something you might if you want to listen to that it might call on you to

280
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:48,000
make make big choices that decisions

281
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,480
what you let go of what you stop doing and what you change and do differently

282
00:28:54,559 --> 00:29:01,840
and and i think that that becomes for some people an important stage and so you

283
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:08,320
know what's important to keep in mind is the more deeply we go into this practice

284
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,799
that um it's not just you're doing a practice that helps us to cope

285
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:22,000
manage more effectively with the life that we're living but really that helps us to question the

286
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,720
life we're living in a deep way and i probably most of you would consider that would be

287
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:35,760
if it's not useful for you that if you look across the country across the world and how many people live their lives

288
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:42,799
probably you wish a lot of people would question in some deep way what they're doing and

289
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:48,880
how they're doing it and why they're doing it you know there's a fair number of things

290
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,919
which are dysfunctional going on around us but it's also probably true for

291
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:59,520
ourselves in some way that we start questioning and what is the calling what is the new way

292
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:06,559
of living that really has meaning and purpose and is right here

293
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:13,520
the um so i think this practice is uh that we

294
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:19,840
do is not only stress reduction it's also something that sooner or later hopefully will challenge

295
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,360
you in some very deep way and uh and that you're willing to be

296
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:31,840
challenged by it because you're not being challenged by the something external the challenge really coming from the

297
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:37,679
inside out it's coming from yourself some better part of you is beginning to

298
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:43,600
to flower come forth and uh

299
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:51,200
and at that point maybe it's not a matter of bringing your practice into your life

300
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,919
but rather bring your life into your practice

301
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:04,960
rather than finding a way to live your life as it is it's a way rather to live your life

302
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,240
from this place that's uh has been freed

303
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,799
released through this practice

304
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,120
so release and vow

305
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:30,559
so we have a few minutes some of you would like to ask questions clarifications

306
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:37,200
concerns you have about what i've talked about or how this

307
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:43,679
what i've said how this sits with you is it difficult to hear is it inspiring or

308
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:49,360
nice so over here i think

309
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:57,039
see if that's okay yeah

310
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:02,559
um so gil um the wow is a wonderful topic in sanskrit

311
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:08,000
it's called rata it's called in sanskrit

312
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:16,559
yeah yeah and i'm using actually the word aditana

313
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:23,679
in pali adishtana may be inside so i'd like to draw an analogy with the

314
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:30,000
yoga philosophy where the first of the eight limbs in the patanjali's

315
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,480
sutras are the yamas the it's ahimsa satya non-violence truth and

316
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:42,399
all these things brahmacharya so patanjali calls them the mahavratam

317
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:48,960
sarva-bhama mahavratam which means irrespective of place time

318
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,480
everything it is universally valid and

319
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:00,880
there is a fact called shraddha it is faith but faith from a very

320
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:07,279
deep source which makes people take these walls

321
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:13,360
and the power of this is enormous in this in mahabharata there is a

322
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:18,640
character called bhishma he's known as the one who made the terrible wall of

323
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:24,480
celibacy and the powers he gained are so much that he

324
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,679
could give up his life when he chooses to that is the power of these

325
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:38,360
mahavratas so i just wanted to bring their vows of power yeah great thank you ganesh

326
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,840
talking about what goes on in these early indian texts i mean it's so common in so many

327
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:02,240
different religions that people come to a place where they already do something like a vow and it's kind of interesting to reflect

328
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:08,800
on how this is a common phenomenon religions religious practice at least if we

329
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:14,240
distinguish religion from the practices and uh so it certainly is

330
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:19,679
worth reflecting on and considering and understanding a little bit about

331
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:25,679
what it what it points to in the heart what it points to in our kind of in our nature that

332
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,200
that people go in this direction

333
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:39,919
yes for me

334
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:45,520
this path has not involved so much of a

335
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:50,878
a commitment or a vow but rather a knowing

336
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:56,000
so i can tell that oh yes you know this buddhist

337
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:03,040
these teachings are are great and they mean a lot to me

338
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:09,040
i think they're very beautiful and they've made all the difference in the world in my life

339
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:17,200
so just knowing that has been yeah a great thing it's a great thing yeah so i would have but yes but

340
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:22,880
my discipline the what but and yet there's something resistant to turn it up a little louder

341
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:28,079
please there's something sort of resistant or stubborn in me so that my discipline

342
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,440
when it comes to practice has been poor ah so

343
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:39,040
maybe i do need a little bit of that vow or commitment

344
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:46,320
quality that i have been missing so this has been perhaps wonderful yeah

345
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:52,320
i can imagine that yeah the knowing is one thing and deciding to live accordingly by that

346
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:58,400
knowing is a different thing and so maybe commitment intention vowing would be important for you to

347
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:04,240
look at yes it could be and uh and ideally at least

348
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:10,000
the way i i understand these things is in looking at it

349
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,119
it doesn't become an act of brute force to okay now i'm going to do it for

350
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:21,280
but rather you recognize that that there's a animating force within

351
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:28,000
that it's like of course i'll do it now i'm going to write i'm going to ride this wave of intention of commitment of

352
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,920
our thank you thank you

353
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:42,160
thank you so much girl um you helped me understand something about

354
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:48,720
futility um with your dharma talk today and and i was just think futility or utility

355
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:55,280
futility okay but turning it actually into utility and and the image i had

356
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:01,599
was of the cellist on the titanic actually and your notion of

357
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:08,400
well you know is it kind of crazy to go and try something that's obviously sort of futile right you know you're a

358
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:14,400
sinking ship and we often use that as an analogy of well that's something useless right why would you

359
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:20,800
go you're gonna you're gonna drown but in some sense what else would you do if you were a cellist

360
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,560
you know in the titanic you might as well go play and those last moments are your way of

361
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:32,560
organizing a little bit of the universe that in every other sense is quite chaotic

362
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:39,839
and even hostile so i'm no longer going to use that as a as a notion of futility but rather

363
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:46,079
it is a little bit of a way of organizing your hostile world and so anyway i don't know

364
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:51,119
if that's useful or not but at least to me that's the it helped me really sort of rethink what

365
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:56,800
we often think of as just you know futile attempts at

366
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,920
at calming anyway wonderful i think what you're saying is actually quite important

367
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,079
that um the

368
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:14,480
some of the ways in which we respond to crisis are not such useful actually

369
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,520
it might seem essential to panic it might seem essential to get

370
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:24,640
angry and and bark at someone and that's like it's not what people do it has to happen this

371
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:30,640
way but if if it's your last day alive

372
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:38,000
is that really the best thing you can do with your time is to be afraid or to bark at someone

373
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,000
isn't there a better alternative if you have a few hours left then isn't this the time to really do

374
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,839
something really different in your life than the usual anger and desire and fear and

375
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:56,320
isn't that a time to kind of play the jello or smile at your neighbor or do do what you

376
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:01,839
enjoy or you know or put your mind and heart at ease

377
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:08,480
because now you don't have to you don't have to prove yourself anymore you don't have to accomplish anything and

378
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:14,400
so you know one of the questions for us practitioners is

379
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,520
what's the best option that's available for us and i think there's a lot of better

380
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:26,560
options available for us than some of the ones we choose and so choosing to play the cello might be the

381
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:32,160
best option for that person given the alternatives that were available

382
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,359
and and so what's our best option

383
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:42,560
and it's exercise of thinking well this my this is at my last afternoon alive

384
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:48,000
what really is the best option if you then you can reflect well

385
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:54,078
actually maybe i have a few years maybe that's still the best option

386
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:02,800
and and so this call this being connected to something deep inside to have released let go in a deep way and

387
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:09,200
really touch something that's really meaningful is to touch a higher quality of living a

388
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:15,599
higher quality of mind and heart that then it becomes less and less interesting

389
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:21,680
to succumb to other forces where we lose something that's so meaningful and so important

390
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:28,480
so that's i appreciate your your idea that what might seem futile

391
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:34,400
it sometimes has a lot of utility and it could be very inspiring to see

392
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,839
i've i've been with a lot of people as they're dying and it's

393
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:47,520
it's strikes me how much how much of an influence it has on the people who are there their their friends

394
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:54,400
their family who survive how people die and that some people die it's a

395
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,440
beautiful to watch their peace they're letting go and their equanimity

396
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:06,000
it's like inspiring it's like people go there for darshan people go show up and want to be with them because they haven't experienced so much peace in

397
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,800
someone's and other people die afraid and anxious and all kinds of things

398
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:18,800
so this ability to this practice to discover the better option the better alternative and really know it for

399
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:24,640
oneself and then choose choose to live by it

400
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:30,880
is uh this vowel okay so maybe maybe one more and then

401
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:37,040
we'll stop and then what we'll do is uh we can continue in uh afterwards in the

402
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:43,599
in the parking lot we can take off our masks we can make some chairs out there and see if any of you would like to stay and be more informal out there we can

403
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:52,560
continue yes gail thank you for this i'm sitting thinking about um

404
00:41:52,960 --> 00:42:02,079
the dichotomy between advocating for myself in situations where

405
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:08,000
i see or experience unfairness or

406
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,599
not being you know i just experienced

407
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:19,680
a week ago a situation on the medical area where i felt that

408
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:25,119
i was i had to really push for advocating for what was right for me right

409
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:30,800
and um but i also recognize where

410
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,839
you know that that was very much about survival a sense of survival or sense of

411
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:42,560
ego or sense of just wanting to have to survive and

412
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:49,119
there's a lot of there's a lot of continuum with that there's times where

413
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:56,079
it's probably egoic to but but how to how to kind of like navigate through

414
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:02,720
that sense of advocating for what you feels right for you know

415
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:09,040
versus allowing things to let go yeah it's a good it's a very good

416
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:14,880
question because some things i said like earlier you shouldn't let go of some things need to happen and so

417
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:21,680
being an advocate and holding your ground and saying no or insisting or staying present

418
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:29,119
and it's not it's not a spectrum it's not like they're just a range it's more like these things can co-exist

419
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:35,680
it's possible that part of our motivation is is a clear wise intention to care for our

420
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:41,440
well-being so we can care for our family or something and some of it is that

421
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,720
pure egotism both can coexist and uh

422
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:52,400
and then it's really a pity for us to you know if there's if part of

423
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:58,400
it is a good intention and part of it is unhealthy to sacrifice

424
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:05,200
the good intention give it up because there's some bad and bad you know intentions as part of it so we

425
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:11,839
have to weigh these things and the impact on them and the harm we might cause or the benefit might cause it's a

426
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:18,079
it's a complicated world what you're bringing up i don't have a simple answer for you except one

427
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:25,040
and the simple answer is um uh learn how to be really mindful of

428
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:31,040
yourself so you can track all the different component parts of what's going on for you

429
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:36,319
and recognize the tension the stress the clinging the

430
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:42,400
contractions that are unnecessary and generally

431
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,920
the physical tension the stress that builds up in the system

432
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:53,040
you can bet generally take that as being unnecessary

433
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:58,240
and whatever is driving you that causes that stress

434
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:04,480
that probably is not useful to have but if you can be motivated and

435
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:10,640
activated engaged in a strong way without that tension or that contraction

436
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:17,839
that brings you suffering go for it if it's the right thing and my hope this practice actually makes

437
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:22,880
us more courageous more willing to kind of stand up and

438
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:32,280
fight for a good cause not less but to do so at ease to do so with peace

439
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:39,839
