1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,718
foreign

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,759
Let's uh set

3
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,758
yeah

4
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,420
the silence beckons us

5
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:54,980
yeah we we can uh place our attention

6
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:03,000
in a simple way with the breath with our body sound

7
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,760
the darkness behind our closed eyes

8
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:16,879
with a phrase a mantra art practice

9
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:31,319
when we don't want the mechanics of our

10
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:42,420
attention to blot out the beckoning of Silence

11
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:22,040
before he died Leonard Cohen wrote a few lines of poetry or referenced

12
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:31,139
listened to the hummingbird whose wings you cannot see listen to the hummingbird don't listen

13
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:37,020
to me listen to the mind of God that doesn't

14
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:43,220
need to be listen to the mind of God don't listen

15
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,460
to me

16
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:11,639
um maybe in that instruction is complete

17
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,539
for you maybe

18
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:23,639
the practice is uh listen listen to the mind

19
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:26,900
of a Buddha

20
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:42,680
but the emphasis is on receptivity

21
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:51,660
untrusting trusting awareness

22
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:04,940
of hearing the silence beckon us

23
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:24,860
the movements of our mind

24
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,500
quite a bit like the body of an animal plowing

25
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,079
and totally blameless

26
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:18,440
we forgive our mind we forgive some sorrow

27
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,620
when we rest

28
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:10,440
suspended silence

29
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:30,600
we find the reconciliation between spiritual

30
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:38,179
urgency and abiding patience

31
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:31,140
there are practices to uh rest from the endlessness of our

32
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,679
coping

33
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:44,100
coping with the intensity

34
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,179
The Human Condition

35
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:02,240
and just kind of give up trying to sort out

36
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:11,400
all the pleasantness from the unpleasantness The Hope from the fear

37
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:16,760
the prose and cons of me

38
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:40,700
when we're not coping anymore

39
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:52,158
there's nothing to do but be awake

40
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:37,340
foreign

41
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:45,140
okay it's good to uh good to sit with you

42
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:52,520
so

43
00:29:55,020 --> 00:30:02,659
silence and Noise we uh

44
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:10,440
live in a very noisy World Realm

45
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:17,940
and of course the blessings of Technology

46
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:24,740
but the ways we drown in it and so much of technology has functioned

47
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:31,880
primarily to scale greed in delusion

48
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:40,500
and um we've kind of drowning in information

49
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:47,778
but can't make much sense of anything

50
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:55,500
line from uh Jennifer Egan's novel candy house

51
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:00,779
um she says knowing everything is too much

52
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:06,059
like knowing nothing without a story it's all just

53
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:12,480
information it is

54
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:18,179
um very very easy to lose a plot

55
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:25,700
the plot of our life it's very easy to

56
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:35,240
take on that kind of prevailing values of the moment of the context

57
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:41,100
and um and when we're when we're pretty happy

58
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:46,559
when things are going okay our things can be kind of fun

59
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:53,640
yeah things we often take to be important they can be kind of fun I don't want to dismiss that

60
00:31:53,640 --> 00:32:00,840
but when we're unhappy when things are breaking down almost nothing matters

61
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:06,080
except the heart there's just

62
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:13,919
zero consolation from ownership

63
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:22,220
when there's not wisdom delusion fills the vacuum

64
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:31,200
so maybe we we know the experience experiences like like we have on Retreat

65
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,600
especially maybe a little little Whirlpool of suffering

66
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:43,200
yeah the day is going all right we're doing our practice whatever like okay there's a whirlpool

67
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,620
and we get spun out about whatever

68
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:54,659
and uh and on Retreat you know the blessing of

69
00:32:54,659 --> 00:33:00,200
retreat the blessing of continuity you get to see

70
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:05,220
how little that the kind of House of Cards we built we get to actually see

71
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:11,880
the collapse when the house of cards that seems so meaningful the story that seems so

72
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:19,159
meaningful we get to see a collapse and we we see how little it actually

73
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:28,019
meant right but um some whirlpools are 10 minutes long

74
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:35,120
and some are 10 years is that from uh

75
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:40,980
poet David White um said some years ago I found myself

76
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:47,519
working with a room full of particularly thoughtful managers we were looking at all the way as humans

77
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:53,820
find it necessary to sacrifice their own sacred desires and personal Visions on the altar

78
00:33:53,820 --> 00:34:00,360
work and success out of this a woman wrote the following lines she

79
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:07,260
read them slowly from the back of the room unaware stricken we all were by the

80
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:13,260
silence she created she said 10 years ago

81
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:20,838
I turned my face for a moment and it became my life

82
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:34,460
possible for that to happen and it's possible for us to wake up

83
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:45,720
and so we asked the question how do we um keep from losing the plot how do we

84
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:52,320
remember and we

85
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,980
we take our Council from death

86
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:04,338
I am of the nature to age

87
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:11,339
to become ill to die there's nothing I can do

88
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:20,780
to escape this okay okay take it in the kind of remembrances yeah

89
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:28,140
we take it in and we see what in our mind holds on and

90
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:32,960
what let's go we see what Falls away

91
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:39,900
and so much of what we do mean in our life

92
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:47,460
in the busyness kind of it maintains its momentum only in light

93
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:53,040
of immortality we tacently are assuming

94
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,500
immortality it's the only way this little thing

95
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:04,440
matters because if I knew in this moment yeah

96
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:11,940
this thing ends The View would be different

97
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:18,300
so we bring the contemplation to the surface not to scare ourselves but to

98
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:26,400
sense into what we care about what will matter what

99
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:32,880
would make life feel more complete we're Complete because even if we were

100
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:40,820
to live carelessly for a thousand years it would not feel like enough

101
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:50,579
it would not feel like enough it's almost like the image I'm having is that kind of the Hungry Ghost with the huge

102
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:58,079
belly and the tiny mouth and trying to get sustenance you know and maybe we're like that with life with

103
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:04,440
time you know What would

104
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:13,460
make it feel like enough we we ask ourselves uh this question

105
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:20,520
saw this interview with uh with Roland Griffis who's a psychopharmacologist at

106
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:26,339
Hopkins and I knew his work long before he got famous for doing

107
00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:34,260
um psychedelic research he was a kind of drug you know abuse liability researcher and

108
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:41,700
very uh kind of well-respected and I didn't know long-term meditator

109
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:45,380
and then um

110
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:55,140
then got into a psychedelic research and

111
00:37:55,140 --> 00:38:00,720
um I was um quite sad as he was recently

112
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:08,640
diagnosed serious aggressive disease and um saw an interview with him and he

113
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,040
says the interviewer says um you talk about your cancer almost as if

114
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:19,140
it's a gift does that mean you don't have any regrets about what's happening

115
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:24,780
and Griffith's response was my life has never been better

116
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:29,720
if I had a regret it's uh

117
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:40,920
I had a regret it's that I didn't wake up as much as I have without a cancer

118
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:46,099
diagnosis it's been incredible

119
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:58,880
so to live in alignment with our

120
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:05,700
with our deepest value is what we care about it takes something powerful

121
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:13,460
nuclear powered really keep remembering

122
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:21,140
and it takes um takes energy takes

123
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:29,400
wisdom renunciation the the Buddha famously described anger

124
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,640
as having a honey honey tip and poisoned root

125
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:41,220
and um in this life there is a lot of honey and

126
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:48,420
a lot of poison and how do we remember that the honey is

127
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,799
tied to the poison

128
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:02,599
how do we not be conned by what doesn't matter

129
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:07,819
we recall our death

130
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:16,740
and there's something about that contemplation where I can almost just feel like the energy draining out of the

131
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:23,940
defilements and it just feels like too much to

132
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:29,060
nurse the dense

133
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:37,260
stories or old resentments or the Envy or divisiveness or whatever is

134
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:45,140
just like okay don't have time for that

135
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:54,380
and so maybe maybe what I'm saying is that uh

136
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:01,260
what's been said a million times is uh death helps us let

137
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:06,660
go it helps us let go

138
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:12,920
of fake Refuge fake happiness

139
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:22,800
death of course is a letting go right where

140
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:31,680
in a way in each moment we practice we're practicing uh practicing

141
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:36,839
or the enormous letting go of death each time we surrender

142
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:40,280
to imperfection

143
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:49,859
each time we uh stop coping each time we open to a

144
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:56,720
certain kind of helplessness yeah

145
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:02,299
we're practicing dying

146
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,220
and uh

147
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:20,480
in a certain way rehearsing our own death both as a preparation

148
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,500
and as a

149
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:34,940
a way of clarifying what's going to count and in the wake of that kind of

150
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:41,839
surrender that the the Dayton with the first Noble Truth

151
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:48,720
uh the Dharma makes a lot of sense

152
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,599
death helps the Dharma make a lot of sense

153
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:07,260
to offer this for your consideration and please uh pick up what is useful and

154
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:13,260
leave the rest behind yeah we were speaking one-on-one there's no

155
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:21,599
way I would say exactly all of this to each of you so we each need to Wade through

156
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:27,980
the words of others to find a what's useful

157
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,740
okay
