00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:08,080
my greetings my warmest greetings to all of you and here from redwood city in

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,440
california at the inside meditation center

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:20,880
and um the topic uh for most much of this week

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:28,160
is the uh important insight one of the probably the most

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,840
important insight for people doing the pastana practice and for

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,760
what we see in the teachings of the buddha is the insight into the inconstancy

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,800
of experience and in constancy means that the moment-to-moment experience that we

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,840
have there's a lot of arising and passing appearing and disappearing of our

9
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,920
experience that is hidden from us if we

10
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:07,680
dwell in the ideas of what is happening uh ideas have a constancy to them

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,880
in our imagination we have an image perhaps of something and and the image is not really current with

12
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:22,159
how things are changing always and uh and this inconstancy is a

13
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,200
repetition of just new things appearing they disappear

14
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:34,720
or they get replaced they're superseded by other things that arise and so for this meditation today i would

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,000
like to emphasize the appearing of experience the arising

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,720
of phenomena that we are aware of we perceive and

17
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:53,759
many things appear in awareness without any choice in our part or wish on our

18
00:01:53,759 --> 00:02:00,240
part they just appear if there's a building in the environment where you're a sound

19
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,520
in the environment where you're at chances are some of those sounds are

20
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:12,480
creaking of a building or traffic outside is not something you willed or planned on having or

21
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:19,520
but it just arises it appears in awareness and then there's a recognition there's a sound and it

22
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:26,879
happens on your cheek and it wasn't there before and now it's appeared and

23
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:34,319
it was not planned it was not engineered it just appeared no choice

24
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,480
no choice on your part and but it's there it is and the initial appearance of many of

25
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,560
these things is effortless and that it's effortless on our part we don't have to make any

26
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,640
effort to make it appear and so as we sit and meditate there are

27
00:02:52,640 --> 00:03:01,040
many things that will just appear in awareness and to settle back and just watch and

28
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,800
observe the appearance of things don't have to worry about how long it

29
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,840
stays and you don't have to worry about seeing it's passing away

30
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,400
but in the course of the meditation many of things that appear will in fact disappear

31
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:27,040
they'll be there for a while and and then they will pass away there may be some things that endure

32
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,120
don't worry about that and um but for this meditation we'll stay with

33
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,319
the breathing it's the kind of that's the the beat or the the base that we kind of

34
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:45,120
keep staying at um being with the breathing in breathing out but as we do that in the

35
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,720
breathing itself we can be aware of just new new sensations arise

36
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:58,400
um or maybe not new it might be similar to what's happened at the last in breath or last out breath but still we can

37
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,480
we're there to not do not necessarily experience new things arising just that things arise

38
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:12,239
arise arise arise things appear without and there can be a cascade or a rapid sequence of many

39
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,600
little sensations that arise on the in-breath and the out-breath but that he has to rest and stay with

40
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,639
the breathing stay close and intimate to the breathing but then as you do so

41
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,160
gently in the peripheral attention as things arise a sound a sensation your

42
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,240
body a thought see it as something that's arising

43
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:42,560
if your thinking is incessant then notice how the the pixels of thinking

44
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,919
appear in the the structure of your thinking the thoughts that

45
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:54,080
if you think in words different words appear and disappear if you think more in images different

46
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:02,320
images images changes and new things appear just be sensitive much as you can to appearing appearing

47
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:11,440
and you might even gently use the label appearing appearing as just a reminder stay here

48
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:18,960
don't strain don't be actively looking so much as settling back and allowing

49
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,880
like you're giving space for things to appear sensations experiences

50
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:31,440
to show themselves so taking a meditation posture

51
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:39,840
and gently closing your eyes and sitting here just right away

52
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:48,080
what appears what shows up

53
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,639
what sensations what feelings what emotions what demon

54
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,800
thoughts that didn't exist before or didn't were happening just before

55
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,560
but then appear

56
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,479
the sound of my voice appears

57
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:26,160
and if you drop into your body what appears what sensations feelings

58
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:35,840
and say are there that you weren't aware of before

59
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:46,720
and if as you feel your body you feel the body's wish to relax

60
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:53,680
maybe the shoulders the arms the belly the face give into that pull of

61
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:03,840
relaxation allow it to happen

62
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:17,840
and as you do there may be new sensations arise

63
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:44,080
and if what arises as you're sitting here is unpleasant

64
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,599
maybe don't worry about it even if it's if it stays for a while

65
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:54,720
don't worry about it this is a meditation about being open

66
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,840
to the next thing that arises

67
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,440
the next thing that arises

68
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:12,080
and if it's a presence what arises

69
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:27,360
don't hang on to it because you want to be available for the next arising

70
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,200
if you find yourself straining or trying too hard to just be with the arising of

71
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,320
phenomena then relax and center yourself from the

72
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:44,640
breathing again simple breathing in and breathing out

73
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,000
and then at some point gently

74
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,800
not trying too hard begin noticing again

75
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:05,760
the arising of experience and it might be mostly in the breathing

76
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:14,640
or in the body around the breathing or anywhere where arising new things

77
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:21,680
come into awareness and just know it's very simply

78
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,640
know it as an arising and appearing

79
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:37,839
without any other need to label it or understand it

80
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,959
just knowing it as something that's

81
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,839
arising

82
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:06,160
and knowing that it is good to be aware of

83
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:13,040
the appearing of experience in awareness

84
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,839
as it moves through as it appears and comes

85
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:37,040
in this small little sliver of time that we call the present

86
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:43,200
moment noticing what appears

87
00:10:44,959 --> 00:11:01,839
and how it appears changes

88
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:06,560
in the way that awareness operates it tends to move around

89
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:12,079
now aware of this now that sometimes following

90
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,720
the train of thought or feelings or

91
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:26,560
so part of things that arise in awareness arise because how awareness has shifted

92
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,759
were shifts

93
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,240
even when something is relatively constant

94
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,959
in the subtle details of awareness

95
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,839
or attention goes somewhere else and then it might return

96
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:05,839
and it's a new era and what was before arises again into awareness

97
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:15,120
to be aware of change in the arising of phenomena of experience

98
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:24,158
as if your mind your awareness is wide and receptive and open

99
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,480
receiving whatever arises

100
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:45,840
like the surface of the lake receives the raindrops

101
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:50,399
we're receiving the arising of sensations in your body

102
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,840
like the bubbles that appear in sparkling water

103
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,080
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

104
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:21,760
that new experiences new things arise all the time for us not so hard to understand

105
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:29,278
a new new person appears or calls or emails the email arises

106
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:39,039
maybe we'd eaten and we're satiated and full and then at some point hunger

107
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:49,840
rises again we rest well rested and then sleepiness arises again

108
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:58,240
but to see phenomena first and foremost has something that's

109
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:04,240
a risen to be right there in the present moment see oh it just appeared

110
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:13,360
there it is and to do so in a receptive way open way

111
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:24,960
to receive it in a liberated way not entangled or caught in it

112
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,240
but with an attitude that you could

113
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:37,279
bow to it whatever arises you bow

114
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:45,840
yes and so as you go through the day

115
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:53,039
new people will somehow or other come into your awareness maybe you'll see them

116
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:59,840
maybe they'll talk to you on the phone or send you an email

117
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:06,159
maybe you can be go through the day ready and open in the present to receive the

118
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:15,120
next arising person in such a way that you could bow to them

119
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:22,159
bow to them as a in a certain reverence or certain

120
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:28,559
deep appreciation of their capacity to have emotions and

121
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:34,240
thoughts and feelings their capacity for

122
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:40,880
goodness they have a heart a sensitive heart as

123
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,600
well as you

124
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:56,159
to give some care and attention to the first appearance of others into

125
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:01,360
your life today and how you are how how that's received

126
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,480
in your awareness in your heart and your mind

127
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:13,679
perhaps before the reactions and usual thoughts and

128
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:21,360
ideas and entanglements as if you could bow to everyone who

129
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:29,120
appears and the bowing expresses a wish

130
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,480
may you be happy

131
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,720
may you be safe

132
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:45,120
may you be peaceful

133
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:51,840
and may you be free

134
00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:00,000
and then my receptive awareness of you

135
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:09,919
always ready to have those wishes may it be that i contribute to it being

136
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:18,559
so may i live this day

137
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:24,880
aware of the people who come into my awareness

138
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:35,440
living for their welfare and happiness and freedom may all beings everywhere

139
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:47,840
be happy may all beings everywhere be free

140
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:12,840
so the topic continues to be the 13th step of the mindfulness of

141
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:19,760
breathing observing one trains oneself

142
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,799
observing in constancy i will breathe in observing and

143
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:33,279
constancy i will breathe out just how the instructions are and this observing of

144
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:39,919
in constancy usually translated as impermanence

145
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:45,600
is really as i said yesterday is the core insight of insight meditation the core insight of

146
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:51,519
the buddha's teachings in the ancient texts and the definition of the buddha gave

147
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:58,480
repeatedly for wisdom wisdom is the perception of arising and passing the insight into

148
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:06,480
the arising and disappearing of phenomena that is noble and penetrating

149
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:14,799
and leads to the ending of suffering so it's the

150
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:24,240
experience the perception of seeing things arise and pass that leads to liberation to awakening

151
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:30,559
and uh and so the site and constancy that you the way that in constancy is understood here

152
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:36,960
is um it is the uh it's defined as over in many

153
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,720
different words in the ancient language that are equivalent to the english arising and passing appearing and

154
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,600
disappearing and

155
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,559
things like that and it's hard to understand to appreciate

156
00:33:54,559 --> 00:34:01,120
how valuable this is to have this experience until one experiences in a very deep

157
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:06,159
subtle quiet place in meditation that's really where this deep insight is

158
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:11,839
really it's really an insight that works and it's very penetrating and noble

159
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:17,839
awakening when the mind is really ready for seeing that if an ordinary consciousness

160
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:22,960
walking around the street someone tells you just to notice the arising and passing a phenomena

161
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:29,839
it probably won't stick it probably won't be any sense of continuity with that resting in it just being open to it

162
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:36,158
because you have to take care of too many details walking on the street and figuring out what's going on and

163
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:42,000
and um but in deep meditation to be really at rest and really able to

164
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,040
be centered in a receptive open observing way of the the flow of

165
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:55,118
experience in awareness uh that's possible because we're not overlaying

166
00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:01,680
concepts and ideas on top of things we're just there in the direct experience of

167
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:07,680
of perception and sensations and the beginning of thoughts and even with the emotions that might feel

168
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,800
an ordinary street consciousness as being continuous we when your mind is very quiet and

169
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:20,800
still we're beginning to feel and sense the uh how they actually kind of um are very

170
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,880
momentarily fleetingly coming into existence out of existence there's a coming into awareness and out of a worse

171
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:33,200
awareness the mind picks it up and doesn't pick it up and generally what happens is we sew

172
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:40,400
these all these different moments of arising and passing together into a feeling of constancy into into idea that

173
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:46,320
it's continuous but when we don't have ideas anymore just in the experience

174
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,599
um this arising and passing occurs and this is meant to me this is supposed

175
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:57,280
to be liberating um i mean to do this and partly it's because

176
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:04,079
when we see that things are constantly in flux that um it's hard to it doesn't make

177
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:09,440
sense to cling to them to grasp onto them it's like you're seeing the river flow

178
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:15,440
binds clearly moving and in flux and then you put your hand in there to grab the river and hold it

179
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:20,560
and you grab a handful of the river and you pull it up and by the time you open your hand to

180
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:26,160
hold the river all the water has kind of squeezed out of your fingers and run off

181
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:33,040
and you might have a little bit of drops left on your on your uh on your hand but you don't go with those

182
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:38,480
drops of water and you're in your hand and go up to your friends on the shore and say hey look

183
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,760
i have the river in my hand if you think you're holding the river

184
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:49,359
because you have those few little drops you know that's no longer the river the river is partly defined by

185
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:54,880
water that's flowing and those drops are no longer in that flow and so the idea

186
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:00,640
of picking something out of the flow of experience and holding on to it if we're in the

187
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:06,480
flow really centered in it then we see it you know we've actually left the flow we've

188
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,920
actually now kind of holding something an idea of something that's just a little drop it's

189
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:18,480
just a little maybe even i don't know what and some it turns out that so much of what

190
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:26,000
we um get attached to cling to resist is not actually reality

191
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,680
but uh the the idea interpretation the concept we have of reality

192
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:39,520
and so to it's hard to explain that to people in ordinary consciousness but to really be centered and quiet and see

193
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:46,640
the flow of the vibratory flow of the sparkling flow the raindrop being on

194
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:52,400
the lake appearing and disappearing a phenomenon becomes glaringly obvious

195
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:58,880
that it doesn't make sense to cling to it it doesn't make sense to resist to it but rather is to open to it and just

196
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:04,480
allow it to move through and and just allow it to flow and move

197
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,680
in there and generally when that happens our relationship to that experience changes

198
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,720
dramatically so even if it's been a very we have physical pain

199
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:20,800
which is very hard to be with i know but when we really in the ability of being

200
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,839
concentrated and still and feel it all is flowing sensation the pain

201
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:32,079
gets transformed into something else that doesn't really feel painful anymore it's a flow of this arising and passing

202
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:37,599
of sensations that becomes a whole different way of experiencing it but it requires the mind

203
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:43,599
being very still and focused and present and quiet to do that

204
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:51,520
so this is the core insight to see the appearing and disappearing phenomenon in the guided meditation

205
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:56,640
i was focusing mostly on the arising and at some point we'll do a meditation

206
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:02,560
just focusing on the passing away a phenomena and then arising and passing

207
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:07,599
a phenomenon that occurred together but

208
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:13,520
the so our relationship to things begins to shift

209
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:20,400
and there's a wonderful verse in the dhammapada

210
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:29,440
that where it starts with a kind of a quote that all things are inconstant so everything

211
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:36,000
is arising and passing so even things that are continuous and

212
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,280
from ordinary consciousness seem like they're just unchanging in some way or they're

213
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:47,920
in the mind's way of experiencing it it's the experience that's arising in passing so we want to be a little bit

214
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:54,400
careful we're not getting too wrapped up in um the thing that we're perceiving

215
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:00,160
is inconstant it's the way it's the nature of how experience happens

216
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:07,760
that's inconstant uh uh there's a momentary kind of pixelated

217
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:13,040
nature of reality or this flow of this flow of experience that comes and goes

218
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:21,359
that is built into the very nature of how we are aware how we experience things so um

219
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:30,160
so so here the buddha says all created things are inconstant and the word is sankara

220
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:35,520
which uh which uh it's i'd like to suggest that what we're talking

221
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:44,000
about is all created experiences all the ways in which the mind perceives

222
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:50,720
and takes in and constructs our reality everything everything like that is just

223
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:58,960
is inconstant it's in flux and moving and seeing this with insight

224
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:06,560
and one becomes disenchanted with suffering one becomes disenchanted

225
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:12,000
with suffering so whoever believes that they're enchanted with suffering

226
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,760
enchanted means and maybe it kind of means enamored it means kind of caught in this i'd like caught on the

227
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:25,440
spell of it somehow if we hate our suffering we're caught in its spell

228
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:31,200
we're in enchanted by it in a certain way i guess if that means in english to be under a

229
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:37,440
spell if we hate something we're under its spell we're caught we're entangled

230
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:43,920
and there's something about seeing the constancy of experience that helps us to disentangle ourselves

231
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,760
to become to break that spell to not be so caught in it

232
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:56,319
and so all things are inconstant all created things are in

233
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:03,440
constant all sankharas seeing this with insight one becomes disenchanted with suffering

234
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,640
this is the path of purity this is a path of purity

235
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:15,040
so it's a little bit problematic this idea of purity but just a few verses before they talk

236
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:22,079
about purity this way this is the path for purifying

237
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:27,599
one's vision purifying our awareness our vision how

238
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:35,040
we see things so it's not necessarily becoming a completely you know a saint inside that kind of purity but

239
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:40,079
rather it's um coming to a place where our capacity to

240
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:45,200
be aware is purified all the filters of thoughts ideas reactions emotions

241
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:50,880
that prevent us from seeing clearly but to really see clearly see things as

242
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:59,839
they are we want to see the inconstancy of phenomena then this the verse goes on goes on

243
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:06,400
all created things are suffering seeing this with insight one becomes

244
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:14,160
disenchanted with suffering and here we have the second of the three characteristics the three

245
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:19,200
are in constancy suffering and the

246
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:26,560
third is not self and these three characteristics are the core insights of insight

247
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:32,880
meditation it starts with arising and passing in there and in seeing the arising and passing

248
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:38,720
there's something about seeing that level of our experience that layer of our experience

249
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:43,920
that gives birth to a clear clear

250
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:50,720
insight into the in here that this translator which is me

251
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:57,280
translates as suffering the word is dukkha and for now it may be it's could be more usefully

252
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:03,599
translated in this context as stressful but we'll talk more about that on monday

253
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:10,319
and and then it goes on to say all things are not self seeing this with

254
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:15,760
insight one becomes disenchanted with suffering

255
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:21,119
so we'll continue this idea of the three characteristics which are so phenomenally important for insight

256
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:26,880
meditation that's worth spending some time with it and and this movement of seeing and

257
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:32,240
constancy observing a constancy has an impact on the meditator

258
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:37,520
and the impact is a process of disenchantment of breaking the spell

259
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:44,640
of how we're caught or entangled or clinging or attached to things and

260
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:50,640
where the allure the promise of attachment the promise that uh grasping will

261
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:56,160
somehow uh save us or do something for us begins to be broken

262
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:03,040
and um and uh so that's uh so

263
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:10,560
so you might want to today during this weekend look a little bit at um at

264
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:17,760
this idea of inconstancy and arising and passing a phenomena and see if somehow that casts any

265
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,800
perspective on how you might be enchanted with suffering

266
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:30,160
or caught in its spell so i have a little bit of time today

267
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:37,040
so we can stop uh formally here but if some of you would like to stay a little bit longer and put some

268
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:43,200
questions in the chat i'm happy to try to answer and i might not be able to answer them in order

269
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:50,880
but but if you would like to try i'm happy to stay and

270
00:45:50,880 --> 00:46:01,838
and for a little while

271
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,680
and constancy is not bad news aha nice

272
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,280
so are the transcripts of your talks yes but they're not necessarily coming

273
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:48,400
uh right away but there's a wonderful team of people who are transcribing these talks in the

274
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:55,680
morning and i think some of the earlier ones are available now from earlier in the year or before so um

275
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:02,400
if you go on audio dharma where their the audio recording of them appear it'll say if there's a

276
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:08,800
transcription available and they're likely edited luckily so um

277
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:14,480
and um and uh and the person leading up that uh that

278
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:19,680
wonderful the project of transcribing is uh meg galler who often says hello here in the

279
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:26,558
morning so uh thank you so much meg and your team for this great work you're doing

280
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:38,160
where does awareness go when we are caught in thinking a lovely question where does it go um

281
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:45,200
where does it go well it depends what we mean by

282
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:52,079
awareness if awareness is not the same as consciousness but

283
00:47:52,079 --> 00:48:00,880
awareness is conscious awareness or how to say it if there's

284
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:06,079
knowing awareness we know what we're aware of we know what's coming into consciousness there's a lot

285
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:14,000
of things we know that are come into awareness that we don't really you know clearly fully up i know that

286
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,680
like so for example just saying all this i was aware that i have these lights on

287
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:27,760
here and the kind of studio lights just that i was aware of this light that and then i knew oh the light is on

288
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:33,280
and uh but it wasn't the second kind of the knowing of it is different than just kind of i go

289
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:39,680
about and not paying attention i don't think about it i don't have any act of formal recognition

290
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:48,240
we're thinking our consciousness our awareness i like to think of it as it gets hijacked and held hostage by our

291
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:54,400
thinking uh we get so glued to our thinking that that kind of self-reflective

292
00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:02,000
awareness that we know what's happening and what we're doing we know that we're thinking gets lost because it's so preoccupied so

293
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:09,040
glued to it so that's probably an inadequate answer and and but then we'll have to leave for

294
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:14,800
that can you say more about dealing with pain especially for those with chronic illness

295
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:21,359
yeah that's a huge topic and for now and um and um it's a very very important one

296
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:28,800
there's a lot of people who have pain and they're managing their life with pain and chronic illness and

297
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:34,160
and uh i think one of the great benefits of mindfulness meditation in circumstances like that

298
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:39,280
is to help us not add second arrows to it to the when we already have tremendous

299
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:46,319
difficulty in trying to figure out and working our life with this difficulty to not add

300
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:53,839
shame or self-incrimination or or or resentment or anger or

301
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:59,599
to not get attached to it should have been different why isn't it different i should have you

302
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:04,800
know whatever it might be the second arrows but to learn how to be

303
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:10,319
simpler and simpler and to allow ourselves to be be ill

304
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:16,559
and painful in the simplest possible way maybe even an ordinary way as if oh yes

305
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:22,000
i'm sick that's what's happening and then absolutely take care of ourselves try to try to be well

306
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:28,720
and try not to try to do what we can to heal the pain or overcome the illness

307
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:34,000
and this is not a passivity that we want to have about it but

308
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:40,720
we do what we can and sometimes we can't do much but the practice can help us then become very simple with it and breathe with it

309
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:46,400
and not add extra attention and stress to the already stressful situation

310
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:52,720
and then as the mindfulness gets stronger and more concentrated then it's possible to bring a careful

311
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:58,640
loving compassionate attention deeply into the pain and the illness to really feel the

312
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:04,240
direct experience of it and that sometimes allows to be different kinds of shifts

313
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:09,520
and beneficial shifts and i don't want to say exactly how those beneficial shifts will

314
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:15,520
look like different for different people and i don't want to set up the expectation that mindfulness

315
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:22,720
can help make the pain go completely away or the illness go away and that it's healing that way but it it can

316
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:28,800
be healing for the heart the mindfulness practice so the illness and the pain might not go away

317
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:36,000
but the heart is healed and that that's the movement of liberation and and then we become whole

318
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,359
in a certain way is closed captioning available for these talks

319
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:46,480
you know i believe they are through youtube but i'm not i don't really haven't tracked all this

320
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:54,400
so well i'll try to find out but i believe there's a way maybe down in the settings and on youtube you can um

321
00:51:54,400 --> 00:52:02,599
they're there that way and um so

322
00:52:02,599 --> 00:52:08,160
oh you know that it kind of goes by quickly so i miss i can't do

323
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:14,000
them in order i apologize um our thoughts the central mechanism

324
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,200
as to how we cling to these constant phenomena

325
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:25,520
i don't know if thoughts are the mechanism for clinging but at least in my experience

326
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:34,800
that mostly what we cling to what is our thoughts these are ideas and um

327
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:40,400
and it's not so obvious until you might you know you really see how this works in a deep quiet way

328
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:46,000
um so we don't really cling to physical pleasure but it's more like

329
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,200
we're clinging to what what the pleasures what the thoughts the ideas the

330
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:56,880
that we have about what these the pleasure is doing for us

331
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:03,520
um to get it

332
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:15,040
oh to to get to the deepest levels of insight it seems we have to let go of every to-do list in our life how can we

333
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:21,680
function in the world if we want to go into the deepest levels of insight great question

334
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:31,359
yes to get to the deepest level of freedom um you have to put aside or let go of

335
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:36,720
any clinging all clinging and but

336
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:43,359
we can still hold things without clinging so you know i can

337
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:48,559
i can be attached to the striker and i can feel i'm attached to it i'm so

338
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:54,720
you know i should therefore let go of it and i can just drop it drop it but another way of letting it's not the

339
00:53:54,720 --> 00:54:01,040
thing that we necessarily have to let go of when we let go of attachment it's not the thing

340
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:08,160
unless it's you know harmful and the striker is not harmful in itself it's the clinging we let go of so then

341
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:13,520
we can go like this and we can still hold it without any grasping

342
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:19,520
so in deep meditation we want to put everything aside

343
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:24,720
and so with the to-do list you would maybe put it on a to-do list on a piece of paper

344
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:29,760
and put it up on a shelf leave it on your table and and just put it aside

345
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:35,920
and then later you come back to it and then i look at it and and hold all the things on the to-do

346
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:42,000
list with this open hand an open mind and and then go through them and have the pleasure of

347
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:48,400
checking them off but don't get uh attached to any of it or clinging to any of it

348
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:54,640
so there's you're welcome to keep your to-do list and hopefully the deep letting go and the deep wisdom

349
00:54:54,640 --> 00:55:00,160
of of meditation helps you to look at that list and prioritize

350
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:05,200
in a good way and maybe few of the things on the list are not necessary a few of the things

351
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:10,400
maybe represent something you're attached to maybe

352
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:21,839
unattached to unnecessarily

353
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:32,240
there seems to be two kinds of inconstancy how our awareness flickers and then perhaps wraps

354
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:37,359
things up in a constant narrative the flickering inconsistency of phenomena itself

355
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:43,119
is that correct yeah yeah first that sounds nice um

356
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:50,559
but things are not random the inconsistency of what appears and disappears is not completely random

357
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:58,319
but it arises because of preceding conditions and and so nothing arises out of nothing

358
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:03,760
but the conditions come together and then things arise and uh

359
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:08,799
and so in dharma practice we're actually putting in place the conditions

360
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:16,319
so that uh we have more consistency so that we have uh more likely that uh

361
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:22,160
we move in a certain direction we grow in certain directions we certain kinds of arising tends to arise

362
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:28,960
more often so for example if you practice a lot of loving-kindness then that sets the conditions that when

363
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:36,720
you sit and we feel pain we're ready to feel a compassion maybe and love for ourselves

364
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:42,640
and care for ourselves then we are to be angry with ourselves or angry with

365
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:48,480
other people because what's happening to us and so it's inc there's an inconsistency but we begin to

366
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:58,799
shape that inconsistency so it tends in one direction in a beneficial direction

367
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:04,319
so would you please say more about the buddha never said no self or he had a sense of self yes so we'll

368
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:13,838
talk about that next week when we get to not self in this exploration of inconstancy

369
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:22,240
i have i have hopes it kind of goes away

370
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:29,040
i have tetanus i think it's tonight that tinnitus

371
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:38,799
tinnitus there we go oh it's an idea so where is it i was oh anyway so

372
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:45,119
anyway i guess no i missed a question but tonight is i i've had i have tinnitus so the one of the best

373
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:51,680
things for me is if no one brings up the word um because then if i'm reminded then i start hearing the

374
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:56,799
ringing in my ears so and uh there are times where i've

375
00:57:56,799 --> 00:58:03,119
been really troubled by this uh you know really draw me kind of batty uh the ringing in my ears

376
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:10,000
and but now i'm not troubled by it anymore and it kind of recedes and and some people find it useful to make

377
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:15,599
it the object of meditation and um it has a kind of constant constancy

378
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:22,720
that um that is grounding for some people and uh and i found it i've never found

379
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:28,079
it particularly useful to pay attention to it and in fact some teachers actually say

380
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:33,599
this is one of the things in mindfulness practice you shouldn't pay attention to the idea is to pay attention to everything in

381
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:40,240
mindfulness but not to pay attention to that so it all depends on the person and uh

382
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:45,920
you know what's useful and not useful but um i mostly these days

383
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:52,079
um don't give in much attention and don't you know i've learned not to react to it

384
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:58,160
not to before against it and just to okay there it is and then

385
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:04,720
i'll continue with my breathing and sit there and practice and go on with other things and

386
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:10,720
and i know for some people it's really bad they just have some kind of ambient sound around and that sometimes

387
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:19,838
you know masks it hides it

388
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:27,839
it's a challenge to hold one's tongue and only observe yes this is the advanced graduate school

389
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:32,960
mindfulness to be mindful of speaking and there's so much attachment so much

390
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:40,960
force and power and desires that come into play in speaking that um but it's so beneficial

391
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:47,760
to bring mindfulness to thinking it's a window into to say it in non-buddhist dramatic terms

392
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:53,359
to really be mindful of our of our talking and what drives our talking and why

393
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:59,440
we're going to say what we're going to do and what what is the the emotional motivation for

394
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:05,200
our talking it's kind of like a dramatic window into our soul into our depth of

395
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:15,838
who we actually are so it's certainly worthwhile to learn to do that

396
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,839
writes closed captioning equals the oral notes on audiodharma so

397
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:44,160
oh someone says yeah closed captioning on youtube is not available live but seems to show up later on

398
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:51,200
if things are inconstant and clinging to them causes us to suffer what does that mean for choices of the

399
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:58,000
heart like marriage and career things are constantly clinging to them causes us to suffer what does it mean

400
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:05,280
for choices in the heart like marriage or a career well ideally we would

401
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:12,319
choose marriage or a career without any clinging

402
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:19,440
and in the flow of things are still make choices that uh the direction we want our lives and

403
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:24,559
the purpose of our lives the meaning of our lives and what we want to really put our heart

404
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:29,599
into more than anything else we don't have to just kind of go randomly along with whatever happens

405
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:34,640
and it's a beautiful thing for some people to have a career or have a marriage that

406
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:41,040
they want to be to devote themselves to be engaged in other people make other choices that are

407
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:47,119
just as good and valuable now with something like marriage and

408
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:52,400
maybe with careers as well if we wait until we have no clinging and

409
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:58,880
no crave no craving no attachment the buddhist idea of attachment craving clinging

410
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:04,000
before we get married and then perhaps most people wouldn't get married

411
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:10,319
because that's kind of there's you know there's kind of you know there's not a crime it's not

412
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:17,280
it's not a crime it's not in buddhism it's not a sin or a crime to be attached and to cling it just means

413
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:23,119
we're going to suffer some somewhat because of it but one way to approach something like marriage and

414
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:28,400
career or any choice we make for our lives is to fold it into our mindfulness

415
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:35,520
practice fold it into our careful care and attention and compassion for where is our clinging where's our

416
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:43,760
attachment and marriage it can be a great place to and family and kids a great place

417
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:50,480
to discover where we're attached to where our clinging cravings are that maybe it's very deep that we

418
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:55,920
wouldn't see in ourselves unless we were in this kind of intimate committed relationship

419
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:03,119
and and then to work through it and come to the other side of it so it can be folded in as a path of the

420
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:10,960
practice as opposed to we avoid all these things because we're we're clinging and

421
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:16,799
so it's probably best not to choose to go into marriage because you want to work out your

422
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:22,319
clinging but but so hopefully that answers the question

423
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:28,400
well enough what chapter verse from dhammapada did you cite oh i think it's well the

424
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:33,599
chapter is first it's like in the 170s let me see

425
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:41,119
it is verse oh 277 that what i read and it's in

426
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:47,520
chapter 20 the path yeah this is my i'm reading from my translation that i did 20 years

427
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:53,920
ago or so and and it's a little bit fascinating and a

428
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:59,520
little bit i don't know if embarrassing but a little bit of regret that

429
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:06,240
um choices english choice you know i was my poly my study of the pseudos was not

430
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:14,480
what it was now so i would translate some of this differently now and and also the use of gender pronouns

431
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:21,039
i try to avoid um in order to become more gender neutral i did many things i did in a general

432
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:26,079
neutral way but sometimes i would if there was two pairs of verses

433
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:31,119
where in the original it was the masculine pronoun i would do one with he and the other was

434
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:36,319
she and at the time i thought that was good but 20 years later you know or

435
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:41,839
10 years later i understood that it's we really want to try to be gender

436
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:51,440
neutral more fully because of how many people don't fit into the binary of he and she

437
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:59,920
and and so i regret that i left it and that i mean they didn't know enough back then to make that choice so anyway

438
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:06,640
um oh someone asks meg if um need more help

439
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:12,000
with transcription and someone else as well um

440
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:17,200
yeah so she says you can contact imc volunteer coordinator hillary borson

441
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:22,799
you can i think if you go on the imc's website there's probably a place there

442
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:31,280
for volunteering and you could just let her let hillary know and she'll be the support at all

443
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:40,240
okay maybe i'll do one more here are these deep insights only really possible with lengthy

444
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:46,319
meditation retreats have you read the harper's article about the possible dangers of this

445
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:52,640
um um no it doesn't require deep insights but

446
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:59,200
if you're if you're uh if you for many people in our tradition at least it's usually

447
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:06,400
uh in in in meditation retreats that this really settles in and

448
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:14,160
really kind of becomes digested or we see it and are impacted in a very good way these deep insights

449
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:19,680
and for most people and uh but once we have a clear sense of it

450
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:24,720
and a familiarity with it then they kind of live in a delightful and wonderful way

451
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:31,119
much more in our daily life as well and it doesn't require deep meditation anymore to really

452
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:37,839
have it be part of the landscape these insights and and affect us and um i might have read the harper's

453
01:06:37,839 --> 01:06:43,039
article and i think i'm pretty familiar with the modern uh discussion

454
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:50,000
about the dangers of deep inside meditation and and

455
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:56,960
so that's you know generally people who want to go into the deeper meditation experiences it's good to work with a

456
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:04,799
teacher be close connected so you can ask questions of how it's going some of the some that can be a little bit disorienting and

457
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:12,880
but some of the real dangers that happen has a lot to do with with

458
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:18,799
the attitude and way in which people practice and the people who really strive and

459
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:23,920
push and tend to can have

460
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:29,440
real psychological problems because they're overriding they're not integrated there's not a relaxation it's

461
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:36,880
not a a nice broad unification uh

462
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:42,799
composure or collectedness that leads to that supports and so this

463
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:49,440
anapanasati practice is really a fantastic practice because it creates a really good

464
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:56,240
foundation for these insights i think some of the people who have these that end up in a little bit of

465
01:07:56,240 --> 01:08:01,760
psychological trouble somehow leapfrog over creating the

466
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:09,520
foundation of practice they're in a hurry there's a gung ho and and so they experienced this

467
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:17,120
the deep experiences of inconstancy before they really have the psychological support and well-being and

468
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:23,920
stability to make good use of it and so if they already have a little bit of psychological instability can make it

469
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:31,359
more unstable so this is a known phenomenon that can happen and so one of the things that one of the

470
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:37,600
reasons why having some connection to a teacher and meditation retreats is where that can

471
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:43,278
happen we have that connection and support if something like that happens

472
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:50,480
