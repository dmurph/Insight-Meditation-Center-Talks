00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:08,000
hello and welcome to this week where

2
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:14,280
we're considering the what the Buddhist early Buddhist

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:21,119
tradition considers the primary hindrances obstacles to meditation

4
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:29,039
practice and these uh five are also U many of us can recognize them as

5
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,040
one of the primary may be obstacles challenges that we face in our daily

6
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:40,239
life as well so first ones are desires sensual

7
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,960
Desires in particular or a certain kind of greed avariciousness wanting

8
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,360
something so desperately and uh and the second is uh

9
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,039
ill will aversion wanting something to go away or

10
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:06,040
be destroyed or not exist and with a certain degree of everlight uh

11
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:14,799
animosity and uh both of these desire and aversion anger for example are

12
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:22,280
energizing and there can be even a sense of uh pleasure in the in the energy of

13
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:28,840
Life the energy of being Vigor vigorous and engaged and and

14
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:35,119
um and some people maybe even part of their addiction to anger and maybe

15
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,640
desire is uh how it helps them feel alive and therefore that they count that

16
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:49,200
they're valuable that there's purpose or something the next hindrance is um

17
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,280
usually translated as sloth and torper and I'll talk more about this later

18
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:00,479
and that these might not be the best translations or the there might be Alternatives that that are interesting

19
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,840
to look at but uh this is where uh the Life

20
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:13,080
Energy dissipates where the caffeine of the Soul desire and aversion is no longer

21
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:20,560
there and without that caffeine there can be withdrawal there can be dullness

22
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,319
toror sets in complacency a kind of giving up and that

23
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:33,920
can happen if things are comfortable in meditation the complacency of pleasure of bliss and

24
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:41,440
we stop engaging in the mindfulness because we're just enjoying it in the way that certain Vitality dissipates the

25
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,040
Vitality of the inspiration of I'm here fully

26
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,519
here and uh it can be complacency it can just be a shutting down it could be a uh

27
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,640
no longer kind of applying ourselves to what doing because we're enjoying it and

28
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,080
it could also be the shutting down from it's too difficult that um I'm

29
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,000
discouraged I'm bored and uh this is not really doing me much good and I'd rather

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,280
be doing something exciting follow the dictates of my desires and

31
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:23,319
aversions and um and so there's a shutting down so one of the things we want to do and as we meditate is to

32
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:31,120
notice the es and flows and I use that word carefully the es and Flow

33
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,560
of the Vitality or the energy that we are engag in as we meditate we don't

34
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:45,120
want have too much and we don't want to have too little just the middle just right um

35
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,760
just right means there's no striving there's desires haven't you know

36
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:58,360
clinging desires greed or pushings hasn't uh taken over at the same time

37
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:06,000
giving up hasn't taken over over shutting down or getting too calm and too complacent hasn't taken over just

38
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:14,079
the right amount and uh it doesn't have to be so dramatic how much that is but uh I don't

39
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:20,359
know what a good example for you is but in the best circumstances when you're not really

40
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:26,240
tired um uh the kind of alertness you need

41
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,759
to um drive a car on the freeway where it's not so much traffic but you have to

42
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:41,919
constantly stay present and you can't shut down you can't drift off or taking an

43
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:47,240
exam that you really know the subject well so it's not like a strain but you

44
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:53,240
have to stay present and alert so you can be you can be relaxed but also alert

45
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,560
and but it continuously it's just right so so what I'm suggesting for this

46
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:06,120
meditation is to watch watch the es and flows of the energy the level of Engagement you have with the practice

47
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,520
and see if uh just to see how it shifts and changes maybe not try too hard to

48
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:18,960
get it just right um be content that uh you're kind of gently swinging just past

49
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,400
the center and maybe occasionally you feel have it right but just

50
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:34,919
watch the ABS and flows of your engagement so to uh assume a meditation

51
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:43,360
posture and gently close your eyes and just straight

52
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,880
off feel the Vitality or the energy level in your body whatever it might be

53
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,039
low or high

54
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:06,160
medium and there might be in any single person's body different parts of the body with

55
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,599
different degrees of Vitality and we might over identify

56
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:17,680
where it's most energized active or

57
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:24,720
least see if you can find some place in your body where the sense

58
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:31,400
of Vitality engagement is medium middle

59
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:40,080
maybe it's the effort to keep the your lower back

60
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,520
upright or the sensations of your arms

61
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,000
positioned in your meditation

62
00:06:54,199 --> 00:07:00,000
posture or maybe there's something at the base of the stomach

63
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,919
that seems like it's alive and vital the Vitality there but it contains no

64
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:13,680
striving no no complacency just

65
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:27,240
there and in the same way there might be in your mind your

66
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:34,199
awareness different degrees of of energy or

67
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:43,080
engagement some things arise and your mind is straining and pushing or alarmed

68
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:49,479
energized excited other things happen and you're

69
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:55,240
discouraged deflated or

70
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,599
you just love just to settle back and float

71
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:08,560
and almost drift off can you find that place in the

72
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:16,080
mind find something you're aware of right now that's medium just

73
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,520
balanced no excitement but

74
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:28,240
no deflation easy to be

75
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,680
aware maybe the tingling in your

76
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:45,039
fingers the contact of your hands against some other part of your

77
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,640
body maybe the beginning of the

78
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,160
inhale the beginning of the

79
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:25,160
exhale so notice as we continue now in Silence the ABS and flows

80
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:31,120
of how energized you are

81
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:39,560
in practicing mindfulness without being concerned that

82
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,800
what you're doing is right or wrong just see

83
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:52,560
clearly how it is and if you find the

84
00:09:54,519 --> 00:10:01,839
medium trust that trust being with that for how as long as you

85
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
can

86
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040

00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,799
as you're practicing now is your mindfulness

102
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:57,320
compromised by desires by

103
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:04,080
aversions or with a shutting down giving

104
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:11,080
up letting go that

105
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,039
is letting go into

106
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,280
torper

107
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
complacency

108
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,360
where is The Middle

109
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:46,679
Way in engaging

110
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
mindfulness

111
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159

e

116
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
for

117
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
for

118
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
e

119
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
for

120
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679

e

122
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,600
for

123
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:49,240
and as we come to the end of this sitting

124
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:56,760
considering the end of the sitting and the next time you'll get up and go

125
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:02,919
out into the world world we being the presence of other

126
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:13,200
people what occurs to you does that activate

127
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,600
more the realm of desires wanting

128
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:24,919
something more the realm of aversion not wanting

129
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:32,559
something or is it a a way aaken the opposite of Awakening does it shut you

130
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:39,080
down does you free something of you

131
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:49,440
sinks something of you shuts

132
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:59,519
down maybe from overwhelm or maybe from boring

133
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:11,919
but if you're able to gaze upon the world the with the middle

134
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:19,840
way without the strain of any desire without the strain or tension of any

135
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:29,440
aversion just gaze upon the world kindly gaze upon the world

136
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:37,159
with a aliveness Vitality

137
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,720
Clarity either wanting or not wanting

138
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:53,559
except to see clearly G be

139
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:59,398
still and gaze upon the world kindly

140
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:09,039
let your awareness be calm and

141
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,200
settled so that your heart's

142
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:23,158
well-wishing your heart's ability for friendliness and

143
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:30,890
kindness can be expressed or come alive through these [Music]

peaceful may all beings be free

148
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:13,699
[Music]

149
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:29,240
thank you

150
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,240
e

151
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:23,799
so hello and welcome to this third talk on the the hindrances the five

152
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:30,360
hindrances today we do the third hindrance and the hindrances are that which

153
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:39,480
compromises our capacity for a useful engagement with our activities

154
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:46,960
whatever we do whether it's meditation or life itself and other ways and I use the word engagement

155
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:55,039
because uh being mindful is also an engagement that something is activated or comes alive when we're

156
00:31:55,039 --> 00:32:03,120
Mindful and um to only associate mindfulness with calm uh might actually encourage a kind

157
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,799
of dullness in the mindfulness it's possible to get

158
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:16,799
overcome and and uh but to associate mindfulness with uh uh making effort for

159
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:22,080
some people means that we're trying too much we're straining or uh we're

160
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:28,120
agitated in certain kind of way and so this a classic metor in Buddhism of the

161
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:34,960
middle way that where's that middle and um so in terms of the five

162
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:42,679
hindrances the first two um kind of a gr

163
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:53,320
desire uh compulsive desire clinging desire and then uh uh uh uh hostile

164
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:59,639
aversion uh that these kind of desire and verion are both

165
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:05,000
energizing and some people even if they're really hostile love to be

166
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,440
hostile and angry because now they feel truly alive and otherwise they don't

167
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:16,240
feel much maybe they feel maybe they feel unworthy or dull or bored or

168
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:22,880
something and being angry just makes them feel kind of like energized and they feel so you know that's what

169
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:31,039
they're attached to not necessarily the aversion but the the being energized they love it or same thing with desire

170
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:36,559
that the uh sometimes with fantasies of different types um it might be a

171
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:42,120
pleasant fantasy but of Desire but it's the sense of coming alive and what it

172
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:49,039
does in the body and the feelings and that we feel like there's purpose and meaning um and sometimes people spend a

173
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:54,320
lot of time in fantasy because it it's there's a pleasure of feeling

174
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:59,679
alive and some people uh it's kind of operates as kind of caffeine of the Soul

175
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:07,320
aversion and desire caffeine of you know it's kind of a caffeinated thing where we using something to keep us energized

176
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:13,000
that's not really natural in a certain kind of way and um

177
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,320
and so when we find ourselves no longer caught in desires and aversion some in

178
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:24,320
meditation some people don't know how to be alive energized engaged without

179
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:29,520
desire and aversion and so there can be dullness that sits in there can be a

180
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,720
kind of a withdrawal caffeine withdrawal and it can be awkward in time of boredom

181
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:41,878
and feeling dull and feeling maybe headachey or feeling kind of uncomfortable and we have very important

182
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:47,118
to realize that just like with um uh withdraw withdrawals from caffeine it

183
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:52,839
takes a while to kind of work it through the system that the withdrawal from

184
00:34:52,839 --> 00:34:58,000
desires a life of constant desires or constant diversions or both

185
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:04,000
um there's a period of withdrawal awkwardness for a little while and we don't know quite how what foot to stand

186
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,680
on or we don't we feel dull or bored or we feel uh shut down or

187
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:16,240
something discouraged even and um and so we have to kind of have the wisdom to

188
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,680
know how to go through that so the third hindrance is usually translated as sloth

189
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:27,480
and torper and uh these are English words that probably I never used until I

190
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:35,839
came to the Vasa tradition and teachers were using them for this third hindrance and um and it's not the same

191
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:42,760
thing as tiredness and uh you know physical and mental tiredness um can come from overe

192
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:50,480
exertions come from just not having slept enough and that can have a big effect on meditation as all as well and

193
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:57,760
there we have to be careful that maybe it's more important to take a nap than it is to meditate uh

194
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:05,880
if people are asleep derived you know it's probably better to sleep than to meditate ideally you get enough sleep

195
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:11,839
and um and then you can um Can meditate without that kind of dullness that's

196
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:16,920
there sleepiness some people however when they're sleepy but can't sleep find

197
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:24,960
that meditation helps that that set settles something so they can go to sleep but so sleepiness is not sloth and

198
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:30,960
torper sloth and torper is um is a psychological condition that compromises

199
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,040
our capacity to be mindful in in a balanced engaged

200
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:42,680
way and there's a variety of things that can do that uh one is uh as I said uh

201
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:47,880
the withdrawal symptoms of not no longer being caught up in desires and

202
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:53,440
aversions sometimes it's because the meditation is going well and uh we're

203
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,319
getting fairly concentrated and calm but we're getting too calm and so we're kind

204
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:06,599
of the mind is kind of going into a dreamlike state if there's a lot of uh dreamlike images and things feel

205
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:12,640
basically Pleasant in meditation then that's uh people get complacent they get

206
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:18,640
kind of lulled into kind of a kind of dreamlike state that's usually a sign

207
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:23,920
that there's not enough engagement not enough Vitality in the mindfulness and

208
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:30,160
then the art is to turn it the dial a little bit just enough to get that engagement you know bring in more

209
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:36,319
clarity more Act of recognition and and really seeing what's happening in a

210
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:42,319
little bit more kind of energized way sit up straighter sometimes it's enough

211
00:37:42,319 --> 00:37:50,079
for people uh maybe do walking meditation instead of sitting meditation and um so the imbalance of

212
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:57,960
energy and calm is uh you know sometimes it's called concentration and energy

213
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:06,839
another reason for uh this sloth and torper is U uh it's a kind of uh uh

214
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:13,640
variation of aversion we don't like what's happening and so we we want we want to kind of there's a version for

215
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:20,079
sure but it manifests as a shutting down uh really getting really tired and and

216
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:27,720
uh dragging our feet and you see see you can see this in Spades sometimes in young children where they'll and I

217
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:34,560
remember very well how I did that with my mother uh when she pulled me through department stores and uh when I was

218
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:42,680
young and and I just really disliked it and even the smell of them I you know which kind of set me off as that this is

219
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:48,440
associations I had and I would drag my feet and tell my mother how tired I was

220
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:54,400
and and um and uh and how hard it was and I must have been miserable for my

221
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:59,839
mother to be with me the way I was so tired um and then all she had to do was

222
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:06,440
say let's go get some ice cream and boy the tiredness just vanished and then like oh then it was worthwhile being

223
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:15,440
alive so it was a kind of resistance to tiredness and uh a strategy of um

224
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:23,680
aversion and uh so so sometimes uh but sometimes U the sloth and torper can be

225
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:29,440
uh what's called sloth and torper can be a shutting down down uh out of fear or

226
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,520
shock and it turns out that the first word that we translated as sloth if you

227
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:40,240
go and look in the poly English dictionaries uh one of the meanings that they give is

228
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:46,800
rigidity and uh and this uh uh I think works really well for some of the

229
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:54,040
compromising ways in which we trying to meditate we were compromised in meditation and that is um fear can

230
00:39:54,040 --> 00:40:00,079
operate in such a strong way that we shut down we we we

231
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:06,839
freeze we um don't know what to do we just kind of you know just kind of uh

232
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:12,680
maybe even give up or something and um and that's what compromising

233
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:20,119
awareness is a kind of rigidity or Freez uh freezing up or dullness and that is a

234
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:26,920
response to things being overwhelming and that can also happen meditation because sometimes meditation

235
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:33,560
is kind of like taking the lid off Pandora's box of our emotional life there's a lot of unresolved emotions

236
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:39,880
that exist within us and meditation as we quiet down um the active way in which

237
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:45,680
we keep them repressed or keep ourselves avoiding them can um can slow down can

238
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:52,280
quiet and then these deeper Wellsprings of the anger or the grief or the despair

239
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:57,440
that we might have shows itself and that can be overwhelming

240
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:04,240
and so then people will shut down and uh and some people will shut down so

241
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:11,319
thoroughly that they kind of just kind of not really even aware of what's going on and they might believe that they're

242
00:41:11,319 --> 00:41:16,680
meditating well because they you know nothing really happens you know until

243
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:23,079
the end of the sitting and they hardly knew where they were during the sitting and so they think oh well boy that was

244
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:28,520
fast or boy that was uh you know I must have been deep meditation or something

245
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:38,680
um but uh so a shutting down a freezing and so uh all these things that go on uh

246
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:46,920
and then you know then one more thing reason for sloth and torper is um actually Bliss some people get such joy

247
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:53,000
and well-being and happiness in meditation that they Bas in it they kind of give up their e energy they kind of

248
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:59,240
lean back and just kind of kind of indulge in it in such a way that the the

249
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:06,359
mindfulness goes out the window and uh and then there's even no desire to kind of be mindful anymore but

250
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:12,280
things are really dull just kind of um and a certain kind of dullness because

251
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:20,000
it were just kind of Basking in this in the sun of of the Bliss that might be there so all these things need respect

252
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,880
all these things need to be care and love anything that fits in the category of sloth and Tor torper uh rigidity

253
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:33,280
freezing up all these things are not enemies and and uh there's no need to be

254
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:40,480
afraid of them but we need to become wise about them and uh and to understand

255
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:47,119
exactly kind of a little bit understand why were sloth and toror has come up and

256
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:54,480
um because simply kind of increase the level of energy or engagement that we want to do might not be the appropriate

257
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:00,760
thing for some of the reasons for sloth and torper and so uh

258
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:07,800
it might be that we want to stop our meditation if we're really afraid and that's why we're freezing up and maybe

259
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:13,440
do walking meditation maybe just walk gently around the block uh so there's a

260
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:19,920
different context for feeling what's going on that we don't feel trapped by it meditations for some people people

261
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:25,640
feel trapped but if they're walking around they might be willing to kind of be present for what's happening in the

262
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:32,880
easier way way or maybe even meditations counterindicated um if we're up against

263
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:41,800
this the some really deep Challenge and we have to be really careful and considerate what's the best way to uh

264
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:46,839
appropriately address the reason for the freezing up that might be going

265
00:43:46,839 --> 00:43:52,160
on um and um but uh in the in in the

266
00:43:52,160 --> 00:44:01,160
bigger picture what we're aiming towards over time is to dial up the efforting the energy

267
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:09,640
the Vitality uh just enough so that we feel engaged in the mindfulness but not tired

268
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:16,160
engaged in the in the uh in the aware in Awareness so it's not we're not not

269
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:22,119
caught in desires not caught in aversions but uh just that middle way

270
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:30,520
that's sustainable and um and so it might be that um you know just you feel tired you

271
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:38,599
feel like you don't have much energy but you um you turn the corner and and there

272
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:43,640
lo and behold and in there some big parking lot nearby

273
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:49,160
there's never before event there's a circus has come to town and you've never

274
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:57,640
seen such a thing and now uh you know you're just kind of amazed and just kind of in a relaxed way you're not tired at

275
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:04,559
all anymore you're just kind of like wow you're present to study the colors of the tents and I don't know what I don't

276
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:10,240
know if my examples are the right ones for you for this middle way of dialing up the energy when there sloth and

277
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:15,280
torper but that's the that's the goal and sometimes we can do it directly and

278
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:20,319
sometimes we um you know take our time as we address what's going on and

279
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:25,680
appropriate way so for today uh what I'd recommend

280
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:32,640
is that this what what I did in meditate the guided meditation is that um the es

281
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:39,880
and flows of how engaged how present how clear our mindfulness is has a lot to do

282
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:45,599
with whether we're caught in desires or aversions or whether we're caught in

283
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:51,760
sloth and toror and to watch the ABS and flows and see what is compromising your

284
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:57,280
mindfulness and is it desire is it aversion or or is it a kind of shutting

285
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:02,480
down or a giving up or a complacency all of the above

286
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:07,520
um can operate but watch the the uh the es and

287
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:13,760
flows uh that's the assignment if you want to for the next 24

288
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:19,920
hours so um thank you and um we'll

289
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:27,800
continue with the hindrances tomorrow
