1
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:22,880
so hello and before we start i just saw my screen turn black

2
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:29,360
and and then i think twice i think did anyone else have still having problems with the image

3
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,640
transmission black for a moment this happened last night as well

4
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:41,200
i don't know what it is but i'm going to last night it happened and and it um

5
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,480
we kept the transmission going but uh there was a

6
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,920
strange things with uh um

7
00:10:53,279 --> 00:11:02,000
with the image it was a kind of uh stretched out like a like a amusement parks me uh kind of

8
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,519
mirror that you stand in front of so um

9
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,880
so we'll see if a couple of things might happen one is that i might it happens again

10
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:22,000
i'm going to switch the the screen is frozen

11
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:34,320
yes also saw that yesterday during the eee day long well the day long had nothing to do with um

12
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:40,839
well that then i think might be a internet service provider problem

13
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:46,640
um and it's uh supposed to student's image goes black and fourth for you it's

14
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,920
it's intermittent it seems to be i'm going to uh switch our uh

15
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,839
service provider we have two of them here and i'll be right back in a moment

16
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:30,240
yeah so some people are having this issue and we're having it here as well some people are not having the issue

17
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,079
of the screen going black and i made one change now and now so we'll

18
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:41,760
see if that makes a difference and if it doesn't then

19
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,880
i have one more change i can make if we lose the youtube connection

20
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,800
you might have to log on again

21
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,839
so we'll see so

22
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:08,240
in some ways having things not go

23
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:14,000
right is not wrong in for the purpose of dharma

24
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,399
practice it's just something else to fold into our practice and to be mindful of and

25
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:26,240
and be careful that we don't succumb to some kind of um

26
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,839
you know for the the topic for this week to succumb to the hindrances

27
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,199
so in terms of the hindrances today's topic

28
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:42,839
is aversion or ill will and

29
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:49,760
uh this is very uh closely connected to its positive

30
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,040
uh companion it can look like it sometimes

31
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:01,440
and um and there is a way of uh saying no to things

32
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,920
that does not have to involve aversion and so for this purposes of the meditation

33
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:13,120
there is say no thank you or i'm not going to follow that train of thought i'm not

34
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:19,600
going to pick up that kind of situation or i'm not going to

35
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,639
be aversive no thank you to aversion i'm not going to be swept up into the

36
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:30,480
desires and and

37
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,880
so rather than only kind of being mindful of what's happening there is an appropriate way of saying no

38
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:43,440
and it's not so much a no of pushing something away but it's a no of choosing not to be

39
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,560
involved in it not to pick it up not to get entangled in it

40
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:55,040
and this makes a lot of sense the more we have a have some feeling or experience

41
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,720
of peace or well-being and meditation

42
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,839
so that we can

43
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,680
feel there's a loss there's a we could diminish a little bit

44
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:17,720
as we get involved in certain things so in particular

45
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:30,800
in particular we could have um a healthy no

46
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:37,600
to the mind's movement of aversion of of the minds

47
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,800
contracting around it wanting something to go away so here it went away

48
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:51,199
so it happened again this blacking out it seems to be happening intermittently

49
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:57,199
so i see some people are reporting it when it hasn't happened here

50
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:04,279
and some of them and maybe it's happening here um

51
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:09,839
i wonder if it uh i read they're supposed to be solar flares today

52
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:15,520
and i wonder if there's something large like that but i'm going to make one more change

53
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,640
and see if that makes a difference and if it doesn't then and and it's possible

54
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,400
we'll lose the connection and i'll log back on again and then we'll sit in

55
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:35,240
in silence and meditate with maybe with a healthy no towards aversion so hang on for a moment

56
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,000
so let's meditate quietly for the next 20 minutes

57
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,440
and that way there might be all kinds of

58
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,440
blacking out blanking out that goes on and if it happens on the screen

59
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:14,559
we probably won't notice and if it happens in our minds may it teach you something about letting

60
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,880
go deeply

61
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:34,760
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

62
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:42,160
sometimes the opposite of ill will

63
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:48,079
is love and all the variations of love

64
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:53,119
good will compassion kindness

65
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:02,079
appreciative joy appreciation delight in other people

66
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:08,800
warm-heartedness we have this rich capacity

67
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:15,960
for love in many many flavors

68
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,960
to learn not to be caught up in ill will releases our capacity freeze our

69
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,838
capacity for love

70
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:40,560
it's one of the most significant and healing aspects of our personal and social life

71
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,320
so may it be that whatever we learn these days about

72
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:52,800
the hindrances and today about ill will may it be a support for going into the

73
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:59,280
world with at least a teeny bit more orientation

74
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:07,520
to love kindness benevolence good will

75
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:17,119
appreciating and respecting every person that we meet

76
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:24,000
may this practice that we do today be for the welfare and happiness

77
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,119
of all beings everywhere

78
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:35,760
may our respect for each person that we meet

79
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:42,320
be a medium for bringing well-being and peace into

80
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:47,440
this world may all beings

81
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,480
be happy may all beings

82
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:58,160
be safe may all beings

83
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:06,040
be peaceful and may all beings be free

84
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:21,560
[Music]

85
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:21,920
well if it blacked out again the last 20 minutes i wasn't watching the screen so i don't know

86
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,599
hopefully it's stable again and we can continue with the talk

87
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:39,280
so today's topic is ill will as a hindrance

88
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:47,440
and the opposite of ill will is love of all the different kinds

89
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,560
uh the closely related because it looks a

90
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:59,599
little bit like ill will is our healthy capacity to say no

91
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:05,440
to uh to avert ourselves from activities which are harm

92
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:11,280
producing or unhealthy for us and and so

93
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,880
whereas love and ill will can be seen as quite distinct

94
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,920
this healthy averting can be confused with the aversion that

95
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:27,280
comes with ill will and and so we have to be very careful here

96
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:33,040
and so it can be part of our strength our capacity to say no thank you to things

97
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:39,359
so mostly here in meditation we're talking about internal things so certain trains of thought arise and

98
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:45,200
we've been down those that been on those trains a lot we see that they usually end up in in train

99
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:51,520
crashes and so we say no thank you and now we say no where we we turn ourselves away

100
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:57,920
from the involvement with those it's not being aversive or ill will towards them but just knowing that this

101
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:03,680
is not a good place to go and

102
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:11,920
so we have to kind of it helps to see those two as distinct because in relationship to ill will

103
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:18,720
there's a healthy way of saying no to it we're not supposed to only accept it and hold it in awareness

104
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:25,440
we're also there's times when we say no thank you enough not this we let go

105
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,800
and so the hindrances uh are fascinating

106
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:37,040
they are one of the primary areas of study investigation for people

107
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:43,359
who do inside meditation there's um it's because these are the primary

108
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:49,920
forces that are said to interfere with insight into fear with concentration interfere with our ability to really

109
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:57,040
have clear attention to the moment and the way to

110
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:03,599
one of the healthy ways of working with hindrances they don't predominate is to understand them well

111
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:09,760
and so rather than being upset if one of the hindrances arises for you

112
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:16,480
take it as an opportunity to understand it more deeply and this is where turning around and looking at it

113
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:23,119
deeply is part of the what we learn and what we do and some of the things we

114
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:28,480
learned can learn for some of us is that sometimes the hindrances are strategies

115
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:36,400
for us to avoid things that uh aren't comfortable for us things that are painful difficult

116
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:41,520
and uh and some people run off to desire to food and

117
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:47,040
pleasures and things that could take them away some people get involved with aversion

118
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:52,319
anger and blame and that's how they kind of are not really stopping to really be with the

119
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:57,520
discomfort they're pushing it away or directing you know the attention outward

120
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:02,960
towards the object of ill will and so forth for the other hindrances

121
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:08,800
there can be ways in which the mind is trying to avoid stopping and really looking carefully

122
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:14,960
what's happening here really learning the skill of being present for what's uncomfortable rather than

123
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:20,560
reacting to it and um so in ordinary mindfulness everyday

124
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:27,040
mindfulness when the mind is not settled and concentrated um there's some wonderful ways of

125
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:33,599
practicing mindfulness with the hindrances one is to appreciate that often

126
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:39,839
they are they have an object or kind of an object some concern that we have

127
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:46,720
space especially true for desire and ill will and and when we caught and desire new will

128
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:53,280
we're often uh preoccupied with the object of the desire the object of the ill will

129
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:58,240
and so it's kind of like the attention is directed

130
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:04,400
it's a objectifying or objective attention and

131
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:10,400
and so what we try to do then is to turn our attention around 380 degrees

132
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,839
to feel what it's like to have desire what it's like to have ill will

133
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:21,760
we let go of our concern with the object the best we can to to really be present for the

134
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:28,000
experience of desire the experience of ill will and that's what we're trying to discover or investigate to understand

135
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,440
deeply and that begins to break the trance the allure

136
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:39,920
of desire and ill will when we're no longer committed to the object

137
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:46,319
but rather we're committed to our own well-being and then we start feeling that um

138
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:52,960
that this ill will the desire is a kind of alienation it's a way of being not connected to ourselves

139
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:58,880
because we're so involved in the object and even if the object inside of us

140
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:05,440
um if there's a narrowing in the alienating kind of way in which you're only present for us ourselves partially

141
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:12,079
and so this turning the tension around 180 degrees away from the object to what the experience like how it feels within

142
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:17,119
us is a effective way of working with the hindrances

143
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:23,440
as we do this then also you want to start feeling what are the different emotions that

144
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,838
come into play so with ill will

145
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:34,160
for sometimes anger or ill will hostility is people's people recoiling from their

146
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:40,240
own sadness underneath ill will there could be sadness sometimes sometimes there's hurt

147
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:47,040
sometimes there's a loneliness sometimes there's some kind of inner pain that's the kind of the catalyst for this

148
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:52,400
objectifying kind of ill will and hostility so as we turn the attention around

149
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:58,960
we can kind of see the underlying emotion that's might be the fuel for it and chances are that's what needs our

150
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:04,640
love that's what needs a caring careful attention more so than the than

151
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:10,800
the hindrance itself um sometimes in daily life what we can

152
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:16,640
learn to do with the hindrances is not maybe it's hard to kind of pay attention to it carefully and turn

153
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:22,559
around and look at it deeply it's it's so strong and life is so busy and we know we have a hindrance but we're kind

154
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:29,280
of in the midst of all the activities of life and it's difficult to stop and sometimes the

155
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:36,079
significant thing to do is uh is um uh restraint

156
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:42,880
radical restraint just no i'm not going to do this i'm not going along with this i'm not going to speak from my ill will

157
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:49,200
i'm not going to act on my ill will you know just just simply no it's not pretty it's not

158
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:55,520
deep and insightful but sometimes that's better than than the alternative when we give into it

159
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:03,280
and there's a kind of wonderful muscle that gets developed the muscle of restraint that will serve a meditator tremendously

160
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:10,160
through a you know a lifetime of meditation when meditation is deep

161
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:17,520
deeper clearer and this is the i think the premise for the fourth foundation of mindfulness

162
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:22,800
is that a person has kind of followed the journey of practice

163
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:29,520
and they've gotten quieter stiller more present then we have the opportunity to

164
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:37,280
see the hindrance in a new way and that is to see it as a inconstant experience

165
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:44,160
to see that it comes and it goes to feel what it's like when it's not there get to know it when it's not there

166
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:51,440
uh and the in meditation sometimes the the quality of the absence of desire or

167
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:56,880
aversion can be quite high there's a real sense of peace perhaps

168
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:03,440
or some something that feels really nice that's really finally we're free of these hindrances that maybe is part and parcel of our

169
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:10,240
ordinary life and so to take time to now feel that

170
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:16,559
turn around and really feel the well-being the peace the quiet the stillness that might be there

171
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:23,520
let it register deeply the registering it sometimes allows it to grow and become fuller

172
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:28,559
but also to see the unconstancy of it and and this is where the

173
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:34,720
insight meditation and the satipattana really comes to

174
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:43,200
its maturity is when we start seeing things arising and passing

175
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:50,079
and in terms of the hindrances um it's a little bit different because there this text seems to imply that we should

176
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:56,079
use our agency to let go of it so if we can be really present

177
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:02,160
to see it be a ill will or virgin hostility

178
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:07,680
arise and we're right there to see it come into being

179
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:14,160
this is a opportune time a a unparalleled time perhaps

180
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:20,720
to um let go say it's almost like the body and mind has almost a memory of what it was like

181
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:27,200
just before when it wasn't there and it's seen as a provisional state

182
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:34,000
seen as not having the absoluteness of really strong fiery anger or hostility it's just a

183
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,040
something that's appearing the buddha called it a visitor

184
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:45,520
visitors that cover over or hide the luminosity of the mind

185
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:50,800
and so and so be quiet enough and it's kind of a delightful even

186
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:58,240
amusing thing to be quiet and still enough and watch a movement towards ill will arise

187
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:04,640
and then say no let go like and not going there and sometimes

188
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:10,000
just letting go is just more like letting be because we're not we're not picking it

189
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:16,319
up we're just letting it be letting it go by and and this is one of the deeper ways of

190
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:22,800
practicing with the hindrances and the reason it's deeper is that it's it's now beginning to align

191
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:28,720
the practice with the emphasis in the refrain of the satipatthana sutra to see the arising

192
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:35,119
and passing of phenomena and to really be there for at the place where we can see how inconstant how

193
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:43,520
changeable our experiences our perceptions are or and um and this is where um

194
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:49,920
and so this clarity we're trying to develop by not having the hindrances obscure

195
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:55,119
the mind becomes this clarity of sitting quietly

196
00:52:55,119 --> 00:53:02,079
in the changing flow of experience in the present moment the inconstant arising of passing coming and

197
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:07,119
going appearing and disappearing the flow of change that is the present

198
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:12,160
moment if we're in the present moment things are always changing

199
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:18,240
and uh and that's a deep liberating place to sit and be

200
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:24,559
the entrances are not liberating but we're moving we're developing attention to the

201
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:29,760
hindrances so that that attention can become liberating for

202
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:35,359
us and the hindrances are just as good as object as almost anything else

203
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:42,319
so so see today if

204
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:48,480
you have ill will anger hostility aversion

205
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:55,839
that feels painful to have and stop and stop for it stop a lot really

206
00:53:55,839 --> 00:54:02,720
take your time with it do that the the the practice of turning attention 180 degrees around to really

207
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:08,319
feel it get to know it and and if you have it then when it's no

208
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:14,480
longer there feel what that absence like and if you are tracking this through the

209
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:19,760
day perhaps you'll catch and see the arising of ill will maybe it's

210
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:27,760
driving your car and someone cuts you off and you see it arise right there and um and what what what opportunity

211
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:33,119
what's how's that different to have ill will you see it arise

212
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:40,640
than it is already in place so i hope you can this way

213
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:46,079
maybe not enjoy your hindrances and enjoy ill will but maybe

214
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:53,520
enjoy and maybe even be amused in being mindful of it

215
00:54:53,520 --> 00:55:00,079
seeing it clearly for what it is and uh and find a very different relationship to ill will than many

216
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:05,839
people have when they um are pushed around by it

217
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:12,480
thank you and i appreciate our time together and

218
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:17,559
we'll continue with these hindrances tomorrow

219
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,839
you
