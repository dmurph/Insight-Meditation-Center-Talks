1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:09,359
hello everyone welcome

2
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:19,199
so entering into your body

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:27,279
with your awareness and assuming a meditation posture

4
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:34,559
a posture for being alert and present a posture that

5
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:41,239
affirms that you are here now

6
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:53,718
and to gently close closing your eyes

7
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,000
and again affirming that you're here present

8
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,320
taking a few long slow deep breaths

9
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,720
maybe on the long inhale the feeling of fullness that comes in

10
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,640
the torso as you breathe in take it as an affirmation that you are

11
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:39,240
here nowhere else and in the long exhale

12
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:47,159
releasing into here just here now

13
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,360
letting your breathing return to normal

14
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:15,280
and as you exhale relaxing your body

15
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,040
heats relaxation embodied

16
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,799
affirmation that you are here

17
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:40,480
here in this body at this time

18
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,319
on the exhale softening in the face

19
00:02:52,160 --> 00:03:00,000
relaxing any intenseness forward looking and

20
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:09,200
that's carried in the face the eyes settle back in their sockets

21
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,760
on the exhale softening in the shoulders

22
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,239
to the degree to which the shoulders can relax

23
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:39,680
it's an affirmation of their trusting relaxed ability

24
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:47,319
to trust the moment not tense against it

25
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:09,920
on the exhale softening in the heart relaxing and trusting

26
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,400
a subtleness

27
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,280
the relaxation in the heart

28
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,400
and softening in the belly

29
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:52,639
and relaxing anywhere else where you might be holding tight or stiff

30
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,919
the arms and the fingers

31
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:09,000
in your hip joint and down your legs

32
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,120
uh

33
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:31,240
perhaps relaxing softening in the spine

34
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,759
then settling into the body's experience of breathing

35
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:59,120
maybe letting the inhale be a kind of gentle

36
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:06,120
affirmation of being here

37
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,680
and the exhale to be relaxed letting go

38
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:25,440
into here just here

39
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:35,840
here is where awareness can be established

40
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,638
and can blossom

41
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,840
blossoming of open relaxed awareness

42
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,599
supported by breathing in and breathing out

43
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:56,560
with your whole body affirming that you are here

44
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:03,800
feeling the weight of your body maybe against your seat

45
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,079
the substantiality of your body

46
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:27,040
clearly recognize and affirming you are here nowhere else

47
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:34,399
and within this here this affirmed presence

48
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,880
breathing

49
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,680
as the primary physical activity

50
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,959
that's occurring as you sit quietly

51
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,759
so

52
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:22,320
whatever is happening for you that's present moment happening

53
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:29,919
is a thing to accept in direct experience

54
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:38,720
and in accepting it to affirm that you are simply here

55
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:44,440
here simply aware

56
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:52,400
but maybe not troubled just aware

57
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,760
breathing with what is

58
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:25,840
and as we come to the end of the sitting perhaps to recognize

59
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:32,240
that when we are at odds with what is in our direct experience

60
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:38,200
if we're tensing against it judging it

61
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:45,120
we have less affirmed presence

62
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:52,919
less fullness of being to offer the world

63
00:26:53,760 --> 00:27:00,799
to affirm oneself being here in the present moment

64
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:09,679
as if you have a right to be here means there's more of you here

65
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:17,520
to be friendly to have good will to be generous

66
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:26,960
or to simply listen better to others to offer your presence

67
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:33,760
may it be that as we practice

68
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,480
mindfulness

69
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
it gives us the ability to be more present for others

70
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,840
more caring for this world

71
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:58,480
may it be that this practice that we do this large community at the seven a.m

72
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,398
sitting that we collectively

73
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:12,640
aspire to contribute to the welfare and happiness of others

74
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:19,200
may all beings be happy may all beings

75
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:26,880
be safe may all beings be peaceful

76
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,840
and may all beings be free

77
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:48,449
[Music]

78
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,089
[Music]

79
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:04,159
often in the teachings of the buddha

80
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:12,080
he lists our experience in terms of body speech

81
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:19,200
and mind or our activities as being activities of body activities

82
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:25,520
of speech and activities of mind and it's usually [Music]

83
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:32,240
the body which is activities which are you mentioned first in this uh these kinds of lists

84
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:38,840
and part of the reason for that is the physical like physical activities we do walking talking

85
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:44,880
eating is not only the most obvious to notice there's can be seen by other people we

86
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:50,080
can they're you know they're much more obvious than uh sometimes then we are aware of our

87
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:55,279
speech and certainly uh can be more obvious than how we're aware of our mind and

88
00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:02,080
mental activities and in being more aware of them we also have more choice more ability to

89
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:08,399
do something about our activities than maybe our speech sometimes and also especially our minds

90
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:14,080
that seems sometimes to be an automatic pilot and so

91
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:20,000
uh the training in buddhism begins classically with

92
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,720
attending to our actions and because that's where it's easiest in a

93
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,159
sense to bring mindfulness to and to see clearly and it's the easiest to have some choice

94
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:39,279
about what we do within our actions so um here in this this discourse we're

95
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:45,360
going through the teachings of the buddha and the four foundations for awareness

96
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:51,039
the first foundation is the body and in the beginning of the body

97
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:57,840
exercises has to do with activities so the first one breathing

98
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:04,399
is um a physical activity when we sit still it's the you know the usually the largest

99
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:10,880
activity biggest activity of the body and then with experiencing this the

100
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,640
breathing uh experiencing the whole body just taking in the body in whatever way it comes

101
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:23,120
and then relaxing it calming this body and so this body we might not be able to

102
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:28,399
calm our mind but we might be able to calm relax this body to some degree it's

103
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:34,159
more accessible sometimes and then and then we're aware of our postures

104
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:39,840
that we're in and then this third exercise is aware of the activities that we're doing

105
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:47,760
and uh these are activities that are mostly most of most of them are you know

106
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:54,799
activities that involve the whole body and much of the body and we can observe we can watch we can train

107
00:31:54,799 --> 00:32:01,360
ourselves to be attentive to these activities we do setting the ground setting uh

108
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,960
warming up the mind strengthening the mind so at some point it can be aware of

109
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,480
something which is much more fickle much more slippery

110
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:18,240
and that is the mind itself and um

111
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:25,679
so in a sense mindfulness activity is preparing the ground for a fuller experience of mindfulness

112
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:32,720
but mindfulness of the activities physical activities that we do has another very important role

113
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:39,440
and that is that our activities are a mirror for what's happening for us

114
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,799
mere to see ourselves better and this idea of our activities being a mirror

115
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:50,399
that goes back to the buddha's teachings to his own son when the son was relatively young and

116
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:58,880
encouraged him to use his activities of body speech and mind as a mirror to understand himself

117
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,480
but he offered particular criteria of what to see in this mirror and

118
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:12,640
part of the what we want to see is whether what we're doing is causing harm to oneself or to others

119
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:19,279
to really see that this ethical component of mindfulness is really important and we want to see whether what we're

120
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:24,320
doing is wholesome or not wholesome whether it's nourishing whether it brings a

121
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:32,000
sense of goodness and warmth or nourishment to ourselves or it does the opposite

122
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:40,399
and then also we want to know if it also brings suffering or whether it brings happiness

123
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:46,320
and so these kind of reflections of what's the impact what's the result

124
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:52,960
of the activities we're doing is part of the the role of seeing activities as mirror

125
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,559
mirrors so it's not simply being aware of the activity in and of itself

126
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:03,679
which can be quite delicious just to be there fully for it but as

127
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:09,520
we kind of develop this capacity from mindfulness it's also taking in the impact the

128
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:16,398
influence the effect of these activities we have and so when the buddha talks about full

129
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:21,520
awareness of activities this kind of using activities as a

130
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:28,158
mirror is important and then as it's a mirror we see what we have choice about

131
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:35,040
so if we're hurrying to do something and we see is this nourishing us or not

132
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:41,200
then we see actually we're not being nourished we're not taking in the full experience and being present in a way that um

133
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:47,280
offers some deep support for our being

134
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:53,440
and but rather we're kind of draining ourselves or shortchanging ourselves

135
00:34:53,440 --> 00:35:01,440
and this can be for example with eating food to take your time to eat food to take in

136
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:07,119
not only the food the food properly but to enjoy it to take in the nourishment

137
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:12,960
of it to feel and sense the goodness of caring and maybe someone is cooked for you and

138
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,838
and what it's like for the body to process that food and to take it in

139
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,000
yesterday i had this delicious soup for lunch that i was hungry

140
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,280
and it just felt so wonderful to take it in just feel it feel it kind

141
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:36,240
of it felt like it was like almost like medicine for my myself and just felt good to be there present for it as

142
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:42,480
opposed to you know reading emails while i'm eating for and

143
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:48,800
and not really taking it in so this ability to then make a choice i'm not going to do emails i'm going to

144
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:54,880
be there with a soup and just be with that rushing

145
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:00,320
rushing anywhere you know if you're driving your car you're rushing

146
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:06,800
is that the way it be nourished is that the way to be benefited to feel somehow the growth of attention and kind

147
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,560
of a feeling good about being in your own skin probably not probably rushing takes you

148
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:19,040
out of your skin or disconnects you to some way so to use uh

149
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:24,800
the activities as a mirror of something deeper and important for us

150
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,920
as we go through life sometimes in the teachings of mindfulness

151
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:36,320
the emphasis seems to be so much on certain schools of mindfulness on just being present for things as they are to

152
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:42,560
just feel the immediacy of it and and then there's no emphasis on taking

153
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:48,960
in the bigger picture the impact the influence it has on us as we take in this bigger impact then we

154
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:56,400
can make choices about what to do and what not to do learning to do this with our physical

155
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:02,160
activities is also preparing the ground for later when we do it for speech

156
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:09,680
later we start doing it for more importantly for the mind the mind is really the origin the source

157
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:14,880
for our physical activities our speech activities

158
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:21,680
and so to get a sense and feeling for what it's like to shift gears to move into a wholesome

159
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:27,760
direction to move away from that which debilitates us or

160
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:33,359
drains us in the mental activities as well that's coming it's much more difficult

161
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:39,520
but to learn to do that in terms of physical activities prepares the ground gives us a sense of how to do

162
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:46,000
it and if we do it in a relaxed way and but it builds and becomes stronger over

163
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,200
time it's like we're developing a muscle and that muscle at the right time can be

164
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:56,640
applied to the mind but if we live a mindless

165
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,400
mindlessly in activities of our life then we're not developing that capacity

166
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:11,200
that's going to be eventually in buddhism directed to the mind itself and mental activities

167
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:17,200
and uh what we'll see as we get into this is the mental activities are quite um

168
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:23,839
um you know get more and more subtle what we see but the subtlety of it

169
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:30,400
is not inconsequential that's where there comes from the core operating principles are for our lives

170
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:36,320
and so to be able to touch into those and be able to use them as a mirror and have some

171
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:42,480
choice about them what to let go of and what to encourage is a very important part of this

172
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:48,000
practice so the message for today is that um in training

173
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,000
mindfulness developing awareness and physical activities it's phenomenally important for

174
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:01,119
uh what we're gonna do you know as this mindfulness practice develops and goes on and you can you can try this in your

175
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:08,720
daily life is be present for the activities you do but uh not just not just the activity in

176
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:14,160
and of itself but being present as a mirror so you can in the fuller picture you're

177
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:21,280
opening up more and fuller picture you see uh what impact does this activity have or what is impact does the

178
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:28,560
way you do the activity have on yourself is it uh healthy for you is it wholesome is it

179
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:34,320
beneficial the way you do it and if not can you find a way to do it

180
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:39,440
that feels good and kind of to repeat what i said a few

181
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:45,119
days ago one of the guidelines for what is

182
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:50,240
maybe wholesome and beneficial is that which is beautiful

183
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:58,640
to live in beauty to act in beauty to to uh see how to be in the world

184
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:05,440
with beautiful activities and um how would you walk down the sidewalk in a way that

185
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:12,319
not for other people but for yourself it was beautiful or how would you clean your dishes how would you clean your

186
