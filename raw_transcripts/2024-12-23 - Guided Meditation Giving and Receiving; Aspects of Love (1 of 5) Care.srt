1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,279
so hello everyone and Welcome to our meditation

2
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:11,280
session and for today I'm sitting

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:18,960
here a little bit um appreciating marveling all the causes and conditions

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,640
that bring me here and but one of them that stands out

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,720
as I begin this meditation is that it's some point

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,280
through this Buddhist practice and I trace it to doing meditation

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,840
practice um the practice started to change

8
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,879
me in a sense I was practiced I

9
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:55,680
was because there's two things happening there's what we offer the

10
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:01,920
meditation and there is what

11
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:09,960
um The Meditation does to us and both are important we we create

12
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:19,680
certain conditions by how we offer ourselves to the meditation and the meditation changes us

13
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:26,520
dependent on if we allow it to be if we make ourselves available to that

14
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,799
change if it's only about us doing something we're going to miss one of the most

15
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,200
important parts of meditation but if it's only about we're

16
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:45,560
passive and the meditation is going to we supposed to somehow magically do something for us then it

17
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:51,960
won't there has to be this reciprocal relationship between us and the

18
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,280
meditation and one of the things that we offer as we sit down to

19
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,640
meditate is we offer our attention we

20
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:10,479
offer not so much as something that we do but something we show up with we show

21
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:21,040
up to be present so in a sense we show up with presence with a clarity about inhabiting

22
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:30,440
here being here and now and this thing of being here and now

23
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,440
puts us in the field of awareness of

24
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:42,599
attention a prominent part about really here and now is

25
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:48,280
awareness if you spend a lot of time in your head thinking then you might think

26
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,680
that you have to think your way or work your way into the present

27
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,239
moment and it's work to be done to focus

28
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:09,239
but we have to offer ourselves to the present moment we have to offer ourselves here with our

29
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:16,680
presence with present moment present moment awareness and then the meditation has a

30
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,439
chance to unfold to do

31
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,159
something and both these what we offer and what we

32
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:34,640
receive can be infused with love love there's something about if you're

33
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,080
going to love someone that's a present moment phenomena that's a present moment thing

34
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:49,080
that we do the stronger the love the more it's really something

35
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,120
that's strong here and

36
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,159
now and if we're going to allow someone to love us in return there has to be an

37
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:07,319
allowing a receiving of that it's not just one

38
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:13,879
way so there's a love we offer as we

39
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:19,239
attend it's a kind of a could be seen as a love for ourselves a love for

40
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:24,479
awareness a love of meditation a love of the

41
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:31,720
Dharma a love of this world even that's not a

42
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,960
assertive and then in a certain way we'll be loved in

43
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:44,160
return in a certain way what's within us deep

44
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:52,400
inside our capacity for kindness and friendliness love care

45
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,960
compassion will appear if there is the need for it if

46
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:05,000
there's the conditions for it so as we sit today and

47
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:12,960
meditate certainly see if you can offer your presence offer

48
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:19,840
awareness but can you do that together with offering your love your care your

49
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:26,840
kindness your tenderness your gentleness and then see if you open

50
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:34,840
yourself up if you available to

51
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:42,479
receive without expectation slowly like walking in the

52
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:50,600
Mist will meditation reciprocate so that it offers you

53
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,919
presence it offers you something in the family of

54
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:03,960
love so to sit in a meditation a or assume a meditation posture that's right

55
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,240
for

56
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:24,160
you and in some very general way think of it as a posture of

57
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:31,120
care posture of Love even for yourself

58
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:41,400
posture which creates the conditions for attentiveness loving

59
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,560
attention to gently close your

60
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:56,000
eyes and if the beginning of meditation was to be

61
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:03,520
receptive like you would be receptive to the standing in the warm rays of the sun

62
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:11,680
on a cold day or

63
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,960
receptive to inspiring

64
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:28,039
music to let your whole body assume a receptive

65
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:35,479
mode as if your whole body is going to listen

66
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,840
deeply and then to receive the next

67
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:53,440
inhale to receive the movements of the body as you breathe

68
00:07:53,960 --> 00:08:01,440
in the expansion of the chest and the belly movement of the diaph

69
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:22,520
PR and then as you exhale offer your

70
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:29,560
attention to the release of the air the release of the muscles

71
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,680
the release of the diaphragm contraction falling back of

72
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,880
the chest

73
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,079
as you exhale offer your attention to the

74
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:20,040
places in your body that can relax

75
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:48,040
where relaxing your body is a form of

76
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:57,480
care maybe even a form of love

77
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:32,160
and we're breathing in is your body caring for

78
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:40,839
yourself perhaps we can even imagine or feel that the inhale is a form

79
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:51,120
of love we receive receiving the lifegiving air

80
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:02,680
oxygen receiving the body's working of caring for

81
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:31,959
us and the care the body [Music] gives is silent as no words to

82
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:39,440
it and so to receive that care with ATT tension that is without

83
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,440
thoughts

84
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,040
and as you exhale offer

85
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:24,120
attention to the whole length of the exhale

86
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:44,639
offer care and love the whole length of the

87
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:50,560
exhale a care that does not require words or

88
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:59,519
thoughts but is a tenderness a gentleness a warmth Within

89
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:16,680
and so the process of breathing in and out is a process of receiving and

90
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,519
giving receiving love giving

91
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
love

92
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

93
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
for

94
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
for

95
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
for

96
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
for

97
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
for

98
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,880
for for

99
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:48,679
and if breathing in love breathing is too

100
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:55,080
much let go of all things that get in the

101
00:17:55,799 --> 00:18:00,840
way of receiving love

102
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:09,158
if breathing out exhaling with

103
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,039
love is too

104
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:25,679
much let go of all things that are in the way

105
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:41,120
and when you have let go be receptive to what is as you

106
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,520
breathe

107
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:59,320
in offer your kind gentle presence attention

108
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,799
as you

109
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
exhale

110
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

111
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

112
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
for

113
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
for

114
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
for

115
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

116
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

117
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
for

118
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
for

119
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
for

120
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
for

121
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,320
for for

122
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,320
and then as we come to the end of this

123
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,520
sitting to

124
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:33,039
gently let there be a sense of

125
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:40,480
care compassion a sense

126
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:47,880
of wanting to tend to the suffering of the

127
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:56,600
world and part of care compassion

128
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:03,559
love is the way wish that is not necessarily a feeling

129
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:11,600
but it can be the wish for others not to

130
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:19,679
suffer the wish that oneself does not suffer that

131
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:25,480
wish is a form of care and love

132
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:36,440
and may we as we come out of meditation

133
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:42,620
consider that wish consider a

134
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:47,919
[Music] world that we could

135
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:52,639
touch with our kindness our

136
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:58,679
friendliness so that everything that our eyes land on

137
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:05,880
everything our hands touch everything our ears

138
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:17,320
hear is known with love with

139
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:23,399
care with kindness with

140
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:28,880
tenderness the tenderness

141
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:38,518
of wanting to be friends with everything that we

142
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,480
encounter may this

143
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:51,880
practice expand our range of friendship so we meet

144
00:28:51,880 --> 00:29:00,039
everything as a friend may all beings be happy

145
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:06,200
may all beings be

146
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:13,159
safe may all beings be

147
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:19,080
peaceful and may all beings be free

148
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:24,579
[Music]

149
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:36,320
thank you

150
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:36,720
so so hello and welcome to this Monday uh we begin a new

151
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:44,720
series and maybe a series that might be appropriate to for this first day of

152
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:52,480
turning towards the light the day after the solstice and

153
00:30:53,080 --> 00:31:00,279
um and may we light the world with our attention maybe light the

154
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:06,760
world with our care so what's on my mind my heart these

155
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:14,320
last days is love the the practice the expression

156
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:22,519
the idea of love and I'm very aware that the word word love in English is a very

157
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:28,679
vague word can be I mean it's it has such a wide range of meanings that when

158
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:34,480
someone uses it it's uh I imagine that anyone uses

159
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,880
it uh anybody who hears it being used might interpret it differently than

160
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:47,039
intended as far as I know there's no good word in poly in the Buddhist language that covers the range of

161
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:54,200
meanings that we have for this English word love but for uh there are five words

162
00:31:54,200 --> 00:32:01,919
that uh uh represent or can hold this broad English word love that maybe

163
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:07,120
give it some uh some clarity or some by

164
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:13,480
some specificity that's helpful to kind of understand or to understand some

165
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:20,480
potential we have uh of what can arise out of um Dharma

166
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:26,080
practice and these five are um in P

167
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:32,600
anuka meta karuna mudita

168
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:38,919
UPA and um the uh in English there would be

169
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:46,360
care kindness compassion appreciative joy

170
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:53,639
and uh equinity equanimous love and

171
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:59,080
um and uh care is the one that is the kind of found I see that is the

172
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:04,200
foundation for all the other five that the other other four the other four that

173
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:10,720
we'll talking over the next days um come arise out of a sense of

174
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:19,039
care uh and or expression different different flavors of care depending on the context in which care is

175
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:25,840
offered and that um and that the the bottom line is something very

176
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:31,440
simple uh and that is what whatever it is that motivates uh the basic simplest

177
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:37,039
forms of care that we would offer uh if a neighbor is injured and we

178
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:45,840
go do their shopping for them for food that there is care we might not love the neighbor but we have a kind of care and

179
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:51,360
maybe it maybe we call it compassion but it doesn't have to uh be compassion it

180
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:57,519
could be just a simple desire to be helpful and and um it doesn't have to

181
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:05,639
come with a lot of feeling it doesn't have to come with a lot of um you know uh it just a basic kind

182
00:34:05,639 --> 00:34:13,839
of instinct to care for someone who needs help needs support and um it could be that uh we

183
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:20,000
care for ourselves because maybe we've cut our finger and so uh we know that uh

184
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:27,440
if we don't clean it and put a bandage on it it might get worse and so we care for ourselves knowing that not doing it

185
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:34,398
might have bad consequences and again there might not be a strong feeling of Love of warmth of

186
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:41,398
tenderness but still it is offering care it is taking care of something and

187
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:47,398
um one of the big surprises for me uh in my life kind a turning point in a

188
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:53,800
certain kind of way was um I was going on a an organized hike in a kind of

189
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:59,720
desert-like area uh and there were people strangers on that door organized hike and there

190
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:06,760
was one uh woman who was not so U capable of hiking so well uh but it was

191
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:13,440
kind of Rocky and we had to sometimes climb over these rocks and these little short I don't know 5 foot Ledges and

192
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:20,200
stuff to make our way uh through this desert environment and so I saw that she was

193
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:25,880
this was all hard for her and so I hung back and stayed with

194
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:32,079
her and um and uh I didn't assert myself but I was just there ready to offer a

195
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:38,920
hand as she needed it and she uh gracefully graciously just received my

196
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:45,800
hand took the support I give I don't even remember if there we did any talking about it um I was just there to

197
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:53,640
offer what was needed and it was very matter of fact and she was very matter of fact of receiving it and but what

198
00:35:53,640 --> 00:36:00,920
what happened as I was walking I started having things there's a really nice feeling inside I started

199
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:06,599
to have something tender and warm started to occur or something gentle or

200
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:12,240
a kind of a joy a kind of a feeling of well-being or some kind of feeling of

201
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:19,319
being a little bit more open or a feeling of being kind of appreciative of just this attentiveness of being here

202
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:25,040
and present for this person there was like kind of this this uh a kind of a

203
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:32,560
attention kind of a Som of being uh my my awareness my attention was now

204
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:40,040
encompasses the uh the present moment in a clear way because I wanted to be ready for her so I wasn't distracted I was

205
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:46,000
just right there but I was also enjoying the scenery and just walking peacefully and not trying to assert myself for

206
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,240
being too writing her too closely uh just gently kind of being

207
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:59,319
available and uh and this great wonderful feeling this very felt very nice there was a kind of a peacefulness

208
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:05,560
to it and this goodness that uh that arose after a while I couldn't tell

209
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:13,359
whether I was hanging back walking with her in order to support her if I was walking in order to enjoy or appreciate

210
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:19,200
this wonderful feeling that was arising in me and uh and this taught me

211
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:25,040
something important it taught me that uh there's a way of caring for the world

212
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:30,640
that uh we're we're caring for our eles at the same time there's a way of being

213
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:37,760
open and receptive engaged in support in care that uh feels really good for

214
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:44,400
oneself and this was a surprise uh I think before that sometimes I would be lost in the

215
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:49,680
caregiving I thought I had was had a responsibility I better do it um I was

216
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:56,319
obligated to I had to kind of ride the person be responsible for the person and ride very closely to the person right be

217
00:37:56,319 --> 00:38:02,440
right there ready to take care of of things and it was a little bit fear driven it was a little bit Duty bound it

218
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:10,079
was a little bit um um a sense of uh I should I must and I must not fail in

219
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:15,880
doing this and this other way of doing it showed me a whole different way of

220
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:21,640
caring of uh that uh it was possible to care for

221
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:26,880
someone uh in a way that cared for myself at the same time that felt good

222
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,480
that was support for me and so began to kind of break the uh

223
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:39,920
Authority in me of uh shoulds and Duty and fear around this notion of being

224
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:47,720
support for the world and um and so uh and so that was a turning

225
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:53,160
point for me and very very valuable uh another Turning Point number

226
00:38:53,160 --> 00:39:01,800
I had a lot of turning points but uh around this generally what we might call love in English this very vague word uh

227
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:08,319
one of them was another one was the the growth of compassion I had a lot of suffering when I first started doing

228
00:39:08,319 --> 00:39:15,160
Buddhist practice and um and only thing I KN knew what to do was to be present

229
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:22,319
for it to be present for it in a non-reactive way to be present for it without trying to fix it or do anything

230
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:27,920
about it and um and somehow I had a lot of faith in Zen practice

231
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:34,200
and so I kept showing up for my own suffering but I didn't I was not given any tools for how to work with it or how

232
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:39,599
to fix it just to be present for it and there was something about that being

233
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:44,920
present for suffering that was tenderizing that softened again some

234
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:51,760
kind of reactivity some kind of defensiveness some kind of assertiveness some kind of anger some kind of fear

235
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:58,319
that I had that came along with my suffering and so I slow got

236
00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:03,760
tenderized and slowly like walking in the mist and getting slowly wet uh

237
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:10,440
unbeknown to me I was becoming compassion a similar thing happened to

238
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:17,160
me in doing Vasa practice that um I did not care or understand what the Vasa

239
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:24,520
teacher were were saying when they were teaching meta loving kindness and did guided loving kindness meditation and so

240
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:30,440
I tuned them out when they in meditation when they did that but to some point uh

241
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:38,640
as I kept doing this vasna practice the um uh the barriers the again things like

242
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:45,000
fear and assertiveness and conceit and and uh the shoulds and what I should do

243
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:51,040
and trying to make something happen all this quieted down for me and uh and

244
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:58,160
something began space inside for something different to arise and I started to feel a sense of of

245
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:03,280
well-being a sense of uh peace a sense of goodness

246
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:10,400
that uh was very was friendly had a very friendly feeling to it and uh and then

247
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:19,680
one day when the teachers were doing a guided loving kindness practice I had that feeling and I said um um and said

248
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:25,319
to and said oh that's what they're talking about and so both this

249
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:32,240
compassion and this love and this care that have become important parts of my life were not something that I searched

250
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:37,319
for or not something that I tried to make happen but they started to happen

251
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:45,720
to me and uh and so I learned how important it is to be available to allow these

252
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:52,760
things to happen towards me to allow myself to uh to be present for

253
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:59,480
experience and um and then in that allowing at different times when the

254
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:06,400
conditions are ripe then maybe you'll feel um

255
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:12,520
friendliness compassion appreciative joy and the joy of others and a certain kind

256
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:17,560
of equanimous love loving

257
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:23,880
equinity all of which are a manifestation that we care about

258
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:28,960
ourselves we care about others we care enough to try

259
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:36,040
to want to bring an end to suffering we care enough to want to care and the

260
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:41,599
desire to care the wish to be caring the wish to love the wish to be

261
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:48,040
compassionate is in fact the beginning of care love and

262
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:54,440
compassion that the the wish the hope the aspiration is one of the beautiful

263
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:59,800
qualities of human being qualities of human

264
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:07,480
nature and I think it's invaluable not to diminish its role in

265
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:14,240
our lives and make room for it and uh life

266
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:20,599
unfolds so much better for everyone for ourselves and others if we can

267
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:28,640
relax or accept and relax and make room for

268
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:33,680
the wish the aspiration to make a better world for

269
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:39,800
everyone for ourselves and everyone else that aspiration is an

270
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:45,400
expression ultimately of Awakening itself this was the Buddha's

271
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:53,040
wish that's what he lived for after his Awakening and whether and to whatever

272
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:58,839
degree we awaken to what is in our own heart Hearts we aaken to what's in our

273
00:43:58,839 --> 00:44:05,960
own minds awaken to the wish the

274
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:11,200
aspiration let's live with it let's care for it let's care for ourselves and

275
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:17,359
let's care for others so thank you very much and um I'm

276
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:24,319
looking forward to sharing this part of my life over these next days uh with you

277
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:27,520
