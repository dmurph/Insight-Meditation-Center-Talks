1
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:12,160
so hello everyone and welcome to our meditation

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,279
and um somewhat following the

3
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:24,000
demon last few days of mindfulness

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,199
of the for

5
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:38,960
properties elemental properties of earth water fire and air

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,280
i'd like to suggest some little variation of what we did yesterday

7
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,960
and today the instructions are to

8
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,600
follow the sensations in the body

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,920
follow the trail of sensations that their body

10
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,880
sends up and if you're with a relaxed mind

11
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,400
relax kind of not fixating or focusing on anything particular

12
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:23,119
let your body take the lead to so that and your awareness follows your

13
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,320
mindfulness follows so if

14
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,000
you're aware of a coolness in your fingers your mind would your awareness would go

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,520
to the fingers then aware of a teeny cough you'd be

16
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:46,240
aware of a little cough aware of warmth in the chest

17
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,680
you would go to the warmth whatever appears in the body

18
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,600
if you keep your attention open and relaxed to your body

19
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:04,399
what then sensations appear some may persist and last for a while

20
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,920
but if you stay relaxed around it and just kind of aware of it in a soft

21
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,840
kind of way kind of floating floating way

22
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,080
something else or some sooner or later will appear

23
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,040
and then you as it appears you follow that you continue on the trail

24
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,879
along that sensations so in other words you're not directing the attention

25
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:40,319
to something new or some idea you have what you should be paying attention to except for sensations of the body

26
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:46,640
but you're following the lead the body takes the lead and you follow maybe it's like a dance

27
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,760
where there's a lead and a follower so you just follow with awareness

28
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,680
and see what happens when you relax into

29
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:04,000
following along with no other responsibility but to follow along and to feel the

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,720
sensations that appear and then at some point

31
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:17,879
later in the meditation i'll offer some little additional instruction

32
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:26,159
so to about to begin to settle into your body to relax into

33
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:33,840
the present moment if it's nice for you you can take a few deeper breaths

34
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:44,400
a clear kind of ritual recognition of being here in your body

35
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,840
breathing in deeply

36
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,519
and extending the exhale longer than you

37
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:02,080
your exhale will do that on its own especially on the second half of the

38
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,959
extra exhale extended part of it is there more places in the body the

39
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:15,840
arms the shoulders that you can relax the belly

40
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,238
just

41
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,600
a ritual connection as you breathe in and the ritual of relaxation as you

42
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,840
exhale

43
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,960
then letting your breathing return to normal

44
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,639
and continue with a few more breaths just ordinary breaths

45
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,639
as you breathe in feel some place in your body where there's tension

46
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,039
and as you exhale relax and soften

47
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,320
breathing in breathing out relaxing into your body

48
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:35,440
and if you have any concerns thoughts pressure to think

49
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:44,639
feel that pressure as you breathe in and without expectation without

50
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:53,638
force as you exhale relax the thinking mind

51
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:13,199
and letting go of your thoughts and as you do letting go into your body

52
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:20,240
whenever you need to let go of your thinking let that be the same as letting go into

53
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,880
your body

54
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,560
and then for this meditation let your awareness your mindfulness

55
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:45,520
follow the trail of sensations that appear in the body

56
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,280
with your mind relaxed

57
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,360
be curious follow the what appears in your body

58
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,440
in whatever way the sensations your body appear disappear

59
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:12,880
appear persist for a while and then others appear follow the newly arising sensations in

60
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,080
your body letting your awareness follow them in a

61
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,199
relaxed slow way floating

62
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:31,080
to the next sensation that appears to the next one to the next one

63
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:39,599
where the trail the lead is set by the sensations

64
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,880
and awareness follows

65
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,839
whatever new sensations arise

66
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:16,399
let your awareness go there and then when the new another new one

67
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:23,120
arises let it go there be sensitive to

68
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,760
the new sensations of body that appear

69
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:37,800
sometimes it might include sounds appearing sensations of the years

70
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:08,880
if you think about what's happening you will miss the next arising of

71
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:16,960
sensation in your body see if you can quiet your mind enough

72
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:23,679
that you can float between the new sensations that arise in your body

73
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,840
in a light relaxed way

74
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:39,760
where no one sensation is given extra emphasis

75
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:46,200
or importance it's just a new arising

76
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,559
and now for the end of this sitting

77
00:22:52,400 --> 00:23:00,240
to have felt your body the sensations of your body come and appear and disappear

78
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,960
is evidence that you are alive

79
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,399
this is the animated body

80
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:21,200
one day this body will be not alive this body will be a corpse

81
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,640
and none of those sensations will be here

82
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,360
and there's nothing no sensations for the body to take in

83
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:38,480
be aware of no sensations to

84
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:45,440
react to or to cling to worry about

85
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,919
no sensations

86
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:59,039
and there's no awareness of sensations no mind

87
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:08,799
this wonderful powerful gift of nature

88
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:17,400
to be aware will not be here as well

89
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:28,240
what is it to sit in the middle of this living body animated with

90
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:36,158
sensations and awareness without clinging to any of it

91
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:49,360
feeling the uniqueness the timeliness of this in this time in

92
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:55,679
this moment now is the only time and place

93
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:01,039
where all the sensations the awareness exists

94
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:05,039
the lived moment of the present

95
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:20,440
aware but not attached just aware

96
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,640
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

97
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:56,720
to know yourself as an animate being alive with sensations alive with the

98
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,799
capacity to feel and sense

99
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:09,039
to be aware of the emotional life in your life of awareness and thoughts

100
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:17,360
and memories and futures with a heart that's sensitive to the

101
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:22,799
comings and goings of life the challenges and joys of life

102
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:31,440
and like you other people are the same way they too are

103
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:37,440
animated beings with sensitivities of body and heart and

104
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:45,200
mind with capacities for their inner life to be happy and free

105
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,840
or suffering and caught up

106
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:02,039
knowing that others are in some ways like yourself

107
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,840
in their capacity for happiness and suffering

108
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:16,919
open your heart of compassion and care the heart of love

109
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,480
to all beings

110
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:29,600
imagining how wonderful would be if they could be happy and free

111
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:38,399
just as it would be wonderful for you to be free in this precious living

112
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,120
life that we live

113
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,158
may all beings be happy

114
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:55,600
may all beings be safe

115
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:03,600
may all beings be peaceful

116
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:11,000
may all beings be free

117
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,759
thank you

118
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,398
so today we move into the last of the

119
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,399
mindfulness exercises for the body with the body

120
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:11,760
there are six of these exercises and

121
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:17,120
so it starts with breathing then with mindfulness of postures

122
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:23,600
mindfulness of activities mindfulness of the parts of the body

123
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,720
mindfulness of the elements properties of the body

124
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:34,640
and then there's now um the mindfulness of or maybe we call

125
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:42,080
it the corpse meditation reflection consideration of a corpse

126
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:48,320
and this one um begins with the words

127
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:56,240
as if as if we're viewing a corpse

128
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:03,440
and so here we're calling upon the imagination and now some buddhists will go and spend

129
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,759
time with corpses so they this

130
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:14,480
mindfulness of death is a time-honored practice in buddhism most years before

131
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:20,159
covet i take people to anatomy lab to spend time with

132
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:26,399
the corpse it's fascinating to see it be with the corpse but to be with it in like an anatomy lab where we're

133
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:33,519
seeing a whole different perspective on life and the body and people

134
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:40,880
when i was a freshman in college i took a drawing class

135
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:46,799
and um halfway through the class the teacher took us to the anatomy lab

136
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:52,159
of the university and um there was uh we would go into the lab

137
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:59,360
and there would be this there was this person laid out who had died a corpse and um

138
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:04,799
and it was you know it was the first time i've ever seen a corpse in that kind of detail and way in

139
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:10,799
and we were supposed to draw it and the first day we were there two days

140
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:17,039
the first day i went to i drew the person's foot because that to me was the furthest i

141
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:22,799
can get away from having to deal with this this death

142
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:27,840
when i went back to next time i realized what i'd done that i'd been avoiding

143
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:34,799
so i uh then decided to draw the face to really kind of be there with it

144
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:40,799
the teacher explained that the reason he took his drawing classes to the anatomy lab

145
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:46,720
is that after the visit everyone's drawings would be stronger i never

146
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:55,360
asked him what stronger meant but apparently he appreciated somehow the something shifted for people

147
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:02,880
and um so this time modern way of being reminded of our mortality

148
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,560
of being really kind of knowing that we're going to die

149
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:14,320
that you know it's easy when you're young to think well you know operate as if no

150
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:21,040
i'll never die or i know i die but it's irrelevant and but to some point to really kind of

151
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:26,720
consider and reflect and look death right in the eye and take it in and

152
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:32,158
consider it for the purposes

153
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:38,000
of becoming free in this life for the purposes of somehow

154
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,760
connecting to this lived experience of ours so that we can live in the midst of this

155
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:50,000
lived life freely the contemplation of death is not a glorification of death

156
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:58,079
but it's meant to be variety do a variety of things for different people there's different benefits from contemplating death

157
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:04,560
and for some people it really and i think this is it helps them to really

158
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:10,560
show up and be really present in a cute way for this life like now is the time we have to be aware

159
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:16,800
to practice let's not put it off in this

160
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:22,480
there is you know the direction the practice is

161
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:28,079
going each of these exercises is to be able to very deeply settled

162
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,200
peaceful undistracted to be able to settle back and just

163
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:39,760
observe things arise and pass away until observing arising and passing away

164
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:46,079
of phenomena the changing flow of experience something inside let's go the clinging

165
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:52,640
and the grasping so when the suta introduces this corpse contemplation

166
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,760
we have to understand i think it's good to understand that it's it's for the purposes of this

167
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:03,520
really getting concentrated and settled and and being able to observe

168
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:09,119
in a deep way so it's not meant to be disturbing though it might initially be disturbing

169
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:15,280
it's meant to develop concentration in a peacefulness

170
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:22,160
it doesn't work for everyone but knowing that that's the purpose then so we oriented ourselves around this

171
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:27,440
contemplation with that as kind of the north star

172
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,480
so how is it we contemplate the corpse that supports this

173
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,920
well one clue is that uh it is a little bit of a visualization imagination

174
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:44,079
and it's maybe kind of compelling one rather than going and finding a real corpse to look at

175
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:49,200
um it may be a little bit uh less disturbing less

176
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:55,760
you know challenging to imagine one if you could imagine it kind of lightly

177
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:01,200
or in a way that's not so disturbing just imagine there's a corpse

178
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:07,680
and and then um and so for beginners i think it's what's

179
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:14,320
nice is to uh there's nine of these contemplations but to start kind of in the middle

180
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:19,920
and to contemplate a skeleton so if you come across you know they're

181
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:25,040
in an anatomy lab or a museum or somewhere

182
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:30,400
a human skeleton to contemplate it

183
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:37,040
when i was practicing in thailand with a famous teacher named buddhadasa

184
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:43,599
he had mostly he was really into practicing outdoors and teaching outdoors and

185
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:48,640
but because it rains there he had a big yet big

186
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:55,599
meditation hall dharma hall that had open sides but had a roof to protect people from the rain

187
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:01,520
it was kind of a big big big building big roofed area

188
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:09,599
and in a respectful way hanging from the rafters were a couple of skeletons

189
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:14,640
and one of them was had a sign under it

190
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:21,320
and under the sign it said miss thailand 1936.

191
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:28,240
so i imagine that's been up there for all those years for a good reason

192
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:33,760
for me in the dharma hall and a place where teachings and meditation happens

193
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:41,839
and i suppose it's to remind people that any preoccupation with beauty

194
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:48,320
is you know attachment to beauty physical beauty and to identify with

195
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:56,480
that and hold on to that and be preoccupied with that you know it's only temporary

196
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:03,200
that underneath that and in the end of that there's the corpse there's a skeleton

197
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:10,880
in what way is that not gross in what way is it not disturbing in what way can we contemplate that that

198
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,880
skeleton in a way that's beneficial for us that supports us on this path of freedom and

199
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:23,359
liberation it's easy to be disturbed it's easy to protest

200
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:29,359
it can be much more difficult to put that aside gently

201
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:34,560
not rejecting it but just putting aside if we want to benefit from these

202
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:40,400
exercises we don't benefit if we protest we benefit if we do the inner work like how

203
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,240
is it that this can be helpful for me

204
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:52,160
so um the uh so these the text begins

205
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:58,480
as if one is viewing a corpse and then it ends

206
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:05,040
with um with uh each each of the nine contemplations

207
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:10,720
it ends with the reflecting

208
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:16,079
this body too has a nature like this will become like this

209
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:21,119
will not avoid this so in other words the contemplation of a

210
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:27,838
corpse is for the purpose to realize this will happen here to me

211
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:34,800
this too will happen and in what way does this realization this discovery

212
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,880
um or taking this in this you know true thing in what way do we benefit from that

213
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:48,400
where's the wisdom of that how does that guide us in a good direction how does it wake us up

214
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,760
how does it help us shed the distracted mind the preoccupied mind

215
00:40:53,760 --> 00:41:01,680
the mind that's involved in things that maybe are not really to our benefit how does it create a kind of seriousness

216
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:08,880
a kind of aliveness a kind of dedication and in the context of this

217
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:14,319
meditation how does it even create a kind of love

218
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:19,359
for being present now so that we can get

219
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:25,839
really settled here really clear that this is the place where the meditation is in here in the

220
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:33,040
present moment here and now so

221
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:38,880
i'll describe more this contemplation of the corpse later um

222
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:45,839
the um but for now i'd like to encourage you to contemplate a corpse i don't know

223
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:51,040
about where you live but around here this last halloween there were

224
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:56,800
the population of skeletons increased dramatically never seen so

225
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:02,880
many halloween skeletons and some are still hanging in different places and

226
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:09,599
the last one i saw a week or so ago was someone had outfitted the skeleton with um

227
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:16,880
climbing gear mountain climbing gear with shoes and belts and everything and had headed climbing um

228
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:23,599
uh underneath the eaves up onto the roof of their house so all these fun things people are doing

229
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:30,319
but uh maybe contemplate skeletons maybe consider your skeleton uh that now

230
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:35,839
right now is clothed with tendons and flesh and

231
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:42,800
but consider that someday your skeleton might be without flesh

232
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:48,160
or some someday maybe your your skeleton will be all that's left in

233
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:55,359
in terms of ashes if you get cremated and now and how it does you know you

234
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:02,880
might consider this and think about it in a way but the exercises to do this is to consider in what way can you do

235
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:10,560
this it's beneficial so you're not getting depressed or upset or horrified but rather in what way does

236
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:15,920
this light some kind of

237
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:23,040
greater present moment awareness some ability to really okay here i am no question about

238
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:30,480
it when there's a skeleton there's no animated life no awareness no sensations

239
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,880
no nothing we see nothing we hear

240
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:41,520
and how to rest in that be free in that

241
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:47,920
so that's the homework if you'd like to do it and then we'll continue this tomorrow

242
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:53,280
and um and i placed in the

243
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:59,200
in the underneath if you're on youtube i place underneath the um

244
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:06,079
the you know this you know the picture of the video in the

245
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:11,280
description section of youtube underneath it one of the

246
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:17,680
contemplations you can see the text of the skeleton one and then finally what i'd like to say is

247
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:23,440
that just give you a heads up since will maybe be here friday

251
