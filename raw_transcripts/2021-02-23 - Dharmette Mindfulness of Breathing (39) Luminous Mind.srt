1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,760
so i find that one of the inspiring

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,799
topics

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,240
in the teachings of the buddha

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,679
is the teachings around cheetah so

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,440
ci tta which

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,400
is often translated in english as mind

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,840
or sometimes it

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,160
may be in context is also translated as

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,080
state of mind

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,080
and maybe there's no difference between

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,279
mind and state of mind

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,320
um the mind here as i said yesterday is

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,320
not a thing

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,960
it's not like we can see the mind in

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,920
some clear

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,440
like take a microscope in the brain and

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,320
discover where the mind is the mind is

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,840
more of a gestalt it's more of a

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,120
the sum total of

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,239
our mentality of how the mind works

21
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,520
and so it's not a thing and so because

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,039
of that

23
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,640
maybe because of that the buddha never

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,440
talks about

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,400
letting go of the mind he talks about

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,200
letting go

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,400
of a form of

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,439
feelings of perceptions of

29
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,320
mental activities and he also talks

30
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,439
about letting go of

31
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,280
something that we've come to understand

32
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,759
in the west as consciousness

33
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,280
the pali word is vinyana and

34
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,680
it's possible that vinyana it should not

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,840
be translated as consciousness

36
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,040
there's a whole history of about maybe

37
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,600
three four hundred years or so three

38
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,280
hundred years maybe of

39
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,880
uh the western use of the word

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,720
consciousness

41
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,880
it's kind of a coined in just you know

42
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,159
in relatively

43
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,920
recent times and but it's uh

44
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,840
it's kind of entered into our languages

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,680
word consciousness and the idea of it

46
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,399
probably

47
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,159
in a deeper deeper way in the last

48
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,079
hundred years or so

49
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,560
and we take it now as many of us as kind

50
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,040
of second nature's obvious what it is

51
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,240
and and it's often held up in religious

52
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,000
circles spiritual circles meditation

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,479
circles as something really ultimate

54
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,080
and there's ideas of cosmic

55
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,480
consciousness ultimate consciousness

56
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,120
different states of consciousness

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,200
altered consciousness

58
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,319
and so it gets really there's a lot of

59
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,200
it gets that word consciousness gets a

60
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,120
lot of uh

61
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,640
association a lot of power a lot of

62
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,560
projection a lot of

63
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,280
a lot of expectations and hopes around

64
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,800
this word

65
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,440
and and a lot of people will feel that

66
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,319
somehow

67
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,800
a broad state of consciousness is

68
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,519
somehow

69
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,920
ultimate and really profound

70
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,640
and i certainly don't want to diminish

71
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,160
the ultimate feeling of it the

72
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,360
profundity of

73
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,040
of states of consciousness states of

74
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,360
awareness

75
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,280
but what's fascinating is that for the

76
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,959
buddha whatever

77
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,519
that is

78
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,080
if it's vinyana this word that he we

79
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,440
translate his consciousness

80
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,879
he says let go of that let go of that

81
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,040
and um and sometimes he even treats it

82
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,400
as a kind of a problem

83
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,720
clearly it's problematic this vinyana

84
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,760
what we translate as consciousness

85
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,800
and um and

86
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,360
but he never says that about cheetah

87
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:21,840
about

88
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,040
mind maybe mind should be translated as

89
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,840
consciousness

90
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,920
but consciousness also has a sense in

91
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,560
english of something that knows

92
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,720
and the state of mind i'm not sure

93
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,840
exactly if it's

94
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,519
something that knows but it's a

95
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,720
broad a tone or mood or

96
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,760
feeling or sense of the mind

97
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,599
and sometimes that state of mind can

98
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,239
feel fragile it can feel sluggish it can

99
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,440
feel

100
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,720
agitated contracted and

101
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,879
certainly sometimes the state of mind

102
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,319
doesn't feel good

103
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,720
and in fact some of the some of the

104
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,560
sufferings the dukkha

105
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,959
that this buddhist practice is meant to

106
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,720
alleviate

107
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,760
is experienced as kind of a vice-like

108
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,840
experience of the mind or the heart

109
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,080
where it's really tight irritated

110
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,000
mind is like rough sandpaper perhaps or

111
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,720
um you know the mind you know just feels

112
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,840
just so miserable in our minds

113
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,040
oppressed by it so sometimes the mind

114
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,880
can feel that way

115
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,040
but the mind can also feel the opposite

116
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,199
of that i'm experienced

117
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,479
and um the word cheetah is a very

118
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,280
fascinating word that this is what used

119
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,000
to

120
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,960
to translate his mind because the word

121
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,680
has many

122
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,280
other meanings or homonyms

123
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,560
same sounding words word we would spell

124
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,960
the same way

125
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,080
and but the dictionary for cheetah also

126
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,040
has the word for brightness as a

127
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,160
definition for

128
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,479
cheetah also wondrous or wonderful

129
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,080
and so there's maybe a little kind of

130
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,960
idea that the mind is something really

131
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,240
not exactly in itself

132
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,160
but has it's related to something

133
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,400
wondrous and bright

134
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,680
sometimes the mind is called a luminous

135
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,160
in buddhism teachings of the buddha or

136
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,720
clear

137
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,479
or clean the mind it becomes clean

138
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,600
and not that the mind is inherently any

139
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,440
of these things

140
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,520
because the mind is not a thing that can

141
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,680
be inherent to anything

142
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,960
maybe it's a little bit more like a

143
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,840
hologram or

144
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,080
you know or yeah something that

145
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,360
doesn't quite exist by itself and you

146
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,880
could put your hand right through the

147
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,479
mind if you ever see it

148
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,759
it's not quite not there but it's

149
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,280
it's still a mood feeling a

150
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,520
sense that is can be very powerful very

151
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,600
significant for us

152
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,639
and so significant that as i said

153
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,840
uh often when the mind is suffering it's

154
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,360
really oppressive

155
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,440
when the mind is happy or peaceful or

156
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,160
clear the mind feels quite wondrous

157
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,319
quite bright and open

158
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,440
so um so the uh

159
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,639
and much of the buddhist

160
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,520
path of practice is really is

161
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,039
is done in terms of the mind and that's

162
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,680
sometimes it's done so instead of

163
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,520
personal terms

164
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,600
instead of saying i'm training myself

165
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,639
it's we're training the mind

166
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,440
we're we're developing the mind and

167
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,440
we're liberating the mind and this is i

168
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,039
find fascinating that

169
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,960
plenty of times the buddha doesn't say

170
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,080
that a person gets liberated

171
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,759
rather the mind gets liberated

172
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,240
and some of you might find a little bit

173
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,080
disappointing that find out that you

174
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,919
will never get liberated

175
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,160
and that's not the name of the game

176
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,560
but your mind will get liberated and

177
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,759
your job whatever you

178
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,880
are whatever the you is a job is to help

179
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,599
the mind

180
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,160
experience liberation to be free to

181
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,680
bring it to some kind of

182
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,039
beauty and this this idea that the mind

183
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,960
has the potential for beauty for

184
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,000
luminosity

185
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,199
for brightness for cleanliness i find

186
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,639
phenomenally inspiring and

187
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,639
and but also that my other things even

188
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,000
more inspiring

189
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,960
is that the mind is not a thing because

190
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,240
it's not a thing

191
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,240
it's malleable it's shapeable it uh

192
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,720
it's uh we're never stuck with our mind

193
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,879
might be stuck with our brain

194
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,759
and um in whatever way the brain works

195
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,840
but to the mind we're not stuck with the

196
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,120
mind

197
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,720
it's uh it's the it's kind of the field

198
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,919
within which

199
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,520
our practice uh has its effect its

200
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,720
influence

201
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,039
that as we develop as we develop more

202
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,520
concentration more mindfulness

203
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,560
more letting go more equanimity more

204
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,319
wisdom more strength in the practice

205
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,800
in the mind that the mind begins to

206
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,520
to uh um whatever then we call the mind

207
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,039
to say the mind is

208
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,518
starts to have a wondrous feeling

209
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,399
wonderful

210
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,839
sense that we can experience

211
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,279
and um and one of the things i also find

212
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,120
wonderful about this word cheetah the

213
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,839
way it seems to be used in the suttas

214
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,519
is that it's very personal the

215
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,120
experience of it

216
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,200
so don't go looking at a buddhist text

217
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,800
or listening to a buddhist teacher like

218
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,080
myself

219
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,240
for a definitive definition or exp

220
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,959
or description of what how the mind is

221
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,320
experienced

222
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,000
and then try to make sure that you have

223
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
that experience too or feel bad because

224
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,800
you don't have it

225
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,080
the way it's described um

226
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,360
you're the your mind you are shaping

227
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,720
your mind you're

228
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,959
the this this thing that's being

229
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,640
constantly morphed and changed and

230
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,160
shifted

231
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,920
that's something that's arising within

232
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,560
you with all the cause and conditions of

233
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,279
how your

234
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,240
inner life works and how your attention

235
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,399
works and what you focus on

236
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,080
and what you're how you're thinking or

237
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,440
conceiving it's a dynamic thing

238
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,640
so um it's very personal so it's more

239
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,920
discovery of how you experience it

240
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,440
then you have you don't be concerned

241
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,160
about discovering what the right way to

242
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,399
experience the mind is

243
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,399
or what the right mind is or how the

244
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,519
mind is supposed to be

245
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,800
but you can as we feel the mind become

246
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,640
aware of a mind that

247
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,040
is has an ouch to it

248
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,399
and a mind that has an ah

249
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,200
and this very technical terms in gil

250
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,240
language

251
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,600
ouch and ah is meant to kind of give us

252
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,760
lots of room to not get caught up in the

253
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,880
details and

254
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,680
try to be right or wrong or it's a very

255
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,880
simple thing ah that

256
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,720
that's an ouch that the state of the

257
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,160
mind doesn't feel good that's not

258
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,959
doesn't that's

259
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,880
it's and now or this feels good

260
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,279
and the direction of buddhist practice

261
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,160
is in the direction of the ah

262
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,560
direction of the beautiful mind in

263
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,839
whatever way that you

264
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,360
define or experience or see beauty

265
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,320
luminous mind clear mind clean mind

266
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,200
spacious mind peaceful mind

267
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,800
so it takes a while

268
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,320
and i'm not still you don't have to kind

269
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,240
of be in a hurry to experience some of

270
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,040
the

271
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,800
wondrous ways the mind can be

272
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,079
experienced

273
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,720
but as the anapanasati develops and as

274
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,240
we become calmer and more settled

275
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,560
going through the steps especially after

276
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,200
step eight where we're pivoting

277
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,800
as mental activity relaxes it means

278
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,120
we're not so fixated on the what's what

279
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,279
we're thinking about and wanting and

280
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,360
but we're beginning to rest back into

281
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,320
the

282
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,760
into the easy chair of the mind resting

283
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,079
back

284
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,800
and just allowing and feeling and

285
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,720
sensing

286
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,360
the overall state of the mind and

287
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,959
breathing with that

288
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,680
breathing in experiencing the mind

289
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,839
breathing out experiencing the mind

290
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:53,440
so thank you and we'll continue tomorrow
