1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,639
so good morning good day

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:19,439
and here we are here you are in your place

3
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,840
and the idea is to kind of be definitively clearly

4
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:33,840
in the here that you are meditation is to rest here

5
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,960
established here now

6
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,520
and in that this week has been the week of touching into the role of imagination

7
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:53,760
and meditation one of the similes the buddha uses for

8
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,440
the state of clarity that

9
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:06,640
gives rise to awakening or that it kind of represents maybe

10
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:13,680
awakening is that of a clear

11
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,159
very clear lake here in the mountains in california there are some very clear alpine lakes

12
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,240
where you can look down into the water quite far and see clearly what's on the bottom

13
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,920
and uh so a very clear lake and a person who stands on the edge of

14
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,680
that lake the buddha says can look into that lake and see the fish swimming around can see

15
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,399
the pebbles the little shellfish that might be there and

16
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,600
each thing stands out distinctly but these things each thing is kind of swimming or

17
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,280
existing in this a context of domain

18
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,759
this space of clear water

19
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:09,840
and the water is often a symbol for awakening or the awakening but the mind for awareness

20
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,120
and and so the awareness that becomes clear

21
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,280
and so clear like this clear mountain lake in which all things can be seen but the

22
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,800
idea of standing on the the edge of the lake looking in the fish and the little rocks

23
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:33,599
the person who's looking is not interfering with anything it's not being foreign against anything

24
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:41,680
particularly just kind of just letting each thing be independent and free

25
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:50,080
and i love this idea because there's such a strong emphasis or strong tendency for people to look at

26
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,160
buddhist practice their own experience in meditation through the lens of me myself and mine

27
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:04,560
in my experience what i have to do and all this and and uh and so then you know the

28
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,840
ideas and the liberation means i will become liberated uh

29
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,080
look at me i'm liberated i'm free another way of understanding it which is just as valid

30
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,400
is that as we become free we are liberating everything else

31
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,000
from us and that way liberation awakening is a gift we give to

32
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,280
everything where everything has become free of our attachment our clinging our expectations our

33
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:42,000
judgments all the stuff that we put on top of it and uh and so they're standing on the

34
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,640
lake edge of the lake and looking in the clear water the fish the rocks the shell shellfish

35
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:57,120
whatever's there is allowed to be theirs free of our entanglement or trying to grab it or

36
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:04,239
do something with it so that kind of clarity of mind that allows

37
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:10,319
each thing gives each thing its freedom its independence every experience in meditation

38
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:18,560
has this permission to be there provided it's seen in clarity

39
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:25,600
and so that's the kind of the key thing

40
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,919
recognized clearly so it's possible to be very foggy in one's mind

41
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:39,440
confused but that can be known clearly i'm foggy this is fogginess fogginess is

42
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:46,879
known this is chaos confusion chaos is known

43
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:57,840
confusion is recognized oh so um

44
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,479
so the um and so that's kind of the vision the

45
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:12,560
imaginational vision that the buddha is giving of where we're going with mindfulness practice

46
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,400
and it's not so much an experience of bliss and joy and happiness which is the subject right now in the

47
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,800
series of anapanasati but rather it's clarity

48
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,479
so with that as a background image for this meditation

49
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:39,840
to assume a meditation posture and to

50
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:53,840
gently close your eyes

51
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:12,560
and taking a deep breath in in a long exhale

52
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,400
and exhale that you relax your body

53
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,240
as if relax as if

54
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:35,680
you're draining out all the mud in the lake

55
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:42,080
as if there's a little outlet to the edge of the lake where the

56
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,639
mud can just drain away so as you relax your shoulders

57
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,400
let the tension drain away

58
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:04,160
as you soften your belly on the exhale the tensions of your belly

59
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,960
drain away

60
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:22,160
whatever attention you can easily let go of or relax let it drain away so you have

61
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:29,520
room within for clarity for seeing

62
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:35,039
as if you're making your body a receptacle

63
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:42,720
for clear kind of an empty receptacle empty of tension

64
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,160
so it can be the

65
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:59,840
the abode of clarity

66
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,840
letting your breathing return to normal

67
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,639
and taking a few moments as you exhale

68
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:41,839
to drain away the tensions or pressures in your mind the area of your brain

69
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:55,839
any tension in the forehead or in the temples

70
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,640
even any any little bit of contraction

71
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,360
that has a location for awareness

72
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:19,680
it's okay to have a location but the contraction associated with is not necessary

73
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:37,839
as you exhale let it drain away

74
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,800
and then to settle in here more fully in the body

75
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,839
entering into your body

76
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,600
regardless of how much comfort or discomfort you have in

77
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:32,640
your body from the inside out

78
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,839
that you your body is the buddha's body

79
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,480
certainly you're having a lot of experiences that he had when he meditated

80
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,600
certainly not all of them but the basic physical experience of the body

81
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:57,279
from the inside out your buddha body

82
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,680
to settle in be present here

83
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:17,760
and within this body to become aware of your breathing

84
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:27,120
regardless how you're breathing the buddha certainly breathed like you

85
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,519
at some point or other some of the same sensations you're experiencing

86
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,040
the buddha felt from within

87
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:57,839
here you are your buddha body breathing in and breathing out

88
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:11,839
and then

89
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,880
searching around in your mind or in your awareness

90
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:28,079
to find where and how can your awareness your mindfulness of

91
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:35,040
breathing have some degree of clarity

92
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,760
the clarity of standing on the edge of a lake looking in

93
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,519
without interfering with anything allowing things to be as they are

94
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,680
each things in its simplicity

95
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,200
nothing to do nothing to change

96
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,360
except have clear seeing

97
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,839
of the body breathing

98
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,760
and whatever else arises that's compelling

99
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,560
clear seeing clear knowing this is happening

100
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:49,839
this is what is recognized

101
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,839
reach it with each in-breath and each out-breath

102
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:20,399
the mud and the lake settle and gradually

103
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:27,760
there's more clarity

104
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:41,839
about what's happening in the moment here and now breathing

105
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:55,839
breathing in a vast expanse of awareness

106
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,840
so

107
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:14,868
[Music]

108
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,840
so

109
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,159
when we can let go of our preoccupations

110
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:47,440
it's kind of like emptying the lake of

111
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,120
debris and bud

112
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:59,600
and it makes us a vesicle for clarity kind of like it helps us become

113
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:07,120
gloriously empty spacious open

114
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:21,760
and then where there's space and openness for there to be well-being

115
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:31,039
is in room for gladness joy delight happiness

116
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:40,400
when the mind is crowded and claustrophobic with anxiety and thoughts and concerns

117
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:46,720
there's no room for well-being and joy

118
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:56,480
letting your tensions and preoccupations drain away

119
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:03,919
and give room for whatever well-being is here for you now

120
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,880
and with whatever embodiment that's available for you

121
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:19,279
feel the embodiment of well-being in whatever way it is for you however

122
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:26,640
small the embodiment of contentment

123
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,840
stillness calm

124
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,840
and breathe with the well-being

125
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,480
as if the well-being

126
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:56,399
shows the mind that it's okay to relax and dwell in clarity

127
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:07,840
clearly recognizing here

128
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:49,840
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

129
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:59,840
to open and extend your well-being

130
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:06,159
in your consideration contemplation of the world around you

131
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:12,399
the people you know people you know about and the many

132
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,360
people you don't

133
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:26,159
and to sit here for a little few seconds as if you can share your well-being

134
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:34,799
with them whatever however small it might be

135
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:42,640
as if you're a little bit like a heater that's spreading its heat outwards to

136
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:49,760
the world around it so if you can sit content in your well-being

137
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:59,120
and open it to the world imagine that you're warming up the world

138
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,080
with well-being

139
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:13,520
and consider how wonderful it would be if in fact your well-being one way or

140
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:20,320
other known or unknown could reach and touch all the beings of

141
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,840
this world

142
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:37,840
may it be that the practice of meditation this this day

143
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:46,480
is a condition for bringing welfare and happiness

144
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:53,520
to beings everywhere may the goodness and merit of this

145
00:30:53,520 --> 00:31:00,559
practice be dedicated to the happiness well-being

146
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:11,360
joy peace and freedom of all beings may all beings be happy

147
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:18,559
may all beings be safe

148
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:22,240
may all beings

149
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,480
be peaceful

150
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,840
may all beings be free

151
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:06,080
so this has been a week of emphasizing the role of imagination

152
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:13,039
in buddhist practice and it's not something that i'm making up by my own

153
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:18,240
that the buddha himself in one way or the other in a variety of ways

154
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:24,880
used imagination and evoked the imaginary powers of people

155
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:32,000
when they engaged in this practice and as the practice deepens there

156
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,559
is born a capacity for a particular capacity for

157
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:43,679
imagination which in english we could call maybe vision

158
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,720
and and to have a vision of a possibility

159
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:56,000
and it's a vision that can seem very clear and tangible and immediate and maybe it even is

160
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,799
in a certain kind of way it's not something which is it physically tangible or physically

161
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:09,200
seen but with the mind's eye and buddhism awakening is opening the

162
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,960
eye of the dharma the eye that can see and have a vision

163
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:21,279
of the potential for freedom or can see freedom

164
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:28,880
can see if the peace and the freedom of the mind that's there to some degree and then has

165
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,399
a vision for it becoming complete a vision of it expanding

166
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:41,200
a vision of it touching the places where we're not yet free and this idea of becoming a visionary

167
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:47,679
using the imagination to to know a possibility that um

168
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:52,960
it's nothing it's not a fantasy it's based on something real

169
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:59,200
but it's imagining the fulfillment of that so for example if i hold my hand in a

170
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:06,080
tight fist i could release one finger and hold down the other fingers tight

171
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:13,919
and then but then oh i think you know it's possible now i have a vision i see the potential

172
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:20,320
of opening the whole hand up and relaxing it and so it's a kind of a kind of an

173
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,679
imagination a vision of a potential and it's said sometimes in

174
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:31,118
buddhism that with the that uh awakening is an act of vision a seeing

175
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:38,000
or it awakens vision it awakens the imagination of something that's possible that then

176
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,679
becomes um uh the direction we go or the or what we kind of wholeheartedly

177
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:52,480
put our life energy into like this is important this is valuable to live this way

178
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,680
and it doesn't mean we have to leave the our world behind the regular world behind

179
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:05,359
but rather when the clear enough vision of the potential or what awakening is as freedom of clinging is

180
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:10,720
we realize that it can be the foundation for how we live our life

181
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:17,359
or the all incumbent all-encompassing container or or approach

182
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:26,000
for everything we do so it isn't so much that we have to leave our life and it's

183
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:33,599
but it's rather it's to vision that it's possible to live our life freely and to wholeheartedly

184
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:40,640
enter our life with that as a guiding principle and this is a radical thing

185
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,920
and so so it's not a compromising our life necessarily but it's

186
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:52,880
bringing what's best in life freedom and peace and compassion uh as the container as the context as a

187
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:58,160
foundation so a vision that's possible and then a decision

188
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:04,559
even a commitment a vow this is how i want to live my life

189
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:10,960
so uh so all these things i've been talking about this week have to do with imagination and

190
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:20,079
imagination can be both harmful can be debilitating and it could be

191
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:26,800
forward leading opening it can help us grow and develop and to be able to see those two apart is

192
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:32,160
very important a few things about the word that the buddha used words he used that i'm

193
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:39,040
translating his imagination one of them is manyati and

194
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:45,359
the uh and that uh is usually uh used

195
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:52,400
for acts of imagination which are not helpful in fact b coboti the great

196
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,760
translator sometimes translates this word as misconceived there's no

197
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:04,400
negative prefix in the word but it's used in such a kind of negative way in the suttas that it's

198
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,680
often you know can be to misimagine or badam poor imagination

199
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:16,079
and so at jackal the buddha used the word for a jackal that imagines

200
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:23,599
itself to be a lion and uh and so you know

201
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:31,040
it's a misconceived oneself as a lion the um um

202
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,720
so one of the very interesting places where this word um one imagines where it has negative

203
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:45,760
connotations as manyati it has to do with identification and

204
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:51,680
there's a plenty of places in the sutras where buddha emphatically talks about um

205
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:58,480
the pro the problems people have when they imagine and they imagine an identity for

206
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:06,400
themselves that they are something in relationship to other things so imagining

207
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:13,119
that they are the same as the universe so the same as the world imagining that they are in the world

208
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:19,040
imagine the world is in them imagining that they are distinct from the world

209
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:25,280
and he uses this word manyati imagine and if you really understand that and it

210
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:32,800
is often translated as conceive which has some idea doesn't quite capture the idea of imagination

211
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:40,720
and so rather than talking about the self and identity that who i am i'm this i'm that as a belief

212
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:46,480
which gets into philosophy and all that the buddha is using the word imagine

213
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:52,720
and so it's not a philosophical issue but it's an issue of what we're doing with our imagination

214
00:38:52,720 --> 00:39:00,079
what are we constructing what are we fantasizing about and many of the problems around self are

215
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:06,160
not about truly exactly what we are as a self whatever that is

216
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:12,560
but rather how we imagine ourselves to be and and then we have a whole different

217
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:19,680
understanding of this kind of not self teaching there's a deci for example there's a very common

218
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:25,040
phrase important to me myself and mine that's

219
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:32,400
used in the sutures it's a little bit of mistranslation the order of it but but basically the same

220
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,599
and and uh imagining that um

221
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:43,200
something is mine imagining that i i have an identity imagining there is a

222
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:49,680
essential self the buddha uses the word imagine it doesn't say one believes in me myself

223
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:55,280
and mine but one is something that we're construing we're constructing we're

224
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:02,560
imagining happening and so a part of meditation practice then is to

225
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:10,480
quiet and calm this excessive over-imagination false imagination misconstruing we do

226
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:16,000
and it's not questioning or or or challenging any kind of philosophical

227
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,839
view of self me myself and mine in these particular teachings

228
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:27,760
and so we don't have to get involved philosophically is there is there not a self where we get involved in meditation

229
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:33,119
practice is to clarify um

230
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:39,760
let go of quiet the imaginings that are occurring

231
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:46,800
and and so so that's kind of manyati this imagining

232
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:55,520
is usually negative the word that's more positive for imagination is has the word anupasati in it

233
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,800
and that's one of the central words for mindfulness practice it means in mindfulness practice to

234
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:08,800
observe to see but it has the the prefix sum in front of it so some anupasati um

235
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:15,760
and the context in which it's used in the buddhas is to we can understand it to be

236
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:21,838
imagination of maybe of the form of visualization

237
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,280
so uh so the the similes of the hindrances i talk free of the hindrances

238
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:33,520
i talked about a few days ago to the buddha says visualizing oneself

239
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:39,920
as no longer sick visualizing oneself is no longer in debt

240
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:45,839
visualizing himself were no longer enslaved and so that visualizing has a

241
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:52,720
kind of richer feeling sometimes in imagination and and it touches into something deeper it

242
00:41:52,720 --> 00:42:00,560
touches into something more emotional more embodied more tangible maybe in the mind's eye

243
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:06,480
it kind of helps us to fill out something and and that is i think one of the

244
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,319
functions of two functions of this imagination or visualization that buddha talks about

245
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:18,640
uses in practice uh one is to give us a visceral

246
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:25,040
kind of embodied maybe uh feeling or sense sense of what he's talking about that's

247
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:30,160
not just uh explanations it's you know more like poetry or

248
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:35,520
something that's evocative and something that opens up and it touches into

249
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:40,960
more dimensions of our life than just words it touches touches into our emotional

250
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:50,079
being our kinesthetic being some of the imagery imagery are in action and movement flowing water

251
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:55,760
and the the person working the lathe or kneading the the water into the into the

252
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:00,960
powder and also it's touches into memory

253
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:09,520
and associations we have with these things and um and our capacity for imagination our

254
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:15,920
capacity for thought and thinking and so we have here this movement support

255
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:22,480
in imagination this movement of becoming unified which means gathering together all our

256
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:28,400
different functions as human being so that we're focused and present here

257
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:34,160
for the practice of meditation we're not fragmented we're not divided and we're not leaving any part of

258
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:41,520
ourselves out rather gathering together all of ourselves to center and be here

259
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:48,160
and that we'll see we'll continue now with the steps of anapanasati on monday going on with um

260
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:53,359
steps seven and eight and this continues this process of gathering

261
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:58,480
together and settling and unifying and with supporting also the process of

262
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:05,280
also once the imagination has functioned in useful way to help that to settle as well not to

263
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:13,280
hold on to that but to go to deeper states of unification and calm that at some point imagination uh

264
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:18,319
you know is no longer supportive for so we'll start going into more deeply

265
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:23,760
into the mind next week and and then we will um

266
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:32,000
go on from there and um so thank you very very much and um

267
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:41,119
someone asked yesterday i saw on the chat at the end that they wanted to see the the you know the

268
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:49,040
written form of the similes for the for jhanas and um and i said i would do

269
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:56,160
it and i i still will do at some point and also i can also maybe uh post

270
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:02,480
my translation of this 16 steps that we're going through and once i posted it i'll let you know

271
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:09,440
where it is and hopefully i'll have time to do it over the weekend so thank you all very much and look

272
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:16,000
