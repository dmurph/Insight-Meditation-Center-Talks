1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,320
good evening welcome

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,719
welcome so maybe I'll start by um just sharing a

3
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:19,840
little bit that uh sometimes at the end of Retreats we have a closing Circle and

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,920
people talk about how their experience was and you not all closing circles are

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:31,400
exactly the same but sometimes you know it's not uncommon for people to share something that happened that was

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,480
meaningful for them that was noteworthy that uh something they want to take away

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,280
perhaps with them and sometimes not every closing

8
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,320
Circle sometimes I say something like whatever you found here that was

9
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,800
meaningful some new understanding a feeling of peace and

10
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,079
ease or some settledness in the mind and the

11
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:05,119
body or maybe a connection with uh somebody else you know that might happen if you did a job together or something

12
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,280
like this I often say give it away just

13
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,759
give it away so this idea of maybe as you get in

14
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:23,520
your car to leave the retreat and there's other people in the lane next to you here have some peace here have some

15
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:31,720
Stillness here have some sense of well-being just give it away give it away like actively we do doing this

16
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:38,360
there's something about sometimes when we find things that are meaningful or helpful we want to hold on to them of

17
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:44,880
course we do of course we want to hold on to them but right those of us who have been

18
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:52,479
practicing for a while and certainly the Buddhist teachings are pointing to this this idea of clinging right is leads to

19
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,600
dooka leads to suffering and so there can be a way in

20
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,799
which you're like oh this is uh so meaningful that I have to hold on to

21
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:11,760
it but the act of holding on sometimes um transforms it from an experience to

22
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:20,920
just an object to just another concept or memory and it's no longer a lived

23
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:27,840
experience for me this was a very powerful I think I've told this story maybe more than once that uh I was

24
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:36,280
sitting in a long retreat and after quite some time on Retreat I uh I ended up I I needed to go

25
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:42,599
to the doctor's it wasn't it turned out not to be serious and turned out to be fine but when the you know when your

26
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:48,640
mind is really settled and you've been practicing I think at that time maybe it' been a few months that uh you know

27
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,680
any small little thing turns into something giant so anyway so I was off

28
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,760
to the doctors and um you know I'd only been doing like walking meditation

29
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,959
slowly for a long time so it was so exciting to be in a car we were going so

30
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,400
fast you know like 35 mes an hour you know like wow but I

31
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:17,879
remember having this idea of like okay I'm coming from this place of you know incredible Stillness and peace and I was

32
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:24,519
having a lot of ease and just giving it away to people in the car in the other lanes you know going the opposite

33
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:30,239
direction or something and just my heart just starting to overflow

34
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:37,319
and then showing up the the I don't remember now if it was an urgent care or just a doctor's office but you know

35
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:44,480
there's a lot of suffering in the waiting rooms of you know medical centers and just like giving it away

36
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:52,319
like okay here's here's whatever sense of peace I have here have it here's here's a any sense of well-being or

37
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,760
stability and there was something magical about this and one thing of

38
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,799
course is we discover that it's these aren't Commodities there isn't a

39
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:10,360
limited quantity of course not they're unlimited and giving them

40
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,680
away helps them grow helps them

41
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:23,840
expand and so there's this movement this openness this willingness to open up and maybe like

42
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,600
share as opposed to kind of like hold on that is a really a big support for

43
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:37,280
practice and this shows up in so many ways but this what I want to highlight

44
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,639
is this practicing generosity that leads to this I'm using this word generosity

45
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,520
this uh this willingness to give away here it was some

46
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,960
experience and maybe I'll back up of course when we come off Retreat for me

47
00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:00,080
I'm often writing down some notes that was like what was really meaningful and helpful for me and sometimes look back

48
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,720
at those notes maybe I don't always so I'm not saying that we shouldn't ever like remember things that happen that

49
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,440
are really meaningful and supportive for us it's the clinging and like oh this is

50
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:18,639
I have to hold on to this this is where we're going to get into trouble and the opposite of this

51
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:24,560
clinging is this movement of maybe we would say sharing or generosity or letting

52
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,960
go and it it supports this openness

53
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:37,080
this spaciousness this sense of uh having

54
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:43,199
enough like undermines a sense of uh inadequacy or insufficiency or this uh

55
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:49,880
sense of lack this like freely giving away turns out to be a tremendous

56
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:58,160
support and the bruda pointed to this and some of his uh teachings paraphrasing uh maybe some of

57
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,400
you have heard this but the Buddha is one of his teaching is if you knew what

58
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:09,280
I know about the power of generosity you wouldn't let a single

59
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:17,360
meal go by without sharing it so he's just pointing to this openness and we

60
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:24,120
might also say this recognition of connection to others how we impact others and of course we're impacted by

61
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:33,960
others too so this we might say is a little bit of a paradox this idea of giving away

62
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:41,280
makes us feel like we have more CU it to undes this feeling of I

63
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:49,919
have to have more have to hold on to this in some kind of way but I think all of us uh have this

64
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:55,879
recognition that when we have this feeling of I don't have

65
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:01,240
enough then all were there it's really um and it's true right I want to say

66
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:08,919
sometimes we don't have enough sometimes we don't have enough money that we find ourselves in a lot of debt or we find

67
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:14,160
ourselves uh not being able to take care of some additional responsibilities we

68
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,720
find ourselves having or whatever it might be so I mean it's perfectly legitimate that sometimes there simply

69
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:25,319
isn't enough I'm pointing to money right

70
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:31,400
now but if there's a way in which uh we're primarily concerned with okay I

71
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:37,400
got to get more I got to get more then it kind of it leads to a sense

72
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:48,000
that really supports this sense of insufficiency and there's this maybe this gwing anxiety that goes with

73
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:56,039
that there's this you know that kind of supports the sense of there's not enough so this can be kind of a tricky

74
00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:03,840
territory like okay I need to get out of debt and yet I don't want to feel like

75
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,440
everything isn't enough one way we can look at that and I'll talk about this in a moment a

76
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:17,560
little bit is uh to bring some wisdom to this maybe money is one thing what's in

77
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:26,080
the bank account what's on the credit card versus what is there some what do

78
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,120
we have enough of what do we what can we give away

79
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:37,599
our attention so much suffering in the world

80
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,959
is about people feeling like they haven't been seen or haven't been heard

81
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:51,560
or haven't been met with somebody giving them their full attention it's quite astounding actually

82
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:58,640
if we look at that and notice this so maybe we can give our attention with

83
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:06,000
care to somebody who comes to talk to us or even on just small

84
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,120
things the person The Grocery Clerk just to you know make eye contact and

85
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,800
acknowledge and if it seems appropriate you know say a little Hi how are you

86
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:24,839
kind of thing instead of there's a way in which we could just be just just you do your job so I can get out of here as

87
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:30,480
fast as possible instead of kind of recognizing our common Humanity

88
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:37,600
or maybe we could have be generous with some kindness kindness for ourselves and

89
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:44,040
kindness with others maybe this is some warm-heartedness and maybe that uh takes

90
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:50,600
the form of sending a card like a physical piece of paper that goes in the mail like these are seems like special

91
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:57,680
these days right like precious things when I get something in the mail like you know now it's you know text and

92
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:04,480
email seem so easy but send a card to somebody it's a feels it's a sense of

93
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:12,040
uplift some kindness and some care so this idea of like generosity and

94
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:18,800
giving when we talk about it here in the Buddhist centers and then certainly in this tradition in

95
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:26,000
particular where we really highlight that everything is offered freely everything here at IMC right

96
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,440
offered freely everything at the retreat center offer offered freely all of our Retreats offered

97
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:40,040
freely and then when we want to talk about generosity you know sometimes it can feel awkward but there's a way in

98
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:47,600
which maybe perhaps like conflating maybe mainstream ideas of generosity and

99
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,920
giving with what I might say the Buddhist ideas I I want to highlight a

100
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,639
few differences here first of all I'll say that

101
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:05,720
generosity often translated as Donna and we sometimes you hear this uh

102
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:12,360
language Donna da a it turns out to be a foundational

103
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:18,000
practice in the Buddhist teachings it's just this recognition of

104
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,880
the openness this of uh and the of sharing

105
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:30,200
maybe connecting with others is and in contrast to the opposite of like um I

106
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:36,680
have to have more which again I want to say sometimes we do need more I don't want to say that

107
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:43,399
we don't but it's part of this with ethical Behavior this like openness this

108
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:49,200
willingness to share whether it's attention or kindness or time or

109
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:55,519
material objects money or something else is really foundational to the

110
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,600
practice so it highlights how we are in the

111
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:08,760
world as opposed to okay I just got to get some meditative experience and then I'll be fine it's really highlighting

112
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:14,680
the way that we impact others and we are impacted by

113
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,920
others so in the list of parames some of you might be familiar with this list

114
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:27,000
it's a list of 10 um qualities that are usually described as off of the meditation

115
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,399
cushion so something that is done in one SL life the first is this orientation

116
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:41,279
towards sharing this orientation towards giving generosity it's also often when the

117
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:48,399
Buddha is giving teachings to somebody in these stories and um he encounters them the first teaching he gives them is

118
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:57,519
about generosity Donna and then CA ethical behavior and then b in a um this mental

119
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:04,279
cultivation so just this recognition that generosity so often is just this

120
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:10,199
orientation towards some openness and it's this orientation that

121
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:15,240
turns out that can have such a big impact on our

122
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:21,959
lives this is maybe in contrast to I what I might say a mainstream Society

123
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:28,720
the orientation is getting I got to get more give me more I got to attain I got

124
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:36,120
to achieve I got to have what can I get and what can I get away with and you know this opposite you know this it's a

125
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:43,959
society we created you know we can choose to participate in that or not in a way that uh makes sense to us but

126
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:50,000
there's a real different uh emphasis on what kind of an orientation to

127
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,720
have and so we might say that also in what I'm going to call

128
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:01,720
Mainstream these days like this is what what we're in here at IMC is not so

129
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:10,240
different than mainstream we might say but I going to say mainstream versus like these Buddhist ter Buddhist uh

130
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,920
values and mainstream there's often this way in which giving or yeah I'll just

131
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:22,639
use this word giving is transactional you gave me this I'll give

132
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:28,639
you that or you know maybe there's a sense and again this it's a natural

133
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:35,120
thing but well I had you over for dinner and I'm kind of expecting that you're going to invite me over for dinner or that if

134
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:41,959
you're offering me dinner then I better show up with something that's of value or and I'm not saying that these are bad

135
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:48,680
I'm just saying there's this uh often a transactional or maybe there's just you know the Girl Scout cookies okay I'm G

136
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:56,440
to pay this amount of money for the cookies or something that will uh support the Girl Scouts so there's this

137
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:03,959
clear expectations I might say of uh reciprocity or maybe there's this clear

138
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:12,079
expectations of tangible benefits I'm G to get cookies now that I uh gave money

139
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:19,560
to this young girl that rang the doorbell or that is sending in front of the grocery store as the case may

140
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,680
be so I would say a mainstream society that kind of the reciprocity and Tang

141
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:33,240
tangible benefits but um with a Buddhist idea it's more of an internal experience

142
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:40,680
is the uh is the Orient or is the emphasis I should say whereas this external okay

143
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:47,560
what am I going to get versus what is the experience like is it supporting

144
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:54,319
greater freedom is it supporting greater ease greater peace and my movement

145
00:15:54,319 --> 00:16:00,519
towards trying to find my way through the suffering I have in my life

146
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:07,440
and also we might say in kind like mainstream giving sometimes there's this

147
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:14,959
giving that's done out of a sense of Duty or a sense of obligation a sense

148
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:20,240
of um well this what's expected of us

149
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:28,120
there's this maybe kind of these Norms of a certain communities or there's this you know expectation that you should

150
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:34,519
give you know in in this particular setting whereas in contrast to that I

151
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:39,800
would say like the Buddhist teachings on generosity is more on this emphasis on

152
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:45,880
cultivating an open heart cultivating and open

153
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:52,040
mind and this recognition that the heart and the mind and our behaviors of course

154
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:58,600
they're connected and they go all directions the heart affects I'm using heart to mean

155
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:04,959
maybe um maybe a a felt sense or maybe an

156
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:10,120
Intuition or a feeling I'm using mind to be more like thoughts and

157
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:15,400
Concepts and then behaviors are the things that we actually do all three of

158
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:21,360
these behave uh sorry uh influence one another and the influence goes all

159
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:28,919
directions so of course what's in our mind influences our Behavior but our Behavior influences our minds and our

160
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:36,320
Hearts as well so this recognition that uh generosity flows out of this openness of

161
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:43,039
heart and mind but also the behavior of being generous supports this sense of

162
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:49,360
openness in the heart and mind as well it's and it's also about like

163
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:56,600
cultivating we might say this inner disposition of not only openness but

164
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:02,799
maybe some kindness and some care that often accompanies when there's some

165
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:08,120
generosity when there's some giving so there's

166
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:15,640
this maybe this movement of uh giving we as I pointed out earlier

167
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:21,320
also is the opposite of clinging so it's the

168
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:26,640
cultivation of something that's the opposite of what leads to

169
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,760
suffering this cultiv ation of what leads to Greater peace and ease and

170
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:38,720
sometimes it's this uh when we're doing the opposite of something it highlights

171
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:44,799
its opposite for example the feeling some of the openness with generosity

172
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:52,159
really starts to highlight oh yeah there's this tightness when there's um this feeling

173
00:18:52,159 --> 00:19:00,080
of stinginess for example I might say that's not a very nice word I don't feel good saying that word the s of

174
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:05,280
uh holding too tightly maybe I'll just say

175
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:11,080
that so just this maybe I I'll say use different language the being in

176
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:16,280
generosity supporting the openness and it highlights the tightness that we can

177
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:22,000
feel in other areas of our life including when we feel like no no no I I

178
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,039
I'm not I can't share my attention or my time or my energy and I feel like every time time I

179
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:35,000
say something like this I also need to say there are times in our lives when we

180
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,400
have a lot of suffering and we don't have the capacity to meet others where

181
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:46,000
they are there are seasons perhaps when there's a lot of illness or a lot of Dua

182
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,320
in whatever way so I don't want us to feel obligated like oh yeah okay I have

183
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:58,960
to give even though we feel so depleted even though we are starving for

184
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,399
some ease we more in the midst of

185
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,400
difficulties having said that that part of

186
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:16,200
the um connection between generosity and some

187
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:24,919
happiness is we see this happen a lot on um big scales hurricanes these terrible

188
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:31,240
hurricanes that were just in the South North Carolina and Florida for example I'm just using this as example there's

189
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:38,520
so many terrible things that are happening in the world that when there's this tragedy and

190
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:43,919
things are I'll just use this word

191
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:50,679
awful horrible yeah sometimes people come

192
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:56,640
together and share what they have with others or they share they help pick up

193
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,880
the rubble or they help literally or metaphorically when they and there's

194
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:08,280
this activity of like when we're sharing helping others that can bring this uplift of the heart that even though

195
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:15,720
there's this Devastation around perhaps I feel devastated the the uh Act of being

196
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:21,679
generous of supporting someone else kind of reminds us oh yeah I I have something I can

197
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:29,000
give energy time attention whatever it is and there's this uplift of the heart

198
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:36,960
that can happen with that so sometimes I'm saying when we're really down and out maybe we don't have the capacity to

199
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:43,240
be generous and it might be if we do have the energy to be generous in some

200
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:49,640
kind of way might provide some uplift a little bit of Joy some appreciation and

201
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:57,080
maybe undermine some sometimes we often have this sense of a we don't have agency like we can't do

202
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:04,799
anything or it's just not enough of anything and being generous can counteract

203
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:12,440
that so also there's this way in which I'm going to um contrast like mainstream

204
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:18,799
idea of generosity versus like the Buddhist ideas of uh

205
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:25,360
generosity is that kind of in the Buddhist ideas there's a real emphasis

206
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:32,320
on having some wise discernment in one's

207
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:41,000
generosity I would say maybe in contrast like mainstream um requests or

208
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,000
or I'll just use this word requests they're often lying relying on and I

209
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,159
don't want to say this is bad I'm just saying this to highlight how with the emot with the Buddhist one is

210
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:58,799
different the mainstream they often are relying on relying on emotional impulse

211
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:07,000
is like oh like a certain break heart brokenheartedness that can Happ when you see a photo a particular photo of often

212
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,720
it's a child right that is um in distress there's a lot of research

213
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,720
around this right of course so people have done research okay what makes it most likely that somebody will donate

214
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:25,600
what kind of photos and they've determined that usually it's just one child is better than more than one and

215
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:31,480
you know there's all kinds of stuff on this but so there um relying on the heartstrings getting

216
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:39,760
pulled as a way to uh be generous or maybe some uh social pressure uh to be

217
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:48,480
generous some religious traditions for example uh openly share uh how much uh

218
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:55,320
individuals donate they have it like publicly listed so and so donated this much so and so don't donated that much

219
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:00,440
or some religious Traditions say well some of our religious tenants are only

220
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,600
available to you if you donate enough or you know something like this right so

221
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,640
there's other ways in which mainstream

222
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:17,279
uh requests for donations are using certain um approaches in contrast I

223
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:23,320
would say here we're really pointing to wisdom needs to be here this is an

224
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:30,278
opportunity to cultivate wisdom this is an opportunity to use wisdom

225
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:40,398
so this an encouragement to be attentive to one's own needs and

226
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:46,320
limitations this uh like okay what's appropriate for you in your life

227
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:52,320
situation in terms of the amount that you donate or this encouragement like do

228
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:59,520
you feel like inspired or um appreci appreciative and want to help see these

229
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:05,480
uh continue these teachings continue or these offerings continue and some wise discernment like is this something

230
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:13,279
that's valuable for me if so then what can donate so L's relying on emotional

231
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:18,799
heartstrings and also this the sense of wisdom but the wisdom

232
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:24,080
also comes with a the sense of responsibility of like not harming we

233
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:31,840
don't want to harm ourselves that we're being generous and to a way that is inappropriate for us for our

234
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:37,240
life we've all heard these stories of people getting in terrible debt so that

235
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:43,480
they can donate to some organization and then that organization ends up just dissolving or going away or being a

236
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:50,799
bogus one it's heartbreaking whereas here there's this um in the Buddhist tradition there's a

237
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:56,960
real uh encouragement to practice generosity and wisdom

238
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:02,919
together and so there could even be a way in which our generosity like

239
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:08,760
compounds difficulties for example there might be

240
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:16,320
a situation in which we feel like okay well here's a one of my co-workers who is um doing a lot of

241
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,919
complaining maybe about their boss or their spouse or the government I mean there's no end of things that we can

242
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:28,399
complain about and maybe we feel like okay well I heard I'm going to be generous and

243
00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:33,559
really listen to them but we might start to notice that the more the person is

244
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:39,720
complaining and complaining the more that they're feeling dejected and we're feeling dejected and they're starting to

245
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,840
feel even more agitated not only that they did this can you believe it oh my

246
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:51,440
gosh and and then we're starting to feel like oh yeah it really is awful and

247
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,720
starting to feel helpless and hopeless or something like

248
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:02,760
this so if we just listen feeling like we're being generous then maybe they

249
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:09,880
might believe that they're that we're condoning their behavior and thinking that oh yeah this is a way to Greater

250
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:16,600
Peace and Freedom or maybe they might even think that we are agreeing with everything that they say and would go to

251
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:21,679
somebody else and say oh yeah well so and so agrees with me they didn't say

252
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:28,600
anything when I was complaining about this that and the other thing so just this encouragement to have some

253
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,799
sensitivity about you know the manner in which we're being generous and make sure

254
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:41,279
that we're not causing harm to others or to ourselves and maybe I'll also add this

255
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:48,600
idea of generosity requires us to be sensitive to what's happening with other

256
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:54,720
people what is the wise thing to do are we just being generous because we feel

257
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:02,159
uncomfortable and we want to stop feeling uncomfortable or are we so closed off and concerned with ourselves

258
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:07,919
that we don't even notice when other people could use some help could use

259
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:15,039
some attention could use some kindness so there's this way in which

260
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:22,559
this uh idea of generosity is used as a foundational

261
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:28,320
teaching just as this openness of this of the heart but also as a way that

262
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:33,360
supports the teachings of course but supports our own path towards

263
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:40,080
Liberation it's this way that I've been talking about this openness of heart and

264
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:47,919
mind but some of you might have be familiar with this teaching that uh one of uh the

265
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:55,600
three sometimes gets called poisons is greed this sense of just I need to have

266
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:01,559
more more more more this causes so much suffering in the world for us as

267
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:10,519
individuals and then you know just the wider world and so I generosity is an antidote

268
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:17,600
to one of these poisons that shows up in so many ways and complete freedom is described

269
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,760
as the absence of greed the absence of hatred and the absence of delusion so

270
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:30,440
this is like fundamentally pointing directly towards some of this uh movement towards greater

271
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:37,960
Freedom so maybe maybe I'll say a little bit about

272
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:43,840
um some of the something else about this uh the Buddhist practice of generosity

273
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:49,679
or this Buddhist emphasis of generosity is it it's also a great way

274
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:55,480
in which we can learn about ourselves a big part of this practice is

275
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:00,720
some greater self- understanding how we are in the world how we show up

276
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,780
in the world as a way to help us find less suffering and more

277
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:11,799
[Music] ease so we might just have this query

278
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:17,640
what areas of Our Lives do we feel generous and what areas do we not feel

279
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:23,159
so generous not that it has to be bad or good but just to understand ourselves

280
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:29,600
and then maybe to stretch ourselves a little bit I'm not saying we have to um

281
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:35,000
condemn our the way that we are or but just an encouragement to find more and

282
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:43,399
more openness and so an obvious sway is like between uh time and resources some

283
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:51,399
people are like oh I don't have any extra time but here you can have some money or maybe some people are like um I

284
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:56,880
don't have any money but I have time to share or I don't have so much kindness

285
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:03,080
I'm cranky and my world is falling apart and I don't have kindness or I don't want to give you attention or not so

286
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:08,760
much I don't want to give you like I can't give you attention because I have so much suffering here and again we

287
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:14,799
don't have to say it's bad or good we could just have this recognition well how is it for

288
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:20,880
us and is there a way with this greater understanding of how generosity shows up

289
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,399
in our lives is there a way that we could have greater Freedom if by just

290
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:33,559
maybe stretching a little bit because we learned these ways of how we

291
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:39,039
are how generosity generosity is in the world most likely from our families from

292
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:45,120
our societies our our communities that we grew up with we don't have to make

293
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:52,480
them bad but can we learn something and when we look at this when we look at our

294
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:58,399
practice of generosity we'll probably notice that we most often have MI

295
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:04,639
motivations when we're generous maybe some of it is this natural uh wanting to

296
00:32:04,639 --> 00:32:11,559
share and maybe there's a like well it's kind of expected of me or or we might

297
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:19,720
say and um I want them to like me or I want them to appreciate me or I want them to remember me or whatever it

298
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:25,320
is and can that be okay because we might say well if it's mixed motivations it's

299
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:33,600
not pure openness then maybe it's not even worth while what happens is it I would say it

300
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:39,080
always starts with some mixed motivations and then as we practice both

301
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:45,399
with mindfulness and um just spiritual practice in general our motivations

302
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:53,760
start to get more and more I might use this word purified they start to become more and more generous and open as we're

303
00:32:53,760 --> 00:33:00,518
finding more and more ease it's just naturally flows that

304
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:07,200
way so this idea of

305
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:14,960
giving and we might say mainstream giving versus maybe kind of this Buddhist idea of generosity which turns

306
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:21,679
out to be a foundational practice as it points to this openness this open-heartedness

307
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:28,840
open-mindedness or we might even say open fisted maybe in this way that we show up in the

308
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:36,279
world that leads to Greater Freedom less harm and peace and

309
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:43,080
ease so thank you thank you for your kind attention and I'll open it up for

310
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:48,518
some comments and questions thank you

311
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:08,839
um I had a couple of thoughts about like the intention behind generosity

312
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:16,520
that I look have seen this in others and I look for it in myself if it's kind of

313
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:22,398
an unhealthy um I want to do be generous

314
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:28,960
this way and get some recognition for it to me I

315
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:36,760
uh yeah I see that as as greed you know Greed for recognition so not

316
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:44,158
um you know not not real open generosity um and then the other thing

317
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:52,240
when you were talking about if if you're depleted yourself you know maybe it's not the time to be to be

318
00:34:52,240 --> 00:35:01,359
generous I was thinking well maybe that's the time to be direct your generos it to yourself very nice yeah

319
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:07,359
yeah yeah yeah I like this idea of me having generosity towards myself I love that

320
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:13,040
some self-care in some kind of way yeah and this is interesting about being

321
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:20,200
generous so that you can have some recognition I'll say that uh there is a

322
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:25,800
back when I was in Corporate America uh you know there is a plaque I'll say here

323
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:32,400
in the Bay Area that has my name on it for you know my generosity for something

324
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:39,520
so you know but uh I will also say that whenever I uh see that or I recall it it

325
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:45,359
gives me this uplift to the heart it was something that was meaningful for me and I kind of I don't know makes me very

326
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:50,599
happy that I was able to do that so maybe there was some greed there of

327
00:35:50,599 --> 00:36:00,119
recognition I did like the idea that my name was going to be on this PL and um I I uh heard this idea years

328
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:05,880
ago from Joseph Goldstein on he's one of the elders in this

329
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:11,359
tradition and uh about generosity and he said that he had started this practice

330
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:16,800
of Whenever there was a like a request for generosity to just do it to just do

331
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:24,440
it even though the motivations may be mixed just to do it and you know being wise with one regards to one's means and

332
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:29,640
I started to do this as well I left it it just made me happy and I also not

333
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:35,200
noticed how my motivations were all over the place and but there was also just

334
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:42,960
this uh recognition of being generous with material Goods or with uh time and

335
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:50,400
attention it um cultivates this movement of maybe like of letting go so I don't

336
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:56,960
know if this addresses your comments yeah thank you thank you

337
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:06,119
so you mentioned that that uplift of the heart and I was thinking about this why

338
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:14,040
you were talking uh uh in my experience it only comes then

339
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:22,079
it is difficult to be generous so contributing to organizations like save

340
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:29,359
the children or doctors in their borders that's easy and there is no uplift of the heart in that sort of

341
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:37,839
generosity putting myself in a situation that is difficult talking to someone that I feel uncomfortable but it's

342
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:42,920
helpful that has the uplift of the heart is

343
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:49,599
that so you saying the uplift of the heart is more if it's difficult to give

344
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,760
I see uh that hasn't been my experience but I think this is great thing to

345
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:02,839
explore like okay what is the connection there between if it's difficult to give or not to give thank you for bringing up

346
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:08,599
that I don't have an answer I'm just explaining my experience seems like your experience is different I think it's a

347
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:14,319
great thing to explore I'm I'm contributing to these large organizations because that's the

348
00:38:14,319 --> 00:38:20,119
right thing to do but that's not doesn't do anything for me

349
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:24,799
inside thank you thank you

350
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:36,319
um so one one area where I feel a little tight is um I like things to go my

351
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:45,160
way and um especially socially uh there's uh control and um wondering if

352
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:50,599
you have suggestions for working with uh giving that away giving agency um

353
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:56,359
allowing for things to go the way that I don't like

354
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:08,280
what does it feel like when uh you said that you feel tight can you say a little bit more it's just yeah it's like oh

355
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:13,839
things it would be better if I you know if I told them this is this is the my

356
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:19,920
way the better way to do it

357
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,160
yeah that this is a such an interesting topic you know about uh controlling

358
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:32,400
others and of course Kevin you probably know right it does we don't get to control I mean we we think we can but we

359
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:40,720
don't really control others um I I what comes to mind is something simple about

360
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:48,000
uh just being present in the moment an obvious thing is you like feeling your feet on the ground because often what

361
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:55,839
happens when we're trying to um control others is maybe maybe even

362
00:39:55,839 --> 00:40:01,440
you said this Kevin is to not feel the discomfort and so we feel like okay well

363
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:08,119
if they would just stop doing that or start doing that then I wouldn't have this discomfort but is there a way that we

364
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:13,480
can just acknowledge feel our feet on the ground and like yeah this is

365
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:21,960
uncomfortable and that's the truth of the moment right and that's the reality of the moment and can we be with that as

366
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:27,920
best we can and so often probably what will happen is like oh yeah this is uncomfortable and they really should be

367
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:35,640
doing all this kind of stuff right we'll slip right into that and then can you just come back to wow this really is

368
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:41,079
uncomfortable but what man you probably have this experience too that if we

369
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:47,280
don't control often things unfold in a way that we don't expect and maybe they're even better like maybe people

370
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:56,000
have different ideas that turn out to be better than the ideas that we have had so takes a little maybe trust and

371
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,680
confidence and the unfolding of things and maybe if it's not

372
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:07,520
better can that be okay too I wish I had an easy answer for you

373
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:12,040
Kevin like that was good thank you you're

374
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:18,760
welcome anybody else have a question or

375
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,079
comment go okay okay so may you find some flow of

376
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:39,200
