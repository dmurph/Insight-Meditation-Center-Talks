1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:09,799
so good evening my name is Maria stratman hold on a second

2
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:21,000
here so what I would like to talk to you about tonight is

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,960
um the attitude of mind and awareness as tools of insight sounds

4
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,840
very pedantic doesn't it but I really have as an

5
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,239
intention to share with you a way of thinking about mindfulness that makes it

6
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:46,520
touch how we are in life we all have things that happen that we're

7
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:53,280
dissatisfied with you know that you think of it for a moment of the many ways in which there are things that you

8
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,600
wish were different the many ways you wish things were different we lose someone or

9
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:08,600
something we lose our keys we lose someone close to us we stumble and fall on the path the

10
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:15,840
metaphorical path or you know we trip over the sidewalk and we fall and we break

11
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,640
something or we hurt someone or when someone or something

12
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,680
disappoints us are the Solace that we used to feel

13
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,000
in meditation somehow has left us and what's wrong with my

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,640
meditation or our bodies age and betray us and we wonder what happened to that

15
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:46,680
juiciness and that resilience and that get up and go

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:55,360
and somehow that movement is no longer reachable or maybe we're unable to

17
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:03,920
forgive or we feel unseen or dism miss or just plain

18
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,640
Passover or we see or experience Injustice these are common things that

19
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:15,239
happen to us all the time they're a normal part of life and how we're able

20
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:20,519
to meet them and interact with them determines whether we are miserable

21
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:27,360
unhappy suffering or whether we can encounter them with

22
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,560
equinity and we'd all like to have the secret for how to do that right I meet

23
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:41,400
everything that I don't want to be true with total balance and equinity and I'm

24
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:47,840
happy and how do I get there so what I want to talk about is

25
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,400
how do we get there

26
00:02:52,920 --> 00:03:00,319
because suffering exists in the world but we don't have to suffer

27
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:07,440
pain exists in the world unsatisfactoriness exists in the

28
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:16,799
world I don't know when you last lost your keys but we had keys missing in our house this this last week and it was

29
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:23,280
painful whose fault was it that the keys are missing what are we going to do about the keys we've torn the place

30
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,400
apart how important are the keys and of course in the overall scheme of these

31
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:35,760
things keys are not that important but they can become a source of great

32
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:43,400
irritation and of course we have strategies for dealing with things that aren't the way we want them to be we can

33
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:50,959
ignore them we can pass over them we can substitute something else in place of worrying about those

34
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:57,400
things we can say well I'm going to take care of myself and I'm going to go off and distract

35
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,480
myself we can develop self- Improvement plans okay I know how I'm going to deal

36
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:10,519
with this I'm going to take care of that bad habit I have and we're going to fix this as if by

37
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:16,199
fixing this particular case everything's going to be

38
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:21,720
better or we become we attach mindfulness to it and we attach great

39
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:27,840
intensity of intention and I'm going to be here with this I'm going to measure it I'm going to know everything about it

40
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,919
I'm going to analyze it I'm going to understand understand what's wrong with it and we just make it

41
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,680
worse and it becomes ever more a source of suffering and pain for

42
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,199
us or we get down and we roll around in the papers on the floor and really

43
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:52,478
really get miserable or we become

44
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,919
self-righteous this is not my fault and we enter into the world of

45
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:05,639
praise and blame it's not my fault it's your fault if you were better if I were better self-criticism

46
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:13,320
judgment and none of this is absolutely necessary it's just the way the mind

47
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:19,440
works all of these suppose we see these sources of

48
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:27,960
dissatisfaction as experiences that don't need to be fixed changed managed

49
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:34,919
massaged suppose we just see these as experiences that actually don't have

50
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:40,240
anything to do with our selfworth your

51
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:47,840
selfworth meaning in life the end of life they're just things

52
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:54,520
that happen suppose it is actually possible to see things just come and

53
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:01,638
go without attaching great meaning to everything that happens

54
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:11,720
can we actually do that how so I want to call your attention to

55
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:18,520
two aspects of how we experience the world and those are the attitude of mind

56
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:26,120
and our awareness so by attitude of mind what I'm referring to is the the sort of

57
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,639
context that we carry around with us that can be very shortterm or it can be

58
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:38,080
it can last days months weeks years which is sort of the uh the container

59
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:44,080
for how we experience the world you know the interesting thing about it is

60
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,759
it's usually what we ascribe to ourselves and say this is who I am well

61
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:58,120
I tend to see the world with judgment I'm J I'm a judger or I'm a fixer or I

62
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:04,000
am I'm really depressed so I see things this

63
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,039
way and we we decide that there is a way to look at the world and that's how we

64
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,360
look at the world and that tends to color the experience now it's a little bit

65
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:22,639
different than mood it's it's really just what we expect to

66
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:30,000
see and then we place our awareness in such a way that that's in fact what we see

67
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,240
and what I'd like to do is distinguish between what's actually happening and

68
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,599
our attitude or our opinion about what's actually

69
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,240
happening so I want to give a few examples and and see if we can look at

70
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:57,440
what's the raw experience versus what is it that we describe and decide is the

71
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:03,240
experience so they're kind of so so I'm GNA I'm going

72
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:11,639
to tell you why I think this is important first so on my mind lately has been a lot to

73
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:18,520
do with uh grief I've recently lost somebody very very dear to

74
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:26,280
me and I have been contemplating a lot about the intimacy of that relationship

75
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,919
and the loss of that relationship and what that means and so

76
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:37,039
one morning I was very conscious of of thinking about

77
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:43,360
well I'm going to think about all the wonderful times we had and I set myself

78
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:50,399
to thinking about memories of things that we had shared looking for what is it that has led to this great

79
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:56,240
intimacy and what arose were times of great

80
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,440
pain things that we shared around

81
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:10,920
events that were really quite painful and the memory brought to me at

82
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:17,399
what I was experiencing were pangs of ow oh that

83
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:24,079
hurts and at the same time I realized that those were those were moments when

84
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:30,519
we were really really close that we were there for one another that we were very

85
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:36,920
present for one another that we were vulnerable and

86
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:45,800
present and the intimacy that I recalled in those moments brought me

87
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:51,920
Delight so here I was in the present moment recalling pangs of grief feeling

88
00:09:51,920 --> 00:10:01,319
pangs of grief and the pleasure of the intimacy of just being there for one

89
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:07,880
another and the Insight that I had was not

90
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:15,040
that intimacy requires pain or pain gives rise to intimacy but that intimacy

91
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:24,959
has to do with vulnerability and trust and I said oh that's really

92
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:33,279
interesting I came out of that few seconds of

93
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:40,279
experience with a sense of ease and relief in my

94
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:46,519
grief that didn't have anything to do with getting rid of grief or changing

95
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:54,320
the nature of grief but understanding that there was pain and

96
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,800
joy in the present even though this person is now

97
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:07,800
gone and I could focus on I could put my Awareness on worrying about oh those moments will

98
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:16,320
never arise again or I could just be here with this experience this Insight

99
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,399
this comes and this

100
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:28,560
goes it's possible to get caught in the place of the story and go I could have

101
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:34,760
gotten in to any one of those grief stories around the pain stories that we

102
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:40,800
were talking about I could have gotten worried about why can't I find

103
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:48,399
any happy memories to feel very intimate about I could have gone on to how I'm

104
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:55,320
going to miss these in the future I could have been lost in thinking about or having opinions

105
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:04,959
about what the experience was but the raw experience was just pain and joy following close on one

106
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:10,120
another and the Insight that

107
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:16,720
intimacy was because we really trusted one another and how wonderful that

108
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:25,000
was and how grateful I am in retrospect that we were that we had that

109
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:33,920
trust now that was described being an experience that lasted less than a

110
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:40,839
minute less than a minute of my life which has gone on for many

111
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:50,519
decades but it actually was a portion of my life that was very free and easy and

112
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,519
flowing we very often get caught in the in the place of thinking that pain has

113
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:04,800
to be fixed that discomfort and dissatisfaction

114
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:11,120
needs to be managed fixed tolerated

115
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,279
somehow we have to do something about it it can't just be

116
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:21,320
there unsatisfactoriness just is not

117
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,920
acceptable but in fact why

118
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:33,760
not it just is it doesn't mean

119
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:41,000
anything it just is like a thought coming and going so in the last couple of weeks

120
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,279
I've spent a a lot of time watching the Olympics I sprang for the $13 in butt

121
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:54,279
you know a month to watch peacock so I could really get into watching everything on the

122
00:13:54,279 --> 00:14:01,839
Olympics and I watched a number of these super Elite athletes do their thing and

123
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:09,600
there there two two events that that I want to call your attention to because they illustrate basically the same thing

124
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:16,279
one was uh Steph Curry doing those Final Shots in the basketball men's basketball

125
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:23,079
in the last few minutes of the gold medal game and somebody asked him afterward

126
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:29,759
there were ridiculous ridiculous three-point shots and somebody asked him how did that feel and were you thinking

127
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:37,440
about at the end and he said I was just looking at the rim I was just looking at the rim and I

128
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:45,560
didn't see those two much taller guys standing right in front of him blocking the shot that he threw

129
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:51,800
over you know you can imagine the hands would be up like this in front of my face and they would go up the ball went

130
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:58,279
up over and a distance to the basket right just he said I was just looking at

131
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:03,560
the rim I just saw the rim and he's talked about this in other times where

132
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:09,000
for him it was so he he had done a lot of skill

133
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:16,680
development but also he was just in the moment I'm just doing this he wasn't

134
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:21,720
thinking about comparing it to something else he wasn't trying to be better than

135
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:27,959
he wasn't worrying about who was going to what people were going to think about it he wasn't thinking about he he had a

136
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:35,120
goal which was to make those baskets and to win the gold medal and he had a determination but he wasn't pushing

137
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:42,920
through something he was just totally in the moment totally in the moment I was just

138
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:48,000
looking at The Rim the other one was uh Katie leeki who

139
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,800
who got a gold medal for the 1500 meter swim and she said that after a th000

140
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:01,160
meters it just hurts and she'd been practic practicing practicing practicing practicing and and

141
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:08,680
it was uniform after a th meters it just hurts but she didn't think about the pain she didn't try to push it away or

142
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:14,600
tolerate it it just pain was there and she just kept

143
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:22,160
swimming because that's what she was doing she was just swimming so in both cases they were just doing what they had

144
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,319
trained themselves to do and they weren't focusing on those things that we

145
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:33,120
tend to think you should think about that you have to pay attention to that you should really be mindful

146
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:41,639
of yeah the pain was there but it was you know that's that's yeah the Pain's there and she just

147
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:47,079
swam that's what she did that's what we want our mindfulness

148
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:52,880
to be like we don't want it to be a task we don't want it to be something that we

149
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:58,120
have to always have an object for we don't want to spend our time walking

150
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:04,438
around saying okay okay now I'm going to be mind mindful of this so we have to develop the skill so that it's like a

151
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:12,880
muscle memory so what I'm encouraging you to do tonight is to become very aware of your

152
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,798
attitude of mind that's that's the thing that

153
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:24,600
determines that's the the sort of uh container for your

154
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:31,000
experience if you're walking around saying you know the world is really

155
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,640
crummy or you're an eternal optimism a person totally focused on

156
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:43,200
optimism and you can't see anything bad you won't see anything bad you also

157
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:49,120
won't be very realistic and things will happen to you you'll lose your keys even

158
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,760
if you're optimistic you'll still trip over the

159
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,440
crack in the sidewalk

160
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:08,720
but if you come to really understand your attitude of mind that attitude of mind that you have now then it becomes a

161
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:16,400
tool that you can use you can check in with it and you can you can say okay this attitude is here

162
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,400
today you don't have to change the attitude by the way you don't have to make it different than it is you just

163
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:29,919
have to be aware of it so that you know how it is coloring your experience

164
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:36,320
so knowing that I'm carrying around a certain amount of grief right

165
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:43,200
now I'm aware of it it's here but it doesn't have to color

166
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:49,200
everything I can still notice other things I can be aware of it and use my

167
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,158
awareness elsewhere as

168
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,360
well it's like knowing it's raining and wishing it wasn't raining R in but okay

169
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:05,320
it's raining but you know it's not the only thing

170
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:12,240
happening but it helps to be aware of it because things are still kind of

171
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,280
damp it's going to affect

172
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:25,280
you it doesn't have to surprise you so that's one aspect of it the other

173
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:33,520
one is you can also cultivate an attitude of mind mind so you can decide for example I

174
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,880
want to understand what it's like to have the attitude of

175
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:45,360
Mind of generosity how do I cultivate that attitude of

176
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,760
Mind well when I notice that somebody said something hurtful instead of

177
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:59,039
deciding there's something wrong with that person I can say I wonder what's bothering that person

178
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:07,039
I can be generous in how I think about or respond to people I can deliberately

179
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:14,080
give something to someone and say how does that feel come to understand what it feels

180
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,440
like to have an attitude of generosity there's value in knowing how

181
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:25,559
it feels or to develop an attitude of

182
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:31,400
renunciation what does that feel like not to learn how to deprive myself but

183
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:36,120
to know what it feels like to be able to let go of

184
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:43,640
something what does it feel like to let go of something so this afternoon I read

185
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:50,159
um I was trying to think of a poem that might illustrate the idea so I read a

186
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:57,760
Song of Myself by Walt Whitman and there he just talked about

187
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:03,360
how wonderful it was just to touch people just to feel

188
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:11,440
that do you know how wonderful it feels just to touch people just I we you know it's kind of

189
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:18,559
not PC to touch people these days so you got to be kind of careful about this but you know choose

190
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:25,200
carefully the other night we had an event here for for volunteers to

191
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,520
celebrate volunteers at IMC and it was absolutely

192
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:38,080
delightful just delightful people that I hadn't seen since before the pandemic I

193
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:44,840
got to see and I reveled in that

194
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,880
delight and I carried that Delight I experienced that delight and I was still

195
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:59,600
aware of this grief hanging over here and people say what's new with you think

196
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,640
well I don't really want to dump on this

197
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:15,440
story but it really felt different I could feel how lovely it was to see old

198
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,679
friends that I hadn't seen and to experience that in your body

199
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:28,000
and say ah yes so that you recognize it and you

200
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:36,320
don't develop the attitude of mind that this is the only way to be whatever that attitude of mind is and

201
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,400
you don't identify with that attitude of mind and say this is who I

202
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:48,840
am it's possible to be many kinds of people you are many kinds of

203
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:56,840
people and when you see that you can use your

204
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:06,080
awareness and any situation to say what's going on here what's going on here how can I see

205
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:13,559
more clearly and in seeing more

206
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:20,480
clearly we become disentangled from all the ways that we

207
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,000
decide this is the most important thing in the world and I am really caught in

208
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,320
this suffering the way we become

209
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:38,559
uncaught is be by disentangling ourselves by seeing clearly this is

210
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:45,360
what's operating this is what I this oh this is what's happening just this not

211
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:55,600
more not what used to happen not what's going to happen not what's going to follow from this but just this just the

212
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:02,640
rim just the rim the closer we can get to just this

213
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:10,799
feeling just this moment just this the closer we can see oh this is

214
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:18,240
what's happening it doesn't say anything about who I am or who you are it's just

215
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:24,080
this happening as we become disentangled we

216
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:29,480
become dispassionate everything falls away we

217
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:35,000
don't hold on to it it's not like we have to let go of things or push things

218
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,120
away oh this is what's

219
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:46,520
happening and the ease that we are looking for

220
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:53,600
arises ah and we see things coming and going

221
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,600
and coming and going

222
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,440
sometimes they're happy things sometimes they're sad

223
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:12,720
things but they don't say anything about this is who I

224
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:21,880
am they're just things it's just raining it's just not

225
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:29,120
raining I notice I seem tense today tension

226
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:35,200
tension tension what's happening what's

227
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:46,679
happening okay it seems like this okay could be what else is

228
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:52,120
happening so that we get don't get so attached to our first thought we don't

229
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:59,520
get lost in the story of the first word that we attach to what's going on

230
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:05,120
we don't decide meditation sucks because today I

231
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:13,399
just can't seem to to relax at all we can actually allow things to be

232
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:18,760
just as they are and when we can allow things to be

233
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:24,559
just as they are we get over the suffering that

234
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:33,120
arises out of wishing everything was different wishing it was better wishing we could be

235
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:39,278
better we just say Ah that's the way it is right

236
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:45,960
now and then we look at our intention and we take the next

237
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:59,799
step and we don't allow the attitude of mind to determine what our life is

238
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:06,880
we use the attitude of mind to see things and to understand how it

239
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:13,520
influences our experience and we cultivate alternative

240
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:19,120
attitudes of mind so that we can understand what it feels like and

241
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:29,120
cultivate that oh huh that's interesting

242
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:36,200
developing a mind of curiosity if you want to be

243
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,840
free cultivate

244
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:50,519
Freedom allow yourself to see things just as they are without an opinion

245
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:57,799
without judgment just this

246
00:27:59,399 --> 00:28:05,159
I have no idea whether I said what was on my page but those are my thoughts for

247
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:10,440
this afternoon so thank

248
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:17,159
you and may all of your attitudes be joyous ones and when they are not as

249
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:22,919
they will not may you see the world through

250
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:29,440
Clarity because then you will be free thank you so if you have any questions

251
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:38,399
or observations or demands I'd hap happy to entertain

252
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:54,440
them would you here's the microphone please it's my first time here um we

253
00:28:54,440 --> 00:29:00,399
talking about the feeling um that's that's like something that that I've

254
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:06,240
been uh working on a lot and it's about for me it's

255
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:13,440
about just like being able to like feel it like in in every breath like to just

256
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:19,320
have like just like the excitement the passion like it's just you have

257
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:26,640
to it's it's it's it's all about feeling the world reflects back to us what we feel whether whether we know it or not

258
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:32,799
it's our subconscious it's it's it's what we believe in our subconscious and what we feel so it's a combination of

259
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:38,760
both so like you're saying the thoughts that we're thinking during the day we have to be conscious of the type of

260
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:47,440
thoughts that we impress into our subconscious because then when we express it out it comes out with those

261
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:55,039
things attached to it so we reflect it back to ourselves in our reality but it's

262
00:29:55,039 --> 00:30:00,440
about like you said detaching from from from those negative thoughts and just

263
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:08,919
being at peace like said just not so um so you've said a

264
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:16,000
lot uh and it's very very complex but basically I if I can reflect back what

265
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:24,399
I've heard we are impacted by our experience and we uh reflect that back

266
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:32,200
and we in reflecting back to others we are also it's it's changed somewhat by

267
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:39,640
the attitudes and and thoughts that we have and that impacts others as well and

268
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:45,360
so there's a feedback mechanism between us and others one of

269
00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:52,880
the one of the criticisms of this practice is that a mindfulness practice

270
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:58,919
can lead you to become self-focused all I'm thinking about is what's going on with me

271
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:05,960
and it is one of the reasons for cultivating an attitude of generosity that you begin to understand that that

272
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:11,639
you you really are not paying attention if you don't notice what's going on for

273
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:17,559
the other person out here as well and how that impacts you because there is

274
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:23,600
there is a lot of sense data that you're aware of that your mind maybe isn't

275
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:29,000
processing yeah and and absolutely obviously we have to be conscious of of

276
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:35,600
other people um I was just maybe just saying like in the sense of like even just experiences or things that we that

277
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:41,639
that come to pass um that that we we don't realize that that we're um that

278
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:47,720
much in control of of what's going on here it's it's really all inside of us

279
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:53,360
and how we feel is what we're projecting just I mean if you don't smile if you look at a mirror you don't smile at it

280
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:59,919
you're not going to get one back okay so I'm I'm not quite sure I'm clear on what you're just saying so are

281
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:05,159
you saying I'm I'm not sure how you use the word control

282
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:10,240
there you said something about it's it's did you say we do control or we don't

283
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:16,440
control we're I think we're in more control than we realize um we influence

284
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:23,919
but I don't think we're particularly in control well yeah we yes influence we we I mean in a sense uh yeah we influence

285
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:29,679
our our experience we we we we we influence our experience you know um for

286
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:36,559
sure but I think it's we influence it a lot more than we realize with our feelings and with our thoughts okay yeah

287
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:42,200
yeah so so what conditions our experience so the experience comes out

288
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:47,399
of the conditions that are set and so if I have ill will in my heart then I'm

289
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:53,559
going to generate a lot of ill will if I have loving kindness and peace in my heart I'm going to generate quite the

290
00:32:53,559 --> 00:33:01,679
opposite uh so I think that's the context in which you're yeah speaking basically what I was say yeah thank

291
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:07,279
you um so you talked about the generosity but I want to know how can we

292
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:15,480
know how much generosity is we need to have um we okay because

293
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:21,120
I'm going through hard time and because I had I think too much generosity that

294
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,360
it hurt me at the end because of caring too

295
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:33,919
much um about other people of giving too much yes to other

296
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:39,519
people so I want to make a distinction between an attitude of generosity and A

297
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:45,760
Generous Heart a Compassionate Heart and the act of generosity and the act of

298
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:51,600
compassion which is different than compassion the reason I'm making this

299
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,720
distinction is compassion is the movement of the heart and generosity is

300
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:03,720
a a an attitude of mind that is open and

301
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:10,560
giving the act of generosity is a Step Beyond that and

302
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:17,599
there's a different um distinction to be made so an act of generosity that has to

303
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:23,720
do with giving somebody something take needs to take into

304
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:30,200
account whether the generosity towards

305
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:37,520
someone is ungenerous toward oneself there needs to be a balance so A

306
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:45,280
Generous Heart is also generous toward oneself it is a kind of a a spirit of

307
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:53,398
loving kindness that doesn't have anything to do with giving somebody something that giving somebody something

308
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:58,920
is um uh like

309
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:04,000
um a a measuring stick I'm going to measure my generosity by how much I give

310
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,720
away and if I give you everything then you're going to love me you know there's a kind of transactional feeling to it

311
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:19,400
whereas A Generous Heart is just plain open and free free flowing okay

312
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:26,200
so when we're in a position of saying I don't know how you could say the same

313
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:31,960
thing about generosity and vulnerability so if I say that I value

314
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:37,359
vulnerability in an open heart to the extent that I make myself

315
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:43,640
unsafe that's unskillful and unwise to give to the point where I

316
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:49,480
am harming myself is unskillful and

317
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:55,640
unwise how to determine where that is is a matter of

318
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:00,240
balance that one has to Det determined for

319
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:07,200
oneself I don't know if that's helpful but I I want you to think in terms of of

320
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:12,240
a generous heart is not measured it's

321
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:18,800
open it it has nothing to do with the act of generosity although acts of

322
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:26,440
generosity help open the heart thank you okay

323
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:36,359
there's there's a stage where people can become

324
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:42,040
um uh you we've heard of codependency

325
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:47,800
where where someone supports somebody's bad habits as I'm going to support you

326
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:54,160
forever because I really believe in you and then you know they're they're really causing harm in the end you know that's

327
00:36:54,160 --> 00:37:00,560
not being generous it feels like generosity but is not so often times

328
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:07,280
it's possible to masquerade an intention and so then one

329
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:12,720
has to step back and say what is my intention is my intention to be loved is

330
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,200
my intention to give love is my

331
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,040
intention is my intention to be seen is my intention to

332
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:31,880
encourage and to look very closely at what the intention is as a way of measuring

333
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:38,519
that um balance to help to find that

334
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:50,280
balance yes can we have the

335
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:58,200
microphone thanks for the talk um got a lot out of it um can

336
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:05,599
you maybe share a bit about so this concept of attitudes of mind um you shared examples like

337
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:11,359
generosity I think Freedom um just curious if there's like

338
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:17,720
kind of a a guiding principle or how do I expand my vocabulary of like the

339
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:24,839
attitudes of mind that we want to have um well see that's the thing I don't

340
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:32,040
want to put a good and bad label on any attitude of mind now if if if you talk

341
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:38,000
to my husband well actually he probably I don't know if he knows this but the very things he likes about me are the

342
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:45,040
very things that in extremist he doesn't like about me right

343
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:52,800
uh and we could say that about anything uh a knife in the hands of a a

344
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:58,079
surgeon is a tool for good a knife in the hands of a a robber is is probably

345
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,880
not so good so any attitude of

346
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,880
mind

347
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:16,000
um exists it doesn't necessarily have to be considered bad so let's take an

348
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:22,319
attitude that is um let's take the attitude of Revenge Revenge is on my

349
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:29,880
mind okay this is a an ill will right so so I would say that this is an

350
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:37,040
an unskillful attitude of mind because revenge is likely to

351
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:44,960
generate more suffering and therefore I suspect is it's not going to

352
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,760
provide anything

353
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:58,400
useful if I have if I can look if I notice an attitude of Revenge

354
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,880
I can say what is what else is here besides

355
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:12,440
revenge and it can be a way of saying is Revenge the right word am I just hurt do

356
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:18,839
I really want to hurt the other person or do I really want something else what

357
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:25,920
is it what is it that I really want because sometimes uh one of my

358
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:32,119
favorite teachings from Gil was he said you know if you can't get rid of ill will at least be the kind of

359
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:37,400
person be the person who wants to get rid of ill will because it it softens

360
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:42,799
and opens the heart right that

361
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:51,280
so a um a characteristic that is uh a negative

362
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:57,760
characteristic greed hatred and delusion are the things that we want to get rid of in life because they are the do give

363
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:03,119
R to suffering so an attitude of mind that supports greed hatred and delusion

364
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:09,400
you really want to let go of that you want to you want to see as clearly as possible so that you can let go of that

365
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:15,119
attitude of mind because it's going to give rise to

366
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:21,839
suffering so I I don't do it anymore but I used to have

367
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:28,240
uh engraved on my iPad the opening lines to the do a

368
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:36,200
Ada all experiences preceded by mind led by mind made by mind speaker act with a

369
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:43,839
corrupted mind and suffering follows like the wheels of the cart behind the Hooves of the ox all experien is

370
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:49,359
preceded by mind made by mind led by mind led by mind made by mind speak or

371
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:55,960
act with a peaceful mind and happiness follows like a never departing

372
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:03,240
shadow I routinely repeat those words to myself to remind myself to

373
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:12,280
check what's in my heart and if it is tight and twisted

374
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:20,119
and full of ill will I say I don't like that feeling I don't want that feeling

375
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:26,200
can I let go of that feeling has nothing to do with whatever

376
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:33,160
is happening but only what I carry in my heart because that's what conditions the next

377
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:41,720
moment that's the power of the attitude of mind so so Revenge would be one I'd say

378
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:49,119
I'd try to lose that one but I would use it to try to figure out what else is there what what what

379
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:57,480
else is happening is there some way that I can can change that Revenge word to what I

380
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:02,720
really want is for the world to be better so I'll give you an example of how that might work somebody presses you

381
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:08,440
on the freeway Cuts you off and I wish there was a cop here right and instead

382
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:13,800
you say wait a minute that's not what I want the truth is it scared

383
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:20,760
me May nobody be hurt now I've moved from Revenge pretty

384
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:29,079
quickly the thought arose but I don't have to hold on to the thought I can let go with the the

385
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:35,720
thought but seeing that thought gives rise to another thought like that this

386
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:42,160
is what else is here well it scared me that was the whole thing it scared me that's why the thought arose but I don't

387
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:49,319
have to identify with the thought and own the thought and hold the thought and justify it and know I don't have to I

388
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:57,400
can let go of it and then there's room for something else to arise which is the habit

389
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:04,720
cultivated by I want to keep a peaceful heart that's why we cultivate skillful

390
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:12,319
attitudes of mind so that we can just look at the rim and keep

391
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:18,440
swimming because we've cultivated the muscle memory to do

392
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:28,400
that so any last thoughts

393
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:38,760
I wish you all joy thank you
