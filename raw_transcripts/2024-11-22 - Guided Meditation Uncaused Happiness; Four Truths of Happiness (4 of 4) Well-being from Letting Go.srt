1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:11,840
so hello and welcome welcome to this Friday

2
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:32,160
meditation and I'd like to this meditation build on

3
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,520
or continue with the momentum or

4
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:45,079
the the background of these first days or these last two weeks of

5
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:52,520
meditation last two weeks of teachings to offer something rather

6
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:59,680
Radical Something That is a maybe would turn things around quite

7
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:07,159
TR atically for a few of you having to do with where you Center your

8
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,400
life and um it it has to do with

9
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:19,240
happiness that the deepest fullest

10
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:25,159
happiness that can come from Dharma practice and a certain kind of way

11
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:30,600
doesn't come from a cause doesn't come with reasons doesn't happen come with

12
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:37,520
anything changing in the outer World often we're looking to be happy by

13
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:44,360
having things go well for us in the world and we're unhappy when they're

14
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:53,240
not but to have an inner uh our inner life be independent

15
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,520
of what happens around us independent of success and failures independent of

16
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:05,159
praise and blame independent of being liked or not liked

17
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:11,560
being there's a there's a happiness inside that is not

18
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:17,360
dependent on what's happening in the world it's not dependent

19
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:24,200
on all kinds of things that or ordinarily we think we need to change in order to

20
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:30,200
be happy and so a happiness without cause a

21
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:36,599
happiness without reason a happiness that

22
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:45,200
comes when we are letting go of searching getting get letting go

23
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:52,319
of wanting letting go of the stories that we tell ourselves stories that might have some

24
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,920
truth to what's happening around us or in the world but still we might be

25
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,120
telling ourselves stories about it remembering it thinking about

26
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,799
it making commentary letting go of

27
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:17,120
stories letting go of searching of wanting letting go of

28
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:24,080
resistance letting go of Doubt letting go of all the extra ways

29
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,159
in which we stir ourselves up all the ways which we live in a reaction active

30
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:37,000
mode or all the ways in which we live in an activated

31
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:43,120
mode just to be here without all those

32
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:50,720
things and here turns out being here in a full

33
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:57,959
way being here without all those other things is where we can find

34
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:03,280
happiness that has no reason you could say it's there because

35
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:10,239
we're not stirring ourselves up so that's may be a reason but it's

36
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,000
the reasons those kinds of reasons are talking about what's

37
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:21,560
absent nothing has to be present nothing has to be

38
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:28,400
happening let go enough and happiness

39
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:36,880
comes let go enough into mindfulness into

40
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:46,120
awareness and there's a yes in our whole system a yes to be here yes to be

41
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:52,280
attentive there can be a yes to physical pain and emotional pain oddly enough

42
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:58,160
there can be joy and happiness together with physical or

43
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:05,800
emotional pain if we've let go

44
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:13,440
enough so to meditate to assume a

45
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:20,039
posture that supports you to let go

46
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:29,720
deeply is there a posture for you where you can be present not fall

47
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:36,680
fall asleep but also let

48
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,360
go into this

49
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:53,520
moment gently closing the

50
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:05,199
eyes and immediately letting go whatever you

51
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:14,840
can and in the letting go let go into the body

52
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:30,199
breathing if anything is activated let go relax

53
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,639
settle into the body

54
00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:01,240
breathing in order to gently

55
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:10,039
brush aside your stories your

56
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,280
preoccupations gently take deeper breaths and deeper

57
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:26,440
longer exhales as if it's

58
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:36,400
sweeping whatever is extra away blowing it

59
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:50,840
away and settling into your body here as you exhale

60
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:17,440
long exhale quieting the mind as you do so

61
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,640
letting the breathing return to

62
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,680
normal and taking a few moments to

63
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:58,519
definitively feel sense that you are here in this body at this time

64
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:19,760
and in this definitive feeling of being here when as you

65
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:29,120
exhale settle into it as you let your thinking Drift Away

66
00:09:51,839 --> 00:10:00,240
and things like wanting and not wanting searching expecting trying to

67
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:07,320
fix searching for answers being caught in

68
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:17,279
stories all those come with a certain degree of tension pressure

69
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,279
stress

70
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:29,240
agitation maybe you can't have them stop

71
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:37,200
but as you exhale let there be a quieting of

72
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:44,880
them and a shifting of your life center from the

73
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,480
stories from the

74
00:10:53,959 --> 00:11:01,240
wanting to this body breathing here

75
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
for

76
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
e

77
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,160
e for

78
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:23,760
rather than wanting something or trying to make something

79
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:31,079
happen rather than doing meditation

80
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:38,120
shift your way of being to

81
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,720
allowing allowing something to

82
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:51,399
arise if you feel calm allow that

83
00:13:51,639 --> 00:14:00,000
to [Music] grow if you feel

84
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,519
content or happy allow that to

85
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:13,720
surface allow it to be there the feelings of

86
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:30,839
it and if there's any way that's somehow inside

87
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:37,279
you have a yes to being present

88
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:45,040
aware here now allow that

89
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:48,639
yes

90
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,000
hello the present moment

91
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,440
to flow into your

92
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:18,959
being maybe like an underwater spring that flows water into the lake

93
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:24,360
from the lake Bottom

94
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:33,120
allow whatever goodness whatever

95
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:40,279
wholesomeness that can Surface once you let

96
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
go

97
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
for

98
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

99
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

100
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

101
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

102
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,760
e for

103
00:19:52,760 --> 00:20:01,158
any sense of goodness well-being that you might be

104
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:09,520
feeling that is not there for a reason it just is because there's space

105
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:18,000
and room and quiet for the humming of the body to show

106
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,559
itself for the humming of a subtle

107
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:31,559
attentive aware body and

108
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:38,600
mind allow that humming allow that

109
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:46,880
well-being to spread through your body to spread through your

110
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,960
heart to spread through your

111
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
mind

112
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

113
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
for

114
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

115
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

116
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440

e e

119
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:15,640
and then as we come to the end of this meditation whatever benefits that you

120
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:22,760
receive from meditation whatever way that you are calmer

121
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:27,320
happier more at ease

122
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,200
don't leave it just for something to do in

123
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:43,080
meditation it can grow for you if you consider how you can you how you can

124
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:52,158
bring it with you or have it as a reference point for how you interact with people

125
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:58,640
today if there was a very non-threatening way to meet someone

126
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,640
in the current state that you are

127
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:09,720
in what do we like to be

128
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:18,559
with talk with someone that you'll see

129
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:25,960
today if you were the way you are at the end of meditation

130
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:38,760
is there some way that it's beneficial for you to be this

131
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:45,120
way in the conversation in the encounter is there's something you can

132
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,559
offer the other person offer them a calm

133
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:58,360
space offer them greater Goodwill gaze upon them with whatever

134
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,519
well-being that's

135
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:08,840
present and in this way we begin bringing the benefits of practice into

136
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:17,279
the world while at the same time those benefits can grow for us benefit

137
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:26,760
us may it be that whatever happiness we

138
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:34,679
experience may we we wish happiness for others may it be that whatever safety

139
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:41,240
that we feel that we support the safety of

140
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:51,960
others whatever peace that we experience let that be a gift we give

141
00:28:52,799 --> 00:29:00,039
others and whatever Freedom letting go we have of attachments and claim

142
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:09,559
let's appreciate meeting others without those attachments without our

143
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:18,799
clinging may all beings be happy may all beings be

144
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:24,519
safe may all beings be

145
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:30,039
peaceful may all beings be free

146
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,360
thank

147
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,039
you

148
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,960
e e

149
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:25,518
it seems I have to push a button over at the control station I'll be right

150
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:30,919
back e

151
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:24,080
so hello and welcome to this fourth of four talks

152
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:32,200
on the truths of happiness and maybe it's a bit bold to put those two words

153
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:38,919
together the four truths of happiness but uh I

154
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:46,000
hopefully allowed to do it uh as a continuation or building on the central

155
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,320
Buddhist teaching on the four noble truths of suffering suffering the cause of

156
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:58,960
suffering the end of suffering and the path of practice leading to end of suffering

157
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:06,639
and so the path of path leading to end of suffering doesn't just lead us to an end

158
00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:14,760
a dead end a you know it just uh it leads us to

159
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:21,000
happiness and U the Buddha was said to be the happy one the people who practice

160
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,399
with him were uh noted for being happy and

161
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:33,080
smiling and um and happiness and peace is probably the most common emotional

162
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:39,559
characteristic of someone who's attained Awakening in this early this Buddhist

163
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:44,639
tradition and so what can we say about happiness and so I've offer these things

164
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:50,600
that as a compliment to the four noble truths uh of suffering and as a four I

165
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:58,639
don't want to call it Noble but the four truths of of happiness and um and uh

166
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:04,840
so there there is happiness that we can Avail ourselves of the first truth the

167
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:12,520
second is there are the conditions for the arising of it uh we don't cause it but we allow

168
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:18,638
certain conditions to bring it about and uh there's a truth that's

169
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:23,960
second and the third is maintain it the truth of maintaining it it's not the

170
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:30,358
truth of the end of happiness but the truth of sustaining it keeping it going

171
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:37,398
the Buddha emphasized uh in very kind of uh emphatic

172
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:43,200
statements of maintaining sustaining increasing developing

173
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:48,398
growing um wholesome qualities and wholesome qualities and well-being

174
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:55,638
happiness are closely connected and then the fourth is

175
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:01,680
um uh there is just like there's a a path of practice to the end of

176
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:09,359
suffering there's a letting go that uh

177
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:15,040
leads to the practices of happiness or say it differently there is

178
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:20,400
a letting go that surfaces that gives

179
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:27,760
birth to the ways of being that promote happiness and what I mean by this is

180
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,760
that both in both these the fourth of the Four Noble Truths the fourth of these four

181
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:42,000
happinesses are explained as the Eightfold Path Right View right resolve

182
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,760
right speech right action right lifestyle right effort right mindfulness

183
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:55,520
right concentration and um and in the ancient text there are two ways that these are

184
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:02,119
discussed one is as practices that lead to the end of suffering but the other

185
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:07,960
way they T they presented is that these are way not I don't know if we still

186
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:15,400
want to call them practices but these are ways of being that arise for us um

187
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:20,960
as we let go of clinging as we let go of our craving rather than something we

188
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:27,760
intentionally do it uh the ancient description is they become us we become

189
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,920
endowed with them we become filled with them they become who we are rather than

190
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:39,520
what we do so we we are we see the way we see is

191
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:45,160
we see we don't have to practice seeing this particular way we

192
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:52,520
see uh Right View we see in that way they just a natural outcome just like if

193
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:57,760
you um if you

194
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:03,920
I don't know if you someone tells you thatone points out to you that um

195
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:10,319
something that you haven't noticed yet about anything then after you've not after that pointed out you can never not

196
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:16,000
see it so it's now it's built into who you are that of course you'll see it that you'll see

197
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,079
it so um there is right uh

198
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:28,079
resolve of course you're not going to be cruel of course you're not going to be unkind

199
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:34,800
of course you'll be kind and compassionate that just arises out of his deep state of letting go so you

200
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:42,720
become compassion you that you don't practice compassion you become free of Cruelty you don't practice being free of

201
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,839
Cru being without cruelty right speech becomes a

202
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:53,440
description of who you are not a prescription it isn't that you have to this now I have to do this this

203
00:37:53,440 --> 00:38:01,200
describes what how you speak so all of these then become descriptive rather than

204
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:06,560
prescriptive and so there is a letting so the the and um and this is the

205
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:11,800
welling up the rising of

206
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:16,839
well-being and um

207
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:24,599
so uh there is this deep letting go there is this Freedom that allows something that's deep within us to

208
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:30,760
manifest as a different kind of happiness than ordinary happiness in daily

209
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:37,680
life ordinary happiness is dependent is conditioned things have to come together

210
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:44,480
in the right way we have to win the lottery we have to have the right date the right experience we have to uh get

211
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:50,880
something that brings us a lot of pleasure we have to get praise or we have to feel that we're doing something

212
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,640
good in the world it's always there's a reason for it and some of those forms of

213
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:03,760
Happiness nothing nothing inherently wrong with them some of them involve craving and can produce a lot of

214
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:09,079
suffering but there's a whole other way of being happy that comes with a very

215
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:15,520
deep Letting Go letting go that doesn't leave us with

216
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:21,760
nothing a deep letting go of craving of clinging that doesn't leave us to be a

217
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:28,880
blank slate a big blank but a makes room for

218
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:34,160
this big yes this warmth this hum of yes

219
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:40,000
this hum of goodness of well-being that is portable we can take

220
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:47,240
it with us it lives within us as who we are and maybe we don't always feel it

221
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:55,400
for sure but it's available if we stop it's available if we slow down it's

222
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:01,000
available if we let go it's available if we just turn our attention to it here

223
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:08,800
there is a yes there's a delight there's a a pleasure of Simply being here

224
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:14,720
present alive to be alive without any hindrances

225
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:21,760
to be alive without any clinging to be alive without any resistance allows for

226
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,960
a kind of natural harmonious functioning of all the functions of our

227
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:34,200
life all the the the inner faculties that we

228
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:40,319
have and there's something remarkable that can arise when everything is in

229
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:45,440
Harmony from all the Letting Go all the ways we limit ourselves shut ourselves

230
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:54,000
down resist ourselves uh get caught in something to not be caught and let the homeostasis

231
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,720
let the heal the natural healing occur the natur natural opening occurring when

232
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:08,800
everything is in in us has a c not everything but when there's a certain kind of Inner Harmony inner allowance of

233
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:15,920
this goodness to flow from deep within then there is a

234
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:22,440
happiness which doesn't depend on anything in the world then there's a well-being and a

235
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:29,400
peace that's a parad that's a paradigm shift it's a revolution AR change it's a

236
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:35,079
radical different way of living our lives than the way that most people live

237
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:40,520
and what Society tells us to live and how it wants us to live it we then

238
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:47,839
become um uh centered um oriented around a different

239
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:55,960
way of being in the world than what advertisers want us to do politicians wants us to do that uh we

240
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:01,280
become the um settled peaceful and

241
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:08,760
something beautiful flows out of us

242
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:13,880
a furnace

243
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:19,200
that's warm and producing heat does not

244
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:24,040
need a little space heater next to it to make it

245
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:32,800
warm when you're firm Fess of Love fness Of Happiness well-being of peace is

246
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:40,720
strong enough in you you don't need small space heers of praise and

247
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:46,720
blame success and failure pleasures and avoiding

248
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:53,039
displeasures you don't need the world to provide

249
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:59,119
you because you're radiating something

250
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:05,960
beautiful so I hope that uh this has given you something to

251
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:11,800
consider something maybe to challenge you with but more important than that

252
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:19,480
something that you will experiment with something that you'll now go into the world live your day with this question

253
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:28,280
with this exploration this kind of feeling centering on yourself where is that happiness

254
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:34,000
where does it arise from what are the conditions that allow it to

255
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:41,599
arise if um I let

256
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:47,680
go if I Center myself on it where's the happiness that's not

257
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:55,760
dependent on the world and can I trust

258
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:00,400
