1
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:17,359
so welcome again Welcome all of you I'm happy to be back with you again

2
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:24,640
sharing the dharma with all of you It uh just warms my heart to see um many

3
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:33,280
familiar names um uh over here on the uh chat and um and also just uh being aware

4
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:41,079
of how far and wide this um online sa extends Um it's very moving to

5
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:47,239
me Um so the focus this week will be on the various aspects of mindful

6
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:54,079
thinking Before we begin the meditation I want to share a few thoughts about

7
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:00,239
thinking You most of us like feeling calm and not having a lot of thoughts

8
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:06,119
running around the mind And because of that it's easy to judge thinking in

9
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:12,720
meditation as being undesirable But we all think it's

10
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,759
important not to place thinking outside of the meditation process

11
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,200
But what we want to do is encourage thoughts that are helpful to us and

12
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:30,840
discourage thoughts that are harmful to us Thinking can be a wonderful tool in

13
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,280
meditation We use thoughts to bring us back when we're distracted to remind us to relax the

14
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,920
body when we're tense to encourage ourselves to recognize the hindrances

15
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:51,560
when they arise We might use thoughts to guide ourselves to look deeper to explore to

16
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:59,759
investigate or just encourage ourselves to persevere But thinking like many tools

17
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:07,720
can also be used unskillfully such as habitually judging ourselves and others getting lost in

18
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:13,000
regrets in useless planning in worry in

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,720
rehearsing or judging or indulging in fantasies while

20
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:27,599
meditating But we can let thoughts be We don't need to get rid of them We just

21
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:33,040
don't need to pick them up and get lost in them When we're mindful of them

22
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:41,560
friendly with them we can let them come and go So let's sit

23
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:58,200
So take a comfortable but alert posture and gently close your eyes

24
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:08,599
Taking a few deep breaths And with each

25
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:15,920
exhale settling into the body relaxing any obvious tension or

26
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,920
holding

27
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:48,239
allowing the breath to return to [Music] normal You might get a global sense of

28
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:55,120
the body allowing the attention to meander freely throughout

29
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,719
the body relaxing any obvious tensions

30
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,680
And staying close to the body intimate with the body

31
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:40,160
sensations you can begin to notice the movements of the

32
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:49,160
breath allowing your attention to rest on the breath

33
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,199
Settling into the rhythm of the breath However it

34
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:06,919
is resting in this body in this breath

35
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:43,199
You might consider the mind as having a foreground and

36
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:49,479
background Placing the breath the body and the

37
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:55,880
foreground As long as thoughts remain in the background we can let them be

38
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:02,880
there They're not a problem Staying intimate with the body

39
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:10,080
breathing in and out We can allow everything else to be in the

40
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:18,360
background There's room for everything Nothing needs to be pushed away

41
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,800
We can be like a mountain rooted in this

42
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,039
body still

43
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:39,479
strong here The mind might wander

44
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:44,680
away but you can easily return and feel yourself

45
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:50,880
here rooted in this body in the

46
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:59,000
present And when thoughts arise they're just like clouds floating past the

47
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
mountain The mountain doesn't chase them It doesn't judge

48
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,440
them It doesn't try to hold on to them

49
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:49,479
thoughts can come in words in fragments of

50
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:55,800
sentences even whole sentences in

51
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:02,319
images stories or even just knowing

52
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,879
However thoughts are be alert to any strong pull or

53
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,400
compulsion that comes from

54
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:22,840
them If the thinking becomes prominent and it's in the foreground we can bring mindfulness to

55
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:31,319
it A kind curiosity an affectionate curiosity

56
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,680
How does it feel to be

57
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,560
thinking what's the tone of our inner

58
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:50,040
voice is it relaxed is it harsh

59
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:55,519
gentle if the tone is not friendly in any way see if you can encourage a

60
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,079
kinder attitude

61
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:17,920
How does it feel in the body to be thinking do we feel it anywhere in

62
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:29,120
particular if there's a lot of thinking sometimes we might feel like bees are buzzing in our heads

63
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,200
Is there location that seems to generate

64
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:42,160
it is there extra tension associated with

65
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:48,600
thinking can we relax into it

66
00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:00,600
and if thoughts are no longer prominent just allow them to fade away

67
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:31,000
And if thoughts are very charged is there an emotion

68
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,120
underneath some form of aversion or anger or

69
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,320
fear or wanting or desire

70
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,519
if so you might shift the attention to see how those feel in the

71
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:57,200
body We can come out of the story and into the

72
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:12,560
body But if nothing is prominent you can allow the awareness to rest in the body

73
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:18,240
on the breath with an attitude of

74
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:25,640
friendliness Simply allowing any thoughts to come and go

75
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:43,120
If the mind has drifted gently bring it back to the

76
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:50,080
present moment to this breath to this body

77
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,960
to home

78
00:29:49,240 --> 00:30:28,920
[Music]

79
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:41,000
my um first several years of meditation

80
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,799
practice even though I understood the basic teachings of mindfulness I'd even

81
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:52,000
set a few retreats it took me several years before I began to understand the

82
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:59,679
importance of being mindful of thinking Um there's a quote that paraphrases and

83
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:04,880
simplifies one of the Buddhist teachings With our thoughts we create

84
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:12,720
the world And all of us have experienced both wonderful worlds in our minds and

85
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:19,360
we've all had very painful word worlds in our minds Each one generated by our

86
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:24,720
thoughts And so even though I knew better I had a

87
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:30,840
really strong bias that meditation meant not thinking I could relate to the

88
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:36,240
breath Emotions seemed very rich Um even

89
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:41,640
mind states and moods but thinking seemed inferior to

90
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:48,080
me Uh but as my practice developed I began to realize wait a second thinking

91
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:53,200
is everywhere in my life it just permeates every day of my life Uh and

92
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:59,679
that this was really a natural human activity and we want to know life as it

93
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:07,200
is not as we want it to be And I began to learn to respect and eventually to

94
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:14,880
appreciate thinking in a very different way Um but the first thing we need to do

95
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:23,200
to befriend our thinking to is to get to know it to really um uh get close to it

96
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:29,760
not rejected Um you don't get to know anything you reject

97
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:35,600
Uh so the kinds of thinking we have come vary very very widely from the more

98
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:41,039
extensive thinking we use in daily life to the subtle thinking that arises that

99
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:48,000
might arise in the calm mind in meditation Um I'll start out with a

100
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,399
grosser more um uh coarser thinking Um

101
00:32:54,399 --> 00:33:02,320
in daily life there are two kinds of thinking that easily can easily dominate the mind and that's discursive thinking

102
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:08,799
and focused thinking Now discursive thinking

103
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:15,440
um is a diffuse thinking without purpose When the mind just jumps from

104
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:22,320
one thing to another it might seem to meander gently or just jump radically Um

105
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:28,399
it's a very kind of um common kind of thinking in daily life Uh which also

106
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:34,480
shows up in meditation practice We often refer to it as the monkey mind where the

107
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:40,720
monkey just jumps from one branch to another one thought leaping to another

108
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:47,880
and often ending up miles away from where we started

109
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:55,200
Um focus thinking on the other hand is purposely focusing on a specific problem

110
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,720
uh a task or an idea I mean we use focused thinking in in paying attention

111
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,320
to the breath or directing the body um

112
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:13,520
directing muscles to relax in a systematic way We're focusing on it Um

113
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:19,358
in daily life you know we might be solving a problem decision making

114
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:24,878
um analyzing something studying learning anything

115
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:31,158
Uh for instance we might think should I sign up for a particular class uh should I go on this

116
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:37,398
trip or we might be considering um dharma ideas You know what does the Buddha say about

117
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:43,280
karma um or maybe we just figure out how to do something You know how do I fix my

118
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:49,240
car um but both discursive and focused

119
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:55,878
thinking can be done in a wholesome or helpful way or in an unhelpful

120
00:34:55,879 --> 00:35:00,960
way With discursive thinking we can spend quite a bit of time dwelling on

121
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:06,160
what's wrong with our lives uh with ourselves with the world with other

122
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:13,440
people allowing the mind to jump from one thing to another compulsively worrying or

123
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:19,000
needless planning rehearsing

124
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:25,000
judging Sometimes we call this type of unhelpful discursive thought

125
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:32,040
rumination kind of a repetitive prolonged negative thinking about ourselves or

126
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:39,520
feelings past experiences that were upsetting over and over again trying to

127
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:47,200
solve something that can't be solved by thinking We can repeat a particular

128
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:53,480
theme and frequent rumination year after year

129
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:59,760
Rumination tends to add to our suffering It adds to negative moods It makes us

130
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:06,320
less effective in our lives And it doesn't resolve by

131
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:14,880
ruminating But discursive thought can also be quite wholesome It can let the mind meander in

132
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:21,520
a relaxed enjoyable way You know maybe daydreaming It can be an easy

133
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:27,440
subconscious mode that can foster creativity and actually helps integrate

134
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:34,000
our thinking Um many of us have had the experience of trying to solve a problem

135
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:42,480
you know using our focus thought and getting stuck you know just just stuck and going

136
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:48,079
for a walk and letting the mind just meander in a relaxed way And when we're

137
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:55,359
turning from the walk the solution shows up easily So it's this subconscious mode

138
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,799
that where the mind's at

139
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:08,119
ease And we can do the same thing with focus thinking We can do it in a way that's

140
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:14,680
relaxed and at ease or doing it in a way that's quite tense

141
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:20,079
Um for instance I used to write short stories and it was something I did that

142
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:25,440
was very relaxed and enjoyable I find myself wrapped with interest you know

143
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,880
many times the smile on my face But it took me years of mindfulness

144
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:40,160
practice to be able to do my taxes with a relaxed body and even an occasional

145
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:46,440
smile Um in meditation discursive thinking is usually not

146
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:53,760
helpful So we train the mind to prioritize the body sensations over the countless stories

147
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:59,200
the monkey mind can generate Discursive thinking in

148
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:06,200
meditation can be very very seductive Maybe some of you had a little bit of that today I don't

149
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:12,000
know It can be a form of entertainment You know some of the fantasies we go to

150
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,079
can be very very enjoyable Um gosh I've written books in

151
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:25,320
in in the middle of a retreat sometimes you know got so seduced by by a good

152
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:30,720
story Um but we can also get just as easily distracted with unpleasant

153
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:36,160
versions of discursive thinking with ruminating about worries about our lives

154
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,880
fears of the future regrets of the

155
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:48,560
past So the idea isn't to eliminate it in eliminate these kind of um coarser

156
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:53,760
types of thoughts uh but to do them in a wholesome way in a wholesome envir

157
00:38:53,760 --> 00:39:00,480
mental environment Another kind of thinking that occurs in

158
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:08,160
both daily life and meditation is what can be called functional or practical thinking or I

159
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:15,480
like to call it present moment thinking Um in daily life for instance

160
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:22,079
um uh let's say we're cooking um we're cooking dinner you know and um the

161
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:28,800
thought the thought obviously enters you know well let's see what do I do next I need a lemon next I need to stir the

162
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:36,119
vegetables I need to set the timer um so whether or not those thoughts are

163
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:42,640
wholesome depends on the mood of the mind depends on the environment ment of

164
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:47,920
the mind We might be cooking in a rush and be very tense and worried about time

165
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:53,599
Where's that lemon um you know oh I want to stir you know it can be very

166
00:39:53,599 --> 00:40:00,960
different quality to these thoughts Or we can be very very relaxed enjoying the process you know enjoying

167
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:08,079
the smell of the lemon um stirring those beautiful looking vegetables appreciating the fact that we

168
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:15,440
have a timer to set Um now in meditation functional thinking

169
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,720
might look like "Oh my knee hurts I'll shift my attention to it Pay more

170
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:26,000
careful attention." Or maybe um "My shoulders

171
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:33,119
are above my ears I'll relax them." Uh some of us have a narrator

172
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:38,560
that lives in the background It comments on the moment Oh that was a smooth

173
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:45,119
breath what's a little bit warm Now dysfunctional thinking about

174
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:51,960
the present moment can also be wholesome or it can trigger unhelpful

175
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:58,720
reactions Again depending on the environment of the mind In a tense mind we might get

176
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:07,040
reactive to the knee pain instead of uh exploring it with a curious curiosity an

177
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:12,960
affectionate curiosity What is this what's this pain like

178
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:20,319
uh or we might add judgment if her breath isn't to her liking or that was that breath was way too short and it was

179
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:26,400
a little rough and and it should be different and you know uh so this this

180
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:32,319
present moment thinking can be wholesome or unh

181
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:38,800
wholesome And the subtler form of thinking that occurs

182
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:46,720
um in meditation and and in daily life is the knowing and recognition that's

183
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:53,799
part of the realm of insight practice part of vaposa

184
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,119
One of the principles of mindfulness or vaposa practice is that we shift the

185
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:07,000
attention from focusing on the content of our thoughts to the process of

186
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:13,040
thinking to the activity of thinking to exploring what the

187
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:20,680
experience of thinking is actually like for us Knowing and recognition can be

188
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:26,960
wordless or it can be accompanied by brief thoughts For instance if you turn on the

189
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:32,880
light in a dark room suddenly you see all the objects of the room You recognize them You know they're there

190
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:40,960
You don't have to figure it out Oh let's see What is that um oh yeah it's got four legs It's it's a desk you know We

191
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,640
don't have to do that It just shows up We recognize it

192
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:52,880
So if during meditation we recognize that we're worrying about one thing after another we can shift the attention

193
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:59,680
to the body to any tens tensions in the body Maybe the forehead's contracted or

194
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:06,800
the shoulders are tight or the belly is contracted or we're holding our breath

195
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:14,079
So we we know those sensations Recognition is essential for

196
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:19,760
seeing the hindrances to meditation When aversion or desire take

197
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:25,960
us away from the moment when we're caught in afflictive emotional

198
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:32,160
patterns the pasta means seeing clearly This simple recognition of

199
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:39,400
what's present however it is whatever it is

200
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:49,119
When the discursive thinking is calmed we enter the world of knowing and

201
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:57,480
recognition We might recognize the different objects of mind that show up and many many physical

202
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:04,920
sensations that come and go the emotions that come and go the attitudes that show

203
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:11,920
up And we can choose to shift from the stories of the discursive mind in favor

204
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:20,400
of what we feel In short we drop the story and find

205
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:26,720
the feeling So um later in the week I'll

206
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:32,240
talk a little bit about reflective thinking Um a deeper kind of thinking

207
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,760
that can arise from the silence

208
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:44,920
So as you go through your day today you might periodically give some attention to how you're

209
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:50,720
thinking You might notice if you're thinking in a relaxed easy way or if the

210
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:58,800
thinking feels contracted or tense And if it does see if you can bring a kind attitude towards it

211
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:04,119
relaxing into it without rejecting it

212
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:09,720
So thank you for listening I'm looking forward to continuing

213
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,960
tomorrow Thank you
