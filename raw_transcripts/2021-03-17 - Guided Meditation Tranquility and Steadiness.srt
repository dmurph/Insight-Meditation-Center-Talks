1
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:13,840
so good day greetings and uh happy sitting here seeing the greetings

2
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:20,400
on the chat and the names and so thank you all

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:28,840
and so the topic is still

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:36,320
samadhi and i like to sometimes translate this word as to be composed

5
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:44,239
and that's a wonderful i think concept that brings together some of the qualities of samadhi of

6
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:51,680
landing on some place being established being calm and

7
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,320
centered being steady with the experience that we're focusing

8
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,878
on if um we go i've gone into the wilderness like up in the mountains

9
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,240
where there was no trails but there were cairns there were these little piles of stones that people had

10
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,840
built that indicated where more or less where the direction was to walk

11
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:23,439
and so we would hike along and we would look for the cairns and uh and then we'd find our way

12
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:30,960
but if we hadn't looked you know if i hadn't known about karen's and also just was fascinated by everything up there and

13
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:38,880
and um and was looking at everything equally i wouldn't have found uh you know the way forward if i was

14
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,640
if i was really scared about running into trolls up in the high sierras in california

15
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:52,000
um and was constantly looking out for trolls i also wouldn't have found my way because i wouldn't have seen the cairns

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,920
even if i knew there to look for them but if we know to look for karen's then we know how to find the way so the same

17
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,840
thing with meditation we can be afraid of trolls and spend our time looking for trolls we can be

18
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,920
um searching for long-lost treasures in the world lottery

19
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,959
tickets and we don't really pay attention to what's really here

20
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,840
and but there are karen's there are these markers these signposts that for samadhi it's helpful

21
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,400
to recognize them and in recognizing them that's how we find our way

22
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:39,280
and and there's many signposts but i would like to emphasize two of

23
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,319
them now one is um a

24
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:50,879
to be steady a certain kind of steady composure with the experience and if when we're

25
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,480
steady when we hold ourselves steady when the the gaze is steady when the

26
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:03,200
when the our composure is steady when our attention is steady

27
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,879
or that part of our attention is steady so we're looking for that part of our attention that

28
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:16,879
is steady or can be steady and we're steadying ourselves in that the other is

29
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:24,560
a quietude a tranquility maybe it's a a a serenity

30
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,879
and um and even if we're agitated we might be able to just pick

31
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:40,319
out the corners of the mind the heart the body where there is some tranquility uh some quietude

32
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,360
and uh and then to include that to kind of orient ourselves oh this is the place

33
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,680
this is the way forward here in this part and um and but if we don't recognize that

34
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,599
quietude that tranquility then we don't uh we know we don't see the signposts

35
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:04,319
and the third is um to so composure quietude tranquilly and

36
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:10,640
third is non-destructibility a kind of a non-dispersal of the mind non-uh

37
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,160
distractedness of the mind and even if we're you know 99 distracted

38
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,680
uh we might kind of pick up uh the signpost of that way in which the mind

39
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,440
is not distracted is not dispersed not spinning out and centrifugal force so kind of just

40
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,280
scattered and all kinds of thoughts and ideas and as the as samadhi begins becoming stronger

41
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:40,240
there's a stronger and stronger feeling of the mind not being dispersed not being scattered not jumping around not being

42
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,680
fragmented the mind starts feeling composed quiet

43
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,280
centered and it is just a feeling like the mind is really here now it's

44
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:58,560
not just non-distracted or non-dispersed kind of feeling and

45
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,880
and and so

46
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:12,479
so these are three signposts that we can follow so to take an upright

47
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:19,039
meditation posture and if you're lying down then upright means

48
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:29,360
laying with a certain dignity and vitality or openness some way that

49
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,039
maybe expresses

50
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:41,600
an integrity or a wholeness or confidence in being here

51
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,120
and gently closing your eyes

52
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,319
and being a little bit delightfully serious at the beginning of a meditation

53
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:03,280
to prepare yourself to so that you can really be here and the sacredness of the present

54
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:10,639
moment so you're preparing yourself and so you take a few long slow deep

55
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:17,120
breaths and the deep inhale is a

56
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:24,880
for affirmation that indeed you are here that you've showed up

57
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:31,919
here i am i'm showing up for this deep breath filling the torso with

58
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:39,280
not just air but with sensations and expansion and maybe even

59
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,680
confidence here i am

60
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:54,240
and then to exhale along gentle exhale letting all of that go

61
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:03,840
letting go of it tension and holding and

62
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:16,880
and then letting your breathing return to normal and we prepare the mind and the heart by

63
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:23,599
relaxing the body all these are very closely connected

64
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:31,840
so relaxing the muscles of the face

65
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:45,759
around the eyes the jaw

66
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:51,120
and to soften and release the shoulders

67
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,840
the area around the shoulder blades perhaps

68
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:09,280
perhaps the outer edge of your shoulders as the shoulders turn around to go down the arm

69
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:16,639
the very top of the upper arms

70
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:27,840
perhaps relaxing the chest softening in the chest

71
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:41,839
and then relaxing the belly in such a way the belly the weight of the belly

72
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,680
gets lower

73
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:55,839
settles into a foundation the lower torso

74
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:31,279
and then with your attention your mind gently

75
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:38,160
placing it on your breathing wherever you're going

76
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:46,720
to be primarily focusing on breathing imagine that attention is gently placed

77
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,839
on that area

78
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,720
but clearly kind of settling into your breathing

79
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:19,839
again affirmation that here is where you're going to walk here's where you're going to be present

80
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:29,920
if you can make some small adjustments in your breathing to make it more comfortable

81
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,440
relaxing some part of the musculature breathing

82
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:47,839
breathing a little slower a little faster a little deeper or shallower

83
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,839
whatever makes it comfortable for you

84
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,240
and adjusting how you are with your attention

85
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:14,720
is there some way that your attention can be less forceful or strained

86
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:21,600
less up in the control tower trying to stare at the breathing

87
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:29,839
and more that the attention the awareness is within the breathing itself

88
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:43,839
in the sensations of breathing

89
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,680
and then noticing whatever's quietude or tranquility there might be

90
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:02,639
here even if it's in the cracks between any agitation

91
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:11,120
or in the side or deeper inside

92
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,480
that's right letting them thinking mind become quieter

93
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,839
slower maybe the thinking mind can even be more

94
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:30,320
gentle so it's easier to notice the quietude

95
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,279
the tranquility

96
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:43,279
that and let that tranquility be part of the

97
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:48,160
atmosphere within which

98
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,839
you're mindful of your breathing

99
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,639
and notice whatever degree of

100
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,720
stability or steadiness

101
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
you can establish with your breathing

102
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:35,839
whatever steadiness on breathing that's here for you

103
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:57,800
and then also notice any way that you are

104
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:03,120
non-distracted the mind is not scattering out into all kinds of

105
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,320
thoughts and even if you are doing that look for

106
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,800
the signposts look for that part of you which is not that way

107
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:21,040
that's capable of being undistracted

108
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:31,839
with your breathing

109
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,399
relaxed calm

110
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:49,600
steady undistracted

111
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,000
these are the signposts

112
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,880
that point you to samadhi to staying present

113
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:07,839
to being intimate with the experience of breathing

114
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:13,839
one breath at a time

115
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:17,440
when you notice yourself thinking a lot look for the quiet and tranquility here

116
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:23,919
let that tranquility of mind spread

117
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:31,360
open up further so it's easier to stay with your

118
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,840
breathing

119
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:35,840
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

120
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:43,039
you could begin by remembering that we're still meditating

121
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:54,080
there's nothing you have to say to anyone or do for anyone for this few next two minutes

122
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:04,158
there's no responsibility and obligation to for to do anything but sit here quietly

123
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:11,039
and in the privacy of just sitting here with nothing you have to do

124
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:18,240
can you somehow let the your heart open

125
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,000
your kindness open

126
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:31,279
to think of people around you and here on this youtube

127
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:37,279
sitting together or in your homes or communities places of

128
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:44,399
work think of them with

129
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:51,440
good will very private goodwill they don't have to

130
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,240
know about it you don't have to do anything

131
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:03,760
just opening your kindness goodwill

132
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,840
in a sense

133
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,880
being aware of these people around you

134
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:27,840
within the quietude the tranquility that might be here

135
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:36,000
and without needing to bring them into your bring too close to you

136
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:44,159
just there in the privacy of your own heart

137
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:49,360
perhaps you can feel or sense or extend

138
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:54,720
the sentiments of these words

139
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,720
may you be happy

140
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:09,840
may you be safe

141
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,360
may you be peaceful

142
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,720
may you be free

143
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:38,880
and if in the safety and privacy of meditation

144
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:45,919
in your own heart if it's possible easier than to have

145
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,960
good will for others

146
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:57,360
stay close to that maybe you don't have to confuse it with

147
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,640
what you actually do

148
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:07,760
or feel obligated to do stay close to that place where it's private

149
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:15,360
maybe even secret trusting

150
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:25,200
that having good will for others will some way or other spread from you

151
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,720
with benefits for the world

152
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,840
may whatever benefits that come from this practice this morning

153
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:43,200
spread from us like the scent of a rose spreads out

154
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:50,480
into the garden so may this benefits that we've had today

155
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:59,519
laughed out into the world for the welfare and happiness of all beings everywhere may all beings

156
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:15,840
be happy

157
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,360
um
