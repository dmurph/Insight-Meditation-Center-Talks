1
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:17,000
welcome and welcome to your meditation during this guided meditation

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,240
time one of the strong associations I believe with mindfulness

3
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:31,360
meditation and often how I teach is that mindfulness is a

4
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:38,160
non-reactive awareness that doesn't add anything to the experience just is

5
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,600
present for our experience as it is and that when we practice that way

6
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:51,480
then we're not allowed to um change anything we're not allowed

7
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:58,600
to think about anything um something like

8
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:04,080
that but in in fact this mindfulness

9
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,560
practice as a Buddhist practice uh sometimes it's useful to

10
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:15,640
think of it as a strategy and we're using the best

11
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:22,479
strategy we have we we know of to become free to become

12
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:29,119
liberated and sometimes we practice non-reactive awareness and that's really you know a

13
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:35,759
really value Val invaluable sometimes we practice not

14
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,880
adding anything or projecting anything onto experience no

15
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:49,600
stories but sometimes we do sometimes it's strategic it's useful to change our experience

16
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:56,039
sometimes it's useful to have stories that we tell ourselves sometimes it's useful to

17
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:01,560
interpret our experience in ways that support the the strategy of being able

18
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,680
to be here present alive and be

19
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:12,959
free so this week we're doing I'm talking about wise

20
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,800
thinking and often I believe for many human

21
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,640
beings uh thinking goes unexamined unconsidered we just think

22
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,120
what we think and we might be troubled by it we might uh be in involved in it

23
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:36,319
it just kind of goes along on its own merry way and we're kind of the participants of it and you know but if

24
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,959
we're living a mindful life in a deliberate life uh we don't just let our

25
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:49,000
thinking go on overdrive go on automatic pilot we can actually engage it in a

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,720
useful way in a strategic way they Buddha said that a watched mind

27
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,280
brings happiness if we don't don't watch your mind and the mind goes an automatic

28
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:11,200
pilot that can often be a recipe for suffering so here we are to wake up to

29
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:18,519
be present to see be wise watch the mind but also to engage the mind in a useful

30
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:26,599
way so in relationship to thinking we can think in ways that support this path

31
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:36,000
we can think in ways that helps us to get helps the Mind get quieter Stiller more focused more non-reactive to our

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,560
experience thinking can be part of our support system for all

33
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:49,599
this and one way that happens is in preparation for really settling into the

34
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:55,959
heart of meditation when we first sit down we could notice how we're thinking

35
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:02,239
we could take some we could think in wiser ways we can

36
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,799
tell stories in wiser ways we can imagine in ways that support

37
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:17,400
us use the imagination so that's what we'll do today and uh and uh in this day this

38
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:26,320
week of uh the wise use of thinking in meditation so to assume a meditation

39
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:36,000
posture and without much other preparation

40
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,120
now gently close your

41
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:56,280
eyes and to whatever ability you have to

42
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,560
imagine or to tell yourself a story

43
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:08,080
imagine that you are sitting in the room or the place where

44
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:15,520
you're sitting to meditate begin a story that

45
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:24,919
says in this story I'm sitting in this room in my meditation

46
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:35,560
posture and then imagine that they tell the story of here you are and you're

47
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:42,638
checking in with yourself imagine that you're a person who's

48
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:51,840
thinking and notice are you thinking thoughts that

49
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,759
you're happy to

50
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,479
have

51
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:11,639
and gently tell yourself the

52
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:18,560
story of yourself sitting here meditating and the way to do that one

53
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,120
way to do it is gently tell yourself give yourself

54
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:32,039
instructions in meditation rather than relying on me to do it guided

55
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:37,919
meditation gently calmly instruct yourself use your

56
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:44,720
thoughts to think thoughts of instruction and we'll do that for a few

57
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,080
minutes

58
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
silently

59
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,479
and if you have a story unconscious sub conscious automatic

60
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:37,360
story of what it's like for you to be practicing what it's like to give yourself

61
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:46,840
instructions what your current circumstances are like and if that story distracts

62
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:57,080
you tell yourself a different story tell yourself the story that of

63
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,319
now here meditating

64
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:20,840
tell yourself the story the experience of what it's like

65
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:27,840
to be in your body breathing maybe narrating it as if

66
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,240
someone's listening to this

67
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
count

68
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
for

69
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,920
as you're sitting here tell the story give the explanation

70
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,920
to yourself of how sitting

71
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,399
meditating can be helpful for you

72
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:59,800
supportive perhaps explaining it to yourself

73
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:09,399
with a voice that's calm supportive kind here let me tell

74
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:15,360
you this is what this meditation is about now this is what I'm trying to

75
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:22,760
do because I care I care about myself I care about you speaking to

76
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:29,760
yourself gently quietly as an alternative to other

77
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:36,199
stories and habitual ways of

78
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
thinking

79
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
e

80
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:43,480
gently give yourself relaxing

81
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:50,240
instruction at the end of the inhale

82
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,399
relax at the end of a thought

83
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
relax

84
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:14,079
let there be a ongoing relaxed clear intentional

85
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:19,720
instruction maybe just with the sing even the single word

86
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
relax

87
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:06,079
e if your mind is easily

88
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:17,639
distracted tell yourself the story of about being

89
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:31,399
distracted tell it to yourself in a quiet calm peace peaceful

90
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:58,800
voice and it as you tell yourself the story of being distracted or starting to

91
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,399
be collected the story of whatever your

92
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:10,959
experience is at the end of each

93
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:17,320
sentence Point yourself to the quiet and Stillness that's

94
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:24,320
here the silence at the end of a

95
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
thought

96
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,639
and when the mind gets distracted

97
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:51,279
again deliberately bring in different thoughts the thoughts about

98
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:56,440
meditating and what you're doing and the goodness of

99
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:05,519
it and let the each of those thoughts point back to the Stillness the

100
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
silence

101
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:04,439
if any thoughts come up that undermine

102
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:14,600
you that somehow are critical or fear producing

103
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:21,160
or any ones that are unpleasant to

104
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:27,040
have substitute them substitute them with

105
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:33,279
deliberate real itic thoughts supportive

106
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,839
thoughts about doing the

107
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:47,759
meditation in a way that points to a quiet

108
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,880
intimacy of breathing

109
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,279
mindfully that does so with a positive

110
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:11,558
regard for yourself for the practice and for whatever your

111
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:14,240
experience

112
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:21,798
is kind regard for all

113
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
things

114
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
for

115
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
for

116
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
e

117
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
for

118
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
e

119
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:12,679
if you find yourself distracted don't simply let go of your

120
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:19,159
distractions offer a reframing of whatever you're thinking

121
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:28,000
about it can be as simple as adding not now this is not the time to

122
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,679
have these thoughts or it's not

123
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:43,840
so or if your distractions are fantasy

124
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,799
imagination reframe your

125
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:57,120
interest to being intimate with reality as it is in the

126
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
present

127
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,960
if the thoughts are

128
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,600
negative reframe those

129
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:30,039
thoughts in such a way that they don't undermine you

130
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:38,440
maybe the simple statement I see

131
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:43,559
you I know you distracted

132
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:53,440
thought it's okay for you to rest and relax because right now I'm

133
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
meditating

134
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
for

135
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
for

136
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:59,880
and consciously you can use a thought that points Beyond

137
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:08,440
thinking the gentle calm thought

138
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:16,360
listen and then listen to The Silence where there is no

139
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,799
thinking the thought feel that points you to

140
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:31,398
feeling not

141
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:59,520
thinking the thought Stillness that point points to

142
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:05,559
whatever non-discursive Stillness there is here in this body

143
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:09,799
or in the space around

144
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
you

145
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,720
and then as we come to the end of the

146
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:38,720
sitting in some way that seems realistic to

147
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:45,279
you tell yourself a

148
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:52,640
positive a story of positive regard for

149
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:59,080
yourself ideas of how how you'd like to support

150
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:07,879
yourself how meditation is helpful how taking this time to

151
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:17,120
meditate even if it was not a good meditation how it was good to do

152
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:34,480
this maybe even having a a small smile on your lips appreciating

153
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:48,720
yourself and then turning your gaze outward into the world and if it's nice for you you can

154
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:55,320
tell brief story of how our lives are so

155
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:04,000
interdependent on the lives and work work and efforts of so many people we benefit immensely from The

156
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:11,360
Unseen labor of people in our neighborhood in

157
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:18,960
our wider communities other countries of the whole

158
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:29,960
world reminding yourself of this story of the amazing supportive Network that

159
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:36,640
brings us our food our clothes our all that we need for our

160
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:50,140
life and then think thoughts of goodwi for all those people who lives support

161
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:57,559
[Music] yours wouldn't it be nice wouldn't it it

162
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:02,559
be wonderful if they could be happy and peaceful and

163
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:09,919
safe wouldn't it be wonderful if you were happy peaceful and

164
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:16,919
safe and so all the networks of interconnection we have all the ways that

165
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:25,760
we share this planet is filled with mutual kind

166
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,799
regard and may we contribute

167
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:37,480
ours may all beings be

168
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:43,720
happy may all beings be

169
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:48,960
safe may all beings be

170
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:55,518
peaceful and may all beings everywhere be

171
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,320
free

172
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:12,159
[Music]

173
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:24,390
thank [Music]

174
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,240
you

175
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:35,039
so continuing on the theme of wise

176
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:42,880
thinking you know in a Buddhist practice all our life is a subject for

177
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:50,760
practice everything that we are about is a worthy object for our mindfulness and

178
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:57,320
attention and that includes the world of thinking and certainly we there's a lot to learn about thinking by being being

179
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:02,559
mindful of it but also it's uh the thinking is such

180
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:08,519
an important activity that uh a necessary activity

181
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:14,000
for our lives that uh we don't have to leave it to chance what we think about

182
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:22,519
we don't have to let the the automatic pilot let us think whatever we think uh we don't have

183
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:27,600
to be the victim of our thoughts

184
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:34,480
and we could think deliberately things such are supportive and helpful we can change the currents that were uh the

185
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:42,639
river of thinking that we're involved in we can introduce new things to have filling our mind and all

186
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:50,480
that this has to be done wisely so it's not just simply uh covering how we are covering

187
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,639
it over and kind of creating a happy scenario so that we don't feel our

188
00:32:55,639 --> 00:33:03,240
sadness or our grief or or anger and pretend that we're kind everything is good and nice that doesn't

189
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:09,600
work but uh we don't have to just kind of go along with whatever our mind gives us in terms of our thinking our

190
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:15,039
distracted thoughts uh we can uh you know we can kind of in in a certain

191
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:20,480
sense be in charge of our thoughts rather than the thoughts be in charge of

192
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:26,080
us and um so one form of thinking that's quite

193
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:32,919
common is the story- making mind we're constructing stories we're constructing

194
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:39,480
scenarios images scenes predictions um if you're planning the

195
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:45,679
future that's a partly a story about what we think is going to happen and how we're going to uh what we're going to

196
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:52,279
say and how we're going to behave in the story if we're remembering the past it's usually a story about something that

197
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:58,559
happened then and there's a narrative behind it some times there's a narrative a

198
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:05,760
framework around which we tell story about our present moment oh this is not going to work out I can't do this uh

199
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:12,398
this is hard this is too hard um or this is uh great I'm wonderful and I want

200
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:19,878
everyone to appreciate me more and more because how wonderful I am there's kind of all this kind of more things going on

201
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:25,000
and those stories can be elaborate in terms of fantasies and creating huge

202
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,358
scenarios and if those stories are

203
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:35,398
are of unfortunate kind of if they're uh

204
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:41,358
hor fear stories if they're angry stories if they're despair stories if

205
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:47,440
they're conceit stories it kind of creates a mood and affects us in

206
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:54,720
profound ways it's kind of like there's mood music that comes along with the stories we tell us and that mood music

207
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:00,800
can depress us or enliven US us can benefit us or close us

208
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:07,359
down and so to uh uh to learn how in

209
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:15,240
just the right way not too much it's almost better to do a little bit too little is to engage in deliberate

210
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:21,960
thought while we meditate to think wisely to recognize what we're thinking

211
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:29,160
about and reframe it so for example a lot of the story making mind one of the

212
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:35,240
characters main characters in the story is ourselves and it uh and sometimes we

213
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:41,359
repeat the same story over and over again the same memory the same repeated kind of telling us the story telling

214
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:48,160
ourselves the conclusion of the story the implications of the story over and over again you know and it and if it's

215
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:54,920
debilitating if it's uh draining us of our kind of energy our life

216
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:02,000
Vitality then it's probably probably not useful to keep telling us ourselves that story repeatedly over and over

217
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,400
again and so to to take in a certain way

218
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:13,640
take responsibility or take control of our own mind our own Thinking by

219
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:18,720
figuring out how to think in a way that's not debilitating think in a

220
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:24,800
different way maybe there's ways of thinking about your distracted thoughts

221
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:31,960
where you tell yourself a different story where you tell yourself it's not like that there's another P

222
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:38,960
perspective sometimes you can tell yourself a a reframing of what you're doing so it could be for example you had

223
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:45,560
something difficult that happened to you and you feel really bad about yourself then to reframe

224
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:51,680
it what could I learn from this how can I be a better person in the future

225
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:57,960
rather than being weighed down by the past let me learn from that what can I learn from that experience

226
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:04,880
so that's being truthful honest you know and direct and real about what happened but it's reframing it in a way so that

227
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:12,280
it does something positive for us we learn something we learn how to be better because of it so that's kind of

228
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:17,480
stepping in and and and whenever something's

229
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:24,760
debilitating try not to participate in the thoughts that we churn out that are

230
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:31,599
debilitating be honest about why we're doing it what we're feeling but is there another way of

231
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:38,920
understanding it another story you can tell ourselves like if you're doing Buddhist practice you can say well

232
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:47,400
instead of kind of ruminating about this story over and over again the the story I have is that now I

233
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:52,560
can bring it into I can bring I can fold this into my practice I have a practice

234
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:59,359
that helps liberate this I have a practice that helps U bring kind kindness or gentleness or Stillness to

235
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:06,040
this I have a practice that Shields me from the impact of these because the

236
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:12,319
stronger the mindfulness is the less the mood music of those stories are going to

237
00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:17,880
penetrate into my heart so telling yourself that story

238
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:24,480
because those can be true stories they can actually call upon positive ways of

239
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:31,880
being and the new story a new framework can be something that brings us a little bit of Joy or happiness or relief or

240
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:39,520
confidence oh it can be a different way so I'm not suggesting we do this all

241
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:46,359
the time but I am suggesting maybe doing doing it when it's the better

242
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:53,440
alternative if we notice that what we're doing is spinning out in our thoughts or pulled into the distractive thoughts or

243
00:38:53,440 --> 00:39:00,680
we've had the same thought the same story you know a thousand times then you probably have something

244
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:06,480
better to do you don't need to do it again and so to step forward with some

245
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:12,480
sense of agency some sense of of uh ability to

246
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,920
change the currents of your life some ability to of controlling yourself being

247
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:25,000
a kind of a u monitoring yourself and and um and

248
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,280
um and taking control over yourself to some degree by

249
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:38,160
engaging in a reframing a new story that uh is a better one than the

250
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:45,680
one that's debilitating you again not to make up something not to invent something not to project kind

251
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:52,599
of fake kind of pos positive regard onto ourselves to

252
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:58,000
really recognize what's happening and and then reframe it for some way that

253
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,560
realistically is a much better story much more interesting if there's a lot a lot of

254
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:11,280
challenges for example I've known people who when it was refrained for them that

255
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:17,280
they're learning to practice with this so they can help others who have the same problem the same

256
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:23,440
challenge suddenly they they they get boyed up they get inspired oh yes when I

257
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:31,560
just focusing on myself the main subject to my story I feel I feel more depressed

258
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:38,160
I feel like one more time it's so hard but when I think oh there's a a

259
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:45,480
higher purpose for going through with this to learn and recognize and practice with this I'm going to be able to

260
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:51,920
support other people going through it they'll understand them better the more I understand myself with my difficulty

261
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:58,000
the more I understand other people with this difficulty the more I learn to be be patient the more I learn to have

262
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,319
Insight the more I learn to practice with it I can maybe support other people to do the

263
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:11,640
same and um so the main point I'm trying to make today

264
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:18,560
is don't be a victim to your of your stories don't operate on automatic pilot

265
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:24,480
of how what you think about through the day uh as if it's that's you have to or

266
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:30,240
that just kind of who you you are your thoughts and these or you have no say

267
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:35,920
over what you think you have to just go along with it or you believe that every thought you have is

268
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:42,599
true and so it has to be there it's not the case we could have some

269
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:49,319
role in how we think and what we think about and we can think in in ways that

270
00:41:49,319 --> 00:41:54,640
are supportive and helpful and for those of us who are doing Buddhist practice we

271
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:00,359
have a whole repertoire to our whole set of understandings about what we're doing

272
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:06,079
that's actually quite profound so to call upon how we understand the practice

273
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:13,240
and how it's beneficial and how the bringing the practice to our difficulties is a reframing of the

274
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:18,880
difficulty it's it's inserting or bringing into it a new

275
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:25,160
story the story of practice the story of the Buddha story about how we're going

276
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:31,640
to practice with this and find our Liberation from it or we're going to sit patiently and

277
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:40,960
not give into it maybe we tell ourselves the story of Mara and uh and Mara's story is uh that

278
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:47,520
the mara comes to the Buddha this uh Temptation devilish kind of person who's

279
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:52,920
trying to stop the person the Buddha from being enlightened and uh he comes to the

280
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:59,440
Buddha and uh the story the Buddha tells is not that he has to fight and battle

281
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:05,800
Mara but he just looks at him straight in the eye and he says Mara I see

282
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:11,200
you and that's enough he doesn't he's not for or against Mara he's not

283
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:18,079
criticizing Mara he says Mara I see you and to be clearly seen Mara can't stand

284
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:26,440
that and just disappears goes away can't manage Mara loses his power if he seeing

285
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:32,960
that clearly so there's Mara story you have your challenges your strong drives and

286
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:38,880
desires and Ill Wills that come up so powerfully tell yourself the story of

287
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:45,480
Mara you might say the words Mara I see you and use that to really see what's

288
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:51,280
going on in such Clarity that you're not being pulled into the world of your

289
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:58,079
desires and aversions you're standing out and really seeing Oh this is what it is

290
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,800
and that uh so this is a skill to learn deliberate thinking

291
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:09,040
reframing uh your experience um and certainly can seem

292
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:14,800
like you're being busy in meditation when you do this um but the idea is to develop this

293
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:21,040
skill this orientation so you know when to bring it in because it's

294
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:26,280
supportive you know when this is the better alternative to do rather than

295
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:33,440
verily going along in distracted thought so may you today as you go

296
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:39,839
through the day may you find ways to reframe your

297
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:45,240
experience or to place whatever is happening to you into a different story

298
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:52,880
than the one that you're habitually engaged in or unconsciously engaged in may your

299
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:59,240
life occur within stories that bring you and others tremendous

300
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:04,880
benefit and freedom thank

301
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:13,119
you
