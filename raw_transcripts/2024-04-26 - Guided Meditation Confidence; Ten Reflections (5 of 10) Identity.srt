1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:07,559
good morning or good day welcome and for today's

2
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:15,320
meditation I'd like to call on or evoke in you your

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:23,359
confidence that um confidence has a lot to do with showing

4
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:30,759
up fully to engage with what we're doing with a belief

5
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:37,520
that we can do it that we can uh not just do it with

6
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:45,559
full confidence not just that we can do it with part of who we are but that we can do what we're doing

7
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:54,079
with all of who we are we can bring all of ourselves together in a some somehow an embodied

8
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:00,440
way holistic way and to show up for our activity

9
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:06,080
we're not divided we're not divided by other interests

10
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,920
preoccupations we're just there's a confidence there's a

11
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,759
wholeheartedness uh we can give ourselves fully to the activity at

12
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:27,880
hand and I think of confidence as an embodied State it's not only a belief

13
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:35,439
belief maybe just a small part of it but believing in yourself believing you can do something believing in the value of

14
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:44,280
it but there's also a even without belief some people can have a

15
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,759
disposition towards confidence that you're there you're and

16
00:01:50,759 --> 00:02:01,079
that's what comes with Dharma practice we're confident in the value of being here

17
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:08,399
present inhabiting This Moment's

18
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,879
life here and now and so for this meditation the idea

19
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:21,760
of confidently inhabiting your present moment

20
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,239
experience and letting that confidence be soft

21
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,879
quiet not act not agitating

22
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:42,120
or energizing in a way that is R Makes You Restless but rather

23
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:48,000
a kind of a the full capacity to show

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,319
up here and in that showing up something full all of

25
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:01,319
ourselves has a chance to become still dynamically still

26
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:10,200
something about all of ourselves has a chance to come to rest in the pull of

27
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:18,040
gravity rather than being activated in such a way

28
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:26,799
that we're kind of spinning out so confidence so assuming a meditation

29
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:37,040
posture and add to it some modum of confidence an expression of

30
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:46,480
confidence if you were someone were see you meditating now would they see a person sitting with

31
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:53,599
confidence is there enough full involvement of your body

32
00:03:53,599 --> 00:04:02,760
whether you're lying down or sitting on a couch or sitting upright can you adjust your body so

33
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:08,680
that you are showing or demonstrating to yourself

34
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,640
that you're bringing all of who you are involved in the

35
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:18,359
meditation a way of adjusting your

36
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,240
back maybe in such a way that the shoulder blades can have a chance to

37
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:34,880
roll down the back and the chest has a chance to

38
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,000
open spread

39
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:51,440
out and are the hands in a position that also support the idea of

40
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:59,000
confidence the feeling of it so the hands are not casually on your

41
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,400
lap or someplace but the

42
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,479
hands are placed as if you're

43
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,400
reinforcing that confidence of being yes [Music]

44
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:25,319
here embodied presence for being here and

45
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,560
now and the same thing with the feet if you're sitting in a chair and your couch

46
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:38,759
and your legs are draped over the side is there some way to have your soles of your

47
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:48,080
feet confidently placed on the floor or some surface

48
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:54,800
that they too have a feeling of confidence

49
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,160
and gently if as if the expansion of the

50
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,639
inhale carries with it a gentle

51
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,919
confidence that spreads through your body

52
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:37,159
take some little bit deeper breaths that feel just right for

53
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:44,080
you spreading confidence [Music]

54
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:51,560
embodied attention throughout the body

55
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:18,160
and letting the confidence remain as you exhale long

56
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,080
exhale relax the tensions of your body

57
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:12,960
letting your breathing return to normal with a normal breath and continue

58
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:20,520
to let the inhale be an inhale of

59
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:28,840
confidence even if there's discomfort as you breathe in let the expansion the spread of the

60
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:36,279
inhale spreading out of the Torso

61
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:41,000
belly let it be a spreading

62
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,240
of inhabiting your

63
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:56,279
body being here taking up residence in this

64
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:06,880
body and and as you exhale to soften relax the

65
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,360
body for

66
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:09,120
and not so much watching your breathing from the control

67
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:16,920
tower as inhabiting the body's experience of

68
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:24,720
breathing as if you're entering your body being your body

69
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320

for for

88
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:35,520
is there a way you can more fully inhabit yourself a physical

89
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:42,200
embodiment that gently spreads a sense of

90
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:49,400
confidence for being here

91
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:56,200
now in this place in this time in this body

92
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:06,720
where the living experience of now em

93
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:25,320
emanates letting the thinking mind become quieter so there's more room and

94
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:30,519
attention for the embodied experience

95
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:39,120
of confidence Here and

96
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
Now

97
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
for

98
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

99

102
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:31,279
for

103
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:03,720
and then as we come to the end of this

104
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:11,679
meditation to take a few moments to

105
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:18,360
feel if your experience of being embodied in your

106
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:25,000
body has changed in any way in the course of the meditation

107
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:37,279
and if it has might that come along with something

108
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:45,080
or other that provides you with more confidence

109
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,880
Assurance faith and the value of being

110
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,039
embodied the value of being

111
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:06,278
aware here in your direct

112
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:18,279
experience perhaps even a sense of Refuge in awareness of here and

113
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:24,799
now a refuge in how that awareness lives in

114
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:31,399
your body even if there's disc comfort in the

115
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:43,039
body and imagine that with a certain grounding in

116
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:50,039
your body grounding in a confident

117
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:55,559
embodiment confident presence through your

118
00:27:55,559 --> 00:28:02,279
body that you're able to meet another person without losing yourself without

119
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:09,919
getting caught up in the social Dynamic imagine you can stay connected

120
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:16,760
grounded fully in yourself and in so

121
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:23,080
doing actually have a fuller

122
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,559
ability to be aware of the other

123
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:36,320
then if you leaned into the relationship if you got pulled into your

124
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:42,679
preoccupations and thoughts and stories about what's

125
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:58,518
happening and maybe imagine that with

126
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,080
confident grounding in your

127
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:11,380

thank

144
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:30,880
you e

145
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:14,559
so hello and welcome to the fifth talk

146
00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:22,440
on the 10 Reflections for a spiritual life these 10 Reflections

147
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:30,480
the 10 themes are also um Orient ations

148
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:36,679
or um the concerns that are activated or

149
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:42,960
present as we offer spiritual care to others people offer spiritual

150
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:51,200
caregivers might be listening for these themes in people's lives and seeing which one of those uh

151
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:57,519
is is a challenging for people at any given time and and challenging means

152
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:04,440
that could be the major challenge of their life that something really has ruptured or been taken away or there's a

153
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:10,360
loss or and um and then in offering spiritual care is to take to to

154
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:15,960
recognize this and support people sometimes people don't even recognize they know they're suffering but they

155
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:21,200
don't know why and um and somehow in the

156
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:28,360
conversation with a spiritual caregiver that uh somehow it can come out that oh this is where it is

157
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:33,799
it's uh there's uh what needs to be

158
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:40,240
somehow addressed is the issues of meaning uh the framing of our experience

159
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:47,679
in a what is most important for us or framing it in a way that um brings forth

160
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:53,559
uh our Vitality our inspiration what uh maybe is lacking a

161
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:59,600
sense of direction or sense of purpose what's lacking is a sense of agency the

162
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:05,679
ability to do and engage with what's important or what's lacking is a sense

163
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:11,839
of autonomy a sense that we're capable as an individual to stand up for

164
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:18,599
ourselves or take care of ourselves or engage with uh as a

165
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:24,560
independent person with uh with what seems important for

166
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:30,280
us so today's uh topic is identity and that's one that uh there's a lot of

167
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:37,158
struggles with that people have and there are what some people have called identity Wars going on in the United

168
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:45,800
States and maybe other places in the world as well where people's identities are denied and um by others and not just

169
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:51,440
simply denied and ignored but sometimes uh with active hostility towards who

170
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:59,320
people are and uh it's phenomenally painful for individuals for societ as a

171
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:07,240
whole some people don't have um uh never had people who believed in

172
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:13,160
that you know parents or teachers who believed in them so that who they were

173
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:19,640
could really flower and develop um we children especially uh

174
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:24,839
take in the confidence others have in us the others who show us or open up doors

175
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:31,720
for us yes uh all of you can come here you're capable of stepping forward here as you are who you

176
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:39,079
are and um maybe haven't had people who mirrored who we are and helped us to

177
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:44,240
recognize for ourselves the beauty of who we are as a human being and everyone

178
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:50,560
has Beauty everyone is a Marvel and to be seen with that kind of respect that

179
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:55,960
kind of care is one of the great gifts especially for children as they grow up

180
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:03,720
um to have hostil ility and judgment and criticism be what uh is mirrored for

181
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:09,240
children uh can really distort how children develop as a person and one way

182
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:15,000
they Distortion is that they they don't really grow into the fullness of who

183
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:22,079
they are so in Buddhism we in Buddhism we often kind of there's often a tendency

184
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:27,160
to somehow dismiss the importance of identity I think it was more in the

185
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:33,880
United States a decade or two or three ago when there was an overemphasis on this

186
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:39,960
teaching of of uh not self or how it was often understood was teaching of no self

187
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:46,599
and they were supposed to kind of let go of identity and have no identity which is impossible at least in the way that I

188
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:52,760
want to talk about identity today identity is who we are and it's this I

189
00:36:52,760 --> 00:37:00,319
like to think of it as a sum total of all the different facets of Who We Are how we show up in the world we show up

190
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:07,319
with our abilities our capacities our background our conditioning our way of

191
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:17,079
thinking our belief system our bias um our hurts our Joys all those

192
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:22,240
come together to create uh uh the integral

193
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:29,240
whole of in of uh identity and so uh and this is also this

194
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:34,280
is why identity is very closely connected to the topic of

195
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:40,440
Integrity that Integrity is when we can come forward with all of who we are um

196
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:46,440
in a in a way that it's harmonious that it's not ruptured

197
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:51,920
by uh by any kind of tendency to cause

198
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:59,040
harm to oneself or to others harm harming is a rupture in in the wholeness

199
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:06,440
of our identity some people create an identity around being uh aggressive or being a

200
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:13,280
fighter or being a destroyer even and um but then then there's not

201
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:19,760
the Integrity of the whole person there and from Buddhist point of view then

202
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:25,319
identity has become fixated and it's the fixed identity that

203
00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:31,280
Buddhism shows us Buddhist prce shows us is diminishes who we are when we get

204
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:37,160
attached to a particular aspect of who we are in Buddhism the idea is to have no

205
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:43,800
fixed identity but let the identity of who we are evolve and change over time

206
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:49,079
and per in some ways be cocreated by the events we're in

207
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:55,319
different events call on different aspects of ourselves uh if you uh it was wonderful

208
00:38:55,319 --> 00:39:00,440
to be in the monastery for many years where I was assigned to

209
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:08,440
very different jobs that I never would have had if I had been in out in the world working and each job that I took

210
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:14,480
required very different parts of who I who I am and so in a sense my identity

211
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:21,880
uh chied and changed with the different jobs I had and then when I became a parent uh

212
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:27,480
my identity as a parent shifted in changes and as my children grew up the

213
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:34,280
fullness the what was called on me and called forth for me for who I could be shifted in changes as my par as my

214
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:41,160
children got older and older so to have the fluidity to discover who we are in

215
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:47,839
the fullness of the moment and to realize that's shifting and changing and in that

216
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:55,200
fullness uh to to appreciate that who we are and in Buddhism who we are is

217
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:01,119
phenomenally important not who we are in terms of a fixed identity but who we are

218
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:07,680
as a sum total of what animates us what drives us what what in what inspires us

219
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:15,359
to speak and to act and to live in the world that uh if we act from place of

220
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:20,480
Good Will it's radically different than if we act from place of ill will and so

221
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,800
who we are as a manifestation of Good Will who we are is manifestation of

222
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:31,839
being ethical nonh Haron in who we are as a manifestation of wisdom and

223
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:37,839
patience um who we are as a manifestation of joy and playfulness all

224
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:43,359
kinds of things that come into play and and uh and the guideline I'd like to

225
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:50,240
suggest from a Buddhist point of view is to be holistic so that uh we want to

226
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,520
bring all of who we are into the picture so there's can be can be a sense of

227
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:01,119
integrity and what that includes is ways in which we're uh things that are

228
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:07,319
difficult in us if there's fear um th that's part of our identity

229
00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:13,880
in the moment we're afraid or in the day we're afraid or the year that we have anxiety and to be honest about that to

230
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:22,319
make room to recognize that and let it be and um and the uh if we have if we do

231
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:28,119
have anger and resentment there's an art to not pushing that away not denying it

232
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:33,400
or ignoring it or diminishing ourselves because of it there's a way of opening

233
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:39,760
up so that too is part of our wholeness that too is uh nothing we need to be

234
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:44,839
embarrassed about but in in letting that become part of our whole identity the

235
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:51,359
wholeness of identity then we can be honest about it with other people we can take it in

236
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:57,520
stride we can work with it wisely and carefully so this idea of opening up to

237
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:02,680
all of who we are is what it mean what what it can mean to be have a healthy

238
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:09,200
sense of identity and all of who we are is Shifting and changing every day and and

239
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:14,599
so this movement towards recognition opening this movement mindfulness to

240
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:20,599
recognize how we fixated on something or closed around something or or shutting

241
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:27,599
out something just keep opening and opening and this too is who I am

242
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:34,040
so in that sense uh people have uh when this sense and other senses identity is

243
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:39,480
a source of a lot of suffering for people some people do have some kind of

244
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:45,000
identity that they have relied on and it's they lose it they get ill and they

245
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,280
can't live that way anymore um they uh there's loss in life

246
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:56,760
and and if identity was tied to particular another person with people

247
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:04,440
and those people are not there anymore then the identity of that identity is no longer present to keep opening to the

248
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:10,520
fullness of it all is not to get stuck in that fixed identity but to open and

249
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:17,040
allow this too this too has to be included and if that involves grief

250
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:25,119
grief itself is a kind of very special um you know almost sacred state

251
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:30,640
that this too or to say differently all of who we are that integrity and

252
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:38,079
everything that's included that is entering into kind of a sacred way of being in this world and so

253
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:44,040
that um this opening and recognizing uh the areas in our life

254
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:49,119
that were challenged the areas in life that maybe ordinarily would be embarrassed to show people or you feel

255
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:55,640
like something is wrong with us a full integral sense of identity

256
00:43:55,640 --> 00:44:03,160
just opens to that too without judgment without a sense that this is wrong or shouldn't be this way and discovers a

257
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:11,599
rightness and a wisdom and a balance and a and a healthy way of being when all of

258
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:19,359
it is taken into account and we can shift and change with the ever shifting changing nature of

259
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:25,440
identity how we Who We Are Who We Are is always changing but we can I think we

260
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:34,520
can trust um who we are if we are honest and open to all of it um the warts and

261
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:39,680
all they say so

262
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:45,079
um so uh I hope that uh this gives you

263
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:51,839
something to think about over the weekend the next few days and uh what are the identities that you have had

264
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:57,400
what are the different ways in which you have been

265
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:05,240
um um CAU in identity which are the

266
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:13,240
different ways that you've learned to open up to more and more of who you are been more and more inclusive um to affirm your identities

267
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:19,920
to make room for who you are and um and how you became more whole in that

268
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:25,960
process and how you've learned not to fixate an identity while at the same

269
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:31,119
time not denying it any of it uh what are the challenges of

270
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:37,200
identity you've had what are the joys of it that you've had so that's the reflection that I'd like to offer you

271
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:45,520
for the next few days and then uh we'll take this particular um kind of theme of identity

272
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:52,559
and on Monday related to it is the the topic of dignity identity and dignity go

273
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:58,920
together so thank you very much
