1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,960
so hello and welcome to this 30 minute

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:14,839
meditation and as a continuation of this series on samadei I want to maybe simplify the

3
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:20,840
whole idea of moving into fuller and

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:28,359
fuller samadei the peace of samadei and that is that uh it's the

5
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:34,280
progressive uh um releasing of mental

6
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,520
pressure the the uh progressive re uh

7
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:47,160
light letting up of the ways that we cling to things or get really caught or

8
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:53,680
preoccupied and we do it kind of from the outside in maybe starting at the the

9
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:01,520
more uh larger kind of ways in which we cling or get preoccupied caught in things and

10
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,560
we slowly the process of settling relaxing calming

11
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:13,560
uh we start letting go and we start feeling uh the the place where we're still

12
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:22,240
holding and then there's a softening letting go of that and then letting go further and further and partly what this

13
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,520
uh uh involves is developing a deep deep

14
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:34,360
sensitivity to the way in which uh we

15
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:43,759
think uh about things when there's some pressure there some um tension there uh

16
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,119
in the way that we think so it's not just simply that we're thinking but

17
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:56,640
there's an added pressure tightness associated thinking and when we have certain

18
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:06,520
preoccupations certain ideas that we're thinking there could be pressure around those tension grabbing leaning forward

19
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:12,720
resisting and uh so that that begins to go because we feel that tension and

20
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,360
feeling the tension uh requires No longer being so involved in the content

21
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,360
of our thoughts but rather to feel the experience of thinking and how there's

22
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,640
uh there's um discomfort in that being there's some kind of

23
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:37,280
disturbance there and that gets let go and then uh the hindrances we get let go

24
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,760
of the hindrances as part of that and then um and then we're able to

25
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:50,160
kind of now bring our attention much more to the present moment and we're

26
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,680
able to kind of place the attention and sustain the attention this rhythm

27
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:03,200
massage of just being here the mind kind of drifts a little bit come back drifts a little bit come back and it's quite

28
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,640
lovely as an alternative to that tensions preoccupations with thoughts

29
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:15,360
emotions intentions feelings and with time we feel that even

30
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:22,879
that involves some kind of little bit of kind of tension or pressure and there's

31
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:28,879
a relaxing of that and then there's experiences of joy and happiness that

32
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:36,720
can come and then with time we see that the joy part of it is kind of coarse or kind

33
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,720
of a little bit too much there's too much uh involvement whereas at first the joy

34
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:50,239
just seems ecstatic and see feels so fortunate but over time as we get more familiar with it we can feel sense the

35
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:56,080
way in which there's some holding some pressure some involvement with the joy

36
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,680
and then that tension releases and then we're left with a happiness that deep

37
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,400
sublime kind of feeling of well-being meditative happiness but then at with time we start

38
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,879
sense and feel that even that ever so subtle hard to believe that this sweet

39
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:23,280
healthy feeling of of happiness has a certain kind of orientation of the mind towards it that's still a little bit of

40
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:32,040
tension little bit of pressure little bit maybe something holding and uh and so that

41
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:39,120
releases and then we move into the fourth Janna where uh there's uh really

42
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,120
we don't feel any pressure or tension whatsoever it just feels peaceful the

43
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:51,720
absence of all pressure all tension all force of the mind caughtness of the

44
00:04:51,720 --> 00:05:02,400
mind and so it's a progressive stilling quieting calming of tension tightness pressure

45
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:09,440
um um uh that uh we become sensitive to and

46
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:17,360
then we let go so to assume a meditation

47
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:25,080
posture and the broadest

48
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:32,000
beginning of relaxing is as you breathe maybe with

49
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,440
your eyes closed to feel any

50
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:43,000
tension tightness

51
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:52,120
pressure in your body and as you breathe to feel

52
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:58,000
that and as you exhale to relax the

53
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:11,319
body relaxing into the present moment with your

54
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:18,520
body as a welcoming place something in your body welcomes

55
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:25,440
you as the pulling away of tension as the

56
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,160
narrowing in of tension

57
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:49,280
releases and then to feel the tensions in your

58
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:53,680
mind pressure contraction

59
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:04,199
doesn't matter what the tightness is about feel it on the

60
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:12,039
inhale and soften relax on the exhale

61
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:32,240
relaxing in a way that allows attention to settle more deeply into the

62
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:41,800
body where the body welcomes attention welcomes you

63
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:04,479
as you inhale feel any tension or pressure holding in the heart

64
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:14,520
area feel it on the inhale soften around it relax around

65
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,000
it on the

66
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:31,039
exhale letting attention letting you settle more deeply into the torso

67
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,959
maybe deep into the soft belly

68
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,480
noticing if there's any preoccupations major concerns that

69
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:10,240
you're thinking about don't be concerned about the content the

70
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,519
but rather the felt sense of tension tightness

71
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:20,480
pressure around this

72
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:29,680
concern and as you exhale

73
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:35,959
soften relax

74
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:52,320
settle and then to

75
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:01,279
settle into the body

76
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:17,920
breathing with that gentle massage of connecting to the

77
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:26,519
breathing and sustaining attention touching into the

78
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:32,320
breath and riding on the breath for a few moments

79
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,040
a very gentle

80
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:52,440
massage of breathing massaging it with a

81
00:10:52,440 --> 00:11:01,360
soft very light no pressure

82
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,680
attention breathing in breathing

83
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:30,640
out maybe feeling the relief or joy gladness

84
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,120
that you're less preoccupied than you

85
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:51,480
were massaging the breath with awareness letting breathing massage

86
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:57,000
you breathing in and breathing out

87
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:22,440
and perhaps some of the more subtle tightening or

88
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:28,639
pressure can be softened by having a Small half

89
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:35,279
smile

90
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:46,440
smiling at the goodness simplicity of breathing in and breathing

91
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:52,279
out being connected in a in an embodied

92
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:56,600
way with oneself

93
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,639
and if there is some delight or

94
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,360
joy allow the massage Massage your

95
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:34,480
breathing to suse that joy through the

96
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:43,519
body as the mind gets quieter and

97
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:11,959
stiller the fewer the thoughts The more room there is in

98
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:19,920
awareness to feel the goodness the

99
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,360
rightness that's part of sitting

100
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,839
quietly attending to the breathing

101
00:14:52,399 --> 00:15:01,160
and then relaxing more relaxing around the joy or the

102
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,680
delight the sense of relief

103
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:14,199
to feel more deeply deep in your body whatever sense of

104
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:21,920
well-being might be there even if it's in the cracks of feeling

105
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:28,480
otherwise feel that kind of well-being a sense of

106
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:33,959
happiness contentment

107
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:45,639
letting the mind become quieter so you can better have

108
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:51,079
room for happiness contentment

109
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,800
and then deeper than happiness deeper than

110
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,920
contentment is peace

111
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:41,519
the peace of a clear nonreactive

112
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,759
mind nonreactive

113
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:54,000
awareness letting go of happiness

114
00:16:54,279 --> 00:17:01,720
contentment and becoming centered on that part

115
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,439
of your

116
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:16,640
being which is a clarity of

117
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,438
attention attention that feels clean

118
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:26,438
open spacious

119
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:44,200
that part of awareness the heart of awareness that has no pressure no

120
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,960
tension nothing to do nothing to

121
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:58,480
be simply

122
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:09,360
aware as if awareness is a vast open

123
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,240
space undisturbed by

124
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,520
anything he

125
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,559
And as we come to the end of this

126
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:32,679
sitting to see if you have a clear sensitivity

127
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:39,279
ity two ways in which there's added pressure or tension

128
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,279
in the mind the heart the

129
00:25:56,279 --> 00:26:01,720
body an activation of

130
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,080
Wanting and not

131
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:22,159
wanting holding on a stickiness to thoughts and

132
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:31,720
feelings and even you can let it be the way it

133
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,960
is but appreciate that there is the

134
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:45,120
possibility of not having any stickiness any pressure any

135
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:54,679
activation any holding and that

136
00:26:54,679 --> 00:27:03,640
possibility exists together with your holding surrounding it underneath

137
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:09,880
it as a friendly welcoming

138
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:17,039
possibility yes you can let

139
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:23,360
go you can release the pressures on the mind

140
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:37,880
and that allows you to see the

141
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:44,640
world with new eyes with clear

142
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:53,159
eyes without the filter of desires and aversions wanting and not

143
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:58,480
wanting without the burden of judgments and

144
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:04,559
interpretations to gaze upon the world

145
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:14,240
calmly with a friendly

146
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:24,879
heart a warmhearted attitude to all

147
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:30,679
beings may all beings

148
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:37,039
Be happy may all

149
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:44,640
beings be safe may all beings be

150
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:50,320
peaceful may all beings be

151
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,440
free and thereby may all

152
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:03,720
beings know what it's like to

153
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:11,640
live without any tension in their mind any pressure any

154
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:21,000
holding as they come home to themselves may all beings be happy

155
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:32,490
[Music]

156
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,240
thank you

157
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:37,480
so good morning and welcome to this series on samadei and I think we're now on

158
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:44,080
the 57th the 58th talk and u discussing

159
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:49,559
the fourth janna and to step back to have a little bit of

160
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:55,600
um um different orientation to

161
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:01,440
understanding this whole process of samadei is that sometimes it's said to

162
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:08,240
be a continuous process of letting go that that's what's required in attaining

163
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:14,399
a deep samadei another way that similar is that

164
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:21,399
samadei has a lot to do with relaxing or letting up on all the ways in which

165
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:30,320
attention has been hijacked or uh harnessed into our attachments into

166
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:37,519
pressure into subtle ways that the mind grabs onto or pushes along um it's

167
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:43,000
thoughts subtle ways in which we're reacting to our feelings and how we

168
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,760
are the subtle ways maybe not so subtle ways in which we're uh uh in very

169
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:59,679
involved in with kind of pressure or contraction or tightness or leaning into

170
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:08,640
uh whatever attention is directed towards and if it's directed towards thinking there can be a lot of it and um

171
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:14,440
and so that process of becoming sensitive to

172
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:20,200
that holding that pressure that push that

173
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:26,240
preoccupation around anything at all the way attention you know zeros in and

174
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:34,080
sometimes it's innocent enough if uh you've lost your keys

175
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:40,880
uh then there's some part of the mind you know is kind of now you know intent

176
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:46,600
on finding the keys looking for the keys and there might be a subtle kind of

177
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:54,000
tautness intentionality in the mind or there might be fear and anxiety and

178
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,880
desperation that now the mind has really gotten tight really gotten

179
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:06,360
narrow the holding on there can be a a healthy tautness

180
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:13,440
healthy kind of engagement that or there can be this all this extra stuff and so

181
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:20,440
this uh meditation as a place to become very sensitive to the

182
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:29,200
tension the pressure the strain that we add and sometimes it's pretty uh soft so

183
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,519
in ordinary mind states we don't see the tension but as the mind gets quieter in

184
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:40,640
meditation we start noticing uh what wasn't noticed before because uh now

185
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:46,720
we're quiet enough to start feeling more deeply what's happening we're not preoccupied not caught up in in the

186
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:52,720
thoughts ideas and we start feeling the cost feeling the tightness the tension

187
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:59,200
the strain and then as we just sometimes with mindfulness just feeling it

188
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:06,240
carefully is enough for it to begin to soften dissolve and the process of samadei

189
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:13,679
whether it's feeling the tension letting dissolve or whether it's staying on the breath focusing on the breath uh you

190
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,800
know wholeheartedly so the attention doesn't go into that tension doesn't go

191
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:28,000
into the preoccupations and they kind of fade away on their own both are happening in samadei and uh and in one

192
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,118
way or the other the tensions of the mind are calming down and

193
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:40,638
quieting and uh when they quiet down enough that we really feel like we're in the present moment we've arrived and

194
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:48,200
we're not leaving we're just now at rest at ease it can start feeling like a delight it can be a relief it can be

195
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:53,679
happiness and so then we go further there can be uh the stages of the the

196
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:59,119
four stages of the four Janna are a progressive calming of the tensions

197
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:06,520
activation of the mind and uh and it's some sometimes just enough to feel

198
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:12,760
recognize the the tension or the disturbance or the activate unnecessary

199
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,920
activation that happens in each state so in each Janna if you hang out long

200
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:24,320
enough get to know it suse it feel it really be enter into it um then sooner

201
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:32,880
or later your system you will recognize oh this is where there's still some kind of tension and that releases and we can

202
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,800
move into the next Janna and the next Janna and the third Janna for some

203
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:44,119
people is the most satisfying in some ways because of the sublime happiness that's

204
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:49,520
there But even there there's a kind of attention a little bit of something

205
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:56,400
extra activation that it feels so good to find that which is calmer still more

206
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:02,320
peaceful which is the fourth Janna and now because the mind is not oriented

207
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:10,000
towards anything it's not oriented towards the happiness gathered around for the happiness uh there's no very

208
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:18,800
little sense of the body going on there's no pain and pleasure in the state um and

209
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:25,079
sometimes uh breathing gets very very quiet some people report that breathing seemingly

210
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:31,280
stops because there's no we don't experience any breathing in and out and

211
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:37,280
um and then whether we are still breathing a little bit or whether uh the

212
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:44,320
need for oxygen is so so diminished that uh there's some kind of you know cycling

213
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:51,200
of oxygen and carbon dioxide in some kind of way that doesn't quite require active breathing exactly what's going on

214
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:57,640
we don't know i don't know but um it's it can be

215
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:05,000
quite the first time it's you know I thought I stopped breathing i was so deeply calm and peaceful and

216
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:12,200
unpreoccupied by anything until I noticed I wasn't breathing and then I gasped and said to myself I'm going to

217
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:17,520
die and then I was you know back up in my thinking mind and over time I learned

218
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,640
to trust this and uh and how I wasn't going to die in deep meditation when I

219
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:28,160
could no longer feel any breath and some of that is that the quiet peaceful mind

220
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:35,599
that has so little mental activity doesn't need a lot of oxygen that one of the primary consumers of oxygen in the

221
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:42,240
body is the brain because we're so you know busy there

222
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,760
so um so with the fourth Janna um there

223
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:56,480
is no real any now involvement with anything outside of the state of awareness itself and uh and so it's

224
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:03,520
that's kind of described as an aquinomous awareness or a clear mind

225
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:11,040
clean mind pure mind and if anything there's a kind of a feeling of of this

226
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:17,560
is what there is and there's a the the unification the one-pointedness

227
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:24,640
um is just with what's left which is this quantumous clear awareness mind

228
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:30,880
that we're here and this involves uh no you know the absence of phenomenal

229
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:37,280
absence of tension activation that's so deeply satisfying

230
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:43,520
so I wanted to emphasize this today because um uh the the the balance in

231
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:49,119
practice is some balance between um being focused with attention staying

232
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:55,599
with like the breathing or the object of attention and relaxing and softening and

233
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:03,599
um and you can get somewhat concentrated by only focusing but uh there's not a few people

234
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:08,960
who do that who don't notice the strain by which they're focusing and then their

235
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:15,119
samadei gets a little bit uh uh out of kilter uh their sami gets a little bit

236
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:20,720
off in some ways or very much off a lot of a lot of the strain tension builds

237
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:27,200
kind of energy that's not a healthy energy to have and if we're only focusing on

238
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:34,400
relaxing and letting go um it might not really allow the kind of unification the

239
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:41,079
kind of quieting or centering that um that allows for the deeper

240
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:46,640
submod so where we find the balance is somewhere between the two and uh some

241
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:54,640
people want to emphasize more the letting go the relaxing some people more the focus different times more one or

242
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:01,280
the other but ideally they're working together and they're working harmoniously almost as if they're the

243
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:08,720
same thing and uh and that becomes a protection from the problems that can

244
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:13,800
happen with samadei if uh we're trying too hard to get into samadei if we're

245
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:20,320
straining pushing um gung-ho and I've known people who have

246
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:26,720
been a little bit too idealistic a little bit too striving around somebody and they've

247
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:34,800
gotten into trouble because uh the tension built so much in their body and their mind and and um they got headaches

248
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:41,440
for example or strange kind of activation of energies happen in their body

249
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:49,119
so it's very important to see the process of samati to be a sensitivity to

250
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:55,440
tension sensitivity to holding to pressure to contraction to clinging uh

251
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,880
in all the many variations that can be there to be sensitive to it so we know

252
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:07,200
how to let go we know how to relax and this is uh valuable at any stage of mind

253
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:14,720
of practice um uh if we're in ordinary states of of consciousness of mind then

254
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:20,400
uh maybe some of that holding is fairly coarse as we get deeper in meditation

255
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:26,000
it's more and more subtle subtle doesn't mean it's unimportant it becomes uh

256
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,240
what's the next maybe the next doorway to go further and further

257
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:37,640
so the progressive stilling softening

258
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:43,560
evaporating of tension clinging holding

259
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:49,839
pressure and then we come to the fourth Janna and uh when a person has kind of

260
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:55,800
come to the fourth Janna and is well able established in it then it can be

261
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:01,200
relatively smooth and quick to move between the Janas the mind becomes

262
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:06,560
malleable mind becomes workable and sometimes there's a sense of mastery of

263
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:13,359
just can move in and out of this states because there's no clinging no tension

264
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:21,760
that interferes with that movement it's just enough it's almost like you blow on a you know you you blow on dust and the

265
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:28,079
dust kind of floats away so you flow and direction is in these concentration

266
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:34,720
states and you can kind of move between them because there's so little clinging and the idea is not to necessarily

267
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:43,200
develop mastery of the Janna but rather how the how the deeper the Janna

268
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,560
the less holding there is to the in the mind less clinging and the more and more

269
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:54,040
prone we become to a deeper and deeper letting go that the mind does on its

270
00:42:54,040 --> 00:43:01,240
moon and that is a miracle that is a delight when the mind lets go of

271
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:08,760
itself so thank you and um so we have two more days on this fourth Janna and

272
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:16,280
um and I appreciate very much this chance to be able to offer you these teachings
