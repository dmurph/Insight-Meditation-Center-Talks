1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:10,200
readings dear fellow Travelers

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:16,080
on this beautiful wholesome path

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:22,039
it's good to see you good to practice with you

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,019
so I need to begin by making a correction

5
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:37,440
that the Chinese character combining look and see

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,440
is not the one given for translating niroda cessation

7
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:51,320
but rather samadhi deep concentration

8
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:59,239
bringing the mind and the body and all of us

9
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,119
individually all the parts of us together

10
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:14,900
so it's a it's a beautiful quality of samadhi that nothing needs to be left out

11
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,240
even the parts of us were still

12
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,360
somewhat unskillful from time to time

13
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:43,020
now we'll begin um by formulating our deepest intention

14
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,320
why we are here to meditate

15
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:55,079
and it's advantageous if your intention includes

16
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:02,640
a dimension of altruism it's not only for you but it's for

17
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:09,840
everyone all beings and how we might contribute

18
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,560
to the well-being of everyone on this planet

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,120
setting your intention sets the stage

20
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,800
or your effort

21
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:56,599
so now assume a meditation posture

22
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:04,860
from which you feel you could practice

23
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:10,260
letting go relinquishing

24
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:20,060
letting go of tensions in the body

25
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:27,300
but also letting go of unwholesome mind States

26
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:35,780
like being tempted to jump on thought trades

27
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:46,080
so for me what I need in my posture for that is to know that I'm

28
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,959
upright that my three centers of brevity are

29
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:59,840
well balanced belly the heart and the head

30
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:11,060
and then I like the image of sending Roots deep down into the Earth

31
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:21,900
from where I have the sensation of contact with whatever is supporting me

32
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:30,320
where there is the floor a chair a cushion a bed

33
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:37,220
that's where we send down our roots

34
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:49,440
and then another invitation for our meditation today

35
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,680
is to throughout the whole half hour of practice

36
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,020
to Endeavor to maintain flavor

37
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:09,320
of kindness it's of all being kind to ourselves

38
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:17,840
being kind to whatever arises in the mind

39
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:26,520
being kind to our foibles or imperfections

40
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:34,500
just recognizing them without any Judgment at all

41
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,380
oh this is how it is

42
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,960
that's wholesome recognition

43
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:55,080
so now we'll do a brief body scan

44
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:02,419
from the soles of the feet up to the crown of the head

45
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:11,580
and as we do wherever we place our awareness we see

46
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:17,479
if there might be something there to let go of

47
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:25,340
and if it's not possible to release attention

48
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:30,660
then we settle for just softening

49
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:36,979
around whatever feels contracted

50
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,680
gently coming up the legs

51
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:04,580
now facing our awareness in the belly

52
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,800
if we're sitting that's far center of gravity

53
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:24,840
and if we're on a cushion it might be like a tripod

54
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:31,460
with the knees and

55
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,240
the bottom of the spine

56
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:47,120
if we're sitting in a chair it might be

57
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:51,139
under the thighs

58
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,819
and studying ourselves

59
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:07,319
as a way of inviting the mind

60
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:12,259
and maybe slow down a little bit

61
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,580
maybe take a break from

62
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,800
the distraction of thinking

63
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,740
and then continuing our scan up through the heart center

64
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:45,180
and showering ourselves

65
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,560
with loving kindness

66
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:59,300
it's really okay to be just too weird

67
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:14,240
up through the shoulders down through the arms and the hands

68
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:23,120
and then placing our awareness in the head area

69
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:34,860
are there any parts of the face that you would like

70
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,540
to soften a little bit

71
00:09:53,339 --> 00:10:00,480
and taking the ritual long slow deep breath

72
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,740
in and out

73
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:20,899
making contact with the experience of breathing

74
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:34,160
and now we'll do a practice of reflection

75
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:43,640
based on the Awakening factor of Investigation

76
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:51,660
so if this is okay with you you're invited

77
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:58,500
ask yourself what in you

78
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,300
would benefit from letting go

79
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:21,140
what would you enjoy letting go of in your mind

80
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:39,200
and if you could take a brief vacation from whatever

81
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,399
stands in your way of quieting the mind

82
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,019
please celebrate that

83
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:56,240
it's wonderful it doesn't have to last

84
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:07,100
just a taste of a quiet mind is beautiful

85
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:06,680
I imagine most of you have already closed your eyes but in case you haven't

86
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:10,519
that can be beneficial

87
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,760
so staying with the cycle of the breath

88
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:45,740
and in the background keeping the flavor of kindness and also

89
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,600
a factor of Investigation [Music]

90
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:59,240
of what would it take

91
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:06,980
you to let go of keeping the mind so busy

92
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,980
don't keep practicing like this

93
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:35,360
and if a door should open for you

94
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:46,159
or it's the beauty of Tranquility

95
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:52,700
feel free to step through it

96
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:28,740
perhaps you've gotten a glimpse of what the obstacles

97
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:33,960
are that you need to clear

98
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:39,140
in order to advance on your chosen path

99
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:46,860
in that case the invitation is to revoke

100
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:51,980
The Awakening factor of effort

101
00:22:52,400 --> 00:23:00,919
wholesome effort what do you need to let go of

102
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:07,399
to purify your efforts as you meditate

103
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:44,600
if the problem seems to be the wandering mind

104
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:53,240
might it be helpful to make a vow to just keep coming back

105
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:07,679
article physics has demonstrated that most

106
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:15,200
of this human body is in fact emptiness

107
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:26,700
so now the invitation is to

108
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,820
visualize that emptiness inside

109
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,700
and radiate

110
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:45,299
your emptiness which is infused with kindness

111
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:51,059
in all directions above and below

112
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:57,379
in front and back to the right to the left

113
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:01,880
the spend a few hours from radiating

114
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:11,240
purifying yourself and all beings in the whole universe

115
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:18,679
with emptiness infused with kindness

116
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:48,500
and now we come to the end of this city

117
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:55,980
and we radiate our well-wishing to all beings everywhere including

118
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:02,760
ourselves may we

119
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:10,580
and all beings be held in kindness

120
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:17,600
and may we all be free

121
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:35,989
[Music]

122
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,729
[Music]

123
00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:00,440
[Music] thank you

124
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:32,220
foreign

125
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:45,179
happy to be here with you I need to begin however by a correction

126
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:51,320
um uh a couple of Corrections

127
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:58,220
um one is that the um

128
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:05,220
the event on Saturday which is a fundraiser for a new monastery near

129
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:11,059
Seattle I didn't get that right

130
00:31:11,059 --> 00:31:16,860
uh it's I kind of jumped to conclusions but it

131
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:23,779
it seemed to me to be a reasonable jump um

132
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:32,480
because when I I saw the invitation to this event there were six monastics

133
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:37,799
um with monks interspersed with nuns

134
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:44,640
and they were all named and I made the assumption that wow there

135
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:51,679
are going to be nuns in this monastery and that's not the case

136
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:57,720
my beloved mentor Aya anandabodi

137
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:06,120
actually um since she was uh she was also tagged in that

138
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,179
um

139
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:23,940
had to come out of her in fact that Monastery will just be for male monastics

140
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:30,779
and the reason they put uh nuns in there was not because they were going to be

141
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:36,960
part of the monastery but because they were friends of this future monastery

142
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,240
and um I guess Dr impostero wanted to make a

143
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:48,480
fundraising pitch for them as well um anyway I do apologize for

144
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:54,779
um my uncalled for jubilation but I'm happy for the monks that they're doing a fund

145
00:32:54,779 --> 00:33:01,860
Reserve or this new their Mountain monastery

146
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:11,580
um and So today we're going to talk about

147
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:20,640
um last uh Olson mine State for the week

148
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,919
which is called vasaga v-o-s-s-a-g

149
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:35,840
-a 50 degrees and you know long marks

150
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:41,159
um but before I go there

151
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:49,039
I need to make a correction for um my teaching yesterday when I was

152
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:55,140
wanting to explain um the Chinese character

153
00:33:55,140 --> 00:34:04,200
um that was used in the in the agamas to translate a poly term and I

154
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:10,138
have remembered that it was naroda but actually it wasn't pneumonia it it is

155
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:15,240
some samadhi so um this wonderful

156
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:26,480
uh picture of look and see is the Chinese uh term for samadhi

157
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:33,980
but actually you know it wasn't too far-fetched in my part to make this mistake because

158
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:42,060
samadhi is really related to niroda cessation

159
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:48,419
somebody being deep concentration because samadhi can be seen as the

160
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:55,398
quintessential stopping of the wandering mind

161
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:02,580
and when we finally stop well enough then

162
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:08,040
we can see we're ready for insight

163
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:13,700
and at that point nothing is going to stop us from

164
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,420
becoming enlightened

165
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,720
so stopping is the big part of samadhi

166
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:33,720
so um how would we describe somebody for me

167
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:39,839
it's a mind that is open

168
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:44,119
it's soft and steady

169
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:53,220
and it has a quality I believe of emptiness

170
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:59,480
a kind of emptiness that allows for receptivity

171
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:05,220
and that's what allows us or allows The meditator Who

172
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:11,460
can go deep into samadhi to really see things

173
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:17,540
as they really are um

174
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:25,619
so the theme for today is which is usually translated

175
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:32,099
as relinquishment and like all the other factors I've been

176
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:39,720
introducing this week it also has a very wide spectrum of its meaning in Bali

177
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:47,540
and we see this from the context in which we find it in different parts of the polycanon

178
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:53,940
so um sort of initial um

179
00:36:53,940 --> 00:37:01,280
translation of voice relinquishment is Letting Go

180
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:08,180
and letting go can then mature into giving up

181
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:15,480
are unwholesome tendencies and that in turn

182
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:22,500
so I was against also translator is giving up and then it can go farther that can

183
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:30,300
lead to release and when release

184
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:36,420
is mature that is complete

185
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:43,040
relinquishment that's nibon blowing up the candle is blown out

186
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:49,260
we've dropped everything with let go of everything

187
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:55,260
that's you know when we get ready to be at our hunt so

188
00:37:55,260 --> 00:38:02,660
may not be for this lifetime but uh that's where we're headed

189
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:12,020
um and then very interestingly another uh meaning of

190
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:17,940
in addition to letting go and relinquishment today is simply a

191
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:23,940
donation it also means giving

192
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:30,619
and the Beautiful hurt quality of generosity

193
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:37,800
and you may know if you've read some of the early texts that the Buddha

194
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:44,220
uh when especially when teaching lay practitioners the very first instruction

195
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:50,400
he would give would be to cultivate generosity

196
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:56,880
and then the next one uh even more important

197
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,920
is that when we're comfortable with being

198
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:07,079
generous than to really take seriously the five precepts

199
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:14,040
and really Endeavor to live as ethically as we possibly can

200
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:21,720
and I I love my um monastic teachers because they

201
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:30,200
they incarnate that so beautifully this Exquisite uh

202
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:39,000
um ethics non-harming

203
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,760
by himself so

204
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:53,480
um it's also said uh in the early text that

205
00:39:53,480 --> 00:40:00,960
when we have mastered um making use of the wholesome mind

206
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:08,220
qualities of the seven Awakening factors what this ripens in

207
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:15,260
is relinquishment the same quality

208
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:23,760
so um another thing I'd like to stress

209
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:33,560
is that we're in the thinking mind does quiet down for a moment

210
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:39,720
for most of us it really that really feels good and

211
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:43,520
yet there's nothing

212
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:52,880
but you feel the goodness of this mind state

213
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:58,880
of Quiet Mind

214
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:06,960
and recognizing that when it happens even if it's not for a long time that's really valuable and it's really

215
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:14,000
good to take a moment to enjoy that

216
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:21,420
um and that's uh also

217
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:26,460
shines a light on the importance of joy in our practice

218
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:31,500
uh sort of like the puppy that I talked about earlier this week uh training a

219
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:37,200
puppy with treats rather than with punishment

220
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:44,420
our mind is going to respond favorably to

221
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:50,420
experiences that we perceive as joyful or happy

222
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:57,420
and and in a healthy way you'll want more of that so that helps to keep us on the

223
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:04,980
path when we when we really taste how good it is to let go of all that

224
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:09,799
um that thinking

225
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:17,579
um but as as we all know quieting our mental Fabrications

226
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:23,040
or mental constructions the word in poly is sangara

227
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:30,920
uh it takes a long time because it's not uh instinctive for us

228
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:37,680
and you know that your awareness your

229
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:44,700
mindfulness your attention where you've placed your attention is profound

230
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:50,280
when it's no longer coming from the control tower

231
00:42:50,280 --> 00:43:00,140
and also when your experience is no longer one of reactivity

232
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:07,160
so this feeling of well-being and happiness joy

233
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:14,099
its function in meditation is to help us Trust

234
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:19,619
being here in this body in this moment however it

235
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:24,900
is so

236
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:30,240
um in his recordings of his meditation teachings of venerable analio

237
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:37,260
Begins by asking us to formulate in a altruistic way if possible our deepest

238
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:42,800
intention why are we here to meditate

239
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:48,660
and I think I'll I'll share with you um

240
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:54,000
my deepest intention which I came to a few years ago and stayed with me for a

241
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:02,339
while is I make a I make a vowel

242
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:08,280
to be a safe haven of kindness and emptiness

243
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:16,140
for all beings and the kindness is

244
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:22,140
is obvious but for someone like me who gets

245
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:27,619
caught in the comparing mind comparing myself to others

246
00:44:27,619 --> 00:44:33,980
emptiness is really a valuable quality

247
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:39,180
to cultivate and I know that if I'm not empty

248
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:46,920
if I you know if I have fixed ideas in there uh or I'm you know just obsessed with

249
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:53,300
myself I can't be safe for others

250
00:44:53,339 --> 00:44:58,700
so I really do want to be safe for others and

251
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:05,180
I think cultivating Emptiness is a very wholesome thing to do

252
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:12,900
so um if you'd like some homework uh at the

253
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:20,220
end of this week I suggest that you sit down with a Dharma buddy that you

254
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:27,900
trust and the two of you have an in-depth conversation where you ask each other

255
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:34,319
over and over again what keeps you from letting go

256
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:39,780
and then giving the your body a chance to think about it and answer it and when

257
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:46,079
they do then repeating the question to invite them to go down to a a deeper

258
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:53,099
level so yeah the the process of of

259
00:45:53,099 --> 00:45:59,040
investigating our own mind state and

260
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:04,079
getting getting a glimpse of what is holding us back

261
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:07,579
from completely letting go

262
00:46:09,319 --> 00:46:16,200
so um I'll be teaching here again the week of July 10th

263
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:23,640
but next week you will be treated to the teachings of my longtime Dharma buddy

264
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:29,819
Kim Allen and I believe that the theme will be

265
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:38,720
on another very different exploration of the faculty of taste

266
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:45,200
Roslyn which we've worked on together this week

267
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:51,359
