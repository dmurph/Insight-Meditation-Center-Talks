1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:08,760
good morning everyone welcome one of

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,960
the little bit continuing themes I've done the last couple of Sundays here am

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:20,480
I loud enough for you all yeah so uh little bit continuing the

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,400
themes from the last Sunday I want to talk more about the body our bodies mindfulness of the

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:35,559
bodies uh it's surprising to me how much uh in these 2500 years ago the Buddha

6
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:41,920
emphasized the tremendous value of being present being attentive to your own

7
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:50,239
body and there's a lot of uh uh a lot we can discover in our body uh there's a a

8
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:56,680
tremendous support that the our bodies give to being present and attentive to our lives and to

9
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:02,879
ourselves and um and one of the things that's interesting is that for in these

10
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:11,119
ancient teachings the word that's most commonly used for body is Kaa Ka a y a

11
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:17,520
and it kind of has some of the same range of meanings as the English word body in that it doesn't just refer to a

12
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:25,079
physical body but also refers to an assembly of things uh we might talk about a body of

13
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:30,520
work of an author who's written a lot we might talk about a student body

14
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:36,880
students of a school and a body of water which you know so there's a it's a range

15
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,360
of things that have collected together and held together and with implying that

16
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,600
this body of ours is an assemblage of assembly or assemblage of all kinds of

17
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,640
different things that come together and what's get more interesting

18
00:01:52,640 --> 00:02:01,439
in this ancient teaching is that there's an understanding that the way we experience the body is

19
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,479
variable and it's almost as if we have different bodies at different times so

20
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:13,160
there are some people who uh can talk about the pain

21
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:20,280
body whole relationship to our body and how the body can feel can be very dramatic when there's a lot of pain

22
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:26,879
there's the the fear body and when there's fear and anxiety the physiology

23
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:33,000
of fear and this not just psychology of it but physiology of It kind of shifts

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,239
and changes how our body feels and the experience of body is very different

25
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:45,200
maybe that's what part of the purpose of fear is to get our get us connected to the body in a way that we can fight uh

26
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:53,159
you know we can it activates us to do something about it protect ourselves or fight or hide or do something so the

27
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:58,360
body get you know wants to be engaged and um there's the angry body I

28
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:05,159
don't know if ever any of you have been super duper anger angry at something and you know the whole body is kind of on

29
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:11,040
fire and tense or something and um there's also things

30
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,560
called like the Bliss body that uh sometimes in meditation is

31
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,159
felt kind of very clearly that the whole experience of being in a body is just

32
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,319
saturated with a feeling of Happiness of Joy or Bliss just like

33
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:34,080
pervasive some of these bodies we can experience assemblage of the psychological and physiological

34
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:41,239
processes and as they interact um makes the body feel really tight and there's a lot of focus on particular areas of the

35
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:46,480
body and and kind of a narrowing and a tightening of the focus perhaps and

36
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,799
others uh the the focus on the body gets much more suus of and Broad and and uh

37
00:03:52,799 --> 00:04:00,799
there's a feeling of almost um no particular sharp boundaries even of the body the body feels very kind of a

38
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:06,159
porous in a certain way and in some schools of Buddhism they

39
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:14,040
talk about the Dharma body uh that uh people experience in meditation that something about

40
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:20,840
meditation starts shifting and changing our relationship to our body and even beginning meditators can feel that

41
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:28,160
usually a little bit um if the if they're chronically tense and they sit down to meditate and the shoulders drop

42
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,560
drop a millimeter or two oh look the experience of the body has changed and

43
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:41,120
um it maybe some kind of tension that we car for a long time the for a while and meditation disappears

44
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:48,479
entirely it certainly did for me uh when I after some years of meditation I held

45
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,840
my belly chronically tight I held it in and when I sat down to meditate that's

46
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:01,639
when I discovered that and so I would relax it and that was very successful for about a second

47
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,280
and then uh it would tighten up and so I didn't worry about it too much I just would relax it a few times in the

48
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:14,479
sitting and then I didn't make it a project and so in that and but then after I don't know how many years three

49
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:21,080
four years of regular meditation I noticed one day oh it is not tightening up anymore now it's just staying relaxed

50
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,880
the whole time and and that affected my experience of breathing and the breathing body how breathing felt

51
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:33,759
through my body shifted and changed because it wasn't being restricted anymore by the tight tight

52
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:41,000
belly um the um for many years I teach a a chaplaincy

53
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,160
training program and for many years uh we would take the students to an anatomy

54
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,199
lab at at a community college and we had this wonderful uh

55
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,639
Professor there who was she was like so in we were all inspired the part of the

56
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:05,319
reason to go there was just to meet her and um and she would do this very

57
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:11,039
respectful uh introduction to us to the various peoples whose bodies were there

58
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:19,880
that uh we would then study and uh various stages of dis

59
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:25,080
dissection and uh for chaplains it was partly the reason to do it was that

60
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:31,240
chaplains uh will often go into situations where there's a you know

61
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:38,039
dramatic things have happened to people's bodies they've been injured or hurt or their die or dying and in the

62
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:44,880
hospitals and so chaplain need to have some familiarity with that world uh chaplain me to need to have familiarity

63
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:51,720
with death and dying they need to have some degree of familiarity that gives them a degree of comfort with it not

64
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:58,120
Comfort but ease or certainly not tense and reactive and

65
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,440
um and this surprising you know and also part of chapy training is to discover

66
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,720
where people are going to be reactive before they go to offer spiritual care

67
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:15,560
to someone so it doesn't work if you're there giving spiritual care for someone and you

68
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,879
faint or if you you know start crying yourself and you're more more grieving

69
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:28,240
more than the the griever that you're supposed to help so you have to kind of really see yourself know yourself well

70
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:34,919
and have been able to process and gotten wise about your own way of your own you

71
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:40,800
know inner life I remember one of the toughest people made all the

72
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,919
presentations of being a really tough guy meet sweetheart of a man but just

73
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,120
tough kind of like he had this he grew up as an in inner city guy

74
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:57,520
and with violence and kind of a little bit of gangs and just like carried himself with a dialect that was tough

75
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:04,039
and you know got your attention kind of when he spoke doing chaplain SC and um

76
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:13,120
so he was the one who fainted in the an an anatomy

77
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:19,720
lab so uh so we will go to thead lab and and uh and uh we would see these this

78
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:25,319
for these are for the students there who are going to become nurses or doctors and they they learn how to dissect the

79
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:30,639
body and so there was all these bodies usually there were two or three of them there at any one time and they would

80
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,719
open them up and some of them were quite open you you just and um and every time

81
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:41,279
I went there and we open we looked into an a a torso that had been opened up so

82
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,760
you can see all the organs inside uh I was always surprised there's

83
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:54,560
no space in there it's like packed in there with kidneys and intestines and hearts and

84
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:01,560
all this stuff like wow like it's and um and the reason I'm surprised is that

85
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:09,360
when I sit and meditate I have a lot of space inside I mean it's like really spacious

86
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,040
in there and what's going on you know do I just have physiologically different am

87
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:21,279
I kind of like strange you know maybe I have teeny teeny little intestines

88
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,480
and you know so there's lot of space you know probably has something to

89
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,680
do with how many nerves you have and maybe you know the nerves that are there

90
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:37,279
for you know the intestines and kidneys and all that are very different than the

91
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,560
nerves elsewhere so I don't have a strong inner proprioception of the body inside and so

92
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,680
when I didn't close my eyes I I'm not really aware of the all that stuff

93
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:53,760
that's packed in there so it's but what happens as I sit and meditate uh it

94
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,959
becomes more and more spacious in there and more and more relaxed and open and

95
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:05,880
um and so uh sometimes it feels like like my the inside of my body feels you know

96
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:11,000
bigger than this room just like wow just like so much

97
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,440
space why that is I don't you know it's it's I know it's not literally true I

98
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:23,839
mean it's kind of to take that as literal truth is kind of silly but it does speak maybe to uh a very powerful

99
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:29,320
sense that we have very significant uh sense St we have which not part of the

100
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,640
usual five senses but that is our spatial awareness spatial awareness is

101
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:40,079
partly constructed and we close our eyes and you can imagine a size of a room you can

102
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:46,079
imag some people can imagine uh even the route through a city they can kind of get a sense of the space and the

103
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:51,519
distance and all those things and so uh when when there's in meditation when

104
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:57,760
there's the sense of um Concepts and ideas and preoccupations that the Mind

105
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,839
focuses on are no no longer focusing on things that way and the mind doesn't

106
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:08,760
have this kind of these all these object of concern that they're preoccupied with

107
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:14,120
then awareness kind of begins maybe sometimes takes kind of as an object

108
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,200
some kind of spatial awareness and since there's no objects in that spatial

109
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,240
awareness space becomes bigger and bigger and it can feel really really

110
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,160
peaceful and Broad to have the spatial awareness and um and it's kind of

111
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,399
wondrous sometimes and it provides a very different reference point for what

112
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:41,839
goes on in us in our mind psychologically it's because it becomes it's you can only start feeling that

113
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:48,240
really in acute way if we're not totally preoccupied with whatever we're PR

114
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,920
preoccupied with um uh maybe all of you have finished

115
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,760
your taxes that's why so so people who are not here today you know they're

116
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,800
still preoccupied at home and but you guys have maybe or maybe I shouldn't

117
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:11,920
have said anything now you will be preoccupied and won't listen

118
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:19,040
anymore and uh the um and so we have these preoccupations again very

119
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:25,800
intense and you know we some we discover that when we sit down to meditate it's one of the values of meditation to

120
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:33,040
discover what we're preoccupied with and what the mind is concerned with and sometimes if you relax a little bit the

121
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:39,360
surface kind of agitation of the mind then you discover these deeper preoccupations concerns the mind is all

122
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:46,199
about that needs to be resolved it needs to we think it needs to be resolved and so we're kind of we start discovering so

123
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:53,760
much more about ourselves when we start getting quieter and to have this kind of spacious feeling of being present here

124
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:59,440
um that's it's kind of like having a very quiet still body of water and then

125
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,959
you have a little uh fish or turtle or something that that comes and it's fin

126
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:11,199
or something kind of at kind of comes up out of the surface and mix a Rings he oh

127
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:17,560
there's life in there otherwise you didn't see it oh there's something in there so the mind gets quiet and then

128
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:22,760
something comes up oh look look at that that um you wouldn't have seen if the

129
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:29,160
mind was completely full of waves and uh but but so you see something different as you kind of see what's under the

130
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:35,399
surface sometimes so this is a long introduction to read to read you a

131
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:41,880
poem the the um it's the English translator trans gave it the title of a

132
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:47,800
ballad I'm not going to try to sing it but it's uh it's written by um or

133
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:55,720
composed by aanm and this aan means teacher in Thai and it's um moon is uh was an extremely

134
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:03,279
important teacher in the in the 20 Century I think he died in the late

135
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:11,959
1940s and uh some people attributed him to the as the Rev reev re not reviler

136
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:18,440
revor of um of a certain kind of uh strong powerful meditation tradition in

137
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:25,759
Thailand and revivor of understanding experientially how far this path of

138
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:34,199
Awakening can go that he was somehow fully awakened as a as a individual and he was a forest Monk

139
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:41,920
and so he at some point in in his adult life he disappeared into the forest and spent decades living in the forest very

140
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:49,000
poor in very poor circumstance but living as a monastic doing lots of practice I think he felt that uh the

141
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,560
existence existing scholarly focus of Thai Buddhism variety of things uh there

142
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:02,000
wasn't anybody who could teach him how to meditate in some deep way and um so he went off and spent years decades

143
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,839
meditating and then um he started attracting students and uh and they he

144
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:16,279
transformed their students kind of opened the door for them to go deep into practice and and um and one of his

145
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:24,279
students was aan Sha aan Sha is the teacher for Jack cornfield for aano aan

146
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:30,839
soito very the whole school of um of uh monks and late people studied with him

147
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:36,959
and came back to the west and and in some ways IMC is partly a continuation

148
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:43,800
of of that momentum created by this this man aanm the story of aan CHA was that

149
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:50,399
uh he had been a monk for many years and he and he heard about this man and uh so

150
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,560
he went looking for him and it took he had

151
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:01,759
to walk for a few months uh I think up into Northern Thailand

152
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:09,440
into the forest looking for him and it wasn't just got Uber and just took took you take me to aan Moon back then it was

153
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,560
like you had to be pretty determined that you know there was no you know to

154
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:20,399
find someone like that you had to be pretty determined and ask around and keep walking and and then when he

155
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:27,240
finally found him he spent three days with him and those three days trans transformed him and gave him a clear

156
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:34,279
sense of how to continue his practice and and uh then then uh so a there was no

157
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:40,399
you know living in the forest there was almost no records of him and he didn't write apparently much or all or very

158
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:47,759
little and so so mostly we have stories about him but he there was this one thing called The Ballad of Liberation

159
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:55,040
from the kandas from the and um B Ballad of

160
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:02,560
Liberation and um maybe you'll understand when I get to this one part of it in the middle why I gave the

161
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:09,640
introduction I gave and also the the uh I think there's

162
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:16,000
some idiosyncratic maybe tie ways in which it was written so the pronouns are

163
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,038
not so clear to who's being talked about I've tried to inter I interpret it one

164
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:26,798
way that um and it's uh the first half of it is either about himself or it's

165
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:32,360
about the Buddha and the second half is um it's not so clear who's being

166
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:40,440
addressed and who's doing the speaking but so i' so I just adjusted a little bit to make one interpretation and for

167
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:47,679
this purposes here that part of it is not that important once there was a

168
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:53,720
Man Who Loved himself and feared

169
00:17:53,720 --> 00:18:01,640
distress he wanted happiness beyond the reach of danger so he wandered

170
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:07,120
endlessly wherever people said that happiness was found he longed to

171
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:15,159
go but wandering took a long long time he was the sort of Man Who Loved

172
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:22,679
himself and really dreaded death he truly wanted release from aging

173
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:28,240
and mortality then one day he came to know

174
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,440
the truth abandoning the cause of

175
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:41,280
suffering he found a Cave of Wonders of endless

176
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:47,320
happiness the body as he gazed throughout the Cave of

177
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:54,080
Wonders his suffering was destroyed his fears appeased he gazed and gazed around

178
00:18:54,080 --> 00:19:00,440
the mountain side experiencing unbounded peace but then there were others afraid

179
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:06,400
of death their hearts all withered and discouraged they came to me and spoke

180
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,559
frankly in a pitiful way they said you've made an effort at your meditation

181
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:20,480
for a long time now have you seen it yet the true Dharma Dharma of your

182
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:28,400
dreams they asked to stay with me so I agreed and I said to them I'll take you

183
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:35,320
to to a massive mountain with a Cave of Wonders free from suffering and stress

184
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:42,280
mindfulness immersed in the body you can view it at your leisure to

185
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:47,600
cool your heart and end your troubles this is the path of the noble

186
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:56,280
lineage it's up to you to go or not so the Cave of Wonders isn't that I

187
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:01,919
thought that was a delightful expression of your body is your body a Cave of

188
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,760
Wonders or is just a cave it's not even a cave it's just like a you know it just

189
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:13,000
packed full of intestines and spleens and pancreas

190
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:22,200
and the um Cave of Wonders the

191
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:29,520
um some people have such complicated relationships with their body some people hate their bodies are ashamed of

192
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,640
bodies and these are all ways of kind of relating to the body as an object which

193
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:41,400
in a certain kind of way is from the outside in even though it's you know in inside your mind but it's kind of as

194
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:47,960
objectifying the body and what's being talked about here is uh a very deep

195
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:53,679
subjective experience of the body which is freed from the

196
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,840
objectifications from the judgments from the comparisons we have compar comping

197
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:04,960
our our body with others or with ideals how it should be and so that's one of the things that happens in meditation

198
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:12,840
that can happen not only do we see clearly what we're doing in our mind but the Mind quiets down becomes quieter and

199
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:19,480
quieter and after a while uh the way we get tricked into believing our thoughts

200
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:24,799
or tricked into being hijacked by our thoughts and our ideas and our judgments

201
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:30,559
and like have to keep thinking this lessons and it's not an easy switch to

202
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:36,840
make be uh in daily life because I mean still I've been doing this for so long

203
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:42,919
meditation uh I still am tricked by my mind I'm just going along and thinking

204
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:49,320
my thoughts and you know thinking mostly he's innocent enough but thinking about all the activities of the day and what I

205
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:55,640
have to do and um and uh I take it for granted I think I take this idea that's

206
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,799
business as usual that's how it is I mean it's like like you know it's

207
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:07,440
like this you know I don't question it I just kind of oh this is this is how things are and just I have to kind of go

208
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,720
along with how it is and then I sit down to meditate and I realize no I don't

209
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:20,000
have to do that uh it's not business as usual that was a particular way of being caught up in thoughts and activities and

210
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,600
that there's a whole other way of being that those get quiet and that not so caught in them some people have never learned that

211
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:33,880
and so they think think that chasing their thoughts being chased by their thoughts spinning around thinking over

212
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:39,760
and over again and concerned and worrying um is the way to be and that's

213
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,880
has to be that way it's kind of the truth of how things are and um and some

214
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,360
of those ways self-perpetuating you have a thought and that's uncomfortable and

215
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:56,600
that triggers another thought and another thought the same thought over again and over again and it just kind of

216
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:03,640
you know just seems we and we're blind Ed by the blinded by our thoughts by the thoughts blinded from our thoughts by

217
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:10,200
the fact that we're thinking so much so then to quiet to allow to

218
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:18,480
not you know live in the hegemony of thinking to let the quiet become

219
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:26,520
peaceful and then the Cave of Wonders I read this poem last week

220
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:32,840
and I sat down one day and I yeah that's Cave of Wonders in there it's pretty

221
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:37,200
cool the next day I sat down

222
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,679
nope and the next day it felt like oh the door's

223
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:50,600
closed and okay so I just have to sit at sit at the door and what the door was I I think I was I was caught in certain

224
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,919
things and somehow i' been living a day was kind of full of activities and so I

225
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:02,000
was kind of uh a little bit kind of tense little bit caught up a little bit

226
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:09,320
not quite in my you know settled and and so that the door wasn't

227
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:14,679
the cave wasn't opening and so I sat and just breathed and was present at the

228
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:22,480
door meaning meaning I stood where the tension was where the resistance was where I was kind of held tight and okay

229
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:29,080
that's the name of the game today so I was quite content to just do that way I don't have problem with that and so I

230
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:34,720
just sat there and sat there and by the door and and then after a while the door

231
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:42,279
opened and then then I was invited in invited into the Cave of Wonders and

232
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:47,840
this Spa this this spacious open place

233
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:53,559
where the eyes that see see

234
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:59,240
differently the eyes of the mind that can see you know that sees what's happening within us

235
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:06,640
and even our physical eyes how we see the world uh depends a lot on the filters

236
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:14,399
through which we see and if we're seeing through aversion then a lot of things in the

237
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:22,200
world are wrong if we see through the uh through the lens of Desire of our desires then

238
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:28,000
we a lot of things in our world are desirable and we have a clear sense of and disinterest in what is undesirable

239
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:35,919
kind of like we're dividing the world up what satisfies my desires and what doesn't and um if we see the world

240
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,960
through fear we might see a lot of danger if we see the world through

241
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,000
confidence maybe we don't see as much danger in the world and so same thing if

242
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,919
you look within if we live in the world of fear what we feel inside can be a source of

243
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:58,440
danger and um and uh you know can we can see Danger

244
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:05,279
things in there if we see with aversion the same thing if we see with desire if we see

245
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:11,720
with conceit uh this conceit is such a complicated world that that uh when we

246
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:17,880
see through the world of conceit we might get depressed we might see oh this is everything's bad about me or it could

247
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:23,960
be that we get kind of hyped up and like everything's good about me and people better start praising me because you

248
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:30,240
know I'm like the hottest Cave of wonder in town

249
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:38,000
and so the U and so we see through these filters

250
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,279
and um what happens when you don't have the filters what happens if we kind of see

251
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:49,679
without conceit without fear without aversion without desires things get

252
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:55,720
simpler and that's when uh I think we start seeing um some of the Wonder

253
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:02,000
Wonders that exist within us we do have the capacity for love we do have the

254
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,919
capacity for peace we do have the capacity for calm and equinity we do

255
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:15,480
have the capacity for kindness we do have the capacity for wisdom we have

256
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:22,480
these amazing capacities that seem to thrive when the rest of us is not

257
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:29,600
preoccupied where rest of us is not limiting ourselves through a particular

258
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:35,600
um unfortunate lenses perspectives that we live in all the time and how do you

259
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:42,200
know what is an unfortunate lens and some of you say well fear is a necessary and important

260
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:48,600
thing how do we know one way we know is not by having an opinion about it or a

261
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:54,360
policy about what's right and wrong to way to be but we start getting quiet

262
00:27:54,360 --> 00:28:01,399
enough to see for ourselves to experience for ourselves um this activity that's going on is

263
00:28:01,399 --> 00:28:08,080
extra this activity is not really useful to be doing let's quiet down so to use

264
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:13,600
fear for example um I've had anxiety in my life

265
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,640
that as as I got clearer the mindfulness you can see I could see this is not the

266
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:24,000
anxiety which has any real reality it's it's kind of built on all kinds of kind

267
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,120
of quick sand of strange ideas and this one I can just settle settle out it's

268
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:38,840
okay to quiet down and I've had other fears where I thought oh this is reasonable to be afraid here and uh and

269
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:44,080
so then uh it becomes my friend and I have a friendly relationship to that to

270
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:49,120
that fear I think it's keeping me safe in certain situations sometimes I have a

271
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:55,600
little bit of fear when I'm driving sometimes a lot when there's you know depending on other

272
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:02,120
drivers but uh a little bit of fear when driving and um and um and I just take it

273
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:08,080
as my friend it's trying to keep me safe and I think that as I'm getting older now I think I'm having a little bit more

274
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:15,320
fear as I drive and I I come to the it's kind of like why is that I'm a little more attentive and

275
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:21,320
hped up and I why am I more afraid and I suspect maybe this is pop psychology but

276
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:28,399
I suspect that it's because as I get older my reaction time is slower and so it's actually a while

277
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:34,919
thing to have a little bit more fear as I get older my system knows something here knows what's going on more than I

278
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:40,519
do and so always makes sense to have a little bit of fear so it's my friend that's taking care of

279
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:46,320
me so there's a way in which we become wiser about all these things maybe it's

280
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:53,440
it's wise sometimes to have aversion but it's never wise to have hostility and so you can feel sometimes

281
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,960
the difference of uh turning away and saying no not to something versus being hostile

282
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:05,559
and so as we we as we live in this Cave of Wonder as a degree of Peace of calm

283
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:12,279
of openness of spaciousness um it provides a very different reference point a very powerful reference point

284
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:19,919
where we can see these details of what's driving us in the operating systems to see it in a fresh way in a new way but

285
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:25,880
the cost of doing that is to temporarily stop

286
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:30,960
investing so much value and importance and and

287
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:37,880
urgency around the thoughts you the thinking that's objectifying you objectifying the

288
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:44,000
world just spinning and world creating worlds cathedrals of edifices of

289
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,000
constructed thought we have to somehow be able to calm that down enough and one

290
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:57,399
and to calm it down enough we have to know that we're part of us is no longer addicted

291
00:30:57,399 --> 00:31:03,320
to the thought part of us knows this is not as important as it thinks it

292
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:10,240
is that doesn't mean it's going to stop or slow down but as long as you are believe in thinking and you're investing

293
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:16,600
in your thoughts and going along with them and think they're really telling you the important stories and important

294
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:25,960
things um they are sometimes I don't want to dismiss the value but this o overinvestment in thinking has to stop

295
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:31,720
if we want to kind of see what's going on more

296
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:39,480
clearly and um so

297
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:46,080
um I this the one story occurs to me

298
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:51,760
was um many years ago now 30 years ago or

299
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:58,639
something I thought it'd be nice to watch football on TV and

300
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:03,840
you know I had friends who watched football and loved it and the 49ers were doing better

301
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:11,159
then I guess they're doing okay now but uh but so I was um um and I

302
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:19,120
found myself pulled into the world of the football game and I thought I enjoyed it but when it was over I just

303
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:25,200
felt miserable I felt I felt uh agitated I felt tight I had a little bit of a

304
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,399
headache I gotten too invested too in involved in the game somehow other

305
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:37,200
people can watch it and not have that investment and maybe enjoy it more than I did but uh but what struck me was that

306
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:43,039
um I didn't know I wasn't attentive to myself to to see the cost of how I was

307
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:49,720
watching while I was watching it was only when it was over that I saw the cost I saw that I think I did it a

308
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:56,799
little bit wrong here it must be another way to do this and um so that's so this this uh we

309
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:02,480
often don't understand the cost of how we're living Our Lives running our lives thinking at all

310
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:08,159
this and now so this disinvestment enough so that we can

311
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:15,600
start calming down and relaxing and centering ourselves in our body centering ourselves in the body's

312
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:23,320
experience of our life centering ourselves so the body has a chance to have space to relax one of

313
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:29,320
the ways I think of meditation is we're giving um space mindfulness is what

314
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:35,799
gives space to our experience so whatever we're mindful of it's almost like we're making a room for it to be

315
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:42,320
there freely so if we feel pain we're making room for the pain to be there if we have tension we're making room for

316
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:48,440
the tension to be there if we have calm we make room for the calm to be there

317
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:53,639
we're making room for things and the things which are there because of of

318
00:33:53,639 --> 00:34:00,039
clinging and attachment and and kind of being wrapped up around things when there's more room for them they

319
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:06,039
tend to unwind the things that are are there because it's

320
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:13,118
the emergence of wisdom emergence of some of the deeper Wellsprings of goodness that

321
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:19,398
we have when they have space they spread and so there's a spreading of

322
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:26,040
goodness spreading of the wholesome qualities and the suffusion and one of the values of

323
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:33,079
making space and room for things is that uh is to say it in

324
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:40,320
shth hand it tends to unwind the tensions and spread the

325
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:47,720
joys kind of suffusing us through through the body

326
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:54,398
so the Cave of Wonders so this man a janmon went traveling all over Thailand

327
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:59,599
to visit other teachers and to practice and to find an answer of how to be happy

328
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:06,240
and in the end he found it at himself he found it in his own Cave of Wonders and

329
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:13,680
that's what he taught to find you each have a Cave of Wonders within and uh

330
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:19,160
wouldn't it be nice to be able to visit that a place

331
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:25,280
where there he as he writes there's Un unbounded Peace and I love it that he

332
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:31,160
talks about that that he looked around he he gazed and gazed around the

333
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:38,800
mountain side experiencing unbounded peace all the Time in the World to gaze

334
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:47,960
around this Cave of Wonders and see the peace that's there so those are my thoughts today and

335
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:53,319
um we have a few minutes before we usually end so if anyone has any

336
00:35:53,319 --> 00:36:00,200
questions or comments or testimonials about the their Cave of

337
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:13,359
Wonder thanks hi my name is jeie and uh I would

338
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:21,240
just like to I don't know argue might not be the right word but to um say that

339
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:28,640
I don't think it's fear that's making you drive differently

340
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:35,880
I I think it's caution perhaps but and wisdom because I mean I too know that I

341
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:44,640
don't have the capacities that I had 30 years ago or 20 years ago and so I'm more cautious but I don't

342
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:50,920
feel fear great great well I I appreciate that a lot what you said and uh it depends these what's so

343
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:57,040
fascinating is how we different people have different reference points for these words and you know the words the

344
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,480
words don't have the kind of clearly defined meaning that we think they do

345
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:09,599
right and they're just sounds we make and so so for you that that's an

346
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:15,200
important distinction for me I think of caution as a subcategory of fear so but

347
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:21,240
you know I'm not going to say I'm right and or you're right it just but I I very much appreciate the distinction because

348
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:29,519
I think your distinction might help some people to um to see clear more clearly what's happening inside of them

349
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,800
William

350
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:45,520
yeah hi Gil um could you speak more about vamba Kaya can you hold it like us

351
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:51,440
yeah could you speak more about vamb Gaya but bliss body this the uh Sakaya

352
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:58,800
yeah so in it's not in our tradition but in the Mahayana tradition they have this idea of usually

353
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,720
it's the three bodies of Buddha the three kayas of the Buddha and the nman Kaya

354
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:12,800
Buddha sodar Kaya Buddha and the Dharma Kaya Buddha and um and if we apply it

355
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,960
kind of to to how it is in our tradition these three

356
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:23,560
categories the first it kind of uh by calling it a Buddha it kind of

357
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:28,920
makes it sacred kind of special and wonderful that we can be have a Buddha

358
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:35,520
body and um n monakaya is uh just kind of the body that we ordinarily have and

359
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:41,359
for many of us we sometimes call it a karmic body a karmic body is that body

360
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:46,800
we experience that's the product of a lifetime of karmic activities choices

361
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,000
we've made attachments we've had reaction re activities we've had uh

362
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,760
policies we've had um I I don't know I was I remember there was I was told that

363
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:04,400
it was read somewhere it was Abraham Lincoln who wrote that by the time a person's 50 or 60 they're responsible

364
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:11,480
for their face because of uh how they lived their

365
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:16,920
lives you know with their attitudes and their smiles and frowns and you know how

366
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:24,160
they consistently are attitudes they have it affects you know we all these little micr muscles that we have and and

367
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:30,319
um you know affects us and but that's true think with languages we speak different people speak different

368
00:39:30,319 --> 00:39:36,560
languages consistently have slightly different physiology in the face because of what microm muscles are used for

369
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:45,720
those speaking those languages and um the um so uh so the the ordinary

370
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:52,040
first is the ordinary experience and then uh uh in meditation then at some

371
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:59,119
point as meditations deepens uh there's experience of of a bliss body Joy bodies

372
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:04,920
which is the the body of of uh enjoyment that we really en enjoy being in the

373
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:10,119
body just filled with enjoyment and and it's quite sometimes qu especially if

374
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:15,359
you get concentrated quite remarkable to feel that it's like every cell is

375
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:20,920
dripping with happiness or Joy or fusing spreading through the

376
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:26,839
body and um and uh but that's not the end point that's just a part of the

377
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:31,880
process of the path of letting go to experience that and then the dharmakaya

378
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:36,960
the Dharma body is the body of Freedom so when we've really let go of any

379
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:46,040
clinging and attachment and so that there's no more any um being closed being resistant being

380
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:51,119
preoccupied being um caught up in things there's a very different experience

381
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:58,720
that's not Blissful exactly not the conventional kind of Joy but there's this wonderful F thing of just feeling

382
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:07,119
this tremendous ease or peace of being free and um and that would be the

383
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:16,480
dharmakaya thank you you can my the mic down

384
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:27,599
there thanks for the talk you um I wonder if you can share a little bit

385
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:34,400
wisdom on how to distinguish uh useful aversion from

386
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:42,800
hostility and uh um like what kind of aversion still can be accompanied by

387
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:49,440
peace feeling of peace and ease yeah the reason I ask is it kind of remind

388
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,760
me um one of those difficult dis

389
00:41:54,760 --> 00:42:03,000
distinguishing I have been um try to to feel more is sometimes when I make

390
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:11,000
certain effort whether that's wholen like helpful prevention or

391
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,359
maintainance of wholen condition or I'm just running away or attacking the

392
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:23,960
circumstance that I'm involved yeah thank you your asking is a very important question and I think each

393
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:30,640
person some ways has to discover that for themselves but you know I can give some broad broad

394
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:37,240
category broad ideas for for you to explore um the English word

395
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:44,119
aversion uh mean it kind of means uh to avert avert means in Latin to turn away

396
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:49,880
so there are times when it's really appropriate to turn away from something if you put your hand on the hot stove

397
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:57,200
it's appropriate to have a ver you know don't to have a version don't sit there and ask a question is that hostility or

398
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:05,240
ver verion you know only move your hand when you've decided um but the the um you know the

399
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:10,480
avert from danger for example is a healthy thing to do to invert from

400
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:18,240
something which is uh unhealthy for us or that's not you know not appropriate for us to do is healthy thing to do to

401
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:25,079
to have aversion for a certain kind of aversion where we want to avert we say no and we pull back I don't want to do

402
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:32,040
that uh doing uh une ethical things that harm people this is a health it's actually a healthy movement to

403
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:37,200
have the um but we use the uh we use

404
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:43,160
Buddhist English we tend to use the word aversion to involve uh not just simply a

405
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:49,119
healthy averting but we tend to use it to to be a mixture of hostility and

406
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:56,640
averting there's a kind of judgment and like this is wrong that's bad that's terrible or it's a kind of a it tends to

407
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:01,680
have a kind of a very negative uh uh kind of painful

408
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:08,040
like having having uh darts in her eyes like you're terrible and so we are kind

409
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:13,200
of hurting people we we uh where there's a hostility a little bit built into it

410
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:19,920
and hostility means that we're trying to we want to hurt someone uh we want we want to destroy

411
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:25,960
them or throw them away or get them away or you know you know jab them and with

412
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:33,599
verbal daggers you know be say mean things just to kind of get them and so the one way to look

413
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:39,280
at is and and so a similar question the question you asked is the distinction between anger and

414
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:46,400
hostility does is all anger have hostility in it or is there anger which is there's no hostility you don't want

415
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:54,280
anybody you don't want anybody to be hurt um but you want to some things have to stop and so with certain ferocity we

416
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:59,880
say no but we do it with we might even have love for the person or we care for the

417
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:05,319
person and and but we we're not trying to you know get at them and but too

418
00:45:05,319 --> 00:45:11,920
often anger is a kind of hostility and so again it's it's where we want to cause harm for someone else in some way

419
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:17,319
or other that does that help you think to your investigation

420
00:45:17,319 --> 00:45:26,119
yes I love uh the analogy is like you said uh thoughts in your eyes and uh

421
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:32,680
Theo like verbal thank you so much thank

422
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:40,359
you okay well thank you for being here and uh it is the usual time for stopping

423
00:45:40,359 --> 00:45:46,079
and you know is really nice when people you say hello to each other at least for for me they hear you talking and saying

424
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:52,680
hello so if you're at all inclined to say hello to a couple of people next to you and say hello little bit and and uh

425
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:59,440
