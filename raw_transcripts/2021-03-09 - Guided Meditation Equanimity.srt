1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,720
so hello everyone who is here today with the youtube and

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,639
listening maybe into the future as well

3
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,840
and then some ways we span

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:24,320
geography across the globe and we also spend time into the future with how these

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:32,559
recordings work it's kind of an amazing thing that we share and feel a connection to so much

6
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:42,399
there are some maybe some of you have heard me say many times i like to divide our experience of life

7
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,840
what goes on in with our life moment by moment into two

8
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:54,480
areas there is what is happening and there is how we are with what is

9
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:02,320
happening or our relationship to what's happening and mindfulness practice i put in the

10
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:11,040
lighter camp mindfulness is a practice of showing up and being attentive to what is happening

11
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,960
and to engage in mindfulness with equanimity

12
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:23,759
has the function of staying with the mindfulness staying

13
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,880
with a relaxed dedicated sincere attention to this moment

14
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:35,119
attention to nexus being present being available for the flow of the present moment as it

15
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:41,280
keeps appearing and arising for us moment by moment and

16
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,880
and one thing that helps to have equanimity to just stay present stay with the

17
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:53,439
mindfulness moment by moment is to not think that you are unique

18
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,799
that uh not think that you're that what your experience is

19
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:06,079
is unique enough that it's an exception to what all humans experience

20
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:13,200
not to dismiss what you have what's happening to you or make it not to make it kind of unimportant

21
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:20,560
everything is important you're important but what's also important is the steadiness of how we

22
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,000
are the steadiness of mindfulness when we're practicing mindfulness to not

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,080
it's kind of like we have the bumper sticker that says i stop for nothing when i practice

24
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,480
mindfulness meaning i don't get involved and get entangled and start thinking about things and

25
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,160
just a bare recognition oh this is what's happening now this is what's happening and or

26
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,720
available to experience this is what's experiencing this is what's known now this is what's being experienced now

27
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,879
just steady steady steady like when i went on a walking pilgrimage

28
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,920
a good number of years ago and it was only two weeks but

29
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,159
the idea was just keep walking when we walked just keep walking and walking and walking

30
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:15,599
didn't matter what the ex experience around us was just you walk and you walk so we

31
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,879
are mindful we're aware we're aware with equanimity that allows us to just

32
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:26,720
continue without getting sidetracked without getting stopping for something and getting

33
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:35,519
entangled and retro retrospective thinking so to

34
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:41,519
begin this pilgrimage of mindfulness pilgrimage where

35
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:50,080
we don't we don't walk we sit we remain stationary in a

36
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,280
stationary posture that works for you

37
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:05,760
and to tenderly close your eyes

38
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:15,840
and maybe tenderly in your heart open to yourself

39
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,680
closing your eyes and opening your heart

40
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:32,320
and taking a few moments to appreciate yourself and value yourself

41
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:40,800
that perhaps that is why we're meditating because we value our well-being

42
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,600
and this is a way of finding a valuable important form of

43
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,360
well-being happiness freedom from suffering

44
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,479
and to take a few long slow deep breaths

45
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:11,680
and exhales really settling in here with yourself in yourself

46
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:18,560
for yourself here in this body

47
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:25,840
here in this heart

48
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,919
here in this belly

49
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,240
and then to let your breathing return to normal

50
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:55,039
and because of maybe with a sense of self-care self-appreciation

51
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:03,919
to as you exhale to continue to relax what can be relaxed in your body

52
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:21,840
face shoulders stomach belly

53
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,560
and then letting then settling in just to your breathing

54
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,319
no walking pilgrimage it's the feet that walk

55
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,919
it is a stationary pilgrimage of meditation

56
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:17,840
can you it's your breathing breathing in and breathing out

57
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:26,400
and to have the simplicity of breathing be something that we

58
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,800
allow to come into our awareness

59
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,200
a simple sea of breathing is where awareness lands

60
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:45,279
two metaphors for awareness awareness which receives allows

61
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:52,959
awareness which lands connects whichever is

62
00:08:52,959 --> 00:09:01,200
most useful for you and then with equanimity

63
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,720
that doesn't get alarmed or caught up or annoyed or

64
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:13,760
think that something is unique and not part of the practice

65
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,839
everything is part of practice everything is for the next moment of

66
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:27,279
awareness to trust it's enough

67
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:35,200
just to be aware to trust to just take the next moment

68
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,200
for what it is even if it's very similar to the previous one

69
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:50,720
just stay stay

70
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:58,399
the equanimity that allows a steady continuation of the practice

71
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,000
come back to that continuity

72
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,519
if things are challenging

73
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,519
breathe with it so that your awareness

74
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,519
rides on the currents of breathing

75
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:33,839
relaxed available present for the experience without getting entangled

76
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:31,279
as you meditate nothing is extraordinary enough

77
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:39,920
to stop to think about or get involved in everything is ordinary enough

78
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,959
that it's just one more thing to be aware of to be mindful of

79
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:52,639
in a steady ongoing receptivity of awareness to what is one breath

80
00:16:52,639 --> 00:17:05,839
at a time

81
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,720
and then as we come to the end of this

82
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:56,480
sitting to tenderly calmly

83
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:03,279
open up to the sufferings of the world

84
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:07,760
and to do so equanimously

85
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,799
meaning that we care

86
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:20,720
we feel for the suffering we're concerned with it

87
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:28,799
and there's no need to give up the steadiness of our mindfulness

88
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:37,760
steadiness and confidence in remaining rooted in awareness

89
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:48,000
so that we don't get pulled into our reactivity our thinking our predictions

90
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,120
our sense of obligations and should and what shouldn't be

91
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,840
in equanimity it allows us to stay open

92
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:07,039
so that care and goodwill respect and kindness

93
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:14,639
can flow through that awareness through the field of mindfulness

94
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:25,120
and may it be that as we learn how to be more aware and mindfulness

95
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:31,760
more mindful with equanimity with calm with balance

96
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:38,480
may it be that we can show up for the challenges of this world

97
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:46,000
and stay close to our goodwill well-wishing kindness friendliness

98
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,559
compassion may all beings

99
00:29:52,720 --> 00:30:00,799
be happy may all beings be safe

100
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:09,840
peaceful and free and may my heart and mind

101
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,760
have this good will this well-wishing for others

102
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:25,039
so that in some way or other it spreads from me spreads from each of us into the world

103
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:33,278
that we encounter today may our love and compassion

104
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,159
spread from this meditation session out into our communities and out into

105
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:51,840
the world may all beings be happy

106
00:30:53,210 --> 00:31:03,529
