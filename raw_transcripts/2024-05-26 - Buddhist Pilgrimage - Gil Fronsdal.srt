1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:09,040
okay so today I would like to talk about Buddhist

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,040
pilgrimage and the Catalyst for that was I just finished doing a Buddhist

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:21,760
pilgrimage so it's very fresh in my mind and and very much a part of my heart and

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,760
so I'd like to just speak what's what's up for me the simplest definition maybe of a

5
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:36,160
pilgrimage um that I kind of like is that um a pilgrimage is where a outer

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:43,640
journey and an inner Journey um intersect and support each other and so

7
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,800
but conventionally pilgrimages are often relate uh associated with going to a

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,840
sacred site and so they're spiritual nature not everyone well some people

9
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,160
think that uh our life itself is a pilgrimage some people will call pilgrimage

10
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:10,000
something which is not necessarily spiritual but that's often the association and um I've been on I've

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,600
walked four pilgrimage routes in my life two of them

12
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,799
were not a pilgrimage for me there was other people's pilgrimage

13
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:29,560
routes so they were people of other religions would enter into it in a deep way because it was deeply connected to

14
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:35,880
their faith and I went along those partly because they were spiritual I felt to that was

15
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,240
an important part of why I was there but I didn't share the same spirituality as

16
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:47,799
them and so the Resonance of that part wasn't that strong for me and I've been on two which were

17
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:53,520
Buddhist pilgrimages and they were actually part of my faith part of my spirituality and

18
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,640
really felt be important parts of it and um one of them just ended two days ago

19
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,799
so so um that was quite lovely the

20
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:13,720
um uh so um so pilgrimages involved kind of

21
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:20,280
an inner and an outer aspect and uh and the outer one is one

22
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,800
that uh is connected to the places we go to the out outwardly one of the kind of

23
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,800
simple definitions of a added definition to a pilgrimage is uh walking to a

24
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,720
sacred site to a sacred Temple sacred place and then maybe walking back is

25
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:43,959
also part of the pilgrimage a pilgrimage is a time when you're we're separating ourselves from life as

26
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:50,120
usual and uh work and home and all these kinds of things that we leave behind so

27
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:56,040
we enter into kind of a different way of being in the world and it's little it's has a lot of

28
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,159
overlaps with going on a retreat where there're also the that we leave our home

29
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:06,440
behind we leave our work behind life as usual in order to be able to experience

30
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:12,040
life experience ourselves uh independent from the how those influence us or

31
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:18,120
condition us or or weigh us down or something and it takes a while both on a

32
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:25,720
pilgrimage and on a retreat to let ordinary life settle away to pass away and not be so pressing on us and then

33
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:31,439
something else can start happening the um

34
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:37,360
uh and so the pilgrimage that I just finished uh did have a kind of a sacred

35
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,720
site there was going to but it was both uh this pilgrimage began at a sacred

36
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:49,879
site and kind of ended at one and um and so we were walking between these two

37
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:55,879
places and on land that some people considered to be sacred land and um I'm

38
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:02,200
happy to call it that when I walked on it so um the sacred land was um Mount

39
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:08,040
Tamal payas in Moren County and um one of the people on the

40
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,120
pilgrimage with us uh was following in the foot in other times had done a lot

41
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,400
of following in the footsteps of a kind of a sacred pilgrimage that was started

42
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:24,639
by the beatniks that um Gary Snyder and different people in the 1960s started a

43
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,919
pilgrimage around uh Mount Tam circumambulating Mount Tam and that's

44
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:35,759
been going on for years and now I think it's kind of uh an abyss but but but

45
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:42,560
some of the one of the people I've been involved in has done that now a number of time and there's a book about it and she follows the route of the

46
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,919
book so she was on the right on the pilgrimage it was there was 10 10 of us doing it

47
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:55,759
together and um so and going from we went from from kind of over mount mount

48
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:01,280
alayas from Spirit Rock Meditation Center to green gold Center both

49
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:08,600
Buddhist centers where I've taught where I've practiced important places for me personally and and U I would consider

50
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,919
them sacred sites and uh and uh it was a wonderful

51
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:20,680
in both places uh we were uh offered Hospitality one of the characteristics

52
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,800
often of pilgrims pilgrimages the pilgrims are guests of everybody and

53
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,199
they're kind of uh received by the people who get along as and receive

54
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:40,160
Hospitality it's not always that way but but that's often uh one characteristic of it and so the the pilgrims usually go

55
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,639
with certain kind of humbleness um as a as you would guest into someone's house you don't go in

56
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:53,479
there and demand that they you know that instead of serving you um spinach salad

57
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:59,680
that should have been some other you know you know SP kind of the wrong kind of salad dressing you're using for me

58
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,039
here I demand you know like a restaurant you might go in and demand like it's you know something but you know you're a

59
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:13,160
guest someone's home there's a humility or humbleness and receptivity of being a guest so to be that kind of guest

60
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:18,880
walking through the lands and uh putting aside your status

61
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:25,960
for example with your work and your place and just being a kind of a humble person the word pilgrim comes from a

62
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:31,560
kind of a Latin word that kind of suggests being more like a servant

63
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:40,319
and um and so a certain kind of way of walking with Simplicity usually uh uh pilgrims don't go with a

64
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,919
lot and um so it was very nice because that's we received the hospitality from

65
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:51,599
Green Gulch first from Spirit Rock and uh we slept in the meditation Hall they

66
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:59,599
have you know nice residence halls but they were they didn't offer us that and U it was lovely then to sleep

67
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:07,240
the meditation Hall and and then uh when we came to Green Gulch Zen Center uh we also slept in

68
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:14,440
meditation Hall there and um and U the difference was at Spirit Rock um no one

69
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:21,120
was using meditation Hall the next morning at Green they wake up Bell starts in the meditation Hall at at

70
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:27,199
quter to 5: and it's we had to be out of there by then so we had to get up early

71
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:33,120
which was part of the charm of it all and then we slept two nights on Mount

72
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:42,440
Tam because we took our time with the walk and it's exquisitely beautiful and um so it was um uh so that

73
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:47,520
was that was the our our pilgrimage and

74
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,560
um and in the process to that the land played a very important role uh for us

75
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:59,599
certainly for me uh the land the trees we had a Bist along who told us little

76
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:07,759
bit about the plants as we went along and I learned that uh the redwood trees which are a big part of that area um are

77
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,319
Apparently one of the oldest continuously present species of living

78
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:19,440
beings on the planet and that uh the redwood trees as a Genus goes back to

79
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,879
the jurass uh Jurassic times so 200 million years ago and the species we

80
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:33,560
have go back to the crustacean time which could be about 100 million years ago and and coincidentally I learned

81
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:41,959
that a very big redb tree has a 100 million leaves it's kind of astounding to me and

82
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:47,760
uh the scale of time the scale of kind of complexity and the these redber trees

83
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,560
are so beautiful and so so so tall some of them that we saw and so the

84
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:59,079
pilgrimage in the scale of time that we're part of the scale of um and then

85
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:04,600
also to to see as we went along and botanist pointed it out so it stood out kind of

86
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:12,160
wonderfully that um um uh how the

87
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:18,680
plants uh are shaped by the environment they're in the way they were evolved and

88
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:24,160
you can clearly see that because all the understory plants they all you know they

89
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:30,800
have a problem with getting enough light so they're all flat going directly up to the sky and you can see how they were

90
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:38,120
all shap created in shapes that helped them find light and but because the larger trees were kind of it didn't

91
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,360
leave other choices for them to evolve and so this way that we're and so humans

92
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:50,560
as well we've evolved uh as as a species um conditioned by the land the

93
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,160
environment the natural world in which we've lived in and been in and so I as I

94
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:02,000
was walking along the pilgrimage I thought of uh one of American one of the

95
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,440
anthems of the United States for some people uh Woody Guthrie's uh song that

96
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:14,600
uh and but I had to CH I wanted to change the last the the refrain to

97
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:20,959
um this land uh made you and

98
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:26,880
me this is a land that made you and me if you've been here in the United States for more than seven

99
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,079
years probably to some degree or other you've been made by

100
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:38,920
this and uh it's very nice sound and

101
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:43,560
um so

102
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:49,079
um so the idea of going someplace and then walking and there's something about

103
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:54,160
walking the movement of walking the sematic experience of walking that

104
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:01,360
loosen us loosens us up it creates a kind of different different way of being on the land than driving a car is a

105
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,480
different way of Being Alive walking outdoors in beautiful natural

106
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:14,480
environment then um and then then being um where the real estate is a computer

107
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,480
screen you know that's a very small piece of real estate to spend the time with everything focused on which some

108
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:27,000
people work that way and spend hours each day doing focusing on this little screen the little piece of real estate

109
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,880
that calls on so little of our phys ology a little of our body and our senses and experience of life and uh and

110
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:41,600
who we are in relationship to that screen is very different than how most people feel who they are in relationship

111
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:48,120
to a natural world the forest the ocean the the rivers the the trees the

112
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:54,959
mountains that we all went through these last days and uh for one thing I reflect on

113
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:02,120
is that when I came back I did go on my laptop and I looked at my screen and wonder how am I different here and I

114
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:09,519
could feel how uh how I was bigger than whatever the screen is I'm like a big

115
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:16,920
thing the screen is only I don't know a square foot or something at the most and uh and it's um you know I'm big and

116
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:23,480
substantial and and I'm alone there's something about the Solitude of being in

117
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:30,079
relationship to a screen even though my wife was in the house there was something about those very different

118
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:35,920
compared in contrast to being Out outdoors where all the senses are open

119
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:43,959
and there's this huge receptivity that develops over time the walking is a lubricant or is a massage is a it kind

120
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:49,680
of uh opens things up step after step after step and just you always have to

121
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:55,079
take into account what's around you and uh many times the trail was not

122
00:12:55,079 --> 00:13:00,480
completely even so there's a constant call your whole body is being sh how it

123
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:08,279
moves through space is constantly being adjusted and changed on all these little micr muscle ways you know little

124
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:15,760
adjustments with the ankles and the where the foot comes down the knees and which muscles are activated and which uh

125
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:22,880
what what an environment you're tuning into are you tuning into things through the ears are you tuning in through the eyes and what are you tuning to the

126
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:28,240
ground the trees the sky the birds the ocean and it's a constant shifting of

127
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:35,320
all kinds of things and the whole body is involved completely in a way that I'm sure your

128
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,440
body is completely involved uh in your

129
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:46,440
laptop but it's not it's probably not as fluid and and open and flowing and it's

130
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,959
probably getting more and more tense sometimes and you know kind if you if you spend a lot a lot of time on doing

131
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:58,199
the same thing with your body things begin to stiffen up so this wonderful kind of way in which a pilgrimage is

132
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:03,920
built into it is is walking walking walking and hours of

133
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:11,560
walking and uh uh we uh walked in silence before lunch so to walk with a

134
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:17,320
group of people together there's something of bonding that happens when we spend time together in silence you

135
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,639
get to know each other differently there's a kind of feeling of of way of

136
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:28,120
tuning into people when you don't have to be figuring out what to say or or how

137
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:34,720
what how to respond to what they're saying there's a kind of sense of camaraderie and commonality and

138
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,639
something very I think for me very touching about that kind of experience not so many people are

139
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:48,199
willing to spend a hours you know six hours or something in the morning or maybe not that way probably four hours

140
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:54,079
that we spent um in silence as we walked we did talk occasionally like learning

141
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:59,480
how old the redwood trees are and um and we had a little rituals

142
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:05,800
we did very little simple rituals we did uh as we went along that involved some

143
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:13,519
speech and um the um and so the because of the

144
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:19,720
outer silence it affects the inner silence and it was like being on a

145
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:25,759
retreat or meditating where the inner landscape became highlighted and uh became much more

146
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:31,480
aware of my thoughts much more aware of my feelings my Sensations and there became an inner silence an

147
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:38,560
inner Stillness started to develop being in this out this having this silence as we walked being in touch with an

148
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,600
environment that uh I don't know if you would say was a silent environment but

149
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,160
it was so spacious and so uh supportive that it kind of

150
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:55,680
contributed to kind of a inner receptivity and inner silence and that was a very important part of this

151
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:02,480
pilgrimage an outer silence that supports an inner silence an inner silence that supports an outer

152
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,399
silence and as I went along the little slogan I had for myself

153
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,959
that became very rich to reflect on kind of a or practice

154
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:22,399
phrase was um um love teaches us to say

155
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:30,800
yes to everything wisdom teaches us

156
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:37,279
what to say yes to in every situation so we're not saying yes to

157
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:44,440
everything just automatically there's things we shouldn't say yes to but even so even in those situations there's

158
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:49,480
still something we can say yes to and so what is it we can say yes to even in

159
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:57,759
challenging situations even in situations where you don't agree with someone and one one of the things was

160
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:03,480
was um uh yes I'll I'll listen to

161
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:09,000
you you know this isn't exactly the conversation I want to have but yes I

162
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,280
don't know if I agree but but yes I'll listen as we walked along yes I'll

163
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:23,678
listen why not the bird I listen to the birds I listen to the ocean I listen to The Creeks yes and so there's a very

164
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:29,280
different orientation to have this yes knowing that I disagree knowing in

165
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:36,480
certain ways you know that I would say no or something but yes you know to live with a yes that I

166
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,640
felt that was kind of like how do I say yes here where is the yes that I can live

167
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:50,200
with as opposed to the for some of us uh sometimes the automatic policy is no you

168
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:57,679
know you know no no no but yes to live a life of yes I felt to me it was a

169
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:05,440
wonderful piece of aill pilgrimage to do this pilgrimage route and then we had uh a Buddhist

170
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:12,360
teacher at at Spirit Rock gave a little short Dharma talk to us to begin the

171
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,799
journey and uh and that was an kushman who has spent uh years studying

172
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:25,880
pilgrimages and done Buddhist pilgrimages in India and so she was you know familiar with us and then we were

173
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:31,320
um uh at um Greeno one of the senior teachers there met us

174
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:39,039
and gave us a short talk and both places we meditate a little bit with the teachers and then we we met and um they

175
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:45,440
gave a short talk and so it's kind of like bookended the whole thing with this wonderful um you know receiving

176
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,640
teachings as we went along and the zen teacher gave this beautiful teaching

177
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:58,919
that is from a kind of a co- and uh the Japanese Buddhist tradition of um it's kind of a fable I

178
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:05,320
think but you decide uh the Buddha himself was out for

179
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:12,080
a walk with his students maybe he was in a pilgrimage and um and he stopped at some

180
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:19,600
location and he pointed to the ground and he said this is the place to build a

181
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:25,720
sanctuary a sacred site apparently the the phrase can also mean uh the way it's

182
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:33,480
translated in English is sanctuary apparently the Japanese words can also mean um a place for enlightenment place

183
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:41,640
for Liberation this is the place and so the Indra who is the was was I don't

184
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:48,640
know if he still is uh the one of the most powerful gods in the Indian

185
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:55,760
Pantheon um heard this and and was coming following along I guess on the walk and you know somehow came down from

186
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:02,600
his Celestial domain and and uh and plucked a a blade of grass out from

187
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:11,280
somewhere and planted that blade of grass into the spot the Buddha had pointed to and said the sanctuary is

188
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:20,200
built and the Buddha smiled that's the story and so uh and the and the teacher

189
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:26,679
talked about the Z teacher talked about um uh how Indra being the most powerful

190
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:33,760
God in the Indian Pantheon could have just you know snapped his finger and created a huge Palace a cathedral you

191
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:39,000
know real building as the sanctuary but he just took some some of the most most

192
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,520
humble simple ordinary thing that is right there I suppose a piece blade of

193
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:51,120
grass and put it in the spot and I made the sanctuary and so one interpretation of

194
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:58,080
this for pilgrims is that every step is the sacred site it's not about going to a

195
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:06,400
sacred site it's not about leaving a sacred site it's about finding the sacred site in every step every

196
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:13,799
step is uh is something very uh precious and valuable to be present just for that

197
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:19,799
and so part of the task of a pilgrim is maybe a Buddhist Pilgrim that maybe a

198
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:27,400
Zen Buddhist Pilgrim but is to find what does it mean how do we discover the

199
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:32,600
tremendous value you the power the spirituality the

200
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:40,520
sacredness of one step of the place we're standing the place where our foot comes down this particular moment here

201
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:46,679
and now and it certainly requires a certain kind of humility humbleness it

202
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:51,960
requires certain receptivity it requires a certain uh

203
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:57,400
quietness in the mind where we're not caught up in our thoughts and concerns

204
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:03,760
so much that we miss the missed the moment we missed the footstep we're not here for

205
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:12,960
it and um and it uh certainly requires some kind of feeling of the value the

206
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:21,000
specialness of really being here in the place we're at and uh part of that specialness for

207
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:28,840
Buddhists is to appreciate the possibility of Liberation freedom from attachments from clinging

208
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:37,480
from self preoccupation self building up the self um defending the self

209
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:44,320
um preoccupied with the future preoccupied by the past finding some Liberation from all that which is not an

210
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,799
easy thing to do I think one of the characteristics of many people's lives

211
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:56,600
is preoccupation with some aspect of these things but to find it with every

212
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:03,919
step and there's something about walking all day along through the natural world

213
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:09,799
that um that contributes to that contributes to that contributes to

214
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:15,679
that uh somehow the scale of our life and what's important changes in that

215
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:22,039
world so we W part of what we walked along was um the Marine Headland Cliffs

216
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:28,240
and you amazing we had good weather it's amazing view of the ocean uh you know

217
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:34,679
going far far out we had him uh you know the other thing that I loved about the

218
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:41,480
pilgrimages was how much how friendly people were to us as we went along they

219
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:47,360
were people we encountered and even if they didn't know we were doing a pilgrimage people were just friendly out

220
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:54,440
there and um some of them were were uh County employees who were doing their

221
00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:02,159
different work that they had to do and they were just so happy to be there and meet us and walk with talk with us or

222
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:10,720
answer our questions about what they were do what they were doing and um and then also uh what was

223
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,760
nice was that we were a pilgrim group and as we walked we and through

224
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:23,760
the days we started bonding together and uh becoming more and more it felt like

225
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:30,520
now we're not just a group of people doing the same thing we're a group of people sharing a certain sensitivity a

226
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:35,559
certain mutuality a certain sacredness a certain kind of like we've come together

227
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:41,640
some of the some some of us we never met before never met each other before and

228
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:47,080
um and uh but you know and the the um

229
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:53,240
the the kind of peak time for that really felt like a gel was um there were

230
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:59,480
um uh there were two nights we slept out um on Mount Tam and sleeping bags and

231
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:05,240
Tents and um and the second night there was a picnic table we had our dinner we'

232
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,399
finished everything the evening was coming to a close and we all just sat around the picnic table and there was a

233
00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:15,559
feeling as it was getting darker that we were it was a full moon uh and uh we

234
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:21,600
were all kind of like we were now jelled into kind of a single kind of a single

235
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:28,039
body there was you might say for a group of people kind of like we were all now on the same page sharing the same thing

236
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:35,960
same same kind of sensibility and feeling very connected to each other and um

237
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:42,399
so and probably partly because we had walked so much together we were sharing

238
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:48,919
the sacredness of this land and this purpose that we're doing and because of

239
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:56,480
the of um you know that the the strong

240
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,559
connection we had to this to the practice that we all had everyone was a

241
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:06,760
practitioner so we spend time meditating together sometimes during the day we'd come to these spots that just seem like

242
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:12,000
the right place to meditate and we'd sit there and meditate there's a place called I don't know if you know some of

243
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,520
you might know it Cataract Falls it's one of the great hikes in the Bay Area so we walked up Cataract Falls and

244
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:23,679
halfway up there's a great waterfall and we we sat there on the hillside

245
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:29,799
meditating and so these things can

246
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:36,279
happen right here in the Bay Area and what made it a pilgrimage in a

247
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:42,880
sacred pilgrimage was uh the intention the purpose and the kind of context in

248
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:50,080
which it was created and um it was created last year this is the second

249
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,360
year we've done it and um before that this pilgrimage didn't

250
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,840
exist all Buddhist countries have uh uh pilgrimage routes as far as I know in

251
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:07,399
Asia most religions like maybe all major religions have pilgrimage routes and I

252
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:13,640
don't think there's been too much of this or any much of this I don't know any of this in United States yet so it

253
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:20,720
was high time that we have one here in in California and so now we have

254
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:26,919
one and uh the idea is to make it longer and so this year last year we did uh

255
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:33,919
Spirit Rock to green gold the Zen Center and this year we actually walked a little bit further to Rodeo

256
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:41,159
Beach and ended there and then uh the idea is to make slowly make it the is to

257
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:48,559
try to spend as many nights in meditation halls or Buddhist temples as we make our way down the coast and maybe

258
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:54,840
eventually make to um our Retreat Center in Santa Cruz or or or further make it

259
00:27:54,840 --> 00:28:01,600
all the way to tahara T Sahara is deep in the Los padris National Wilderness tasara Zen

260
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:09,679
Center and uh so I don't know how long that would take but but it's um a lot shorter than the

261
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:16,080
El Camino that people know in in Spain so maybe will get away with

262
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:24,600
it so um that was what I did for my vacation kind of my for my

263
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,880
pilgrimage so hopefully that was nice for you to hear and um if you have any

264
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:36,360
questions you want to ask about it um be happy to try to

265
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:56,519
respond good morning Gil um mine is less of a question but more of a comment on

266
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:03,600
your uh your talk today it if uh I couldn't help but draw the analogy that

267
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:10,919
uh if the sacred sight equal Enlightenment and each medit um each step was the

268
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:17,039
sight uh revered a sight it would be each meditation would be the step and

269
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:23,320
even more each moment of our lives would be a step and how also you said how

270
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:30,799
difficult that would be yes I I completely agree with you I think that's the all you know that's definitely the

271
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:36,559
conclusion of this practice is to realize that every every meditation you're sitting in the place of Awakening

272
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:44,880
it's a sanctuary every step every every thing you do and um uh so that's the

273
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:50,480
goal some of us need some help and uh and pilgrimage is one of the

274
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:56,640
ways to get that help because it's not just going on retreat but it's you're you're living kind of a life in the

275
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:02,360
world walking and encoun ing things and and so there it's really palpable that

276
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:09,519
this is what you're doing and then hopefully we learn from that we imprint that becomes imprinted in us so that

277
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:16,720
when we go back home that we bring that with us through appreciate that every

278
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:22,278
sip of water is a pilgrimage

279
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:54,320
and you're welcome to ask anything else too it doesn't have to be a pilgrimage

280
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:09,399
Gil has been a long time but I've done the Cataract Trail a couple of times and it's it's a

281
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:13,518
very wonderful place I was glad to hear that you've done

282
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,600
it

283
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:26,840
sure let's see if this yeah this is better uh and the waterfall there counts

284
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:36,279
as a body of water you could say um and you saw a view of the ocean I think you said as well I saw in the news yesterday

285
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:43,600
I just saw the headline um about what makes bodies of water so

286
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:49,799
peaceful for us to um be next to I didn't read the article just saw the

287
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:55,760
headline uh and I I resonated with that cuz I I myself find bodies of water to

288
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:02,840
be very peaceful I just loveed to be to be there but I don't know why any thoughts on

289
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:11,639
that why are bodies of water peaceful the

290
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:18,360
um maybe I want answer the question directly the way he asked but uh this

291
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:24,679
last year there's been a few times where I've been in situations where people had to kind of introduce

292
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:31,080
themselves with a little bit about their background where they come from and there story of their life and I've told

293
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:36,320
my life story or you know short version of it or so many times that I'm not that

294
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:43,159
interested in it anymore so it's not like my so so I was so I I I I was I had

295
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:49,840
time to reflect before I was going to do this introduction to myself and uh and

296
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:56,840
um and other people were doing theirs first so it was kind of interesting to hear other people's introductions and

297
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:03,519
then have that reflect back to understand myself in a different way based on what they said and by the time

298
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:09,840
it was my my turn I didn't want to tell any stories or any conventional ways it just didn't wasn't really relevant for

299
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:16,840
me but what was most relevant what I felt most was um at that the last I

300
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:23,320
guess six months where this has been an issue is um

301
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:28,760
um how how have I been shaped by places in

302
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:34,799
nature uh and uh one of those ways that I feel when I was doing this reflection

303
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:40,600
is bodies of water you know they I spent a lot of my life on water and it's been

304
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:48,799
a really big theme throughout my life you I was born on the coast coastal town in Norway and um there's a lot of time

305
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:54,679
on water and Fs and this there some of these FS can be so peaceful so calm when

306
00:33:54,679 --> 00:34:00,880
there's no wind and so the the calm bodies of water I feel like have shaped

307
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:06,440
me there's something that lives in me in a way that that um the spaciousness the

308
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:13,638
openness the expansiveness of of peace or calm that uh seems to kind of kind of

309
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:18,839
um impact something in my chest where the chest becomes similar something in

310
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:25,079
my chest gets peaceful and quiet and peaceful um why that is I don't know but

311
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:31,320
uh so you're asking why but um the uh certainly has had a big impact

312
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:38,079
so certainly water I know that was an odd question thank that's a great answer thanks so something some of you might

313
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:43,560
want to reflect on is how would you tell your life story uh from the point of

314
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:50,200
view of the places you lived as opposed to you know what you

315
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:59,320
did and um right thanks to you

316
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:06,599
hi this is Ashwin uh we just recently completed uh Everest Base Cam

317
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:11,680
tracking and I wish we had thought of some of the ideas that you mentioned

318
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:17,720
such as walking in silence for half day and stopping at different spots and

319
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:22,960
doing the meditation and have purposeful

320
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:29,240
conversations uh so I I I think it's a wonderful thing uh looks like and uh

321
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:37,119
maybe IMC will organize some such either hikes or pilgrims that uh non-teachers

322
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:44,240
maybe or others can participate in it and explore this further great thank you yeah there's a there is some people who

323
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:49,680
have uh organized hikes and U and um

324
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,920
Kristen uh Benson has offered a couple this last year she was trained to be an

325
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:00,359
e chaplain and so she's offered hikes that that have brought together some of these things

326
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:05,680
and I don't know if she's planning to she does it on the soul St or Equinox time so I don't know if she's planning

327
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:13,240
to do it in um you know the summer solstice but keep keep keep an eye on the newsletter to see but it's a it is

328
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:20,680
do more of it and and um and then um you know maybe with

329
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:28,079
uh with um if this pilgrimage route gets developed all the way down to

330
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:34,280
you know south of here some point it has to go through the peninsula and U so either either you'll

331
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:39,839
have to wait till it gets that far and then you can join or maybe we'll do it develop it in

332
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:47,200
sections and uh don't know if that we can just try finding sections on the peninsula to make and then we can later

333
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,078
connect it to create a peninsula P

334
00:36:53,760 --> 00:37:00,040
pilgrimage I have a quick question um I just came back from a sacred Place Salt

335
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:06,880
Lake City and um was um IMC came to mind

336
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:14,440
in Buddhist practices because I really was challenged in different ways in terms of what I witnessed and I tried to

337
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:19,520
have um a curiosity should I move um and

338
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:25,599
an openness and I continued to have my challenges so I'm just curious any

339
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:33,640
thoughts um in terms of my struggles with that experience of mine Al so I

340
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:39,960
don't quite understand but I think what you're saying is that uh you came out of maybe maybe a religious situation that

341
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:45,720
has it had problems um no I'm not I don't practice

342
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:53,000
I I just went on vacation to Salt Lake City and um I I struggle with aspects of

343
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,839
that faith I don't practice it right but just the history and the unfolding and

344
00:37:58,839 --> 00:38:10,079
um the hierarchy and treatment of women and um so you're um commenting on

345
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:16,720
um kind of an openness a having a more of a curiosity versus a a

346
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:26,720
judgmental is kind of how I interpret it um so yeah so you so again I think I I

347
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:32,400
appreciate very much what's behind your question sounds like you're asking a very important question not sure my

348
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:40,079
answer will respond and we can talk more later but the um um

349
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:45,240
um I have I have Mormon friends and number so I know some of the you know

350
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:50,960
who grew up that way and and so I know some of the challenges that they have

351
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:58,040
with their own religion and or some of them have left their religion and but those challenges are not that maybe the

352
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:04,560
maybe the nuances the details are a little different but almost every religion probably every religion has

353
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:11,560
some of the same problems and you don't have to you don't have to you you don't have to kind of look very for long or

354
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:20,960
very far to see problems with Buddhism as a religion as well Buddhism is not free of this as well um but I've uh I've

355
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:28,200
in terms of this idea of you know saying yes to everything um so yes there's problems in

356
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:34,400
religions and uh there's a lot of goodness in people as well so I I was i'

357
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:41,520
I've noticed that there's a a lot of uh generosity a lot of

358
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:47,560
friendship a lot of Ethics in among Mormons that I've met that have inspired

359
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:53,200
me and I know some of the difficulties as well but I really like to orient

360
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:59,560
myself around that which resonates with me and that which inspires me in it because that's that's a way of

361
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:09,480
supporting more of that than the world uh to only Orient ourselves towards it to the problems is uh is kind

362
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:15,359
of limits the ourselves because then we're resonating with what the problem

363
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:21,240
is and the distress that causes us and I don't know if we grow from that as much

364
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:28,920
as we do resonating what's good but what's what's very important is not to be polanish you know and just ignore the

365
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:35,280
problems I think there's a real tremendous importance to see it clearly

366
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:42,040
and then but not to be limited by it or or or in any kind of way but to actually

367
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:47,440
find where where is the spiritual growth happening and um and one of the ways to

368
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:53,119
be inspired that's not the right word but one motivation that I have from when I

369
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:59,560
see things that are terrible in the world is that uh it inspires me to do

370
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:04,839
better and it reminds me that that the world I want to live in is the world

371
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:10,440
that needs to begin with me so if so so that you know rather than waiting for

372
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:19,319
someone else to fix the world at least we try to fix our own world the world that born is born out of us and so if um

373
00:41:19,319 --> 00:41:25,359
if other people are being unethical I would like to live in a world that's ethical and so that then I have to look

374
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:32,680
at myself has it come for me in the world with at War I want to live at peace at War where there's conflict I

375
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:39,200
want to live with Concord so how do I live and promote Concord coming out of

376
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:45,079
me rather than participating in the conflicts in the world so is does this

377
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:50,599
little bit answer your question oh no it it very much answers very inspiring thank you okay

378
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:56,079
great great so thank you so it's now the official time to

379
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:03,400
stop he I'm happy to stay up here if you have some more comments or questions but uh I hope to see some of you at the at

380
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:09,440
