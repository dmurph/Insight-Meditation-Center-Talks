1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:08,559
so good morning everyone and welcome to

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,320
insight meditation center it used to be that that was identified with

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,800
this building that i'm sitting in but now more and more over this course of this pandemic and doing these

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,279
youtube sittings i think of imc as something

5
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:37,040
much broader and wider and maybe even international and um maybe we should call

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,040
imc international meditation center so thank you for being here and for

7
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:49,680
expanding the the meaning and of what our sangha is

8
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,198
and being part of this

9
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,198
one of the really valuable

10
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:09,200
aspects of the discoveries of this practice is a way of being

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,960
the quality of mind a capacity of the mind to be

12
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,799
desirelessness to be desireless to be without the desire

13
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:29,439
and it's a probably pretty foreign idea to the way most minds work because

14
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:36,320
most minds are kind of going from one desire to another

15
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,720
and but to be without desire uh

16
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,119
is to be without any compulsion any attachment any kind of

17
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:57,439
need for something to happen and i know that this goes against

18
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,880
what's necessary for much of ordinary life

19
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:11,520
so not to think of it as this is how we're supposed to be the ideal way of being but rather

20
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:19,200
it's uh kind of like if you are been working in the garden and you're

21
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,120
dirty and grimy then it's good to be dirtless for a while to take off the dirt and

22
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,920
then refresh and then we can go back out into the world so to spend a few moments

23
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:39,599
without desire as a way of kind of refreshing a way of cleansing a way of opening to something

24
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:48,640
different as a way of tapping into another way of being in the world where there is a response where there is

25
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:55,760
there is a way there's wisdom and intelligence and uh that can operate but it seems to come

26
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,200
from a very different place than where kind of ordinary desires come from

27
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,200
and it's a place where we don't identify with our desires we don't make a self

28
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:14,319
out of desires or we don't tie the desires to self-fulfillment self-enhancement

29
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:21,680
self-protection all kinds of things so what would that look like for you to

30
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:30,840
sit and meditate without a desire and maybe it sounds like a very foreign

31
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,519
idea but maybe just assume that something in you knows what that is

32
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:43,440
and that it's something maybe also assume that it's something

33
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:50,480
precious something valuable something that is maybe once we tap into it deeply

34
00:03:50,480 --> 00:04:01,840
inspiring so to assume a meditation posture

35
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:11,360
and maybe you can adjust your posture a little bit maybe sway back and forth sideways a bit

36
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,759
maybe move your shoulders in a circle or something and and kind of

37
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,440
loosen up a little bit in your body

38
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:30,639
and then taking a posture that supports being alert

39
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:37,360
and then hopefully the same posture is one that supports relaxation

40
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,840
and to gently close your eyes

41
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:52,639
and to take a few long slow easy going breaths

42
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,840
as if you have all the time in the world to exhale

43
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:11,520
and allow the exhale to extend itself as long as it's comfortable

44
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:17,680
sometimes by extending the exhale it's possible to soften and relax

45
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,720
parts of the body that otherwise wouldn't be

46
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,840
felt or known

47
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:52,800
to let your breathing now return to normal and as you continue now with a normal

48
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,840
breath in a comfortable way see if with the

49
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:06,960
exhale you can let the exhale continue

50
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:14,960
a little bit longer exhale at the end mostly by releasing and allowing

51
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:34,639
a fuller exhale without any special effort except letting go or allowing

52
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,400
and at the end of that exhale

53
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,240
may perhaps make a very short pause

54
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,520
not so much maybe making the pause but rather allowing a pause

55
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:02,080
or allowing yourself to wait a moment to

56
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:10,080
feel the urge to breathe in very simple urge and then allow

57
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:17,840
for that inhale

58
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:31,840
perhaps receive the inhale

59
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:49,120
and as you inhale see if you can attune yourself to the

60
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,000
fullness of that experience of breathing in

61
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,599
without strain but an attunement that's more and

62
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:06,800
allowing the experience of inhale to be

63
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,840
experienced

64
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:36,719
and at the end of the inhale see if you can have an allowing

65
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,000
releasing of the exhale allowing of

66
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,839
exhale

67
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,920
and taking a few moments

68
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:33,600
to more fully feel the what it's like to allow and receive

69
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:40,640
to allow the exhale to receive the inhale

70
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:52,079
without any other desire

71
00:10:52,079 --> 00:11:00,399
almost as if it's a release of all desires and in the release of desires

72
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:07,440
there's an openness in awareness to the experience of

73
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:14,959
breathing in and breathing out

74
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:22,560
where desirelessness is closely related to allowing and

75
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,839
receiving

76
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,240
and if you notice there are desires or thoughts

77
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:58,720
desirelessness is more found in letting go of those

78
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,839
or letting them be

79
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:15,360
desirelessnesses and not picking anything up or getting involved

80
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:29,519
the kind of letting go that is not even letting go just letting be

81
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:36,560
closely related to receiving allowing

82
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:53,839
whatever happens in experience

83
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:28,720
in becoming attuned to that part of your experience

84
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:35,040
that is free of desires even if there are desires present as

85
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,279
well

86
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,600
don't prioritize the desires don't live in desire

87
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:52,240
see if you can live in the place that is content

88
00:13:52,480 --> 00:14:03,839
open receptive

89
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,839
being with what is

90
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,839
not what we want

91
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,920
you

92
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,919
you

93
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:20,159
for a few minutes experiment to the best of your ability

94
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,000
being free of desire

95
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:31,600
being content to do so even if you're at the edges of it

96
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,880
being able to being content even if it's just an

97
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:49,840
intuition or feeling for what it's like to be that way

98
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:02,159
noticing what comes alive in you

99
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:10,400
when there's no desire that is obscured

100
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:17,840
by the presence of desires

101
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,919
you

102
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:36,080
desires often come with a lot of baggage associated with it beliefs we have

103
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:46,840
aversions we have ideas about who we are and what we need

104
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:53,360
and all this baggage can obscure something deeper

105
00:27:54,559 --> 00:28:00,000
to allow ourselves a chance to be free of desire

106
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:09,200
can allow for the wellsprings of a warm caring heart

107
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:17,840
can allow for compassion and love

108
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:28,960
can allow for a simple warmth and good will

109
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,840
for others

110
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:42,399
a warmth and goodwill which has no resemblance to ordinary desires

111
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:48,159
because it's not tied to me myself and mine

112
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:59,120
it's deeper more intimate within

113
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,080
then thoughts ideas and feelings of self

114
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:16,000
and perhaps in these last minutes of the sitting maybe you can intuit or imagine or feel

115
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:26,799
a place within which is not governed by desire

116
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:33,760
but which is a source for warmth and care and love where in a sense

117
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,039
nothing needs to happen

118
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:46,080
but where we can allow for that warmth and love and care the tenderness

119
00:29:53,279 --> 00:30:03,039
without complicating it with shoulds and shouldn'ts anxieties about caring for ourselves

120
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:09,600
in the last minutes of this sitting perhaps to if you can

121
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:15,840
sit quietly with a sense of warm heartedness

122
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:25,440
tenderness care for the world

123
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:37,840
that maybe in a certain way is free of desire to do anything

124
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:45,919
has also a momentum a motivation

125
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:53,760
a wish that all beings be well

126
00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:05,279
that others be happy have the opportunity to feel safe

127
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:12,320
have the opportunity to be peace at peace and to be free

128
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:25,120
and then as we get ready to end this sitting now maybe is a time for desire

129
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:33,039
and maybe your desire can be to contribute to that possibility

130
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:39,039
may your lit may you live your life to make this a better world for others

131
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:46,640
for everyone you and others

132
00:31:46,640 --> 00:32:01,840
may you contribute to the happiness and welfare of all beings

133
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:23,519
so welcome now to the fourth talk on greed and

134
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:32,480
today's talk is going to be about composting greed or letting it become transformed

135
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,600
and it's not an original idea with me

136
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:43,039
sometimes in buddhism where this kind of idea exists sometimes seen as kind of more

137
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:50,240
advanced practice and because it's best not

138
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,679
to do it in a way that we get all too easily the old habits of mind

139
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:01,679
and habits of self are kind of come along and gets entangled in this practice of composting

140
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:08,960
greed and that's why having a strong foundation in mindfulness practice the basic

141
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,320
practice is really important something i tried to do a little bit yesterday

142
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:22,480
and um and to learn to have this you know really strong clear recognition of of desire of greed

143
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:28,480
of wanting of anything where there's a little bit of freedom little bit of

144
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:35,120
distancing or opening or in relationship to what's going on and

145
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:41,440
this clear recognition when it's practiced with vipassana often involves a kind of clear and clear

146
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:47,519
recognition of the details of experience rather than lumping it all together in one big

147
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:53,440
maybe amorphous idea of what something is we start seeing the comp components of

148
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:59,440
it the components of the body the bodily expressions the emotional aspects of it the motivational

149
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:05,039
aspects of it the cognitive aspects of it as each of them becomes more

150
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:11,200
in highlight and seen as distinct then the kind of amorphous hole doesn't

151
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:19,118
grab us as much and we don't get so reactive to it or caught in it or greedy about it and uh and we start

152
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:25,280
seeing the underlying kind of conditionality of it the underlying uh

153
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:31,520
changing nature of it in a very powerful way and so this is a core aspect of the

154
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:39,520
apostle practice something is tremendously valuable something to be uh to love and to care for and to

155
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:45,440
it's so liberating and sometimes it's a little bit like you

156
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:51,919
take what you want to take a really good look and really recognize what a bicycle is

157
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:57,520
and so you look at the bicycle and you get your tools out and you begin taking apart all the

158
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:03,440
pieces of the bicycle and separating those unscrewing everything and laying everything out in the ground

159
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,720
and so you can really see what a bicycle is and all the parts of it

160
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:16,400
and that's fascinating to see that maybe and but when you do so

161
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:23,119
that thing that was the bicycle no longer rolls it no longer works as a bicycle

162
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:29,680
in order to really kind of let a bicycle be a bicycle you don't take it apart you have to let

163
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:35,440
all the pieces be together and work kind of in harmony and then allow it to roll

164
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,800
so sometimes that's true also with our inner life and with desires and greed

165
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:47,520
sometimes if we kind of do this deeper kind of look of vipassana or if we get deeply concentrated and

166
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:53,280
bypass kind of the the desires the greed itself

167
00:35:53,280 --> 00:36:00,720
then the rolling of the bicycle of desire of greed has been interrupted and sometimes

168
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:08,800
that's like a tremendous safety to do that to be caught and involved in greed can cause

169
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,839
so much damage to ourselves and to others and it's very stressful it's very alienating

170
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:19,599
it's disconnecting it's sometimes lends itself to an

171
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:26,160
assertiveness and aggressiveness that objectifies others or doesn't really see others as human

172
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:33,280
and bulldozes over people because our greater desires are more important than even other people's welfare it's a

173
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:38,960
horrible what can happen in this world in the in the in the assault of people's

174
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:45,119
desires and greed but if we learn how to have this clear

175
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:51,920
recognition learn how not to be involved in the greed not to be entangled with it

176
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:59,280
then we have the opportunity to compost it and what i mean by that is to is to

177
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:06,240
not be caught in it but also not interrupt it not interfere with it not not to go

178
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:12,560
deeply analytical not get concentrated so that it kind of changes the inner kind of landscape so

179
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:18,000
dramatically it's not there but rather to let the greed be

180
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,040
allow it to be there but and one way to allow to be there that's safe that kind

181
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:29,920
of protects us from getting caught up in its uh thoughts ideas its goals

182
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:36,400
is to feel it in the body and now that's why i call it composting it in the body

183
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,599
and and doing to do it so i said before this is an advanced practice

184
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:48,560
but sometimes it's not necessarily for only kind of more well matured practitioners

185
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,839
it's also for people who have no other option because the greed is so strong

186
00:37:53,839 --> 00:38:00,400
that you know it's going to take over if we don't do something and maybe there's no access to you know

187
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:07,040
this deeper mindfulness that i talked about yesterday and so instead

188
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:13,680
just coming back to the body feeling it in the body grounding in the body over and over again and letting it kind

189
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:19,040
of move through in an embodied way feel the momentum feel the move

190
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:24,160
feel the urges and by grounding in the body

191
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:32,400
it does a number of things one thing is that it takes us away from the thoughts the ideas the

192
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,920
as the the hopes that exist in the mind that are often kind of what's compelling it

193
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:47,119
uh they're feeding it it also takes it a little bit away from uh the emotions just in and of itself

194
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:53,920
it allows whatever emotions are connected to the greed to be grounded in the physical

195
00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:01,119
body here it's kind of like has a root it's in the present moment the body is always present also we start feeling it in the

196
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:06,400
body feeling the sensations the impulses of greed in the body

197
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,920
the body is kind of like a large but the the as we when we meditate with our

198
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:19,119
body the body is in some ways bigger than what we think of over our body it's kind of like it's lots of space in the body

199
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:24,560
and so to allow the momentum of greed and desire to course through the body kind of keep

200
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:31,839
opening space to it allowing it to be there and and this what i'm talking about now

201
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:36,880
is best done in meditation where you're committed to not moving

202
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:42,000
not acting on it you sit there and just let the greed course through your body the

203
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:48,400
feeling sensations of it and when you get out of the way of it this way

204
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:54,320
but also don't enact it don't get involved in it then there's a composting there's a

205
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:59,760
transformer there's a change that goes on that is kind of akin to um

206
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,440
i think of it as akin to um the way the body can be self-healing at times

207
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:12,800
that uh you know if you sometimes when we get sick sometimes if we injure ourselves if we

208
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:18,880
allow for the right conditions keep a wound clean or have a if we break our arm have a cast

209
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:25,200
on and have it things the bones lined up again then the body has an amazing way to find its way to

210
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:33,040
health and to healing and um and so uh same thing with emotions and

211
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:40,160
desires and greed greed is a little bit like being sick an illness and the system knows how to move

212
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:45,920
to health if we create the right conditions for it now if we

213
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:52,720
and one of the right conditions is to not enact it not be compelled by it to do anything

214
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:58,000
but also not to push it away or to to not allow it to move through and course

215
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,599
through our body and then as we do so it's kind of like we get out of the way and allow it to be

216
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:09,280
here then something begins to shift and change sometimes it just simply settles

217
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:16,400
uh sometimes it changes into something a little bit different and uh and there's like layers in our

218
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:23,119
inner life then we go through those layers so for example greed itself

219
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:28,319
in some circumstances might be a symptom of something deeper that's going on

220
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:33,680
inside of us and so as we do this composting this transforming allowing it to be there

221
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:38,880
that deeper thing begins to show itself that deeper thing begins to kind of

222
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:46,000
bubble up as well and that's much more important so for example some greed for example

223
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,520
might be a symptom of fear that we're really afraid of something

224
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:56,560
and the and we really want something because we think that's going to make us safe

225
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:03,280
or we might have uh really strong lust even sexual lust but if we look

226
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:09,920
underneath it there's a deep loneliness and that deep loneliness is looking desperately for something

227
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:15,359
that we think is going to fill and take care of it that's really impactfully powerful and

228
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:23,359
kind of like real assurance that we're not alone that someone connects to us and and so sexual engagement sometimes

229
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:29,440
is the ticket we think and um and to feel that deep the fear that might be there or the

230
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:35,839
loneliness that might be underneath greed or the anger that might be underneath it

231
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:43,440
there's sometimes a strong anger that propels us to want to do something maybe something harmful even

232
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:50,640
and um or there might as we kind of go through we go through these layers and so for example if there's fear there

233
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:55,680
might be underneath that fear a sense of vulnerability or tenderness

234
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,960
there might be a sense of hurt that we have or a deeper kind of quieter

235
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:06,800
fear that is doesn't really have an object of the fear but just kind of

236
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,480
exists there more existentially and as we go through and transform and allow these and allow

237
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:19,280
these in laozis then the the the transformation the composting begins happening

238
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:24,800
the movement towards health but it you know it often requires going through these

239
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:30,000
layers and discovering here and this idea that greed is just a

240
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,440
surface manifestation of something a symptom in a sense

241
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,480
and so don't act on the symptom don't kill the symptom it's just a messenger

242
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:46,400
but to kind of sit quietly allow it so we can hear more deeply see more

243
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:51,760
deeply what's really going on inside of us so we can connect more deeply or

244
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,880
allow the more deeper movements and revelations what's really happening here

245
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,920
show itself and and so there's a composting going on a

246
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:08,240
transformation going on and occasionally that transformation like something like desire and greed

247
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:15,440
is that greed is a kind of wanting something just like compassion is in buddhism

248
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:23,359
faith is a kind of desire for freedom and so as we get deeper and deeper down

249
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:30,400
we start finding that part of the transformation might be the discovery of a of a of an

250
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:36,319
appropriate desire beautiful that healthy desires that are really there at the base but

251
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:44,319
we've never figured out how to express it or live it or trust it so quickly the self and uh

252
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:50,160
kind of the ego ego comes into play that selfishness comes into play or the or

253
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:56,319
the care of protecting ourselves or the anxiety around things or that all the cultural beliefs

254
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:02,240
we have around self and others come into play that obscures the deep

255
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:10,160
beautiful kind of desires that compassion is or the movement towards liberation might be

256
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:15,520
so to compost and and how i know to compost when things are

257
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:22,079
strong is just keep returning to the body and uh and when they're when like greed is

258
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:27,359
strong then um it might keep coming back it might have thoughts as part of it

259
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:33,119
we just allow all of it just to be there um but it's kind of like come back be here

260
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:39,920
with it and then be here with it and just keep coming back keep coming back it's like you're

261
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:45,280
turning over the compost pile so that it can keep burning properly come decomposing

262
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:51,599
you're turning yourself over just coming back feeling the body feeling the body feeling the body and if

263
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:57,200
you keep doing that that is a protection against getting involved and getting involved in the

264
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:05,200
thoughts the ideas getting involved in the desires just don't get involved stay here stay here and if what i said

265
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:10,800
today doesn't make sense to you or is confusing then maybe just ignore

266
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:16,079
what i said maybe this is a kind of i said it's a little bit of an advanced practice

267
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:22,640
and maybe it'll become clearer as you trust the basic practice of mindfulness it's so powerful so effective so

268
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:29,359
useful and meaningful trust it and when the time comes you might get some sense of what i'm talking about when i talk

269
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:39,920
about composting so thank you very much
