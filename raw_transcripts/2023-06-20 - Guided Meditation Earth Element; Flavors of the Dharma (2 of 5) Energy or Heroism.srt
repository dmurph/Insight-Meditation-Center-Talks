1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:06,180
okay so let's go ahead and get started

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,460
we'll sit together as usual so finding

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:18,740
a posture where you can be upright and also relaxed

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,300
closing the eyes if that is okay for you

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,920
we would generally favor having the eyes closed in these kinds of meditations

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,579
and just allowing the attention to come inward

7
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,500
sensing from the inside what it's like to be sitting

8
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,039
or standing or lying down whatever posture you're in

9
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,020
maybe taking a couple of long slow deep breaths

10
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,059
really filling the lungs and then on the exhale just

11
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:09,299
allowing the body to soften letting the air

12
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,220
go really all the way out

13
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:25,040
just allowing the breathing to become natural again

14
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,540
and touching into the place where you're sitting your seat

15
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:46,680
against the chair the cushion the bench whatever you're lying on

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,640
and feeling the contact that's supporting you

17
00:01:53,399 --> 00:02:00,860
can really get a sense of the groundedness of the body

18
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:10,519
the stability of where you're sitting

19
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,480
the way the body is somewhat similar to what it's sitting on

20
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,040
Earth sitting on Earth

21
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,760
and then senting into the body itself

22
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:56,480
the structure of the body is supported by the skeleton the bones

23
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,680
I'm just sensing maybe the

24
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:12,379
the bones as you're sitting so you can feel the sit bones and the spine

25
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:18,480
okay perhaps you feel the shoulders

26
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:25,280
maybe the shoulder bleeds against the back of the upper back

27
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:35,220
down into the arm bones and the hands resting somewhere on each other or on

28
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,879
the thighs

29
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:49,799
solidity of the legs and the feet there's a structure

30
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:55,340
to this body particular shape

31
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,500
and infrastructure

32
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:11,640
regardless of our state of health there is this

33
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,879
internal structure

34
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:26,520
you can imagine the body in its meditation posture

35
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:32,699
as a mountain a mountain that can't be swayed even by

36
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:35,840
strong winds

37
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:46,520
this is the Earth element

38
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:55,220
the quality of solidity of hardness of literal strength

39
00:04:55,979 --> 00:05:01,080
that's naturally present it's not something we're creating and so we're

40
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,900
just tuning into that dimension of the body of the

41
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,979
physical experience

42
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:33,120
and as we said still like the mountain we can connect also now with the

43
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,960
sensations of the breath like a gentle breeze flowing across the

44
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,419
face of the mountain the breath the body

45
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:48,020
together

46
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,820
connecting with the present moment

47
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:24,139
this energy of Earth Earth Energy that can support

48
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:28,400
persistence in the mind

49
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:37,080
so we aim to stay gently connected with the present you know through our normal

50
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:43,280
mindfulness practice maybe a bit longer than usual

51
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:53,880
without any push or forcing just with the natural strength of the

52
00:06:53,880 --> 00:07:02,520
Earth Energy in the body let me apply a little bit of persistence

53
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:10,199
the way the Earth inexorably stays in contact with

54
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:13,340
what is touching it

55
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:05,820
we can sense the strength of the Earth element

56
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:11,899
it's a strength that has no aversion in it no

57
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:19,040
coercion in it it's just there

58
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,940
like the strength of a mountain

59
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:30,000
and we sit with the breath with the body

60
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,940
with whatever thoughts and emotions are there

61
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:40,640
willing to be with that

62
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,760
we can rest in this centeredness

63
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:55,279
as we stay with the flow of experience

64
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,100
it all flows across and through and around

65
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:08,339
the Earth element of our sitting posture so sitting now quietly for a little

66
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:10,519
while

67
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,579
thank you

68
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,940
foreign

69
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:08,160
into a world of its own creation

70
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,460
we can feel the ungroundedness of that

71
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:21,200
and return our attention to the simple presence of the body sitting

72
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:31,520
the Earth sitting on Earth and feel how that re-grounds the mind

73
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:38,000
and brings up a sense of Persistence of staying in the present moment

74
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:24,600
as we stay with the quality of the Earth element in the

75
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:31,260
background of our meditation the fruit of this is moving toward

76
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:39,720
equanimity the sense of balance

77
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:47,700
acceptance being able to be with anything Pleasant or unpleasant

78
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:56,899
without getting thrown off kilter so sensing into that

79
00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:02,520
deep presence that is not swayed by

80
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:08,299
experience the Equanimity of Earth

81
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:08,419
so now broadening the attention to include the whole body

82
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:17,700
as well as the emotions the thoughts maybe letting the attention still with

83
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:23,760
the eyes closed extend out farther into the room

84
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,980
hearing the sounds around you

85
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:35,279
just having this sense of centeredness

86
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:42,480
more balance I'm considering what a gift this is

87
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:50,600
when we can carry this around with us throughout the day

88
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:59,460
so easy out in the world to become ungrounded

89
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:06,059
we're reading things on the Internet or getting caught up in the events of the

90
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:11,820
day and sometimes even just one person being

91
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:18,900
connected with the Center of their being being grounded with their feet on the ground

92
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:25,440
can influence a whole situation a whole interaction to be more grounded

93
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:31,100
more connected so the cultivation from this practice

94
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:36,720
today we hope will have some positive effect

95
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:43,620
in the world as we carry the energy of Earth with us

96
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:51,120
as a gift are more than helping just us it can

97
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:59,760
radiate out and be of benefit to many beings even in

98
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:06,179
ways that they don't feel consciously

99
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:10,039
but it's there supporting them

100
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,940
maybe so

101
00:29:57,299 --> 00:30:02,520
okay sorry about that video image I think I fixed that

102
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:08,279
um so now today

103
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:13,740
this week we've been talking about flavors of the Dharma

104
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:19,500
so the Paulie and Sanskrit term is Rasa

105
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:26,600
which could also be translated as a saver and it's meant to be the emotional tone

106
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:32,520
of uh often a work of art um but it can be extended into the realm

107
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:37,740
of spiritual teachings and people who are familiar with

108
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:44,520
culture in the era of the Buddha would have understood these rasas and so in

109
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:49,559
the case of spiritual teachings this flavor is you know more specifically something that would support the

110
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:54,899
Eightfold Path and you see these in the uh in the sutas

111
00:30:54,899 --> 00:31:02,520
so we're picking out some of these flavors and highlighting them this week so yesterday was love or Compassion or

112
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:10,860
care and today is quite distinct from that and equally important so it's the tone

113
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:18,260
of energetic engagement and persistence which is sometimes even called heroism

114
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:26,399
in the Indian world and the poly term for this is Viria and

115
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:33,380
the Buddha talked about it a lot this quality is named in the most lists

116
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:40,919
more so even than mindfulness um probably there's no way to read the

117
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:47,480
sutas honestly and not get the message that Viria is important

118
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:53,039
so this quality of energy or effort or

119
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:59,039
the flavor of heroism has several different dimensions

120
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:04,140
it's not just one thing it's kind of multi multifaceted

121
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:11,820
so one of them we talked about a little bit in the meditation which is persistence or perseverance it has to do

122
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:17,899
with not giving up with being steady and ongoing

123
00:32:17,899 --> 00:32:23,700
sometimes we can have an energy in our practice of being on and off

124
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:31,140
you know we're on to it for a while and then off where we sit for a while you know a

125
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:36,480
week or two we're good at sitting and then we're kind of not into it for a

126
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:44,220
month things like that so this quality of virio when that comes in it it brings a

127
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:50,580
consistency and a steadiness and an ongoingness to the way that we practice

128
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:55,620
and then another another dimension is confidence

129
00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:01,919
so that doesn't mean that we always feel self-confident this practice has many

130
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:07,080
changes in that area but nonetheless it's clear that we're not going to put

131
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:14,100
energy or effort into something that we have no confidence in you know if you if you don't have any

132
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:21,120
confidence that um I don't know uh Pink Elephants are

133
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,340
going to help you in your practice you won't put energy into trying to find a

134
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:34,440
pink elephant something like that so you know we have to have some sense that mindfulness is helpful for us the

135
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:41,700
cultivation of meta is helpful being present even when things are difficult is helpful that will help us put energy

136
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:47,760
into those practices so this sense of confidence

137
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:53,840
and then um there's also the dimension of

138
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:59,820
self-control or self-mastery in a positive way so we one of the first

139
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:06,299
insights people often have in practice is while my mind is really crazy you

140
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:12,000
know when you first sit down doing mindfulness practice we realize oh you

141
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:19,679
know I'm trying to stay on the breath and I can't even do it for one breath wow this is how my mind is and hopefully

142
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:25,378
we continue beyond that and keep doing the practice but there's a an element of

143
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:31,220
Viria is that the mind has become somewhat tamed somewhat trained it's not running all over

144
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:37,560
as we have more of Beria in our practice and there's also a way in which life

145
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:43,440
becomes more purposeful you know we're clear on what we're doing even if we

146
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:51,300
don't have a grand plan Grand aim maybe it's even better not to have that sometimes there's a sense of doing what

147
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:58,140
we need to do at this moment having a larger picture of wanting to be ethical in the world things like that those

148
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:04,800
those are also qualities that come in as this with this flavor of varia or

149
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:12,599
heroism or energy so various images you know superhero images

150
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:18,180
in the Good Sense Rosie the Riveter things like that

151
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:24,180
um the suit has talk you use words like um striving

152
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:32,520
being unremitting and generating Zeal for our practice again all in a in a

153
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:40,140
good way um one of the chapters of the dhamapata has a lot of verses that glorify heroic

154
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:47,880
efforts so I thought I'd read a couple of those just so we get a sense of how this sounds and the teachings

155
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:53,280
Glory grows for a person who is energetic and mindful pure and

156
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:59,700
considerate in action restrained and Vigilant and who lives the dhamma

157
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:05,820
through effort vigilance restraint and self-control the wise person can become

158
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:11,640
an island no flood will overwhelm so

159
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:18,660
you know there is that side of it and it can be an ideal you know that we can

160
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:24,480
look toward not not always achieve but it's a useful kind of energy

161
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:31,020
um and yet I when I looked across many sutas I found that there's actually also a

162
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:36,720
range about how much of effort is needed at a given time so it's not that we're

163
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:43,680
supposed to put out maximum effort at all times it's more nuanced than that so

164
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:50,339
I wanted to offer a few examples that convey the range of this flavor of

165
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:55,859
heroism in the teachings can be helpful for us in trying to navigate the

166
00:36:55,859 --> 00:37:02,160
different changes in our practice so there is we have to acknowledge there

167
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:08,460
is the support for strong effort so about the the Buddhist Quest own

168
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:14,160
quest for awakening there was a time when he made this declaration I know some of you have heard this

169
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:20,880
gladly would I let the flesh and blood in my body dry up leaving just the skin

170
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:28,320
tendons and bones but if I have not attained what can be reached through human effort human persistence human

171
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:33,540
striving there will be no relaxing my persistence

172
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:40,200
from this heatfulness of mine was attained Awakening from this heedfulness of line was attained the unexcelled

173
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:46,200
freedom from bondage so that was the Buddhist declaration now

174
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:54,359
he was ripe he was ready sitting under the Bodhi Tree clearly we're not expected to do exactly

175
00:37:54,359 --> 00:38:00,240
that but on the other hand were not expected only to relax and accept which

176
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:07,320
is sometimes what we're taught just relax just accept just be with everything don't try to change anything

177
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:13,360
um and that's good for those of us who are kind of a little too

178
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:19,260
[Music] a little too striving in our way of approaching

179
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:26,640
um but we may think of times in practice when we have deeded strong effort

180
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,740
there may be times when strong physical Sensations comes strong emotions come

181
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:37,680
and we have to bring forth a lot of strength and attention to meet those mindfully

182
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:43,740
or we might be caught up in a powerful wave of sleepiness and torpor and a lot

183
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:50,280
of effort is needed to stay present if that's our you know that's our aim to stay present we may need to bring up a

184
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:56,820
lot of energy to meet that so what the Buddha is quoting in that quote I I understand is very extreme and

185
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:04,200
I I worry a little bit when I see people kind of moving toward that on retreat but we can't deny that the suitcas

186
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:12,660
really do support strong effort at times on but moving through this range there's

187
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:18,480
also a suta that explicitly talks about being very careful to balance our effort

188
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:24,960
so there's the uh the Sona suta story of Sona who is a monk who has been doing

189
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,900
such vigorous walking meditation that his feet are bleeding and he's walking

190
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:37,079
and walking and walking and then he gets discouraged of course because he's trying too hard and so the Buddha gives

191
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:44,579
him a beautiful teaching about tuning his effort the way we would tune a musical instrument like a stringed

192
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:49,920
instrument so if the strings are too tight then we can't practice well and

193
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:56,820
the instrument doesn't sound good if the strings are too loose the instrument can't be played either so we need

194
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:03,480
something that's just right in tune just the amount of right amount of tension on the strings so that the instrument is in

195
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:11,400
tune and playable in the same way when we have the right amount of effort in the mind we're neither overly aroused

196
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:19,560
nor overly slack in the language of the suta then the mind can reach stability it can become concentrated

197
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:25,140
um there's also an image of a Goldsmith working to purify gold and there are

198
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:31,440
times when he has to sprinkle water on at times when he has to heat it up and times when it's better just to look on

199
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,780
because it's good as it is but there's always this tending to it and keeping it

200
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:42,960
in balance and in the same way as we work to refine our mind a time time to time we

201
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:49,619
emphasize concentration or effort or Equanimity or acceptance different things at different times

202
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:55,920
so we have to kind of keep Vigilant and tune our energy and effort to keep to

203
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:03,060
the task at hand so then moving you know continuing to

204
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:09,060
move through this range there is a time for no effort at all

205
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:16,320
so consider this interesting verse from the sutanipata one Insight is that effort is the basis

206
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:22,200
of all suffering the other Insight is that by the complete Cooling and cessation of effort

207
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:27,300
no more suffering is produced every form of suffering grows out of

208
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:34,859
effort eradicate effort and no more suffering is produced wow how about that so

209
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:39,900
um this is not a teaching for all time um we do need effort

210
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:46,500
but the passage is talking about a particular point in practice where the mind has become so still

211
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:51,960
that any movement creates some kind of tension some kind of strain

212
00:41:51,960 --> 00:42:00,540
so in when the mind is in a state like that it has to let go of intention itself it has to surrender completely

213
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:06,720
any form of effort so it might be that relax and accept is the deepest instruction

214
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:12,078
but that we don't get there until we practice for a while

215
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:19,460
so we have a path that goes from persistence and strong effort maybe

216
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:24,780
toward letting go as another aspect of effort

217
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:30,420
so we have also from the dhamapata absorbed in meditation persevering

218
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:38,339
always steadfast the wise touch Nirvana the ultimate rest from toil

219
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:44,000
so by persevering we touch the ultimate rest from toil

220
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,619
interesting there's another Suitor that says perseverance leads to happiness

221
00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:55,380
so again we have effort leading toward ease effort leading toward happiness and

222
00:42:55,380 --> 00:43:02,819
can we feel that in our practice maybe it's kind of like riding a skateboard we we push or we won't go

223
00:43:02,819 --> 00:43:08,579
anywhere we have to get on the skateboard and then YouTube forward and push but at some point it's appropriate

224
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:15,540
to Coast and then we might have to push again later but it's kind of how it goes

225
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:23,460
um so it can take heroism in our practice to stay with challenging experiences we

226
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:29,579
don't want to fight against them we will probably hopefully learned that that doesn't work so well but we don't want

227
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:34,980
to crumple in the face of strong experiences either the job of a hero is

228
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:41,160
to meet the meet the moment to meet the situation um so there's that balance don't fight

229
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:46,260
but don't crumple the attitude of heroism can also get us

230
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:51,960
out of slumps or periods of complacency or practice is feeling stagnant or like

231
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:57,240
it hasn't changed much for a few years maybe it will help to make a a clear

232
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:02,940
resolution or to look more deeply or to ask a key question alter our habits in

233
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:08,280
some way which takes some persistence um

234
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:15,599
sometimes heroism is about really doing something radically different go on a long retreat

235
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:21,240
drop everything and go practice for three months who knows

236
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:26,280
um so something wholehearted I think there's a wholeheartedness to this

237
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:32,940
quality of area whatever wholeheartedness looks like at that moment being fully there with your

238
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:39,960
experience meeting it clearly and strongly and meeting it with acceptance backing off and surrendering

239
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:47,220
but there's a wholeheartedness so that's the flavor of today Viria

240
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:52,619
energy heroism [Music] it has so many wonderful uses and I hope

241
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:59,540
it will be a it's a beautiful exploration for you thank you
