1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:11,440
okay so um let's uh let's um I have not had uh use for techquinimity um in quite

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,600
a while but um came in handy here and

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:24,840
uh um let's uh let's uh meditate

4
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,840
okay all right

5
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:27,719
so just on a dime we practice stopping

6
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:54,320
and what does it mean to stop it doesn't mean that

7
00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:01,399
we sever the present from the past and the

8
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:05,040
future it doesn't

9
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,600
mean

10
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:17,080
that we disallow the trace of

11
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,840
memory to arise it doesn't mean we

12
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:32,280
disavow the concern or fear we might have about the future

13
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:46,720
to stop on a dime means to feel the convergence of all of

14
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,120
this without being baited into the

15
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:02,239
mode of fixing and addressing

16
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,239
thing he

17
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,600
Establishing a sense of

18
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,759
groundedness sense of Earth

19
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,720
gravity sense of your belly

20
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,638
it's the stability of

21
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,240
uh sitting in our bones

22
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,199
perhaps

23
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:03,520
uh gathering uh your attention around

24
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,879
the sensations of your

25
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,879
breathing not by uh pointing the kind of

26
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:21,560
laser of attention at the sensations but uh

27
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:27,759
receiving the sensations within a sense of openness

28
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,759
receptivity

29
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,399
and if we can we sense into

30
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:58,760
the the longing to be free

31
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:09,880
we let that the force of that longing give us the

32
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,760
courage to get very

33
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:22,120
simple to renounce to let go

34
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:43,680
damachand longing longing for the dharma

35
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:24,199
how simple can we be in this moment

36
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,240
how long is now

37
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:05,720
how much uh space is there between the breath and the breather

38
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:29,639
the whole tragedy of human existence Krishna Murray said lies in the space

39
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:34,959
between subject and object

40
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,200
our clinging and

41
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:15,480
preference keeps uh reminding us who we are

42
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:33,840
sort of defensive functions of self keeping tabs

43
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,600
on threat and opportunity

44
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,280
do what we can to uh channel our

45
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:05,919
uh wish to be free to a sense of

46
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:11,640
courage the okayess of this moment

47
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,960
let go

48
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:30,279
we uh melt into uh this breath

49
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:25,440
and just uh as the meditation ends here uh sensing your whole body and awareness

50
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,039
kind of bathed in awareness

51
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,639
and uh as we open our

52
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,360
eyes not

53
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:14,440
uh yanking ourselves back into familiar default um position

54
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,639
okay thank you

55
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,080
okay thanks uh thanks folks for your your patience

56
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:13,240
i'm bellless

57
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:19,840
and disoriented used to one setup and I

58
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:25,080
don't have it but I think you can hear me and uh we're practicing

59
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:30,640
together and um it's amazing that this doesn't happen more it's amazing how

60
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:37,120
reliable the text been and uh so anyway we'll get that that whatever error it

61
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:43,640
said said we're um on too many live streams or something

62
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:49,360
so anyhoozers question from the uh from the

63
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:56,039
chat line um what are some skillful means when you lose

64
00:27:56,039 --> 00:28:01,240
inspiration in the practice

65
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:12,559
so first just to say that um we ought to have some measure of

66
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:18,039
tolerance for the waxing and waning of

67
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:25,240
inspiration you know every time there's um a period of lower

68
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:32,399
inspiration is not a problem to be fixed you know one has to bear with the kind

69
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:39,320
of vicissitudes of inspiration and

70
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:44,960
um we could say that the path um is a

71
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:51,520
dialectic between making a kind of comfortable dharma home and the rug

72
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:58,640
being pulled out from under us and sometimes the kind of it's true the

73
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,320
cozy dharma home phase can last too long

74
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:10,320
too cozy can be deadening and

75
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:17,399
um and so the process of um of falling in love with the dharma sometimes

76
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:24,240
resembles the process of um falling in love with a person

77
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,440
and there is falling in love and staying

78
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:36,720
in love and we all know people who

79
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:43,960
uh love falling in love but uh aren't so sure how to stay in

80
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:51,360
love and maybe partially we need to relinquish the need for intensity and

81
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:59,360
novelty the kind of hunger for novelty and maybe sometimes we cultivate

82
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:08,440
the ability even in times of low inspiration we cultivate the ability to

83
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:14,759
refind why we fell in love initially

84
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:21,919
sometimes um I've had uh wi with you

85
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:29,799
know folks kind of struggling with inspiration i I've asked them to

86
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:38,279
imagine never practicing again no sitting no retreat no

87
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:45,760
sa no informal practice of mindfulness no contemplation of wisdom and love none

88
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,559
of it then I ask how do you feel now

89
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:56,840
and they say horrible that's a horrifying

90
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:03,120
thought and so there's something there we're going to have to keep going it's a

91
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:09,320
question of how and so we investigate

92
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:16,120
um what is happening in my relationship with the path and what am I

93
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:23,120
seeking refuge you know what is the nature of the faith

94
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:28,480
that's been lost where are we now placing our hope

95
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:35,080
we're placing our hope somewhere maybe there's

96
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:44,240
hopelessness you know sometimes we just feel uh flattened by the intensity of some

97
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:52,559
sorrow some deadness there are we uh comparing ourselves to

98
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,320
some ideal of what's supposed to be

99
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:05,600
happening and so um we might uh probe okay what got us

100
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:13,279
into the path initially and is that intention still alive some level every intention we got

101
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:19,200
into the path with was a little bit naive the dharma is always more than we

102
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,120
bargain for sometimes we've outgrown that intention

103
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:31,720
you know like the reason we started practicing it's been satisfied in some

104
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:38,519
way and um you know okay I began to practice

105
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:47,880
because I couldn't sleep or my anxiety or self-doubt or whatever some existential

106
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:55,720
curiosity and okay now that's been satiated It's much better now

107
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:03,679
what and sometimes we actually have to like put that intention down recognize

108
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:11,799
we've outlived it in order for something new to arise

109
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,279
sometimes we feel uh stuck because we're

110
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:23,080
trying to ask the dharma to do something it cannot

111
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:30,320
do the dharma makes no promises about

112
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:39,159
samsara it doesn't we examine the ways where we try

113
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:45,440
bartering dharma i'll give you dharma for

114
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:53,600
samsara dharma may be the only medicine for certain

115
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:59,840
uh disease but that doesn't mean the it's the medicine for all diseases

116
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:06,120
so as I often say duka suffering it's an interdisiplinary

117
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:13,280
problem and there may be some other lineage of wisdom nature therapy 12step

118
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:20,158
ritual medicine service engagement activism of some kind

119
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:26,800
it may be something else actually is needed can ask the dharma to be the

120
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:34,520
medicine for all forms of disease is sometimes we feel stymied

121
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:41,440
when there's kind of like and this is a little bit of a variation on that theme asking the

122
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:48,800
dharma to do something it can't do we feel like we we we get um

123
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:54,240
flattened when there we know there's an action we have to take but we don't

124
00:34:54,240 --> 00:35:00,599
quite feel the strength or courage to do

125
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:08,280
it and the dharma can kind of stagnate when there's a life move that has to be

126
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:13,480
made but we're not making it

127
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:21,760
and maybe our mind's never going to feel ready normally we talk about well we

128
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,200
change the inner life and then our behavior changes right but sometimes

129
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:34,640
we're never going to feel ready you're going to have to jump before you're ready

130
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:41,240
and sometimes that action actually kicks up the kind of

131
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:46,760
debris or the freedom that actually feeds back

132
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:54,359
into practice the questioner asked for

133
00:35:54,359 --> 00:36:00,800
um for skillful means but this is in a sense tricky yeah

134
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,839
maybe there's some skillful means um but what we're really looking for is

135
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:13,119
intrinsic interest intrinsic motivation and interest cannot be

136
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:19,320
imposed from outside can't be imposed from inside either in a

137
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:26,880
way interest cannot be techniqueified and the lack of

138
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:33,000
inspiration in some sense is a lack of damovichaya

139
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,079
investigation investigation a lack of um

140
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:43,400
um py not in the so much the kind of

141
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:50,880
um samadei sense of janna sense johnic factor of of rapture but like in the

142
00:36:50,880 --> 00:37:00,760
sense sometimes pet is used as like kind of wrapped attention passionate interest

143
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:07,320
um and that kind of

144
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:13,480
um arises you know according to many causes and conditions not a decision we

145
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:19,320
make and certainly can't be imposed from the outside just to get very

146
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:25,760
interested but once we get very interested in in whatever

147
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,920
uh that has its own karmic

148
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:37,760
reverberations you may have to learn to love something

149
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:45,920
new it's not a a decision that can be made i'm now I now love this i now want

150
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:53,960
to nurture this it's like not a decision but we make gestures repeatedly over

151
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:59,440
time to breathe life into that new love

152
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,400
that new interest

153
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:15,839
sometimes practice stagnates and the inspiration stagnates when where our our practice orbits too

154
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:22,079
much around the self you know it's like sometimes it's just like

155
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:28,839
ah I I really can't get excited about practice for

156
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:36,200
myself but the intention becomes very alive okay let me practice for

157
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:43,640
others and you have to have like a palpable sense this matters this matters this

158
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:50,480
um uh your practice matters maybe in ways

159
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:57,760
you can't even fully imagine okay maybe that breaks through some of

160
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:05,440
the stagnation the deadening sometimes interest comes from

161
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:11,320
um spiritual friendship you know uh

162
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:16,760
inspiring practitioners a friend a teacher doesn't have to be a

163
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:25,680
teacher often for me talking with um uh practitioners you know I I hear

164
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:34,160
something very it might be little it might be big but I hear something very inspiring you

165
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:41,720
might not even notice that I noticed it but I have this feeling of like

166
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:47,760
uh I didn't quite know that i didn't quite know that in that way

167
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,880
i want to know it you

168
00:39:53,640 --> 00:40:02,960
know great is this matter of life and death time waits for no one do not waste

169
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:08,000
your life zen tradition

170
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:17,079
says then the uh Tibetan tradition four thoughts that turn the mind towards the

171
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:22,400
dharma appreciating the preciousness of human

172
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:28,640
life that this precious life will not

173
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:36,240
last that our behavior affects our experience

174
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:42,359
there is karma it's not that our behavior is the only karmic

175
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:50,480
force but it is one of them and the fourth thought that um the

176
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:59,119
defects of samsara the unquenchability of ordinary

177
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:08,560
craving and sometimes we make um the uh the confusion

178
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:15,040
uh an object the flatness an object and maybe

179
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:21,880
maybe In deeply allowing

180
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:28,640
noninspiration deeply allowing confusion a direction

181
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:35,280
emerges it's Ken Mloud um a few times in my life I've been in difficult

182
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:41,760
situations situations in which I could not see any way forward

183
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:47,200
my morning practice sessions I would to the best of my ability rest in the

184
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:53,119
confusion that swirled inside me i suppose it was the years of effort that

185
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:58,640
made that resting possible even though uh even though

186
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:06,760
through all those years those efforts had seemed poulry and ineffective when I could rest in the

187
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:14,839
confusion it grew quiet and dark quiet of a dark night with no moon or

188
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:19,960
stars as I rested in that darkness a clarity would sometimes

189
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:27,839
arise and with it a sense of a direction how or what discerned that

190
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:33,240
clarity or that direction I don't know but both were

191
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:40,000
there the clarity didn't illumine anything didn't make anything in the

192
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:47,760
situation clear just indicated a direction where that direction led or

193
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:53,400
what I would encounter I had no idea there was a

194
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,799
direction nothing more

195
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:09,240
so I um offer this for your um consideration and uh yeah may we

196
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:14,520
um may we uh continue on together

197
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:18,400
