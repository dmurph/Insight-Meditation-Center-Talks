1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:06,640
so um so the war in ukraine is very much on my

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:13,200
mind and it seems that one of the interesting or important topics is how does our buddhist practice

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,920
relate to such international events that have such a big impact on all of us and we're all

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,920
all many of us are trying to figure out how to relate to it and live in a world that

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,599
both is unfolding in front of our eyes a new world a new whole kind of maybe

6
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:38,239
era in human history that people will write about and for centuries to come that

7
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:45,840
and um and we're living it and how do we live in this change and how do we relate to it

8
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,879
so i want to begin by to go back to the

9
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:59,440
time of the buddha that the buddha was sometimes referred to

10
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:06,400
as a teacher of action quality word is kama baden

11
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:13,040
and so of all the different ways that he could be represented as you know his stance his

12
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,880
approach there were times when he was called a teacher of action

13
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:26,000
and uh and why is that and what's so important about action that he that's his his teachings and is

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,079
associated with action as being so important and i would like to say that probably

15
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:39,040
action is one of the core aspects of what the buddha had to teach and so to understand why action is so

16
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:47,758
important and why i think is to understand the kind of the kind of the essence of the buddhist practice and how we practice it

17
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,680
and given the war in the ukraine and given this emphasis on action i want to tell a little story

18
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,600
that from the 1950s that is kind of circled around

19
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,640
western dharma circles had to do with a early western kind of a dharma teacher named

20
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:11,039
paul reps he wrote this book zen zen bone zen's flesh then flesh then bones

21
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:17,040
it's a collection it was done in 1939 a collection of wonderful little zen stories that have been quite evocative

22
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:24,640
for many people and probably introduced many people to zen in the 50s and 60s

23
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,920
and there's many there's many uh versions of this story

24
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,920
i'm sure it has some basis in truth but exactly what the you know the version that's accurate i

25
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:44,160
don't know but it has to do with paul reps um going to the consulate consulate in japan

26
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,440
to in 1950s during the korean war to get a visa apparently a visa to be

27
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,640
able to stay in japan for another year and he was told that there was problems

28
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:01,360
getting a visa he had to either wait a long time and or it could be that he couldn't get one because of the korean

29
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,400
war that was a difficult time for east asia and

30
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,319
and so um but he was given the application but you know it's not going to you're not going to hear back anytime soon it'll be a

31
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,840
month or months or something but he needed the visa so he filled out the application and he

32
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,120
sat there in the kind of applica waiting room and maybe he apparently had a thermos with

33
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:30,159
him and he had some green tea and then he handed back the application

34
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:37,040
but with a note on it and the note said drinking a cup of green tea i stopped

35
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,319
the war and it was like i think a haiku which he was he knew japanese he wrote in

36
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:49,840
japanese and and maybe haiku haiku is kind of you know mean a lot in japan so

37
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:57,040
so he handed the application back for the visa with that poem and that person looked at it and said

38
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,680
okay come back tomorrow and tomorrow and the next day he got the visa

39
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,760
and this is this little because i think a little saying that many i've heard quoted recently

40
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,079
with people saying drinking this cup of tea i stopped the war do you really stop the war with drinking

41
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,359
a cup of tea is it isn't this ridiculous to say that isn't it somehow

42
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:27,120
diminishing the horror of what's happening to in your comfort of your own kind of

43
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,440
life drinking you know a nice cup of tea and saying that i stopped the war how could that you know

44
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:40,320
what is this what's going on so partly this talk will be a kind of an

45
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:47,440
exploration of this very topic so action

46
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:54,400
this has to do with what we do with our bodies the activities of our bodies activities of speech what we say

47
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:00,479
and also in buddhism it's what we think and uh and all these are consequential they

48
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,520
have meaning and they can be done in different ways we can act in ways that are stressful

49
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,560
and we can act in ways that are peaceful that are non-stressful calm

50
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,639
we can act in ways that uh express anger and hostility or greed and

51
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:23,120
we can ex we can act in ways that express our generosity and our love and our care

52
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,400
and and this can be done in uh as the medium or the

53
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:36,080
the way in which we do things and so we learn through practice to pay attention to how we do things

54
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:42,320
so something as simple as sweeping the kitchen floor

55
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,919
if it's one more thing in a long list of things that have to be done for the day

56
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,039
one more thing that interferes with uh

57
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:59,840
being anxious about tomorrow when whatever is going on

58
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,600
sweeping the kitchen floor might seem like just something to get over quickly and finish and just grab the broom

59
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,280
really tight and just you know speed through it and don't don't worry about the corners no

60
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:19,280
one sees it anyway and just get it over with and and then when it's over

61
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:25,120
if you paid attention you that person might notice that uh it was actually kind of tiring

62
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,280
it was a little bit stressful to do it because the tension and the hurry and one more thing one more thing and

63
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:38,560
but you might not notice it because that was stressful because you have one more thing to do and you're already on to the next thing or four things later and

64
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:45,520
you're so distracted by your distractions you don't notice the impact of how you do things is

65
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,599
but if you start being mindful you might discover that there are different ways of

66
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:56,639
sweeping the kitchen floor you might do it in a way that's stressful that adds the stress of the

67
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,080
day continues the stress of the day there might be resistance there might be resentment why do i have to clean the

68
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:08,560
floor and the resentment is stressful it uh

69
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:15,280
there might be a conceit look at me i hope everyone notices that i'm the best kitchen floor

70
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:22,000
sweeper in the world and they better know it you know and so there's no you know figuring out ways

71
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,400
maybe put a you put a you know now a camcorder a camera in your video camera

72
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,440
in your kitchen so you kind of broadcast it on youtube so people can see how good you are and

73
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,960
it's like all this kind of strategies and things but itself it's stressful

74
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:46,879
or you could do the sweep the floor and just sweep the floor in a simple direct peaceful way

75
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:53,440
so that the only thing that you're really doing at that moment is

76
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,599
physically sweeping the floor engaged in it wholeheartedly

77
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:05,520
maybe that's what your thoughts are about your thoughts are organized in harmony so that they're actually involved with that too as opposed to

78
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,840
being someplace else and uh and so you start to gather

79
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,120
yourself around the sweeping and you discover that there's ways of

80
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,160
doing it gripping the the broom your posture

81
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:29,680
the speed in which you do it there's ways of doing it that feel just lovely to do feel harmonious feel

82
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,919
peaceful and there are ways to do it it adds a little stress in how you do it how you grip the broom and how quick you

83
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,919
do it and all kinds of things maybe there's resistance those corners you know you can feel as you get close

84
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,760
to the corners there's this like like pulling back and like well navigating and negotiating and

85
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,880
bargaining and bargaining and like okay i don't have to do everything and it just doesn't feel peaceful it

86
00:08:52,880 --> 00:09:00,399
doesn't feel nice and so as we kind of notice the impact of how we do things is

87
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,680
on ourselves we might learn there's a there is a peaceful way of doing it so that at the

88
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:12,160
end of doing it we actually feel more settled more calm more present

89
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:19,040
than we were before it feels good and uh and we learned that

90
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:26,959
how we do things not just what we do but how we do things is actually consequential

91
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:33,519
and so when people say you know buddhism is about action some people get exhausted just hearing

92
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:39,920
it like one more thing to do you know give me a break i thought actual buddhism was but just being

93
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,760
and you know i just sit down to meditate and and just kind of like finally i don't have to be racing around doing

94
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,800
things i could just be in it buddhism gives me permission just to be

95
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,720
but that's not what buddhism is really at the heart about

96
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,720
but maybe it's closer to this idea of how learning how to do

97
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,560
so in the doing we enter a kind of harmony or peacefulness or non-conflict or

98
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,600
non-stressfulness so the very doing we do is nourishing

99
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,640
supportive creates a kind of a beautiful environment

100
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:27,440
internally for ourselves physically mentally emotionally so how we do things

101
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:34,720
so how do we learn this uh for some of us uh certainly for me one of the primary ways of having

102
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,800
learned something like this had to do through meditation where it looks like you're doing nothing

103
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,560
sitting there still but sitting in a good meditative posture

104
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,959
is a kind of doing is an activity it's an action itself and then while i'm not doing anything

105
00:10:52,959 --> 00:11:00,160
i'm just being present but being mindful is an activity of the mind we're acting

106
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:06,880
as we start paying attention noticing how it is and what happens to us as we meditate as we get more settled and calm

107
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,959
and we see more one other thing it isn't just about becoming calm

108
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,399
what's more important than becoming calm is beginning to discover and track

109
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,519
the different ways we are in meditation to notice

110
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,680
when we are for example calm and when we're agitated or where we are in that spectrum

111
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,839
and begin feeling well being agitated is kind of stressful being calm is better

112
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,360
so maybe by accident you find yourself calm in meditation one day

113
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,040
and you're very familiar with your agitation that comes out of thinking about certain

114
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:54,160
things and so you start noticing yourself starting to think about those things

115
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:01,360
and leaving the calm and at some point in practice as the practice matures it

116
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,880
gets you get to the situation where you see that transition happening

117
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,560
and you're able to say no thank you because you see

118
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:22,079
that you're better off being calm than being agitated starting to stress out it's clearly it's better that way

119
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:27,440
as we settle in and become more present with mindfulness and mindfulness

120
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,959
at some point mindfulness is staying in the present moment with present moment experience

121
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:38,320
and we start seeing that the mind leaves to her thinking about something else

122
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,600
maybe something really important maybe the war in ukraine

123
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,120
from your meditation spot in california

124
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,839
and you can feel as you do that that you're getting angry

125
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,800
and then becomes you say is this really am i better off being angry or am i better off

126
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:06,639
being present with mindfully with what's happening here where is where am i taking up residency

127
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:12,240
am i taking up residency in the anger or residency in my peaceful state of

128
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:18,000
mindfulness of being mindful at some point

129
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,440
what we begin to discover that mindfulness and presence

130
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:31,839
peacefulness calm especially mindfulness is what are the best alternatives going

131
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:38,639
if someone asked me you know when should i be mindful

132
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,480
i would respond when it's the best alternative available

133
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:52,079
and how do i know is that as people become mindfulness get stronger it's really clear that staying mindful

134
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,120
is the better alternative to any state of being non-mindful

135
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,480
because tendency when not mindful is it's a stressful state

136
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:09,839
to be distracted caught up in thoughts preoccupied is not a really a healthy state to be in

137
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,440
and so we start seeing that we have mental actions that we have

138
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,880
some choice over we have a choice about whether to stay

139
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:27,199
with the action of being mindful or going along with the actions of being

140
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:33,199
stressful being agitated being worried being anxious being angry being greedy and

141
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:39,279
wanting and it's fascinating to watch the impact

142
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:44,639
different states of mind different chain trains of thought have on us to

143
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,680
see and feel it physically emotionally psychologically mentally

144
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,199
that some activities of the mind are clearly kind of

145
00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:01,040
not so beneficial for us there may be stressful or even harmful

146
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,240
they perpetuate harmful ways of being it habits of being

147
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,399
and that there are other ways that are clearly beneficial that clearly brings sense of harmony

148
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:18,720
peacefulness subtleness that helps us be connected to the best parts of who we are

149
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:25,360
rather than disconnected from it but then the lawyers of the mind come into play

150
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:34,240
and so one of the lawyers will say you're not being responsible for the world situation unless you get angry

151
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,680
or how can you take care of yourself without being greedy for the next thing

152
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,959
or wanting something you're supposed to want things i mean that's what all the advertisements have been telling us some

153
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:51,120
of them say you deserve so i'm supposed to go off there and so in one way the other

154
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:57,040
some of us will have very strong ideas beliefs

155
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,639
that we're supposed to be or it's good to be angry

156
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:09,759
anxious greedy conceded

157
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:16,000
with what we do i deserve it you know it's all of me and you know it's about of course i'm supposed to be the best

158
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,480
kitchen sweeper on my block and i've been let you know i make sure people know that because if

159
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:29,120
they don't know that then how will i get my just desserts about if people don't know how important i am

160
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,959
as a sweeper so so we have to contend with these lawyers

161
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:42,160
these beliefs we have but the beliefs we have which are subtle sometimes subconscious

162
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:48,720
can become known and it's possible to recognize the impact those belief just having those

163
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:55,440
beliefs have on having us chances are those beliefs are not just kind of floating through peacefully like

164
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,720
gentle cloud and empty sky and just kind of like you know coming and going they're a dime a dozen

165
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,880
no problem they come with a force they come with a grip they come with an insistence that's kind

166
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,798
of stressful if if we're having some choice about the

167
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:19,520
actions we've engaged in do we have a choice about whether to go along with those beliefs

168
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:25,280
allow them to take over allow them to influence us participate in them

169
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,799
or do we have the choice to be mindful at their happening

170
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:36,559
look at that there's a belief wow it's just another cloud it's just a dark

171
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:42,640
one but it's just a belief but i'm mindful of believing

172
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:48,720
and then seeing what the impact is of that mindfulness

173
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,559
and learning how to be mindful so the mindfulness itself doesn't add to the stress

174
00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:01,039
the mindfulness itself adds to a kind of peacefulness a kind of a kind of something that feels

175
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:09,280
nourishing and pleasant sometimes the buddhist tradition talks about states of mind that are beautiful

176
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:18,000
so it creates beauty inside but isn't that self-indulgent

177
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,919
well the alternative is worse the alternative of being caught up in these things and preoccupied and

178
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:33,919
listening to the lawyers that say that you have to be a certain way and have to be anxious and upset and angry or yet

179
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,960
let get let people know about you know how right you are and

180
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:45,840
all kinds of things why sacrifice your peace why sacrifice

181
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:52,160
the best alternative available so as we sit and meditate part of the advantages we start learning

182
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:58,640
have a reference point for a healthier and healthier way of being in the world

183
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:05,120
and at some point we realize it's the best alternative going why why diminish yourself

184
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,400
undermine yourself uh in the old habits maybe of

185
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,679
how you usually be it's a it's a navigation for many people

186
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:24,000
negotiation or kind of to discover that it's okay to have an inner life that's peaceful

187
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:31,039
sometimes our society doesn't doesn't appreciate it you're supposed to be a worried

188
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:36,160
you know if you're if you're not worrying you don't love me if you're supposed to be angry if you're

189
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:42,559
not angry then you're not really concerned with justice the more angry you are the more you're

190
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:48,559
proving yourself interested in you know justice in the world

191
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:54,240
and the more angry you are about what's going on the more you're showing that you're one of the people who is

192
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,360
believing the right things or doing the right things so there's all these reasons why people feel like they're

193
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,720
supposed to be angry or they are not okay to be peaceful and

194
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:12,080
present but as we start learning this this new reference point

195
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:18,000
through some like meditation or mindfulness that new reference point becomes

196
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,080
a teacher for us and shows us what is healthy to do and what is not healthy to

197
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:32,080
do and then we keep choosing and buddhism we keep choosing a healthy alternative

198
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:39,200
and then this teachings of action that the buddha has is sometimes

199
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:45,120
encapsulated in four kinds of action that

200
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,400
there's a four four ways of acting everything can fit into these four categories

201
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:58,559
so it makes action simple it's more has to do with how you do things than what you do but it can be what you do too

202
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:04,240
and they're summarized like four words a little bit my own

203
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:10,559
version of these four it's to prevent

204
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:17,520
to stop to start and to protect

205
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:23,360
prevent stop start protect so the first is prevention an ounce of

206
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,919
prevention is better than anything else so

207
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:34,240
live a life that prevents sets up the conditions so you avoid

208
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,520
getting caught up in states of mind habits thoughts activities

209
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:46,080
which are unhealthy for you detrimental as we have stronger and stronger

210
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:52,960
reference point of peace within it becomes more and more subtle

211
00:21:53,840 --> 00:22:00,559
understanding how to prevent so if we are living

212
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:06,640
stressfully it's very easy to not pay enough attention and have old

213
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,400
habits take over one way to prevent getting lost in

214
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:19,200
unhealthy states of mind and health activities is to be

215
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:27,760
is to stay calm not don't allow yourself to get stressed out easier said than done but

216
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,840
that's the game that's the that's what we're trying to do here to prevent maybe there's things you

217
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:40,400
should avoid doing entirely maybe you should avoid drinking alcohol

218
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,760
it seems innocent enough i can do it no problems

219
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:51,840
but it turns out that whenever you're doing alcohol the next day you're not quite up to your usual self

220
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:57,440
to your full self or in a good way and you tend to say things you later regret

221
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:03,520
because you get more casual or you're kind of tired or something and so there's a lot of things we can

222
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,799
pay attention to what can we do to make it less likely we succumb to

223
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:14,080
some of these unhealthy tendencies so for example one of the great

224
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:20,559
preventive moves activities for meditators is to meditate

225
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:26,880
to have the kind of presence of mind the attention the calm that comes from meditation

226
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,559
sometimes has a lingering effect through the day if you meditate in the morning

227
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:40,320
and uh maybe you're less likely to get stressed out or get caught in preoccupations or less likely to do

228
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,679
something mindlessly or you're more in a frame of mind frame of heart

229
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:54,240
where you're connected to what's the best in you so meditation is a preventative

230
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,720
you know just like brushing your teeth every day meditate every day just as a good preventive mechanism from getting

231
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,240
cavities mental cavities mind cavities

232
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:11,520
so to prevent you know prevention the second is so is to prevent yourself

233
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:19,039
to prevent yourself from getting involved with things which are unhealthy for you in body speech and mind the second is to

234
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:24,640
stop and learning to stop is

235
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:31,200
fantastic what it means here is if you find yourself doing something which is unhealthy

236
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,960
stop if you have a train of thought which is not going anywhere useful it's actually

237
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:43,200
going some detrimental way learn the capacity a healthy capacity to

238
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:50,320
stop doing it to avoid it to drop it to let go of it

239
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,679
but to stop but you know it's my mind it's just what it's doing and it's that's repression if

240
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,720
i stop it or that's kind of like not allowing things to be or that means that i

241
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:07,120
you know i deserve i'm supposed to think that way and i'm supposed to include all of who i am and what's just buddhism that says i

242
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:13,200
can't do this kind of stuff yeah i mean if you argue like that i

243
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,840
just probably just get quiet maybe it'd be kind of like saying that um yeah yeah when i have a cut in my

244
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:26,880
finger i should still be able to do whatever i do and you know put my hands into the compost pile and

245
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:33,039
clean the sewer and not have to worry about anything you know putting a band-aid over it or keeping it clean or putting a

246
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:40,400
glove on while i do those activities and that just seems like i'm being limited and i i want to just be myself fully and

247
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,440
and i happen to have this cut on my hand and i just wanted you know okay well if you say that

248
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,640
okay well you know maybe i'll take you to the

249
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:56,400
emergency when your hand gets infected let me know so

250
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,840
to start learning how to stop but to stopping it

251
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:08,400
itself to do it in a peaceful way the stopping itself is an activity

252
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,880
so how do you do that activity so that it supports the best in you

253
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:21,120
so it supports harmony beauty peacefulness calm

254
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:26,559
if you uh i've had it i've had you know there's a there's an expression whack-a-mole

255
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:32,000
that's applied to meditation and uh which is kind of like every time something

256
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,799
like a thought arises or some kind of negative thought arises and kind of like hit it over the head to

257
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:45,120
knock it down you know knock it down like kind of this angry aggressive form of mindfulness

258
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:51,039
and uh when i was a new meditator i sometimes imagined i was playing pinball machine

259
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:57,440
you know it's like knock that thought out of the way or and uh

260
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:04,240
but how to stop in a way that feels peaceful and not repressive not angry

261
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:10,480
not attacking anything just kind of like that's enough no thank you

262
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,919
i don't have to do that anymore and how does mindfulness a clear

263
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:22,880
recognition of what's happening how is that a kind of a stopping

264
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:29,760
and it's a kind of a stopping if your life energy goes into the mindfulness

265
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:36,080
so it's not so much available to continue trains of thoughts and ideas and motivations

266
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:41,840
that don't serve you stop

267
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:49,440
so the third is to start there are things you can do which are healthy that are beneficial supportive

268
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:55,120
you could start your mindfulness practice you can start kindness

269
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:02,960
you can start generosity you can start looking more closely what's going on here investigate

270
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,559
sometimes you can start joy you can start

271
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:16,720
a calmness you can kind of take a deep breath and relax and relax your body

272
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,000
you can take a couple of moments you know to take a little walk

273
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:30,159
maybe just maybe just uh 20 paces enough to get a little bit more settled and calm and connected

274
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:35,360
start means to get involved and start doing the things that you've learned are

275
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:42,080
supportive and helpful there too how you do it is important

276
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:48,799
if you're desperately doing it holding on for dear life maybe that's not the most conducive to

277
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:55,039
being you know get the best out of it if you're doing in a greedy way

278
00:28:55,039 --> 00:29:01,039
you know like i'm going to get these really good states of mind and that's what i want to have

279
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:06,240
and then i can go be the best meditator on my block and i'm going to let everyone know

280
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:13,520
or you can do it as a way of avoiding it can actually be a form of anger or aversion hostility

281
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:20,559
i'm going to get rid of that bad states of mind but getting those good states of mind here and overcoming it

282
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:25,600
those are all actions of the mind always in buddhism we're looking at the

283
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:31,279
actions of the mind the actions of mind body and speech we're looking at those actions

284
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:36,320
and evaluating them is the way that i do anything

285
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:42,000
the way that i respond to anything happening in the moment or anytime

286
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,679
is the way i'm responding beneficial or not beneficial

287
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:55,840
and then we have the fourth one which is protect some things are worth protecting

288
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:02,080
some states of mind some ways of being some activities of mind they're worth protecting

289
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:08,559
if you finally after a lifetime of being anxious you're finally calm or settled or at

290
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:14,000
rest then it's maybe that's good to protect

291
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,039
but how do you protect it not by resistance not by

292
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:25,200
stressfully holding everything at bay but maybe valuing it taking time for it

293
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:31,520
not rushing off to all the other next things we could do so we forget about it

294
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,960
protect what's good protect what's coming along the beauty

295
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:44,480
all of you have tremendous potential for inner beauty all kinds of ways in which there's

296
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:51,360
something really a treasure inside of you as you get hints of it

297
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:57,840
that sense of it through practice or other ways it's worth protecting

298
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:06,159
protecting it is another action the question is how do you do that action so it is beneficial it's healthy it

299
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:12,559
brings harmony to the situation well you protect it

300
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:19,120
by preventing unhealthy ways of

301
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:26,080
protecting stopping unhealthy ways of protecting initiating healthy ways of protecting

302
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:32,480
and then protecting yourself from that doing that there's always a self-referencing back

303
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:38,960
and as practice deepens and deepens and matures for people there's a stronger and stronger and stronger reference

304
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:47,679
point of well-being of ease of peace of happiness

305
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:53,840
that gives us a clear and clear understanding

306
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:59,840
of how valuable these four efforts are these four actions are

307
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:05,120
preventing stopping starting

308
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:11,519
and protecting as we go along with this

309
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:17,440
then when we encounter the world and all the

310
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:25,600
horrible and beautiful things that can happen in the world that reference point is available

311
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,840
so if we encounter the horrific

312
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:34,000
war in ukraine

313
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,639
why sacrifice your own inner well-being

314
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:51,440
at that in relationship to the war why sacrifice

315
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:58,159
your peace your harmony so that you can be angry

316
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:03,440
so that you can be distressed so that you can be

317
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,799
afraid you know so all these things we do

318
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:15,120
that we in choosing to do those and we do choose this is the kind of the

319
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:20,960
challenge of buddhism we don't necessarily see the choice being done but we choose

320
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:27,039
why choose these stressful ways of being why not

321
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:32,720
stay with our peace one of the reasons people choose to let

322
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:40,320
go of their peace is they feel like then they won't be able to be responsibly

323
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,639
involved in making a difference in the world

324
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:53,519
for those of us here in california is your being angry you're being

325
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,799
despairing going to help anything

326
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:06,399
why give into despair when you're sitting quietly and you see that

327
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:11,679
moving into despair is a choice it comes with beliefs

328
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:17,280
that are evoking the despair why give into it

329
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:24,240
and this teaching i'm giving here i think is most suitable for people who do something like mindfulness meditation

330
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:29,280
and who really be able to settle and see there's this choice there's a reference

331
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,800
point for some kind of place of being it's okay

332
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:41,839
and in fact not only is it okay the world needs people who know

333
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:47,040
how not to give into despair how not to give into anger how not to give into

334
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:53,200
fear how not to give into greed because if there's going to be any

335
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,560
chance for world peace

336
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:05,520
it has to come out of that that somehow world peace

337
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:12,240
the greatest wonderful goal that is begins with each of you

338
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:17,440
i can't begin for you i can't begin anywhere else

339
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:24,078
they can't begin anywhere else if you want to do something for the ukraine

340
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:34,079
stop the war in your heart find peace be that way

341
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:39,760
does that mean that you ignore what's happening in ukraine no

342
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:48,320
my my trust is that if you find the healthy peaceful freedom that's within

343
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:54,880
the heart will respond as is appropriate and there are many ways of be of

344
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:00,240
responding some very local some indirect some direct

345
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:06,880
it all depends on our circumstances but buddhism is about action

346
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:12,079
so how will you act don't be a couch potato that's that's

347
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:18,800
not a healthy action how do you act

348
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:27,839
so that the very acting responding feels nourishing and beneficial for you

349
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:34,240
how do you maybe change your lifestyle like i can imagine there's going to be a call for us to

350
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:40,800
change our lifestyle because it seems to me that it's be pretty beneficial for the world

351
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:47,760
for those of us all over the world but in this country to consume less gasoline

352
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:54,320
for all kinds of reasons it would be beneficial but this is an exact religious idea in the united states it's a way of getting

353
00:36:54,320 --> 00:37:00,160
voted out of office if you if you say it

354
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:07,359
but how to do that change how we live and live in a way that

355
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:14,880
contributes to the world rather than detracts from it how do we do it so we feel nourished inspired gladdened by the

356
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:21,359
very doing that's the art of this not so that we feel diminished we

357
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:27,520
actually feel enhanced we feel more beautiful we feel more happy

358
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:33,760
how do we make a donation to save the children not because you know

359
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:41,040
you know gil is expecting it of us and you know then it's kind of to be diminishing that kind of undermines you

360
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:47,040
for that kind of motivation but is there a motivation that comes out of a subtle peaceful place that's

361
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:53,599
inspired that makes you sing this is great to do that it's tragic it's heartbreaking what's

362
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:59,760
happening in ukraine but here is a beautiful activity that i can participate in it feels good to do

363
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,760
this

364
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:13,680
and then my hope is that as we learn how to stop the war

365
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:20,400
drinking a cup of tea sweeping the floor

366
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:27,599
talking to our neighbors whatever we're doing that we'll set up the conditions

367
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:33,599
that when what we have to offer the world

368
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,640
to save the world comes in front of us we'll act

369
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:44,160
accordingly that we when we understand what's needed

370
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:49,760
when we understand the situation and what we have to offer that we will be

371
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:55,359
people who contribute to a better world not just because we're peaceful

372
00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:01,040
but because that peaceful place is empowering

373
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:08,000
action empowering engagement in a way that's appropriate for each of

374
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,960
us in our own way so that that engagement

375
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:20,880
is beneficial for us not harmful to us it enhances us

376
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:28,640
doesn't add to our stress and our burdens and diminishes us the buddha taught action

377
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:34,400
was a teacher of action and how do we act in such a way

378
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:41,359
that the heart can live in this world actively fully participating in this

379
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:48,079
world so the heart is at peace

380
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:55,359
so the heart the heart of the heart is sweetly

381
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:04,000
still sweetly unagitated unmoving

382
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,319
and here is where buddhism emphasizes not doing

383
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:16,640
the place where the heart is sweetly not doing

384
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:22,720
peaceful still while we

385
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:28,720
act and speak and think in beneficial ways for ourselves and for

386
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:33,839
a whole world may this practice that we do

387
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:40,800
give us the inner reference point of peace of stillness non-agitation

388
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:46,319
that allows the best of us to come forth into the world

389
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:53,520
that's for our own benefit and the benefit of the whole world may this practice help us be peacemakers

390
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:59,400
for this world thank you
