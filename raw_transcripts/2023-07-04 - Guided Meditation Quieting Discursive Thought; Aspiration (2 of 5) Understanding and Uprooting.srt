1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,899
so good morning everyone and have a good day good evening Wherever You Are

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:14,759
and uh welcome then this uh Fourth of July Independence

3
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,000
Day I wonder if we could almost uh

4
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:27,720
claim it as a Buddhist holiday for a different uh definition of independence or liberation

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,439
and so here we sit on the path of liberation

6
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:40,379
and in the teachings of the Buddha uh the idea is to

7
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:46,399
see in our direct experience perceive in our direct experience

8
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:53,760
the Dharma so that we become independent in the Dharma we don't have to depend on

9
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,780
anyone else to tell us what the Dharma is because we've really seen it for ourselves

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,360
so uh for today what I'd like to emphasize

11
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,439
is and maybe building on the idea of aspiration and what I'm going to teach

12
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:16,260
offer you for the meditation maybe can be aspirational so you don't get caught

13
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:24,960
up in the idea of success or doing it right or something and um and the idea is to

14
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,140
um see if you can for maybe only a few moments at a time

15
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:38,400
maybe more longer as the meditation goes along maybe you can quiet

16
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,119
your discursive thinking the thinking that is telling stories that's explaining things having

17
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:53,880
commentary the um the mind that's having fantasies uh

18
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,840
and uh reviewing things remembering things what happened remembering conversations

19
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:08,819
having conversations with people and that's why it's kind of called discursive thinking I think they're holding a discourse with yourself

20
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:15,840
and this is a higher order kind of more active agitated complex form of thinking

21
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,540
that kind of um can take all the

22
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:30,000
the air out of the room or if someone is really goes into a room of other people and is so loud and so assertive about

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,020
their opinions and their views there's no space for anyone else to speak and so the discursive mind fills the

24
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:42,420
space and but we have other deeper ways of

25
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,760
understanding of knowing and even kind of deeper more subtle more satisfying

26
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:55,260
ways of thinking and there's a lot of knowing there's a lot of understanding that can

27
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:01,620
happen if the thinking mind becomes quiet and we listen more deeply to what is

28
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,840
here what do we know what what is happening what are we

29
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:14,280
feeling what do we understand what deeper understandings are coming that are not coming from the same

30
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:20,040
place that discursive thinking comes from discursive thinking comes from

31
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:28,440
pressure from tension from a certain degree of attachment from anxiety from

32
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:35,340
a ambition and desires and again they fill the they fill the

33
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:42,180
room so there's no chance for anything else to happen so as we sit today meditate

34
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,400
that maybe um with the every exhale

35
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:53,459
maybe you can let go of your discursive thoughts it doesn't mean that letting go of all

36
00:03:53,459 --> 00:04:00,480
your thinking what remains are very very simple thoughts of recognition of understanding something that doesn't

37
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:08,700
involve you thinking and reflecting and examining and wondering and

38
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:15,480
constructing and the advantage of dropping below this discursive mind is a discursive mind

39
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:22,079
it's like a puppeteer with strings all over all over and that has effects on our emotions our

40
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:28,080
body our tensions we carry it has a big input impact on us this

41
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,440
discursive mind that is not always so useful and to drop below that

42
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,840
and let that become quiet to give yourself a chance to hear and recognize

43
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:46,620
the knowing that arises the feelings the understanding that can be there the

44
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:53,400
connection to ourselves that can be there um in a kind of non

45
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:59,880
um assertive way non you know it's almost like what's there

46
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:08,100
if there's no self-preoccupation what arises without the self

47
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:15,180
trying to make something happen or figure something out so with every exhale to quiet the

48
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:21,300
thinking mind maybe you all the way to the end of the exhale where there's silence at the end of the

49
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:27,000
exhale the Stillness that the momentarily there is a Stillness of the Mind

50
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,479
and then to listen to sense to feel now what is there

51
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:38,699
and maybe that's a con persist into the beginning of the inhale so it's very

52
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:46,020
brief and but the more you can kind of become concentrated or settled on the breathing

53
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:53,180
the more that that begins to quiet the discursive mind

54
00:05:53,340 --> 00:06:01,800
so we'll see so that's the aspiration so to assume your meditation posture

55
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:08,820
and to gently close your eyes

56
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:15,560
and to spend a little bit of time with your body maybe swaying back and forth and forward and backwards

57
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:22,800
just to kind of slowing down and finding the midpoint of upright and balanced on

58
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,460
the sitting bones

59
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:37,919
and to help you kind of move out of the stream of discursive thoughts

60
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,960
it can be helpful to take a few long slow deep breaths

61
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:50,479
maybe three quarters full so there's an intentional engagement with breathing in deeply

62
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:56,840
intentional involvement with exhaling fully

63
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:05,360
connecting to the body as you do so

64
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,979
feeling a more embodied connection

65
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:17,240
to the present moment

66
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,639
and then letting your breathing return to normal

67
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:32,520
and to continue systematically scanning through the body

68
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:38,280
and relaxing part of the power of discursive thoughts

69
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:45,479
that that drives it is comes from our tension that we hold

70
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:50,940
and you probably find if you find yourself in a lot of discursive thoughts and look around in your body

71
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:57,000
you probably find that there's places of tension either in your body or in your

72
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,620
brain or your mind

73
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:09,120
fuel for discursive thought distention stress

74
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:16,039
pressure contraction so relaxing the face

75
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:21,139
around the forehead and the eyes

76
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:30,360
relaxing the jaw maybe letting the teeth fall a little

77
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:37,399
bit away from each other the upper and lower teeth

78
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:46,800
and then as you exhale to soften and relax around the

79
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,160
shoulders

80
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:08,600
perhaps softening and relaxing in your chest in the Heart Center

81
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,220
and perhaps better softening in the belly

82
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,720
letting the belly hang forward and

83
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,440
down

84
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:44,120
maybe a softening of the hands and fingers

85
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:57,139
maybe a relaxing of the thighs and the legs

86
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:18,360
and then finally feeling whatever pressure or attention

87
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:27,300
there might be that's associated with thinking in the area of your brain or eyes or

88
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,980
Jaws or shoulders

89
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,220
then as you exhale to soften

90
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:55,339
gently settling into your body breathing

91
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,800
and feeling the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out

92
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,399
and then to

93
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,620
almost like linger with the exhale

94
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:42,019
letting your thinking mind discursive thoughts quiet

95
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,860
with each exhale

96
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:10,399
and at the end of the exhale and peace breathing becomes quiet for even moment

97
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:17,279
feel and sense see what is there underneath the

98
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,180
discursive thought

99
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,540
what is it you can connect to and be with

100
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:35,839
understand what knowing arises

101
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,240
that's deeper than discursive thought

102
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:49,860
and no need to think about what that is just let it appear and disappear Let It

103
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,620
Come and Go whatever is there

104
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:04,760
no need to get involved in discursive thoughts and figuring it out and analyzing or judging

105
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:17,279
there isn't so much you stay close to that deeper understanding or feeling

106
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:24,980
but rather stay close to that the absence of discursive thinking

107
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:31,040
letting go with every exhale

108
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:39,079
quieting with every exhale

109
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:09,560
foreign

110
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,299
foreign

111
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:21,200
and then bring this meditation to a close

112
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:29,220
aspiring that whatever depth within you that you can access

113
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:37,519
aspiring for that to be for the good that is there to benefit you

114
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:45,600
it's there to benefit the world and others and the quieting of this excursive mind

115
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:52,799
may it be for the welfare and happiness of everyone self-included

116
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:59,520
by being able to listen to the deeper voices the deeper goodness

117
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:05,480
the deeper love and generosity that's within

118
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:12,539
their practice be for the welfare and happiness of all beings everywhere

119
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:19,679
may all beings be happy may all beings be peaceful

120
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:27,740
may all beings be safe and may all beings be free

121
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:39,939
[Music]

122
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,919
thank you

123
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:38,640
so for this second talk on the aspiration

124
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:44,640
that comes along with compassion that the desire to

125
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:51,799
for people not to suffer people not to struggle and be in danger

126
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:59,700
be challenged and unnecessary and difficult ways

127
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:07,260
it's such a wonderful idea it's a wonderful occurrence to have this wish this aspiration

128
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:14,700
an aspiration where we're not self-preoccupied we are available to care for other

129
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:20,159
people to have care for them to have concern for them to have wishes for them

130
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:26,940
that their welfare is at least as important as our own and may it be that they are happy maybe

131
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:33,840
that they don't suffer and so this is Instinct this movement towards

132
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:42,659
compassion involves a wish a desire that precedes acting and the action part

133
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:48,059
that's the the whole topic we'll do at another time for a whole week

134
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:54,779
but before the action there's the wish the aspiration the care the

135
00:32:54,779 --> 00:33:01,740
and there are times when we have that wish but it's not for us to do anything we we learn about someone far away we

136
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:09,179
read about someone in the news and we have compassion we wish them well we want them we hope that this that we

137
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:14,519
would like the suffering to go away we Aspire for it but maybe it's not our place to do

138
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:21,120
something about it it's not our opportunity but there are times when we have been

139
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:27,360
the opportunity to act and to do something and they're also this idea of acting and

140
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:32,580
and doing things for the welfare of others is also a wonderful antidote to

141
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:37,740
self-preoccupation and which is often can often be so the

142
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:45,360
word of the operating ideas self-preoccupation self-occupations really caught up in in oneself and

143
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:52,440
spinning around in self-concern and self combinations and criticisms and desires

144
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:59,399
and all that that there's so much tension there that just generates more and more of the same and to be able to

145
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:07,500
step out of that current of self-preoccupation one of the ways is to care for others to be available to be

146
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:13,800
aware of others through it be attuned to others to appreciate others and to feel

147
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:19,980
the empathy and and connection to their struggles and their suffering

148
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:26,878
and um and uh and then to Aspire that they're

149
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:35,099
suffering somehow they don't suffer they don't suffer as much so sometimes with the kind of a headlong

150
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:40,638
kind of throwing yourself into compassion doing it from sense of Duty or we should

151
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:45,960
the aspiration can be somewhat simplistic or can be limited and the

152
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:51,419
most common way to do that can be is to feel that I'm responsible and I have to

153
00:34:51,419 --> 00:34:56,460
help end that suffering to help it to stop and uh and the only thing that counts is

154
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:02,160
somehow stopping it so um and sometimes we can do something for

155
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:08,580
someone say that someone is um you know is chronically hungry

156
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:16,200
and so it might be important to feed them and I don't want to say it's you know I

157
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:22,320
don't want to diminish the value of feeding people but if all we do is to feed someone

158
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:28,320
then the the condition situation by which they're always hungry is always

159
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,599
going to be present and this hasn't been addressed and so in some ways we kind of

160
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:39,420
perpetuate the system the conditions the psychology all whatever's going on that

161
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:44,760
is perpetuating their challenge The Compassion that simply doesn't want

162
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:50,339
to stop that particular you know what we see directly in front of us but understands that it's something deeper

163
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:57,180
is going on here there are wider conditions societal conditions there are personal conditions or psychological

164
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:03,380
things going on and to really help someone we want to be able to go underneath

165
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:09,000
and see more deeply what is really going on here and what is it to help someone

166
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:16,859
to help themselves what is it to help someone so that the conditions are there that they don't keep falling back into

167
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:26,339
the same difficulty over and over again and so um this is to understand this is to uh

168
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:33,780
to undo this is to uproot and what Buddhism specializes in is

169
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:41,040
doing this psychologically looking deep within ourselves there's definitely a time and place that's very important to understand the

170
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:48,119
wider conditions of the persons in the social conditions family conditions societal conditions and have some way

171
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:55,619
important way to address those as well so that the perpetuation of people's challenges are not just kind of repeated

172
00:36:55,619 --> 00:37:01,079
because of how Society operates but the but the specialty in Buddhism

173
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:07,020
and here in meditation is this also to become aware of more deeply in oneself

174
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:14,460
and then because we understand ourselves so well maybe begin understanding other people as well to understand what is the

175
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:20,579
underlying psychological causes for the tension people carry the stresses they

176
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:26,520
hold on to they're overwhelmed that they have the emotional pain they're

177
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:32,700
experiencing and more often than not there's something that people something deeper

178
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:41,640
is operating some deeper fear some deeper attachments some deeper conceit ideas of self some deeper desires that

179
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:49,380
maybe sometimes are not healthy desires to have and so to Simply address the suffering

180
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:55,680
um without looking at the underlying conditions means the underlying conditions are

181
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:03,660
there and present to to show up again and again and again another few people are confused by how

182
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:09,000
yes the suffering has ended but then it revisits them the next day

183
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,240
there are people who have uh regularly move away from jobs away from people

184
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:21,599
because they find the situation is difficult some people move away from Buddhist Meditation centers or Buddhist

185
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:28,619
practice and to go find something else and for a few moment a little while the new thing whatever they find the job the

186
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:36,839
persons the practice the religion is exciting and wonderful and has a lot of problems but sooner a lot enough they

187
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:43,440
run into the same problems because they brought it with them the underlying attachments the fear the way

188
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:49,980
they're closed what they're avoiding begins to show itself and then becomes difficult

189
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:57,060
and sometimes in that difficulty the situation outside is blamed to the situation outside is supposed to fix it

190
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:04,640
for them and if it doesn't we're going to go somewhere else and so the idea of of helping people

191
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:10,440
supporting people to begin understanding Underneath more deeply what are the

192
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:16,380
underlying causes underlying psychological conditions for the suffering they have

193
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:24,660
and that of course helping people to do that it should be is a delicate thing to do we don't want to be people's you know

194
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:29,820
therapists we don't want to be kind of assuming we understand what's really

195
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:35,640
going on for them but there is a ways of being present for people and listening and being in

196
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:41,700
conversation so that we kind of we kind of discover what's going on in a deeper way with

197
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:48,780
them as a way of helping them understand asking simple questions or being just

198
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:55,740
being a very good listener an active listener and listening and reflecting back what you hear or or commenting

199
00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:00,960
briefly about it just so they know you've heard it and some people when they know they've been heard understood

200
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:07,740
open up more and more and um and so we're not in maybe

201
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:14,280
addressing the surface suffering but we're helping to kind of begin uncover

202
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:19,859
deeper suffering that's there so this uncovering

203
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:25,859
this uprooting this undoing this understanding of something deeper

204
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:32,060
and and one of the things that active listening does being present for people

205
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:38,460
is that we offer to others what we can offer to ourselves in meditation that is

206
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:45,960
a listening that begins going deeper than discursive thoughts that what we actually talk about and say

207
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:53,880
might be the tip of an iceberg or something really deeper that's going on and so if someone's talking about some

208
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:59,520
challenge they have in their life and and they're simply saying sounds

209
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:06,180
like that's really hard um that's now points into something deeper and there's opportunity then for

210
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:11,760
people too because yeah it is hard I'm afraid or I'm troubled or I'm discouraged

211
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:18,480
and and then that is beginning to touch something that's deeper and sometimes I've seen over and over

212
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:24,119
again that we don't necessarily have to help people and solve problems for

213
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:29,940
people but sometimes it just helps people to be seen and to be known in

214
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:38,220
this deeper way so if we fix people's surface suffering and problems then they don't get seen

215
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:44,640
if we oh just you do this and that and this and then you'll be fine and or come with me and we'll just go

216
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:50,220
out and have a you know you know an exciting time at the movies or

217
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:55,800
something and it's more of a distraction than trying to deal with the suffering there might be relief

218
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:01,020
but there's not release there's not freedom and this deeper level of understanding

219
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:07,200
of of uncovering um is a um and for people to be seen

220
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:15,960
understood recognize listened to in this deeper way that itself is the medicine that itself is a phenomenal support for

221
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:21,720
softenings lessening overcoming the suffering people have

222
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:29,400
so this um you know the aspiration to understand to uncover to support people

223
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:35,099
to um to undo or uproot what's going on

224
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:41,040
much more deeper that's a movement of that's an aspiration of of compassion

225
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:46,579
that maybe has more lasting value than simply

226
00:42:46,579 --> 00:42:51,720
uh in some surface way alleviating the

227
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:57,839
suffering that someone has especially if alleviating it it just means it's temporary and it'll come back

228
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:03,180
the next day it'll come back over and over again until something deeper happens

229
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:10,380
so not a few people we I think the in this world have this recurrent

230
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:18,359
theme a particular kind of distress anxiety frustration anger

231
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:23,819
that keeps reoccurring and so if we meet them with our

232
00:43:23,819 --> 00:43:32,220
Compassion maybe is to hold whatever the surface is with a certain kind of equanimity acceptance and non-reactivity

233
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:38,040
so and listen deeply support them so that see what else is going on here

234
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:44,400
what's going on more deeply so the aspiration the compassion and

235
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:51,180
aspiration is a concern not just with a surface suffering but the deeper causes and

236
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:56,880
conditions so that we're not just feeding people who are helping people to

237
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:02,700
grow their own food you know as a metaphor

238
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:08,280
so um thank you and thank you for uh being

239
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:13,319
here on the fourth of July I wish you all here in the United States

240
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:20,700
a relaxing and happy and stress-free day

241
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:27,540
and um I'm gonna go home now and go out with a hike in the mountains with my wife for

242
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:35,119
this morning which seems like the perfect thing for me to do so thank you
