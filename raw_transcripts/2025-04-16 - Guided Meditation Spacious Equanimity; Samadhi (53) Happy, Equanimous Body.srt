1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:13,200
so hello again from Spirit Rock Meditation Center and uh this is the

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,160
last morning I'll be here for this time and uh it's been a

3
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:28,800
wonderful time with my three teachers Tueri Salah and Darra Williams

4
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,399
and Kyra jewel lingo and

5
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:41,280
uh and also with the retreatance here and all of spirit rock it's a

6
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:48,200
wonderful place to practice as you see in these wonderful uh kind of rolling hills behind

7
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:53,840
me we're nestled into these hills and spend much of the time when we have to

8
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:01,320
go between places outdoors and as you can also see these days if you've been following the

9
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,720
weather changes quite a bit and that's part of the joy of uh being at Spirit

10
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:13,200
Rock being outdoors and um I've been here many many years over you know guess

11
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,200
I've been coming here for 35 years and no matter what the weather is I'm happy

12
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:27,880
hot cold stormy so welcome to the meditation and

13
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:34,560
Um and uh one of the characteristics factors that come into play in

14
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:42,439
meditation that stands out in a highlight uh in the third Janna is

15
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:48,680
equinimity uh it becomes even more significant in the fourth Janna but it already appears

16
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,960
here and uh together with mindfulness with sati

17
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:59,880
awareness and clear recognition clear comprehension

18
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:07,799
sajana and um and uh equinimity

19
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:14,280
and one of the meanings of the word upa

20
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:22,319
equinimity is to have kind of an overview a bird's eyee view of our

21
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:30,120
situation how we are at the moment the current experience that puts it into a wider

22
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:39,000
context that allows us to hold it in a spacious way hold it

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,640
generously hold it without getting caught in any reactivity the reactivity of being for

24
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:53,720
and against the activity of translating the experience into a

25
00:02:53,720 --> 00:03:01,879
story a prediction of the future without the reactivity that wants

26
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:06,959
to assign meaning to the experience

27
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:16,920
or the orientation to measure the experience or relate the experience to

28
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,280
uh ideas of me myself

29
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,159
mine this is who I am

30
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:35,360
just this wide spacious overview with no inclinations to have

31
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,920
thoughts about who am I what am I where am

32
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:47,959
I because the overview the broad perspective the spacious open

33
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:52,879
perspective feels so complete

34
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,640
so satisfying that none of the

35
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:06,959
reactivity is needed we see that we feel that we know that for the time of the

36
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:13,879
meditation we understand there's something much better to do in this wide

37
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:20,680
aquamus overview uh that sees and knows

38
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:27,759
but allows each thing to be itself and the metaphor for the third Janna that we

39
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,919
talked about yesterday is um lotus

40
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:39,520
flowers and in a certain kind of way everything becomes a

41
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:48,759
flower it's seen that way in this kind of aquinomous open

42
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:57,520
expansive view of a third so to assume a meditation

43
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:12,320
posture and while you're sitting establishing your

44
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:23,680
posture see if there are small adjustments you can make that soften your posture

45
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,360
that settles your

46
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,639
body and oddly enough maybe there's a way

47
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:48,560
of being well aligned in the posture that allows for a deeper

48
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:56,479
relaxation if we relax everything

49
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:02,680
seemingly we can't relax the most

50
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:16,880
so and if you haven't already to gently close your

51
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:30,600
eyes taking a few deeper

52
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:38,680
longer inhales and exhales to begin entering

53
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,720
into the body meditating

54
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,360
and letting your breathing return to normal

55
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,479
and to orient yourself around the

56
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:24,080
body as if it's the body that's meditating as if it's the

57
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:31,000
body that generates awareness

58
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:39,400
maybe through the way the body can sense

59
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:46,160
sensations the broad fields of sensing in the

60
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,199
body and in that broad field of sensing in the

61
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:05,160
body there's the movement the sensations of breathing

62
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:25,120
and perhaps with every exhale let it be an

63
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,399
opening a widening of awareness through the

64
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:38,360
body open to possibilities open to what's there

65
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,480
and with every inhale also in

66
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:03,600
opening the awareness wide broad field of sensing field of

67
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:11,160
awareness open to possibilities open to what's here

68
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:22,200
without the need to think about it in

69
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,760
fact appreciating that by

70
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:35,640
suspending thinking discursive

71
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:41,959
thinking you become more open more sensitive

72
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,399
through the field of

73
00:09:51,480 --> 00:10:02,360
sensations and the vast space around sensations around your body

74
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,240
the space of awareness within

75
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:13,240
which the body meditates

76
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:57,000
letting go of thinking as you exhale and letting go

77
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,760
into the body the field of awareness

78
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:11,880
open to A spacious field of

79
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,880
sensing

80
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:31,880
awareness as you inhale letting your

81
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,279
thoughts float away

82
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,360
and again open to the spacious

83
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:55,640
awareness of what is here and now as the body

84
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:00,440
meditates the body senses

85
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:13,279
And the mind the quiet mind

86
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:19,959
provides an openness to the vast space all

87
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:25,800
around the sensations of the body meditating

88
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:15,480
[Music]

89
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,559
[Music]

90
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:11,600
just like the sky is not disturbed by a cloud that

91
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,240
drifts through it

92
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,839
so the field of

93
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:32,919
awareness is not disturbed by whatever is known

94
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:45,039
the feel of spaciousness around all

95
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:52,639
things does not react to

96
00:17:53,480 --> 00:18:02,919
anything everything is like a cloud drifting through or like a flower lotus

97
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:08,120
flower floating in the vast

98
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:17,640
waters of the body's lake

99
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:03,960
one of the qualities of the third Janna for all the

100
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:12,919
Janna is to abide to dwell here

101
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,600
to rest in whatever goodness whatever is

102
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,158
good in this meditation

103
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,760
and to consider that whatever that's good in

104
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,320
this meditation

105
00:26:52,880 --> 00:27:00,240
As you enter the world making contact

106
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:06,559
with things of the world the people of the

107
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:15,080
world it makes a difference to contact them through

108
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:22,960
this field of goodness it's very

109
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:31,279
different than encountering the world and people through our field of reactivity

110
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,520
and judgment

111
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:44,720
may it be that all that is really good in you

112
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:50,480
the goodness the calm the peace the

113
00:27:52,840 --> 00:28:00,559
love is in the forefront of how you encounter the

114
00:28:01,399 --> 00:28:08,919
world may all beings be happy

115
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:14,080
may all beings be

116
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:19,600
safe may all beings be

117
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:25,520
peaceful may all beings be

118
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:35,000
free and may all beings be loved

119
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:44,080
loved by the goodness of our

120
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:50,720
hearts and if it helps you to love

121
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,480
more no one needs to know you're loving

122
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:06,720
them but you are with your goodwill your care

123
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:12,679
compassion may all beings be loved

124
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:20,240
so thank you and again without the bell end the

125
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,039
sitting with a bow

126
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:06,799
so hello everyone and welcome to this next talk on the samadei series

127
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:17,080
And it's um the third talk on the third Janna

128
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:24,000
and um as we go deeper into absorptions

129
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:32,000
deeper into a unified concentrated absorbed

130
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:39,200
state the experience of our body begins to change

131
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:45,120
and one of the ways that I unders I've come to understand this at first maybe

132
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:51,640
through my own practice I started to feel that the these immersive

133
00:30:51,640 --> 00:31:01,559
states I would leave my karmic body behind and that one of the bodies we can

134
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:08,320
experience is our karmic body and that's the body that we feel

135
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:14,919
and sense sense that is a product or a byproduct of our

136
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:22,600
reactivity the ways we've reacted to the world the way that we have resisted

137
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:29,760
tightened tensed by the world and now you might want to blame

138
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:36,200
the world for the ways in which you are tense or afraid or

139
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:43,080
um uh contracted and that's

140
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:49,760
okay but still it's something which the mind the inner life is doing the

141
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:57,279
contraction the tension the holding on the resisting and um and it's very deep and

142
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:02,480
it should be have tremendous respect and care and carefulness around this karmic

143
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:08,360
body we have this body that's conditioned uh

144
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:13,919
by the regularity or the frequency in which we think the same thought over and

145
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:20,840
over again if you re repeatedly think that you are somehow

146
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:26,960
inadequate it becomes kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy because if it's

147
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:34,320
repeated enough it's just depressing it just kind of drains us and so that draining the drain body I

148
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:41,120
would call the karmic body if what you love to do is to watch

149
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:49,559
horror movies and uh the excitement and thrill and livveness of being

150
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:55,679
afraid and you do that enough and in fact you tell yourself horror movies in

151
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:01,279
your own mind then that you have a a fearful body

152
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:07,760
the fear body is predominant some people live in their fear body

153
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:13,240
and that's I call a karmic body it's a body that's

154
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:18,600
somehow been shaped by the reactivity of the

155
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:25,120
mind and um as we go through as we settle and get

156
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:32,600
more and more focused concentrated unified relaxed the the the

157
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:41,679
the ways in which the body is tightened up tensed up knotted up held tight

158
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:51,240
become rigid the fear body the anger body the the desire body

159
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:56,760
the grief body that things have gotten so conditioned that we're kind of like

160
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:03,279
living almost like we become that body but that begins to loosen up as we go

161
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:12,720
deeper into meditation we kind of that falls to the side that no longer is operating for us

162
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:20,158
and um it's not a loss of who we are it's like taking off a coat that is o

163
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:29,240
become overly heavy or overly hot as the weather warms

164
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:35,839
up we no longer need it and uh and sometimes this uh leaving

165
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:42,480
the karmic body behind um the body feels very different and the

166
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:48,079
third third gen Janna one of the ways of understanding it that it's a happy body

167
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:53,679
happiness body that uh it's it's saturated the

168
00:34:53,679 --> 00:35:01,880
body is filled with a kind of happiness where the karmic body is no longer

169
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:07,320
operating sometimes I've called it the adam the diamond body the

170
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:15,440
adamantine body because it feels so clear and solid but transparent all the

171
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:23,280
way through like a jewel and um and sometimes the the in going through the

172
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:30,839
Janna the posture of the body changes and uh sometimes it gets very

173
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:36,240
aligned and sometimes you can actually feel the body aligning itself with the

174
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:41,359
concentration it's almost like there's an energetic force in the body that kind

175
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:48,560
of lifts the spine opens the chest and um you feel very present and I call that

176
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:56,800
kind of the karmic that I call that the the diamond body and um sometimes some people might

177
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:04,720
call it kind of an energy body that happens because all that's left is this tingling flowing vibrating field of

178
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:11,240
energy seemingly And um so as we leave this karmic body

179
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:17,280
behind we're leaving behind our con the ways that we've we've been conditioned

180
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:24,599
by the world by our own behavior our own thoughts by the influence of

181
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:30,000
others and um and

182
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:35,920
um and it can be very healing it's one of the reasons why these Janna are

183
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:41,040
prescribed sometimes because they have such a deep there's such deep medicine

184
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:47,359
for the heart the mind it touches kind of the very deep subconscious places

185
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:53,920
that are very hard to otherwise contact and so the usual instructions that or at

186
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:59,359
least that I'm familiar with or at least value a lot when if you're fortunate

187
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:06,640
enough to begin to go through these jas uh do it slowly don't be in a hurry to

188
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:12,960
get somewhere uh because the idea is to allow yourself to be reconditioned to

189
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:19,760
allow yourself to feel the goodness of it the he the healing of it allow your

190
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:26,160
def to kind of uh get a very different message into your heart into your body

191
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:34,800
than the message of danger or the message of being left out or the message of not

192
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:42,720
good enough it's all these messages that we live with that are not so healthy for us and to be able to have this other way

193
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:49,640
of receiving a different healthy message is one of the values of these deep

194
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:58,400
states so uh in this um happiness body of the third genre

195
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:05,480
karmic body conditionality the conditioning we have the reactivity we have really settles

196
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:11,720
dramatically then there's a lot less orientation

197
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:17,760
potential for being reactive and what what comes what

198
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:23,800
becomes clear what stands out and highlight instead is

199
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:30,320
equinimity and the equinimity that is not for or against something that's not

200
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:35,359
wanting or not wanting something the equinimity just allows each thing that

201
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:40,480
arises to be there like the sky allows a

202
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,200
cloud to be in the middle of the vast

203
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:51,440
sky uh or like a vast sky allows a bird

204
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:57,760
to fly through it and the sky is not disturbed it's not for against the bird

205
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:03,720
it's just vast kind of space and non-reactivity openness to whatever

206
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:11,599
comes the metaphor of u Buddhism it's often that of a path Buddhist practice

207
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:18,240
and uh a path is a clearing in the forest that's open so we can walk

208
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:27,680
through it and uh so the path is to a great degree defined by the absence the

209
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:34,240
openness the emptiness that's there above maybe the physical trail that's

210
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:41,800
there but the path includes this open space and a path in the woods the open

211
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:49,839
space is not disturbed by you walking through it so the mind so awareness so

212
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:56,920
this happiness body allows everything just to be there in the quiet aquinomous

213
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:05,480
mind in uh and for me uh very closely associated with this is the feeling of

214
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:11,520
spaciousness as if there's lots of space around each individual thing

215
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,800
the for the Buddha it seems to be rather than space it's kind of similar but it's

216
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,880
the vast space that's underwater in a lake and um

217
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:29,880
there the space has a kind of viscosity it has a certain kind of kind

218
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:36,400
of you know little bit of weight little bit of physicality to it that you feel

219
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:42,800
the contact of the water against the skin and um maybe the refreshing

220
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:50,480
comfortable temperature and stillness of the water and um and so it's not just simply

221
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:56,720
empty space but in the third Janna it kind of feels like it's you know this

222
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:02,640
wonderful soothe kind of texture

223
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:10,280
or viscosity or soft

224
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:16,359
butter of spaciousness in which we are as breathing or

225
00:41:16,359 --> 00:41:21,920
being and um and so one of those characteristics

226
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,400
of that spaciousness

227
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:33,319
this vast water is um is a feeling of

228
00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:39,560
contentment happiness kind of a deep but it's physical the body just feels like

229
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:44,800
it's maybe almost like the body is beginning to disappear getting very soft

230
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:50,480
or has no boundaries but the body is kind of saturated or filled with

231
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:57,920
feelings of pleasure and some people some translators prefer to translate suka in the third genre not

232
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:03,640
as happiness but as pleasure because it's so

233
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:10,240
embodied and um and for me at least pleasure just doesn't seem to capture

234
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:16,240
how good it is how wonderful it is so I prefer happiness but for some people

235
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:22,480
happiness is too complicated a state and so maybe pleasure is

236
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:30,720
Or or maybe contentment is um is um the middle way for these words

237
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:36,760
deep deep contentment or satisfaction so

238
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:44,720
equinimity not equinimity from understanding something but an equinimity of uh being larger than

239
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:51,440
everything the awareness is large and spacious and open that uh it's has room

240
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:57,119
for what's happening here and now giving breathing room to all things so you

241
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:04,319
might today as you go through your day find times through the day to give

242
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:09,920
breathing room space to what's happening and notice how it's a thinking

243
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,640
mind maybe the reactive mind that narrows the space of awareness narrows

244
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:23,079
that makes sometimes a claustrophobic mind that's much more

245
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:29,599
um affected uh troubled by what's happening and

246
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:36,680
maybe by giving breathing room and opening up expanding outwards you get some of

247
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:42,359
the benefit peacefulness or happiness or at least

248
00:43:42,359 --> 00:43:50,800
equinimity of a spacious open wide awareness may your day be one

249
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:59,280
of we'll continue this series tomorrow uh tomorrow I'll be at IMC

250
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,520
And I think I'll miss a little bit being here on this rolling grasslands

251
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:12,920
outside and u and so thank you very much

252
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:16,570
