1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:07,440
if you want to do a sump check I don't think I hear anything

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:15,000
I'll keep talking okay you all hear me okay yeah good in the back yeah

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,480
all right so good morning and good to be here with

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,900
you all um in the hall and also those who are on YouTube

5
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:36,360
um through the webcast so what began this morning with um

6
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:43,379
meditation I'll offer a few words alighted guidance

7
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:54,320
and light guidance in our meditation and the invitation is to consider

8
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,600
the meditation as a ritual and so

9
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,299
so for today's practice whether it's

10
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,760
them silent set or in the Dharma talk

11
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,280
consider this is a unfolding ritual

12
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,380
and so um will begin this ritual what the sound of

13
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:29,220
a bell [Music]

14
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,540
as a ritual there is a beginning a middle and end

15
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:59,399
of a process and that's the beginning involves

16
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:09,680
maybe some setting up ourselves are preparing ourselves from meditation

17
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:19,520
and so take a few generous moments to allow ourselves to arrive

18
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,540
maybe arrive at Here and Now

19
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,060
if you want to take a few long deep breaths

20
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:41,420
as you breathe out riding along with the out breath

21
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,860
to arrive at this space

22
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:50,959
In This Moment

23
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:11,159
there's the arriving processes as if we're entering

24
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:19,379
into a sacred Temple Ancient Temple

25
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:25,760
a temple of this body this mind in this heart

26
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:48,360
maybe there's already a sense of reverence humility

27
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:55,019
as we arrive and enter

28
00:03:55,019 --> 00:04:00,200
into this Temple of the body

29
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:12,500
taking seat in the center of our being

30
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:22,560
maybe first a few moments just to check out the global sense of our being

31
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,759
the physicality of the body the posture

32
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:38,540
the moods emotions that came along

33
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:53,360
becoming present and aware

34
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,259
and momentarily we can settle onto our seats

35
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:14,419
as if we're sitting in the center of the Temple

36
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,100
the Temple of this body this mind in this heart

37
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:33,360
taking a few moments to feel and sense into the contact

38
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:40,220
of the lower half of the body with the floor cheers

39
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:58,039
support it by Earth underneath

40
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:07,520
our settling into the seat

41
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,039
maybe you'll feel into this grounded

42
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:38,240
solidity of the Earth element in the body

43
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:48,199
naturally settling downwards naturally grounding

44
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:05,580
may be feeling into the bones the set bongs

45
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,720
thigh bones

46
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,039
Farm study

47
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:36,539
and bones throughout the spine torso

48
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,979
uh Earth elements in the body naturally grounds

49
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:59,300
settles down

50
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:13,340
they're transitioning to

51
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,060
the next part of a ritual of our meditation

52
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:25,039
from this grounded place

53
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:33,899
may we open to whatever arises

54
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:38,599
and passes away in our experience

55
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:50,279
as a ritual we open to the gifts

56
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:56,700
of the process and letting go of our wanting and

57
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,480
desires expectations

58
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,339
offering ourselves up

59
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:16,040
to what arises what emerges in our experience

60
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,820
and welcome the movements of the breath

61
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:49,580
welcome the dancing Sensations in the body

62
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,519
welcome the waves of emotions

63
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,959
and treat each experience as if our offering

64
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:37,140
the blessings to all of those experiences

65
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,820
nothing excluded

66
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,459
foreign

67
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,660
foreign

68
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,520
foreign

69
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:03,320
and there's the last a few minutes of our sitting together

70
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:10,700
I invite you to gently reflect

71
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:17,339
our notice if there are any effects

72
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:23,839
when we consider our meditation as a ritual

73
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,878
and maybe it's a felt sensing the body

74
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:40,099
without sensing the heart New Perspectives in the mind

75
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,118
whatever it may be

76
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:52,138
notice any effects

77
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:57,679
that may be present or not

78
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:15,260
rituals often touch Us in the subconscious level

79
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:34,760
if there are any effects allow them to emerge through the body

80
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:51,800
will end the sitting with the sound of a bell

81
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:32,239
foreign [Music]

82
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:06,240
signifies a little transition so feel free to take a moment if you need to shift your

83
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:13,079
posture or need to stand up and do what is needed for the body

84
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:16,160
and for your being

85
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:27,119
and this will transition us to the next part of our unfolding ritual

86
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:32,299
which involves speaking and listening

87
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:40,020
and so today and not surprisingly the topic and I had in mind to share

88
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:44,780
is a ritual and our Dharma practice

89
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:54,240
I realized that this is not a popular Topic in the Western teravada centers

90
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:02,460
and especially um maybe a you know lay community centers

91
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:09,440
um and there can be certain um

92
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:16,079
we can't have a certain kind of a relationship when the words ritual gets

93
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:22,800
uttered and and some may consider this as superficial

94
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,680
or even cultural baggage are not necessary as part of the

95
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:36,240
Buddhist practice um and I can totally relate to that and I

96
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:41,640
for me I've been to Chinese temples with

97
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:49,920
lots of Rich rituals and involves incense burning and money making and so

98
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:56,880
that can feel a sense of baggage associated with it

99
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,220
and yet rituals whether they are seeing unseen

100
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:07,280
um they are part of Many religious

101
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:15,540
traditions and the spiritual life in some of the cultures like the culture

102
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:20,940
I came from the Asian culture our rituals are quite significant and

103
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:27,900
prominent I remember once a visiting venerable bikubody

104
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:34,140
you know who lives in a Chinese monastery and

105
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:39,599
and I asked him what is the biggest difference between

106
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:47,339
kind of a the Western teravada traditions and the Chinese Buddhism in

107
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:53,099
his experience given that his loving a Chinese monastery

108
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:59,880
and he said much is in common but where he lives and there were a lot

109
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:08,110
of rituals and they can be quite long hours and hours of bowing and

110
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:13,160
[Music] um and so um

111
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:21,060
and often and they are involved and kind of bowing chanting different forms in

112
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:27,060
the rituals and they are rich in a lot of different cultures like myself coming

113
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:32,520
from the Asian culture in the Western teravada Center like this

114
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:39,359
inside Meditation Center um many of us come to the center may not

115
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:46,800
even notice any ritual whatsoever but rituals are here

116
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:53,099
and so those of you who come through the door and another maybe a not so obvious

117
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:58,380
for those who are online on on YouTube

118
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:05,579
but entering into IMC what we often do is put our shoes on the

119
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:13,079
shelves and we come into the meditation Hall some people bow in front of the Buddha

120
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:21,660
statue and then we take our seat and at the end of the session often

121
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:29,480
people bow out and leave and so there are those rituals present

122
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:36,300
even in a center like this but many of us may or may not associate

123
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:46,280
with them as a rituals and so today I wanted to kind of maybe highlight some of the dimensions of it

124
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:54,000
um so I personally wasn't paying attention

125
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,660
to the effects of rituals until much later in my own Buddhist path

126
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:06,839
but as I reflected back and I can say that in many ways rituals

127
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:13,079
played quite a significant role in my own Dharma life

128
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:19,020
I just didn't realize that for a long time and I remember the first time first

129
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:27,839
exposure to this was when I first came to United States very shortly I lost my

130
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:33,540
grandpa and who was very close to us he lived

131
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:40,740
with our family the whole of my life basically up to that time

132
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:47,339
and he passed away in China and it was very clear that I wouldn't be able to

133
00:43:47,339 --> 00:43:54,720
make my way back and to be with him in any way uh for a wider variety of reasons I just

134
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:01,079
got here so I was very confused and a little lost

135
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:09,800
and just not sure what to do um and I happened to go to a pure land

136
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:15,000
Buddhist de Sangha in my University Town

137
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,400
there through a college roommate that I stayed

138
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:26,579
with and not knowing what's possible I just

139
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:31,680
told them that this situation I'm in

140
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:39,540
and they spontaneously predict put together a ritual and that

141
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:46,260
um honored remembered my grandpa for who he who he

142
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:51,900
was and honored him

143
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:57,980
and I just offered a very brief kind of a description they put this kind of very

144
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:06,660
beautiful and yet simple ritual around it and offered the chanting and

145
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:14,520
um offered a blessing for him to have a blessed afterlife which I didn't really

146
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:21,839
know but it did something to my heart I felt

147
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:27,920
I felt quite E at ease and I felt that there was some kind of a closure

148
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:34,440
out of this and so that was uh first uh Encounter of

149
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:39,480
the Buddhist the ritual and ending some

150
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:46,200
maybe miraculous ways and probably created a certain affinity

151
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:54,780
between myself and Buddhists and Buddhism and I got very curious about it

152
00:45:54,780 --> 00:46:02,339
and it began kind of exploring and seeking the Buddhist practices and and

153
00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:09,020
the teachings um

154
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:16,020
and rituals can have many potent functions in our spiritual life

155
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:22,740
I wanted to share this um quote from an article that Gil francs

156
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:27,900
doll wrote about rituals in Buddhism

157
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:35,520
and so here is what he said rituals are a form of language that

158
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:44,400
expresses many dimensions of our Human Condition including our relationship to others and

159
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:50,220
to our spiritual life and then later on in the article it says

160
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:58,380
rituals to share many characteristics with poetry theater dance in evoking

161
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:06,300
emotions intuition and New Perspectives because rituals touch more aspects of

162
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:13,819
our mind and heart than simple prose and the didactic explanations

163
00:47:13,819 --> 00:47:19,079
rituals like the Arts can enrich our lives

164
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:24,500
and engage the full range of our being

165
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:31,760
and so I really resonated with that quite a lot

166
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:39,060
so today I want to share just a few dimensions of the functions and effects

167
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:44,700
of rituals in our Dharma practice maybe as pointers there may be many

168
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:51,359
other dimensions on and and that's accessible to some of you

169
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:58,500
but those are just a few uh that why I'm maybe pointing out today

170
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:05,280
so the first one is a relationship of rituals and our hearts

171
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:12,300
and so in a way when we engage in rituals wholeheartedly

172
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:18,359
rituals themselves become a hard practice

173
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:25,740
just like a Brahma vejaras it becomes a heart practice they can touch and open our hearts and

174
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:32,760
the beings and deeply and so for myself in my own case

175
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:38,640
rituals had opened my heart in ways that maybe beyond my own

176
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:45,980
logical analytical mind they touched something deeper inside of me

177
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:53,880
in our traditions a simple bowing when we do it wholeheartedly

178
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:59,700
it can become expressions of many beautiful qualities of our heart

179
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:08,400
and reverence reference towards whatever our bowing towards could even

180
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:16,560
just be Earth sky and everything in between animated on animated

181
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:22,500
um and so there can be a deep sense of reference

182
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:28,859
another possibility bowing it carries a deep sense of gratitude

183
00:49:28,859 --> 00:49:34,140
humility and the suggesture of two hands coming

184
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:40,440
together can also symbolize Harmony coming in harmony

185
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:46,700
and unifying in some way in our being

186
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:56,520
and so for me recent months I've been carrying out a ritual of 108 bows each

187
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:03,420
morning before my own meditation practice

188
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:10,560
and this particular practice was called force and because for a while I was

189
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:16,020
experiencing or encountering a lot of illness aging

190
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:23,099
death some really close and my own family family members relatives

191
00:50:23,099 --> 00:50:30,599
and people I know of and people I don't know well and this kind of there's a lot

192
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:37,880
going on there hence I've felt a calling in my heart to

193
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:45,180
express a deeper sense of care and love and

194
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:52,500
compassion and one day I just decided I'm gonna do

195
00:50:52,500 --> 00:51:00,119
there's 108 bows each morning and the dedicating each bow to whoever

196
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:06,800
comes to my mind for their well-being and piece

197
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:12,420
and I had thought that maybe after a while people are getting better then you

198
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:19,980
know at some point I'll stop um but new people keep on getting added to

199
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:24,559
this list so it hasn't stopped

200
00:51:25,099 --> 00:51:33,780
and yeah to this practice has really becoming my own meta practice our Brahma vehara

201
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:43,040
practice not necessarily sitting still on the cushion but in a form of a bowing

202
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:52,220
and so um so simple practices like this can really

203
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:58,740
open our heart in new ways that way may not be

204
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:05,000
um opening to previously

205
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:13,079
the second function or effect and about rituals is that

206
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:19,880
the process of ritual involves making ourselves available to that process

207
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:27,000
unfolding process and so when we offer ourselves up to

208
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:34,338
this process and the process can become a force of transformation

209
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:40,859
and a ritual often leads participants through a process

210
00:52:40,859 --> 00:52:47,040
and opens people to New Perspectives or new insights

211
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:54,619
but the transformation is only possible if we put down some of the

212
00:52:54,619 --> 00:53:01,800
self-centered agendas you know I want to get something as I remember

213
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:09,900
going to the Chinese temple before oftentimes people go there want

214
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:16,440
to get something even if you know that's something in the belief system that you

215
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:25,200
know or get blessed by something but that the process of ritual really is

216
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:32,300
an invitation to open to something rather than getting something

217
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:39,180
one of the most significant Buddhist the rituals and that function

218
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:46,020
and as this kind of a transformation is the ritual of taking refuge in the

219
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:51,380
Buddha Dharma and Sangha the triple gem

220
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:57,540
some of you probably have done this Refuge ceremony yourselves

221
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:04,020
and others may have done this on retreats we often do Refuge ceremony at

222
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:10,740
the beginning of the retreat for the retreat duration of a retreat we take a

223
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:18,119
refuge in the Buddha Dharma and Sangha and taking refuge in the Buddha Dharma

224
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:26,819
in Sangha for life and Beyond evokes an alignment of our life

225
00:54:26,819 --> 00:54:32,059
with something that we may aspire to

226
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:37,260
and so for some people this can be quite significant and it has a lot of

227
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:45,420
implications you know maybe maybe making commitment on how we live our lives

228
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:52,319
I remember for myself um many years ago when I did this Refuge

229
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:59,400
ceremony with my monastic teacher on who's my

230
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:07,619
preceptor offered on this Refuge ceremony to me and so on this English Refuge ceremony

231
00:55:07,619 --> 00:55:16,559
he offered me a small card and on that that was my Chinese Dharma name

232
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:22,800
and um and the date that the Refuge ceremony took place

233
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:29,700
and it has the refuges and the precepts on the two sides of the little card

234
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:37,980
so at the end of this ceremony I felt as if I was reborn into a new

235
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:43,819
life and kind of like a kind of a birthday

236
00:55:43,819 --> 00:55:48,839
into the Buddha's lineage

237
00:55:48,839 --> 00:55:55,980
and so I was rather significant it was a kind of a gut feeling very intuitive

238
00:55:55,980 --> 00:56:01,260
sense but it was a rather significant

239
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:08,220
um the transformation happens very gradually over time

240
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:15,420
but if I reflect the back um this was a significant ritual in my

241
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:22,920
life already began to shift little by little in how I choose to live my life

242
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:31,940
and this may be the case for some people who's done uh um a ritual like that

243
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:39,300
and the third one maybe is one of the most important one function

244
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:45,240
about ritual is that rituals are when they're done

245
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:54,300
consciously or whether heightened awareness it opens us up to many dimensions of our

246
00:56:54,300 --> 00:57:01,039
inner being that maybe otherwise unseen and unknown

247
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:07,760
and I remember and sometimes especially on the early phase of my practice

248
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:13,339
sometimes coming to the practice we can carry this kind of a mainstream

249
00:57:13,339 --> 00:57:21,000
materialistic attitude you know I'm coming here to get something or get rid of something that we don't like and and

250
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:26,640
so let's get really quick and we just you know get to our sitting cushion and

251
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:33,619
pull with sit and then when it ends we dash out

252
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:41,579
and so when we show up with kind of this narrow focus a narrow

253
00:57:41,579 --> 00:57:47,220
um uh or narrowing ourselves into this

254
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:53,520
set of the things that we want and we want a ging we want to get

255
00:57:53,520 --> 00:58:00,720
um and the practice probably have a different effect on us it's always using

256
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:07,940
it as something to get some more things and get rid of some things we don't like

257
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:15,900
um I'll share another example that was a vivid teaching of the sword for myself I

258
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:23,940
was um I was in a Chinese Sangha for a long time we had a beloved Taiwanese Dharma

259
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:30,599
teacher who once coming to offer a teaching we haven't seen her for a long

260
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:35,960
time so we were all very enthusiastic we got to

261
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:43,559
our little Center early and we set up the desk and on the mic and we were all

262
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:50,280
sitting on the front row waiting and so um and that by the time the teacher showed

263
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:56,579
up and she walked down the hallway it was really just a living room in

264
00:58:56,579 --> 00:59:04,079
old house in Sunnyvale and it was not a big place but she just walked into

265
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:10,079
the room and you know get to the desk and sat down

266
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:16,140
and then he just looked around in the room and the kind of different parts of the room

267
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:23,700
and he you know and then her head landed on a corner of the room

268
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:30,839
where there was a big pile of messy cables all around

269
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:38,640
you know kind of cables that connects to the mic and and it was a big spaghetti right over in

270
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:48,180
the corner and so she turned her face looked at us and then said that too is the practice

271
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:55,319
so we were all sitting on the front row really embarrassed I was like what

272
00:59:55,319 --> 01:00:02,700
and I really don't remember much about the talk but I did remember this that

273
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:09,599
was a significant teaching for me that um

274
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:14,640
when we began to open the field of our practice

275
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:25,520
ritual is a vehicle for us to begin to open to all of these processes around

276
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:34,920
included in our practice including the sitting and the talking and speaking and how we

277
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:37,400
show up

278
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:47,220
um and so as a ritual each ritual has a

279
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:52,799
beginning a middle and end and so

280
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:58,440
you know when we walk into our space and this is a part of the beginning how we

281
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:06,900
walk into the space how we take our seat and I was inviting Even in our sitting

282
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:13,859
meditation as a process of a ritual on how we began this process of a

283
01:01:13,859 --> 01:01:19,579
meditation what are the orientations that we have

284
01:01:19,859 --> 01:01:26,960
and so open ourselves up to all of these different dimensions of it

285
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:41,000
as when we consider our practice as a ritual there may be a sense of

286
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:46,559
sacredness that can come in and that as if it's kind of attaching

287
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:52,859
our heart right there and so sometimes when I consider this

288
01:01:52,859 --> 01:01:59,960
meditation as a whole field of ritual whatever practice we're engaging in

289
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:04,980
we're already bringing the heart practice with us

290
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:12,200
and what kind of integrating all of these Dimensions into our practice

291
01:02:13,319 --> 01:02:15,380
um

292
01:02:31,619 --> 01:02:38,780
yeah I want to just take a pause to see what's coming up right now

293
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:51,900
one thing that comes up for me right now is that in our relationship with the

294
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:59,040
meditation often were offered with meditation instructions around breath

295
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:04,200
body emotions and our thoughts and

296
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:11,780
instead of considering this our instructions for our meditation

297
01:03:11,819 --> 01:03:19,319
um we can maybe see them as a description of the unfolding meditative process

298
01:03:19,319 --> 01:03:24,599
kind of describing a process of a ritual meditative ritual

299
01:03:24,599 --> 01:03:30,900
and when we see it this way it may help us to kind of let go of

300
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:37,740
me doing this me doing the instructions instead

301
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:45,000
we're kind of offering ourselves to this process of meditation or it's a meditation

302
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:52,079
process meditative process being offered to us through the ex through the the

303
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:58,760
words and the phrases that are are offered instruct in the instructions

304
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:03,980
so in this way um

305
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:11,299
we may be receiving all of those instructions through a sense of

306
01:04:11,299 --> 01:04:18,680
opening to something rather than getting something receiving something

307
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:24,240
and there are many possibilities when this is done and there can be different

308
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:32,520
kind of beauty that come in for me today and in the in the middle of

309
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:40,500
the meditation I opened my eyes and look at all the folks who are

310
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:49,619
sitting here and Imagining the folks meditating on the YouTube together

311
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:56,280
and so there was an immediate sense of belonging to the community that came

312
01:04:56,280 --> 01:05:02,640
along and belonging to maybe the world and

313
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:09,839
that were part of and when we're not cluttered by our

314
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:15,180
thoughts of a wanting and desires Clarity can also come in

315
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:22,020
and this is where the New Perspectives can come in and as part of the Insight practice and

316
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:29,040
the insights may come along maybe not even expressed in words just yet maybe

317
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:35,460
it's some form of embodied way how we walk out this meditation Hall when we

318
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:40,619
finish and so

319
01:05:40,619 --> 01:05:46,680
um allow this ritual process to be

320
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:53,520
expensive maybe including all different elements and that come

321
01:05:53,520 --> 01:06:01,859
along with it and sometimes I'm considering the Dharma

322
01:06:01,859 --> 01:06:10,799
practice if Dharma practice itself is an overarching kind of ritual that has its

323
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:17,160
beginning a middle and end we can consider many it has many many rituals

324
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:25,680
within like Mandela fracture or fractals kind of you know in our session today as

325
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:34,200
we walk into IMC you know all the way to the end we had many rituals of sitting

326
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:43,220
meditation we had a ritual of Dharma talk engaging with speaking and

327
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:49,559
listening and we may have another small ritual towards the end where there is a

328
01:06:49,559 --> 01:06:57,740
community Gathering and can we consider

329
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:03,780
incorporating on this uh

330
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:10,799
this kind of a dimensions in our practice can we treat each day as if a

331
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:17,280
word living um a ritual of the day how do we wake up

332
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:23,119
how do we want to live the day and how do we want to end the day

333
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:29,160
and so I don't have kind of a fixed idea about

334
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:34,319
this and but the invitation is for you

335
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:39,900
to consider the possibility and what it might um

336
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:46,520
uh how it might affect you in your own practice

337
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:55,799
and so there may be many different forms of rituals needed for different seasons and different situations and on

338
01:07:55,799 --> 01:08:02,940
different days yet no matter what rituals we engage in

339
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:10,079
it's an opportunity um to live with a clear heart a clear mind

340
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:16,940
and open heart and so may the ritual of our practice

341
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:24,238
allow us to touch the depths of our being may it support all beings

342
01:08:24,239 --> 01:08:29,298
so thank you for your kind attention

343
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:42,060
and we'll open up for some Reflections and questions and

344
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:48,318
are sharing you may have you may have your own relationships with this

345
01:09:07,799 --> 01:09:13,040
you look like a rock star okay um

346
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:21,060
um I asked this with a lot of hesitation kind of thought about it whether I

347
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:26,338
should ask or not and what I call of myself is not ours to

348
01:09:26,339 --> 01:09:31,738
any rituals as such especially being raised in in India you

349
01:09:31,739 --> 01:09:39,060
know it's part of culture and I have been from not being okay with them with

350
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:47,278
being okay with them although and I'm not too um worst with the terrorda style of

351
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:53,880
literature or you know books or what before I have read and

352
01:09:53,880 --> 01:10:01,560
from what I have heard there is something called path to enlightenment and from being a one-time stream enterer

353
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:10,320
to being in our hand the first step it says um and I don't know where this

354
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:15,900
comes from but it does say the one-time stream enterer loses

355
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:23,400
of what probably I don't know his or her rights and rituals right so it's I mean

356
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:29,960
it took it took a lot to ask this question because I felt I don't want to sound yeah yeah or

357
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:35,100
cocky or whatever but the idea is

358
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:41,900
um it's hard for what I call of myself for ego whatever to reconcile that fact

359
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:48,540
with or maybe it's just a sense of attachment to rituals yeah yeah

360
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:54,120
so it's a it's a great question I I kind of contemplated a letter to talk about

361
01:10:54,120 --> 01:11:00,239
that or not um but the the it's interesting that uh

362
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:05,400
the Pali term gets translated as it writes and rituals but the poly meaning

363
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:12,120
is not necessarily rights and rituals and so what it's really signifying is

364
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:19,739
the first stage of Awakening is letting go of a dogmatic holding of certain

365
01:11:19,739 --> 01:11:24,840
rules and and so in fact

366
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:29,880
yeah the direct translation wouldn't map to rights and rituals

367
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:37,460
and in the um a broader Buddhist to sing especially monastics Buddhism

368
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:43,760
rituals are always a big part of it and then and how we hold them

369
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:51,120
is what we're asking and so are we holding them as I must do

370
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:58,860
this and you know uh and what's the first uh first stage of Awakening is

371
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:07,800
letting go of a dogmatic holding but it allows us to open up to discern

372
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:14,820
what is the supportive of our own heart and mind and the path of Awakening and what is

373
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:19,860
not and so today what I'm offering is the

374
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:26,699
possibility of considering the dimensions of a ritual that might be

375
01:12:26,699 --> 01:12:33,659
supportive in our practice and not necessarily saying that we must

376
01:12:33,659 --> 01:12:41,880
all do this you know this is it and and so that becomes a dogmatic holding

377
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:47,599
does that kind of make sense yeah thank you thank you

378
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:05,520
so we now I think about it every evening my

379
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:13,380
wife and I do a sitting for 20 minutes it's kind of become ritualistic in the

380
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:20,159
way it's evolved it's not anything we said this has to be done this way or that way you know in fact it wouldn't be

381
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:26,460
formally approved so to speak because the cat gets on her lap because it's so settled

382
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:31,679
and we do this and and it's evolved out of necessity of you know

383
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:36,960
especially my wife's challenges with sleeping due to

384
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:42,540
the Heavenly Messengers and uh World situation and all these different

385
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:47,880
things have and what seems to have helped calmed our help of sleep and

386
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:53,640
helps me too of course yeah and that is a way I guess I could see how rituals

387
01:13:53,640 --> 01:14:01,140
evolve in that way and it's not yeah beautiful and then part of I was what I was hoping

388
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:09,719
to point to is to begin to become conscious of how those processes and

389
01:14:09,719 --> 01:14:15,659
elements of ritual can have different effects on us and so for me it was many

390
01:14:15,659 --> 01:14:22,080
years not realizing it's actually doing something unto my own heart and mind

391
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:28,260
but becoming conscious of it oh oh this can be very supportive

392
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:34,080
and this can be and then we be then we begin to able to to learn what really

393
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:40,739
supports us and what does not support us and so there's uh yeah there's a

394
01:14:40,739 --> 01:14:46,560
recognition has a role yeah it's a noticing and recognizing oh does it

395
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:53,059
become part of my life yeah yeah great

396
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:08,820
seeing Chen thank you so much for your talk um what came to mind for me was uh

397
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:15,900
many years ago I I was um bothered a pretty deeply bothered by

398
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:22,080
feelings my mother had passed away and I hadn't been with her at the time so I

399
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:27,420
felt bad about that and I looked over in my life with her and thought of like a

400
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:32,460
number of times I had been unkind or not as kind as I could have been

401
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:38,580
couldn't really forgive myself for that so somehow I came up with this idea of

402
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:44,159
creating a ritual for myself because I I felt like I would write on a little

403
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:49,560
piece of paper every unkind thing that I could think of of course there were lots

404
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:54,960
of little pieces of paper then I made a I filled a pan with water and one by one

405
01:15:54,960 --> 01:16:00,239
at my gas stove I burned these and threw them in the water threw them in the

406
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:05,580
water and then at the end I could like toss out the water and I felt as if my

407
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:11,880
mother was just um if she had been alive she was holding me and saying I know you

408
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:19,320
love me yeah and I forgive you and it really worked so that was just a one-time ritual but

409
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:25,199
it was powerful for me yeah beautiful thank you for sharing that story

410
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:34,320
uh Griff a grief ritual is powerful for many people that for myself in the sense

411
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:42,080
of my grandpa passing away they're definitely some sense of grief and confusion and

412
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:47,340
offers such a closure and a healing

413
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:53,820
um and so yeah absolutely and open to new possibilities and that's

414
01:16:53,820 --> 01:17:02,480
also another form of transforming you know because otherwise we could be holding a lot of regrets or

415
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:10,940
it's just kind of attracting us and as it becomes a process allow things that are unprocessed to be

416
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:19,080
held in safety and and kindness and so that it

417
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:24,679
can get processed yeah thank you okay

418
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:35,780
it's one more there yeah

419
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:46,380
thank you um my um this is a question for you I guess

420
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:51,780
just um my experience with rituals there's

421
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:58,140
been periods of time where I've hesitated participating in them

422
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:04,800
and then I've gone back to look at maybe I should give it a second chance or third fourth chance

423
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:09,840
how is that a typical cycle

424
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:15,540
yeah yeah um yes I and I appreciated this question

425
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:21,679
and I think uh I kind of connected with the first question also in some way

426
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:27,540
sometimes we may have been exposed to the way of doing rituals that are

427
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:34,679
harmful to us and we can kind of shut off ourselves and I certainly had a very

428
01:18:34,679 --> 01:18:40,199
dismissive attitude towards them at the very beginning because of my own

429
01:18:40,199 --> 01:18:45,780
exposure it is like you know going to this big Temple and that the people just

430
01:18:45,780 --> 01:18:53,340
you know it's just Smoky and crowded and just I'm like busy getting I don't know

431
01:18:53,340 --> 01:19:01,880
things and and I just kind of felt very lost in them and I didn't have a very

432
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:08,239
um and then I didn't have any really

433
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:13,679
positive relationship with them until I

434
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:19,980
began to notice and you know some of the rituals I participate

435
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:25,140
uh maybe not even aware kind of a state at

436
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:30,659
my subconscious level and I wasn't really aware what was happening but I

437
01:19:30,659 --> 01:19:39,239
didn't know that it's doing something to me and through began to become aware oh

438
01:19:39,239 --> 01:19:44,880
this wasn't kind of a How uh uh uh what

439
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:50,580
it is kind of um like what how I associated with it before and so I began

440
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:55,980
to open to the possibility that well this may have something different to

441
01:19:55,980 --> 01:20:03,540
offer to me and so yes we can go through some of the cycles and

442
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:09,420
then especially some of the rituals can be done in very dogmatic way and kind of

443
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:15,320
like you've got to do this and we make and feel very

444
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:21,840
distant with that kind of attitude yeah yeah thank you thank you for the for the

445
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:29,820
question yeah it's kind of like a whole territory and so I just invite

446
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:37,199
um maybe considering um open to this a little by little and

447
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:43,440
and becoming aware of the effects on us

448
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:46,760
yeah yeah

449
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:54,960
maybe we need to yes [Music]

450
01:20:54,960 --> 01:21:01,560
yes I will be around for a little while so I probably just um are we just gonna

451
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:09,678
be outside or in the Community Hall okay I'll Stand somewhere

452
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:17,219
so thank you everyone for being here and let's um maybe end with a typical ritual

453
01:21:17,219 --> 01:21:23,539
in our in our scene that is a dedication of a marriage

454
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:30,540
so may we all just take a moment [Music] um to settle

455
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:35,060
in our bodies and our seeds

456
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:42,719
maybe just bring forth on this last few hours being together

457
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:49,860
any form of a goodness that you can touch in in your own being

458
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:53,900
in small ways big ways

459
01:21:56,760 --> 01:22:04,080
and allow this goodness to expand and touch your whole being

460
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:08,840
may it supports our well-being

461
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:16,520
and may the glow of the goodness expand in all directions

462
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:21,679
and may it support all beings everywhere

463
01:22:21,719 --> 01:22:27,120
may all beings have well-being

464
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:31,400
may all beings be free

465
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:42,260
thank you
