1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:07,120
so uh so welcome folks ah

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:14,360
sweet okay um so I'll uh I'll say a few words and

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,199
we'll uh we'll sit

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:30,000
um so to let let go of um our kind of Nar

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,840
narrative project what we call our life my so-called life to let go of our

6
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:46,440
narrative project that's that's hard it's difficult it's um it's difficult not to

7
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:55,199
sort of embed all phenomena in a coherent narrative

8
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,519
web and we sort of just keep adding the

9
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:07,479
moment to the kind of story of me just keep adding a tiny thin little

10
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:13,439
chapter to our autobiography and we don't check that

11
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:19,280
habit at the door when we start to meditate right it's sort of

12
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,479
like every meditative phenomena every experience with concentration or

13
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:31,520
distraction with Pleasure and Pain all of that gets kind of of incorporated

14
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,399
into this this narrative structure it's like sometimes like the sort of Morgan

15
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:43,079
Freeman Dharma voice over you know with our meditation

16
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:52,520
right and uh it's very natural and adaptive in a lot of ways

17
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:59,960
and awareness renounces language

18
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:09,000
beginning to pick up on this uh theme week ago awareness kind of renounces

19
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,440
language been reading um uh a a book uh

20
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:21,800
kind of hundreds of case reports a book by uh Thomas metzinger the elephant and

21
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:27,360
the blind I I'll post it MIT press actually made it free for download and

22
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,440
I'll post it in the the YouTube um description

23
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:38,840
after um but met singer interesting very interesting character kind of like you

24
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:47,480
know traditionally trained analytic philosopher meditator and um and got you know I

25
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:53,680
think something like 1,400 reports from meditators about awareness something

26
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,800
like this and so he's using kind of philosophical Precision with a lot of

27
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:08,400
direct reports and and his own practice at one point um he uh he writes

28
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:17,120
um phenomenologically sort of in the level of subjective experience uh

29
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:27,480
phenomenologically deep silence is the uncontracted quality of Silent knowing itself empty

30
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:33,920
cognizance lacking any form of grasping or inner

31
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:40,640
agency it's not only non-conceptual it's also characterized by a principle of

32
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,000
mental inaction it never reacts it never makes

33
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,480
a choice it never initiates an action as one person participant put it

34
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,680
pure awareness is that which never speaks pure awareness is that which

35
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:06,599
would not even say I am that which never speaks that which says I am that which

36
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:14,840
never speaks is something else this is an entirely silent and

37
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:24,680
non-conceptual experience of the phenomenal character of awareness itself

38
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:38,880
when the object the object is just the capacity to know all the kind of objects

39
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:45,680
of the ordinary phenomena of awareness uh those those uh fade out but

40
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:53,080
the the capacity to know the phenomenal character of awareness itself that is

41
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:59,680
what is known and the meditation instr

42
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:07,199
instuctions in a way are what we say to do in a way are mimicked by the

43
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:14,039
qualities of deep silence so we say let go we say don't fight we say

44
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:19,280
choicelessness we say relinquish willfulness we

45
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:26,520
say tolerate the disorientation of non-thinking right we give all these

46
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:33,759
instructions all these things that in in a sense we we try to

47
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:41,759
do but then when we've done them when we've done them uh

48
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:48,240
the these are these become actually effortless natural qualities of

49
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,520
awareness itself all of the the relinquishment and

50
00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:01,280
the willfulness and the the the choicelessness the kind of depth of the

51
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:09,800
surrender the way in which we have we're no longer uh tinkering with some SAR you

52
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:16,800
know at all uh this is this is the the quality

53
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,479
of of uh of awareness and so um I'll give

54
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:28,240
instructions things maybe we do or things that plant Dharma seeds in the

55
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,400
mind and uh we in a sense just um are

56
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:42,120
developing developing trust that at the end of our doing there's um

57
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,520
effortlessness and at the all these instructions are are pointing uh

58
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:53,440
pointing to something instructions mirror the fruit in a way maybe we

59
00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:01,240
say I may be venturing out of my terad and territory I'm not really sure to be

60
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:11,280
honest but um this is what's occurring to me so uh let's uh let's set

61
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,479
okay e

62
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,919
so maybe a really full

63
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:33,400
breath just relaxing whatever can be relaxed

64
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:35,920
developing certain kind of uh frictionless with

65
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,360
uh the first Noble

66
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,680
Truth frictionless this with uh imperfection

67
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:14,200
friction requires a

68
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:22,120
narration there's friction we have to understand it we have

69
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:31,320
to embed it in a narrative game it out

70
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,279
to e

71
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:51,000
so equinity is a kind of stance in relation to

72
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:04,120
experience where we're not fighting not generating friction with

73
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:26,320
imperfection this way we uh invite a kind of

74
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
Silence

75
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,160
e e

76
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:05,040
perhaps we we make some

77
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:13,720
effort effort to attend to say the

78
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:29,360
breathing make some effort so at some point we can

79
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,880
relinquish all

80
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:55,920
willfulness all choic making it's like all the forks in the road that we always

81
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,040
imagine dissolve

82
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

83
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,959
e e

84
00:16:53,639 --> 00:17:01,000
who you are and what you want and what you hate all the the administrative

85
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,920
details of Any Given

86
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:16,039
life just lose their uh seductive

87
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:32,679
power the moment is no longer a problem to be

88
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,880
solved to be

89
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,799
optimized e

90
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:38,000
so we do but only so we can not

91
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
do

92
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

93
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

94
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

95
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

96
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,559
e e

97
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:30,519
maybe we can say we trust silence more than sound

98
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

99
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

100
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

101
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,360
e e

102
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:19,760
your life doesn't depend on you

103
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:43,720
awareness doesn't depend on

104
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:51,200
you not something you do

105
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:15,520
so it comes to feel

106
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,080
safe to uh

107
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
rest

108
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

109
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
e

110
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,120
e

111
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,080
e e

112
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:55,279
okay so uh H good to uh sit with you and

113
00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:02,480
um just to say that I I sort of uh presume some familiarity with practice

114
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,720
uh in these these sessions and so it's unfortunately if you came here to

115
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:15,159
kind of like learn meditation as a first go um there are lots lots of good

116
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:22,200
resources at at IMC to uh you know intro classes and lots of great recordings and

117
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:29,000
lots of stuff anyway that's not trying to absolve myself uh completely uh of

118
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,320
irresponsibility but um uh just to uh to flag

119
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:44,640
that okay so

120
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:52,600
um sometimes when a um a a monastic gives a Dharma

121
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:59,320
talk the S says at the end you know s sadu

122
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:04,720
sadu sometimes that's rendered as as well said or it is

123
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:10,679
well um but it it connotes uh that the words have been received that there's

124
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:17,919
some some kind of uh nourishment in the words nourishment in the words

125
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:25,440
and I you know love words is it when somebody said

126
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,039
you know it's like I was talking all about silence silence and then somebody said like yeah but you love words it's

127
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:37,039
like yeah I do I love words I try to be careful with words try to use them in a

128
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:43,159
way uh my own you know as best I can to create a

129
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:51,240
kind of atmosphere of of of Dharma where this sense of the Dharma is more um

130
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:57,080
palpable and um and I I've always been

131
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:04,320
kind of skeptical about attempts to essentially deify silence and demonize

132
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:10,919
language you know like sometimes when when when people say

133
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:16,399
well the the path or this experience it's ineffable it's it's

134
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:21,919
unspeakable often have a sense of like well I get that but actually we can say

135
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:27,159
a lot about that experience we can say a lot about this aspect of the path or

136
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:34,120
that aspect it it's not that we can't say anything it's just that language sometimes seems

137
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:39,760
to defile the beauty of such

138
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:46,360
experiences so we can we can say a lot

139
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:55,919
and um I'm becoming more aware of the ways that that language language

140
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:04,440
functions as the primary tool in Mara's toolbox you know Mara this kind of like

141
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:10,279
embodiment of suffering um forces of

142
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:17,720
suffering and uh okay Mara's toolbox language functions as a kind of primary

143
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:24,159
tool in that and I'm becoming more aware of the

144
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:32,600
connection between uh fear and language fear and

145
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:39,159
thought thinking is usually described as um as

146
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:45,440
the kind of um the the cause of Dua the cause of dukka you

147
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,559
know U but it's also the effect of duah

148
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:57,799
uh suffering right thinking is the cause of Dua we we get that right to sort of

149
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:04,159
wrong view wrong understanding all of that our life project becomes very

150
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:10,720
muddled very muddled when we're hold wrong view when we hold the view for

151
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:20,040
example that hatred Works life gets extremely muddled and so the Dharma is a kind of

152
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:25,320
cognitive therapy that helps us change our thinking our schemas to reduce

153
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:32,800
suffering but the the flip is also worthy of our

154
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,960
consideration that thinking is the product product of

155
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:43,398
suffering rather than just a cause thinking is the product of suffering

156
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:49,240
maybe we put it like this um where

157
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:56,159
there peace and security we would not

158
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:05,079
feel any compulsion whatsoever to speak or think about oneself or the

159
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:13,520
world but fear as as um the brain scientist K Tai said she said fear has

160
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:18,720
an authoritarian command over the rest of the

161
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:24,760
brain and the challenge of of anicha

162
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:32,480
uncertainty is so huge its effect are so pervasive the Buddha like put Finger

163
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:40,760
right on it you know the effects of the pervasiveness of like grappling with

164
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:48,000
anicha grappling with anicha this kind of small very soft fragile creature

165
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,880
amidst unimaginably vast forces what am I to

166
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,880
do think

167
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:07,599
right and so we're preoccupied with arranging our security and so we we

168
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:13,920
differentiate and conceptualize and categorize friend and foe threat and

169
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:20,560
opportunity put everything into buckets uh uh explain it in relation to

170
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:27,240
everything that's come before what I know about this information is sometimes described

171
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:32,839
as the reduction of uncertainty information is the reduction

172
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:42,640
of uncertainty to have information is to reduce the measure of uncertainty and we're so hungry for

173
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:49,599
information so hungry to decode this feeling or that sound or

174
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:55,839
that whatever right in our practice just to what what

175
00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:01,680
does this mean right anicha anicha as I said last week I

176
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:10,480
think like anicha feels like Risk you know like a kind of ongoing

177
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:16,800
threat anicha and meaning

178
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:23,560
making revolves around this kernel of

179
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:30,560
fear in other words language is the the tool we use to manage

180
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:37,280
an to manage it to reduce this the to generate

181
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:44,000
information to reduce the sense of uncertainty we talk about the pain of

182
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:53,119
thinking for sure oh my goodness for sure but there is a deeply self soothing

183
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:58,599
quality we should also investigate even when the thinking is

184
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:05,720
really Bleak as painful as thinking

185
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:11,280
is to not think is more

186
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:19,240
painful it's more painful and so fear fear sends us into

187
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:26,359
the kind of dingy Workshop you know of our mind the

188
00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:33,079
headquarters that I call Matthew right

189
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:41,560
and clinging clinging is um clinging the implementation of

190
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:48,079
craving clinging is strategizing and strategizing perhaps always involves

191
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:53,359
some measure of language language is kind of the tool we use to

192
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:58,599
orchestrate our clinging you know I use that word orchestrate deliberately to

193
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:06,160
orchestrate it language is the hammer every problem

194
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:14,240
is a nail and so every problem every

195
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:20,640
problem uh needs needs a

196
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:28,520
subject the the arising of a problem the arising for it to arise as a problem it

197
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:37,760
needs a subject a kind of egoic form of awareness with me Matthew at the

198
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:47,040
center and so every problem involves measurement and comparing and a

199
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:53,160
subtle sense of of alienation a kind of the World

200
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:59,319
experience as heavy the alienation of a subtle kind of

201
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:04,440
dualism object Weighing on

202
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:12,960
subject the uh third in Patriarchs like 1500 years

203
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:20,760
ago or something when the subject disappears there can be no measuring and

204
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:26,200
comparing subject disappears there can be no measuring and no comparing the

205
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:36,480
very like sense of of um of self is is um involves

206
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:43,960
measurement comparison involves that the sense of the weightiness of

207
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:49,760
problems involves the kind of alienation of

208
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:55,760
language and maybe we say Awakening Awakening

209
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:02,200
doesn't uh does not um solve our problems Awakening arises

210
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:10,640
when we have no problems when we have no problems when we have no problems we

211
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:16,720
don't need language we don't need language and we don't need a

212
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:24,200
self we don't need to orchestrate the moment into a coherent

213
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:31,480
narrative well okay yeah but what what on Earth could it

214
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:37,800
possibly mean to have no problems given our sensitive bodies given the

215
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:45,760
first Noble Truth given everything what could that possibly mean

216
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:52,319
right well all these words are just upaya

217
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:58,480
skillful means maybe not even so skillful but they're all

218
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:04,520
upaya right this is uh

219
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:10,720
one way of um nudging the

220
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:17,760
mind but to have no problems means even even for just a

221
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:23,319
moment we trust letting go more than holding

222
00:42:23,319 --> 00:42:28,760
on even for a moment even for a moment

223
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:33,960
awareness feels more urgent more important than

224
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:39,960
anything else it's it's like awareness is

225
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,960
fully

226
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:52,920
satiating and there's such a a deep sense of safety in that that all all

227
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:59,079
phenomena are treated as false alarms false

228
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:06,160
alarms like all all phenomena we're no longer trying to decode the meaning of

229
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:16,640
this sensation or that sound all phenomena are um The buddas Plea to let

230
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:24,480
go and then we we begin to

231
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:35,319
um to really place are a certain kind of faith faith in

232
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:42,920
silence faith and silence which which is not a kind of willful gesture it's like

233
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:50,240
we trust the karmic momentum of our practice of our

234
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:58,960
wholesomeness place our faith in silence and then

235
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:05,960
everything gets very quiet except

236
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:16,040
awareness so I offer this for your consideration and

237
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:29,119
uh do remember every teaching can be used or misused we do our best to uh to use

238

teachings uh so may they uh be of benefit for uh for you those you

239
