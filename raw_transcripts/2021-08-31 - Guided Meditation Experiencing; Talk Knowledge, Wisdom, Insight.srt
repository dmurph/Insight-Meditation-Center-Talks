1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:05,279
good evening good evening

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,480
a really warm welcome really warm

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,400
welcome i'm hoping you can hear me now right let's see here i think have all the

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,680
buttons going in the right direction

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,120
so okay good thank you getting a little that the sound is okay

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:44,239
thank you so settling into this moment for a

7
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,079
little bit of a guided meditation

8
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,000
and just feeling into what it feels like at this

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,920
moment that is what are the bodily sensations

10
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,880
what are the sounds

11
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:28,560
can we just notice them not so much thinking about them but

12
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,840
feeling them being with the sensations

13
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:17,599
as we're feeling the sensations in the body of course we'll notice the

14
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,640
pressure against the body wherever we're sitting

15
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:29,520
on the buttocks the top of the legs or the top portion of the legs

16
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,400
perhaps the feet

17
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,360
and the movements associated with breathing

18
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,640
the expansion [Music] and contraction

19
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,080
but as part of the body breathing

20
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:55,519
we're just noticing the sensations like from the inside

21
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:02,000
not so much thinking philosophize or

22
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,959
anything like this but just being with the experience of breathing

23
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,960
maybe we feel it in the chest or the abdomen

24
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,840
or maybe the feeling of air going in and out of the nose

25
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,680
feeling the rhythm of the breath

26
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:49,960
we don't have to control it we're just noticing

27
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:26,240
can you notice the difference between like really being with the experience

28
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,720
feeling sensing whatever is arising

29
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:39,120
as opposed to more thinking about the breath thinking about

30
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:47,039
whatever's arising can you notice the difference between

31
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:53,680
the sensations and the thinking

32
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,840
about whatever the sensations are

33
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:21,519
and whether it's a sensation that we find pleasant

34
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,320
or unpleasant or neutral

35
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:34,760
can we just notice it feels like this

36
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,040
this is the experience

37
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,760
and as best we can not getting tangled up

38
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,240
with the experience

39
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:26,759
nothing in particular needs to be happening

40
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:37,040
we're just being with our experience and perhaps primarily with the experience of

41
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:43,360
breathing feeling the contraction and expansion

42
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,000
the stretching tautness

43
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,760
and the ease

44
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,159
hey

45
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:58,799
so this practice is about being with our experience

46
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:04,480
mindfulness is imagine being present for what's

47
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:13,440
happening as opposed to lost in thought and story making fantasies memories

48
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:23,320
it seems straightforward turns out not to be so easy to stay with our experience

49
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:32,240
but doing this is allows us to be present with what actually is

50
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:39,840
to be in accordance with what's actually happening with the reality of the moment

51
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:46,400
and in this way we can respond in a way that's supportive and

52
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:52,360
appropriate hopefully with what's actually happening

53
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,840
so that our practice can be a support for ourselves and not only ourselves but

54
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:05,120
for others sometimes maybe our just being present for what actually is and not spinning

55
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:11,279
out can be a tremendous benefit for others who are maybe spinning out

56
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:17,120
into stories or blaming or memories or whatever it might be

57
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:25,200
so just to simply be with what is

58
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:31,840
it's a benefit for ourselves and for others and this way

59
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:39,120
our practice can ripple out and may be for the benefit of old beings

60
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,120
everywhere

61
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:53,409
[Music]

62
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,559
so welcome welcome welcome everybody

63
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:55,600
it's nice to be here and a way that we're connected you know

64
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:03,200
in some kind of way through our screens but connected nevertheless

65
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,360
so a really warm welcome

66
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:15,360
so tonight i want to start with a story that's in the sutas and the story is

67
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:20,640
about this woman the nanjani and

68
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:27,279
she's a brahmana which means that she's from she's a from the what was the dominant religion at the time of the

69
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:33,440
buddha and apparently there's a meal happening

70
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:39,360
and she stumbles or she trips and as she recovers herself

71
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:45,760
she says homage to the blessed one referring to the buddha

72
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:51,840
and so it's a little bit surprising that amongst a meeting right of one religious tradition

73
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:57,120
that she's saying homage to a different at that time it wasn't really a religion

74
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:02,799
but a different um teacher religious teacher

75
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:08,000
and one of the people there the story is that it's her

76
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,200
brother-in-law says what what are you doing i'm paraphrasing

77
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:19,840
obviously what are you doing why are you saying blessed to homage to the blessed one

78
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:26,159
and she says well if you knew if you knew his ethics and his wisdom that is the

79
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:31,440
way that he is in the world maybe you would be doing this as well

80
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,799
so sangarava the person who is asking about this says okay well

81
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:43,200
the next time this buddha person is in town let me know

82
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,320
so the next time the buddha is in town he was you know a traveling

83
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:54,320
mendicant we don't know how much later it is how much longer it is

84
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,640
tells him and he goes to see the buddha and

85
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:07,840
he asks the buddha when he sees them about he says well there are and i'm paraphrasing here

86
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:14,240
there are some recluses in brahman so that is there are some teachers religious teachers there are some

87
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,919
teachers who proclaim the fundamentals of the religious life

88
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:25,039
after finding a final and ultimate insight into this life

89
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:31,679
and how do you stand among them how do you mr gotema stand among them

90
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,799
and the buddha responds he says that there is a difference

91
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:42,720
not everybody responds this not all teachers are proclaiming the fundamentals of the religious life the

92
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:49,360
holy life in the same way and in fact there are three different types and then the buddha says that the

93
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:56,640
first is the traditionalists that is those

94
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:02,399
who are upholding the tradition and at that time the dominant tradition

95
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:08,000
were the brahmins who were well versed in the vedas and the vedas were these

96
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:15,120
ancient scriptures but i'm using this word scripture it's not really the right word because they weren't written down

97
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:22,320
they were just passed down orally from generation to generation i believe that that's still like today

98
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:29,120
and they have these amazing memories like this amazing capacity to remember

99
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:36,080
so they're memorized and passed down from one generation to the next for thousands of years

100
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:42,960
so the buddha says well there's one set of religious teachers that are the traditionalists or those who are

101
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,480
um memorizing the teachings that have been passed down

102
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:55,200
and they consider these um sacred texts to be revealed in some ways that you know that the sages

103
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,960
of the past had received these sacred teachings and

104
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:07,039
they've just been preserved through these years one thing that's interesting about this is that they

105
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:14,000
believed that it wasn't really necessary to go find new knowledge it wasn't really necessary to go figure

106
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,600
things out everything that you needed was already known

107
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,960
and it was in these vedas so you just had to find it in the vedas

108
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:32,640
so not as so much of an emphasis on finding things new or figuring things out but of learning

109
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:38,640
this emphasis of learning what was already known so that was one type of teacher that the

110
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:46,159
buddha talked about and the second type were the reasoners and the logicians and we might

111
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:52,960
say the philosophers those are the they did that um they didn't entirely like discard the

112
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,640
scriptures but they considered it more of a secondary source of wisdom but they

113
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:04,840
believed that knowledge of reality was or a knowledge about how to live a good

114
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:10,720
life was more found by reasoning and speculating

115
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:18,320
and working with inference so this included ideas about what happened after death or

116
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:24,560
primarily about this so that you could use a logic or philosophy or

117
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:31,760
speculation to know about that so this was a second type of teacher

118
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:37,679
and then the buddha said that there is a third type of teacher what we might call

119
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:43,679
the experientialists those that place an emphasis on what can

120
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:49,358
be empirically known what can we know for ourselves

121
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:57,760
not only from learning not only from philosophizing reasoning using logic but

122
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:05,040
what can we actually experience and the buddha put himself in this third

123
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,320
category the experiencers and to be sure

124
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:15,920
all three of these types of gaining knowledge we might say

125
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:22,960
have value and have a place right we might remember that when we were beginning meditators

126
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:29,440
that it was helpful to learn from others it was helpful to perhaps

127
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:36,000
even here at imc do an introduction to meditation class these days listening to an app reading

128
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,119
to a book there's so many recordings you can listen to so all these ways in which

129
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:47,119
we might learn from others and the knowledge that we have

130
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:55,200
and there might also be this way in which it's helpful to read uh the suttas some of the

131
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:01,680
scriptures that were before and or it might be helpful to really contemplate

132
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:09,040
and think about some of these teachings that we hear in dermatalks is this true does this make sense is

133
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:16,560
this consistent with my experience so not relying solely on what was heard

134
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:22,880
so not giving complete authority to what some teacher has said whether that teacher is

135
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:28,640
in a book or on a podcast or a dormitog but giving some authority to our

136
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:34,640
thinking mind our capacity to figure things out

137
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:41,760
but especially with meditation we can see this or maybe i could use the analogy of a mango

138
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:49,839
we can read about mangoes we can see pictures of mangoes we can hear or read about a description

139
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:55,280
of mangoes but of course it's not until we actually

140
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:01,119
hold and feel the mango how they feel the shape the heaviness of them

141
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:06,320
maybe cutting into them ourselves and seeing smelling

142
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:12,720
seeing the juicing juiciness of them the tasting of the mango

143
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:18,480
right the experience is different of course we know this

144
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,920
and so the buddha he's pointing to this also he's pointing to the importance of

145
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:32,079
experience and this idea that we want to have

146
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:37,599
not only think about the teachings but to see them in our own lives and to

147
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:43,760
experience them and the buddha on his night of awakening

148
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:51,520
he says the dhamma that i have attained is profound hard to see and hard to

149
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:57,440
understand peaceful sublime unattainable

150
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:04,400
by mere reasoning subtle to be experienced

151
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:10,320
by the wise so this dharma that he teaches this

152
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:16,720
drama that was part of his awakening experience that he realized he's saying that we can't just reason it

153
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:22,320
it has to be experienced and of course as we would expect sometimes in the suttas we hear him

154
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:28,800
saying with regard to things unheard before that is that hasn't been

155
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:36,079
passed down through the oral tradition with regard to things unheard before there arose in me vision

156
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:42,800
knowledge wisdom true knowledge and light so making this distinction between what

157
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:49,359
has been learned from others and what has been actually experienced

158
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:56,160
but we need all three we need all the to be able to

159
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:02,880
have learned from others to think about things and to experience things

160
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:08,720
and part of what we this third category of experiencing is

161
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:16,640
part of where insight arises and ajan omaro this um

162
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:22,400
delightful monk in the thai forest tradition writes

163
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:30,560
all that is required is to know understand digest practice and embody

164
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,800
this and through the triple gem the buddha dharma and sangha liberation will be

165
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,839
realized this is all we need to know

166
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:47,839
not much simply what is here in this small package

167
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:52,960
i'm imagining that he's like saying here and this self

168
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:59,640
but then here's what he says kind of like this trick maybe is but it needs to be fully

169
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:07,200
internalized fully actualized made real brought to life

170
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:13,839
through our practice during the course of the day so john omarou is pointing to the same

171
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:19,119
thing that the buddha was pointing to this idea that we have to

172
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:25,440
make them our own make the teachings our own we have to let them

173
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,480
not only like bounce around in the mind maybe but also to kind of like drop down

174
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:36,960
into our experience of the day and so one way that we might think about

175
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:43,119
this is this is where insights come from is from our experiences

176
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:51,680
and some of the key insights that the buddha points to are the insights of anicha duka and anata

177
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:59,280
insights of impermanence unsatisfactoriness and not self

178
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:06,480
anicha dukkha and i appreciate that

179
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:11,599
that uh john omaro he's pointing to that we don't have to

180
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:17,440
take these um something that were as belief we don't have to take these as

181
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:25,839
articles of faith but instead we can use them as tools to explore our experience

182
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:32,520
so and in each of this change and uncertainty or dukkha this

183
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:40,160
unsatisfactoriness or anata this inherent emptiness of self or what belongs to a

184
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:47,200
self or we can use these as tools to ask ourselves

185
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:55,200
with my experience is this changing or is it permanent

186
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:01,599
is there some portion is there some aspect of it that's completely steady that will never

187
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:06,960
change or is it changing is there some inconstancy is there some

188
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:13,920
little bit of adjustment or movement is this experience completely

189
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:19,680
satisfactory or

190
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:25,839
am i identified with this experience thinking that it somehow defines me

191
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:31,119
or that somehow it's mine maybe i'll unpack these just a little

192
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:36,160
bit these three different insights or sometimes we call these the characteristics of

193
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:42,480
experience and we can use this expression insights

194
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:48,319
and the way that we um notice them when we're looking at our experience but

195
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:56,160
omaro is also saying there can be tools to help us be with our experience

196
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:01,520
so exploring this anitra this one is kind of the most obvious one

197
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:08,720
this exploring the way that things change this inconstancy we see change everywhere

198
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:14,160
we look around the way that the audio equipment was changed

199
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:19,920
here i pushed this button it's a toggle switch and i thought i was toggling it on not

200
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,880
knowing that it had been left on and i was toggling it off

201
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:31,119
right so many of these things we've seasons change the weathers change our

202
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:38,720
bodies change our internal experiences about our thoughts our moods

203
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:44,880
these change too you certainly don't need to be a meditator to recognize that things

204
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:52,000
change but maybe we can explore this idea of

205
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,440
dukkha this idea of unsatisfactoriness a little bit more because

206
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:03,839
even if we have this really wonderful this perfectly delightful experience you might ask well

207
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:09,400
where's the dukkha in that is it true that everything has this

208
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:15,119
unsatisfactoriness this dukkha quality to it and using

209
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:20,240
dukkha as maybe a way as a tool to examine our experience maybe as a

210
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:25,839
way of looking a way of seeing things when if we really explore we can see

211
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:31,920
that even the most fantastic experience we have the most glorious

212
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:38,240
experience we have has this quality of unsatisfactoriness to it

213
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:43,920
partly because it cannot make us completely and

214
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:50,400
permanently happy maybe it brings some happiness but that

215
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:59,040
happiness arises and passes away right to that impermanence thing

216
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:04,720
so each experience might have some

217
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:10,640
might to help support the conditions for some happiness to arise but it also

218
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:16,560
we can notice that the happiness is fleeting it's not permanent

219
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:22,480
and not only that it might make us feel that subsequent or maybe even past

220
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:29,200
experiences somehow become inferior they pale in comparison

221
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:36,079
or even when we're having this experiences we might be worrying about how we can

222
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:41,520
prolong it or or we experience it i certainly have noticed this

223
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:47,839
sometimes when um i cook a meal oh this is delicious

224
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:54,400
or i'm eating a meal that somebody else has cooked i'm not necessarily the greatest cook but so if

225
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:59,920
somebody else has i'm often thinking like oh how can i make this again now what are

226
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:05,040
the ingredients what was it that made it special so there's this little niggling

227
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:10,000
sense of like oh i want it again how can i make it again

228
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:16,720
this little sense of grabbing holding on this which isn't quite happiness

229
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:23,680
the sense of wanting more a little sense of dissatisfaction at that moment

230
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:30,079
so the second i'm sorry the third anata

231
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,920
this principle of not self so again this isn't a belief we're not

232
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:41,680
trying to make ourselves believe that we don't have a self but it's a lens

233
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:47,119
through which we can explore this experience of

234
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:53,119
what is this sense of me-ness this sense of i it's the sense

235
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:59,839
of mind sense of mindness what is it that feels as if there is

236
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:04,960
a me that's listening to this talk for example

237
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:10,079
what is it that feels like there's this mind that's having these experiences

238
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:17,520
that um we look at we are encouraging us to look at during our the meditation or at this

239
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:27,799
moment that what are these experiences that we're having what is it that owns these experiences

240
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:34,000
and if we consider that to own something means that you can control it

241
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:40,400
is there an owner to these experiences

242
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:49,119
how does any being really own anything

243
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:56,640
you know really like in a substantial absolute real way

244
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:03,838
can there really be such a thing as owning that is controlling complete control

245
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:10,319
when we explore we discover that this sense of i is really

246
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:18,079
made up of a process of identifying this is me this is what i do

247
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:25,440
but that's a thought i like this i'm going there

248
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:31,920
those are thoughts too i want it to be this way i don't want it

249
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:37,839
to be this way these are thoughts it's in

250
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:43,040
created the sense of self is created entirely by thoughts but

251
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:49,520
what are thoughts they don't have any substance

252
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:55,280
they're arising and passing away just maybe one thought after another and

253
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:02,640
the only way that we can effectively maintain this illusion of a having a self is to do a lot of

254
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:08,240
thinking thinking and planning and projects and programs and if we just

255
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:13,920
keep them coming and one after the other and quickly pace them all together

256
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:20,400
we have this sense that we might be able to make something solid but if we look

257
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:27,039
we'll see that it's just thoughts

258
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:33,599
and when the mind starts to quiet down and this might be in the setting of

259
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:40,880
retreat practice when the mind has a really an opportunity to really quiet down and we investigate this whole

260
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:47,520
structure of the sense of me the sense of the way that we identify

261
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:52,800
this and structure begins to slip

262
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:59,160
it starts to seem not so solid in fact

263
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,119
and if we're not so caught up in

264
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:12,240
each experience identifying with it and instead we can simplify and see that

265
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:17,760
each moment is really just seeing hearing

266
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:24,400
smelling sensing tasting thinking

267
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:29,680
and all of these are without a self

268
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:40,119
so in this way this this exploration

269
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:51,040
impermanence unsatisfactoriness not self this active looking and exploring

270
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:57,920
we could say is inside practice this part of what vipassana is about

271
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:03,040
mindfulness is just about being with them with the experience of what's actually

272
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:10,319
arising and it can be with just simple mindfulness there are these insights can arise

273
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:17,119
but part of vipassana experience is to include some of these investigations

274
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:23,680
maybe just occasionally maybe only on retreat not to do maybe during daily life maybe

275
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:28,800
during meditation but i appreciate that ajahn amaroo kind of

276
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:35,680
describes that when we see oh yeah all of our experiences

277
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:42,960
not not the concepts but the experiences kind of like this third

278
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:48,880
group of teachers teachings that the buddha talked about so not just what we've heard

279
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:57,880
not just what we're thinking about philosophizing rationalizing using logic about but what we're experiencing

280
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:06,319
when we see them and we see oh yeah they're a nietzsche

281
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:12,559
we might see one of those three we might see all three often they see when you see one they kind of go together and

282
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:17,200
often it starts with anita impermanence

283
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:25,920
describes that insight as a change of heart an opening a realization an expansion of

284
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:33,838
vision a clear scene and seeing the world in a radically different way

285
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:40,800
like seeing like oh right how could there be an owner of this

286
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:49,359
experience how could there be an owner of this sensation it's just an experience

287
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:58,240
and the experiences are fleeting they're not sources of lasting happiness

288
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:05,599
and there's not a self and part of the beauty

289
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:11,839
of this practice of this teaching is that we can learn from every experience

290
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:16,880
whether it's pleasant it's unpleasant whether it's neither pleasant nor

291
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:26,000
unpleasant these explorations these inquiries can occur with any experience any sensation

292
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:32,079
we don't need to be having a pleasant experience on a meditation retreat

293
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:39,280
we could be filled with aversion and restlessness but the mind that notices that aversion the mind that

294
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:45,200
notices that restlessness that mind is not tangled up

295
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:52,760
instead that mind has some mindfulness and is noticing the experiences

296
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:58,640
and that's the same mind we could say

297
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:05,119
that notices that things are impermanent

298
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:11,359
unsatisfactory and not a permanent self

299
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:17,760
so we don't have to tie ourselves up in knots thinking about oh these are pleasant experiences these are

300
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:24,000
unpleasant experiences i'm never going to get anywhere i'm having all these unpleasant experiences my meditation is

301
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,520
terrible i'm a terrible meditator all these story making that we might be doing

302
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:34,640
instead all of our experiences whether they're the ones that we're

303
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:40,720
wishing for the ones that we don't want

304
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:48,880
all of them we can just investigate we can be with we can be mindful of them

305
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:55,920
and do this exploration is it permanent

306
00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:02,480
is it really a source of lasting happiness and this third one

307
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:10,319
not self is often a little trickier often this one in particular does help to see a

308
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:17,200
more quiet mind but we're not asking you to adopt some belief just to

309
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:24,319
take on these teachings but instead the encouragement is to experience

310
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:29,200
whatever is happening right now

311
