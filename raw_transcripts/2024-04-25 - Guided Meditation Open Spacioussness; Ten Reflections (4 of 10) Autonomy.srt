00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,440
Welcome to our Thursday morning

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:13,799
meditation there's a maybe it's a little funny to bring up the analogy but there's this uh famous

3
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:21,720
saying that if um a tree falls in the forest is there any sounds

4
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,480
made and a tree falls in the forest no one's there is there a

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:34,960
sound and uh I think part of the image for me is when the tree falls whatever

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,039
vibration of the air that goes on that would travel to someone's ears and

7
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:46,680
vibrate the air drums those vibrations move through the forest

8
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:53,760
unin until they meet an air of some creature and then vibrates the air and

9
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,760
then there's what we call sound and um but until it and so this

10
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:07,159
idea that the sound moving through space is being

11
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:13,799
unimpeded or a bird moving through the sky

12
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:21,200
unimpeded so freedom in Buddhism has a quality of being

13
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:28,840
unimpeded but there's it's a kind of an odd unimpeded in that uh it isn't a freedom

14
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,680
to do whatever we want to do which is often associated with freedom it's

15
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:41,880
primarily a freedom from impediment from picking things up

16
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:49,960
fueling things being involved with things being involved with desires involved with

17
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:57,439
aversions and uh and so uh and with thoughts so thinking thating can happen

18
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,079
there can be a thought but for the thought to become thinking

19
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:08,920
there has to be some engagement with it some involvement with it some picking it

20
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:14,840
up some participation in it some Associated thinking that goes on or

21
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:24,440
Builds on it and uh to be free in the mind is to create a vast space where

22
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:30,239
things are unimpeded so that a thought can arise

23
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,680
like a bird in the sky or a cloud in the sky it just drifts by and Fades

24
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,879
away so that uh uh cognition arises

25
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:49,200
knowing arises almost preverbally uh almost like a a sound in

26
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:56,920
the woods when no which no one hears there's just space there's not any there's no clinging no resistance no

27
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:03,000
picking up no judgments no reaction just vast space in a

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,120
sense so um so the freedom in

29
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,440
Buddhism is a freedom from clinging from

30
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,480
resisting from judging and in that freedom

31
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:26,959
from what is created is often associated with uh vast

32
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:34,200
space so as we sit today in meditation maybe there's some way

33
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:41,480
to partially maybe not fully but in some small way to have a sense of this kind

34
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:47,799
of freedom freedom from self-de freedom

35
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:55,120
from our past and our future freedom from being someone or not

36
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,360
being someone freedom from being right or being wrong

37
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,400
and uh there's kind of sense of space where there's room for things to

38
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:13,239
occur without any involvement with them and it can be seen as kind of

39
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:21,079
profoundly respectful of each individual unique phenomena that arises that um we don't we just allow it

40
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:28,080
to be itself we don't fuel it we don't get involved with it just let it be and

41
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,560
what will happen with more freeway we are things just move through us like a

42
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:39,560
river just moves through the riverbed just keeps flowing by and flowing

43
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:48,360
by or like it clouds in the sky so to assume a meditation

44
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:57,840
posture and with the posture there's also some way of finding a posture where we feel

45
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,680
unimpeded in simple ways you can loosen the belt

46
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:11,120
around your waist if it's tight make sure your clothes are a little bit loose not constricting your

47
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,800
body in any

48
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:25,319
way adjusting your legs your knees your hands your elbows their

49
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:31,638
positions so they all feel a little loose light

50
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:38,880
when I was first taught Zen I was taught to be like a chicken and flap my elbows until so we really keep the

51
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:45,000
elbows kind of unfrozen

52
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:58,880
untight gently close the eyes

53
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,599
and relax your

54
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:15,639
body soften around the body

55
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:37,199
breathing follow the exhale to the very end of the exhale and wait however

56
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,240
briefly for the inhale to begin on its

57
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:56,039
own allow the inhale to be what it is as unimpeded

58
00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:00,960
as is easy to do

59
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:16,560
and in the top of the inhale let there be a

60
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,800
release with the beginning of the exhale

61
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:47,759
with the exhale let there be a release or relaxing of the thinking

62
00:07:54,919 --> 00:08:00,720
mind acknowledging any pressure or Force

63
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,120
in the thinking mind to be

64
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:22,159
thinking and if you can on the exhale relax that pressure that Force

65
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:47,440
if there is pressure or force or power in certain

66
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:57,200
emotions that were born in the past or concern the future

67
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:05,560
on the exhale see if you can relax

68
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,920
release that force that pressure

69
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:37,320
letting the inhale be a time to make space

70
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:43,800
room for the inhale to Simply arise here and

71
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,800
now

72
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:58,519
unimpeded in a space where there's no distractions just the inhale

73
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:35,040
and and then find in your body wherever in your body there's a

74
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,160
soft Stillness doesn't have to be

75
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:46,560
dramatic but is there some place of soft

76
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:58,320
Stillness in the softness in the Stillness there is no reactivity or

77
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,240
judgments or involvement in

78
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:14,279
anything whatever else is going on around it Beyond it is allowed to

79
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:22,800
occur without that soft Stillness being agitated

80
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,800
and maybe there in that soft

81
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:46,800
Stillness is some

82
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:54,240
Freedom the kind of Freedom where there's space for all

83
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,079
things without getting involved

84
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,720
and with every inhale and exhale that soft

85
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:33,600
spilless soft Stillness expands grows

86
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:42,760
outwards making space within which all things can occur

87
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,279
like clouds in the sky

88
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,839
like water in the river and Drifting by

89
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,079
unimpeded for

90
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
for

91
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
for

92
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
for

93
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
for

94
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,880
for for

95
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,760
for for

96
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
for

97
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,640
for for

98
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
for

99
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,480
for for

100
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:09,640
perhaps where there is a soft Stillness or an open

101
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:17,559
spaciousness [Music] however mild those might be in

102
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:21,520
you can they be a

103
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:31,080
reference for allowing whatever occurs to

104
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:38,000
occur freely without any resistance any

105
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:46,039
involvement like a sound in the forest where there's no ears to

106
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:55,039
hear or water flowing through a river without any resistance

107
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:10,360
where there's no building of self defending self asserting

108
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:14,679
self being a self

109
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,960
even where in some radical way we can

110
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:30,360
just allow ourselves to be as we are

111
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:35,440
are a freedom of just

112
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:42,039
ourselves without needing to work at anything

113
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:10,240
and that is maybe a profound form of respect allowing each thing to be

114
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:19,919
itself without appropriating it by our desires and our

115
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,398
aversions our preferences

116
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:37,279
and in doing that for ourselves does it teach us does it teach

117
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:42,679
you something about how to offer that to

118
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:51,720
others to allow each person to have the experience of being known and

119
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:57,520
seen without our projections our preferences

120
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,679
our expect ations our ideas of how they should be

121
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:11,679
or shouldn't be profound gift of

122
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:17,398
respect each thing each person's allowed to be

123
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:28,000
themselves and there's so much space within us

124
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,080
that there's nothing to be afraid

125
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:50,520
of there nothing that can be threatened in that soft

126
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:57,600
Stillness that has room for all things

127
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:10,279
and from that kind of soft Stillness open

128
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:20,200
spaciousness with that kind of Freedom Good Will has a very

129
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:29,960
powerful impact it's clean it's clear

130
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:36,720
it's just a goodness a kindness that allows people to be as

131
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:43,320
they are where they feel our respect and Good

132
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:48,600
Will May this practice we do support

133
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:55,440
us to look upon all beings with profound

134
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:03,159
respect Through The Eyes the ears ear of our own inner

135
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:09,960
Freedom may all beings be

136
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,600
free may all beings be

137
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:21,840
peaceful may all beings be

138
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:28,399
safe may all beings be happy

139
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:43,000
and may our ability to smile convey this for others

140
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:57,329
[Music]

141
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,919
thank you

142
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:54,240
so hello and welcome to the fourth of the 10

143
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,519
Reflections that this series is focused on

144
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:07,760
and uh the fourth one is autonomy so to review there was

145
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,799
um this week yesterday it was uh a sense of agency so first

146
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:21,440
meaning then purpose and then with that uh it makes

147
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,480
sense to act in the world and so to have an ability to act the ability to have

148
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,840
agency to act according to what's important for us our values our sense of

149
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:40,960
purpose is an essential human need and when that is inhibited broken

150
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:48,360
made difficult uh denied it's profoundly uh

151
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:54,200
difficult for a human being and to support people in their

152
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:01,559
agencies and empowerment is one of the gifts that we can offer others to believe in people to have

153
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:06,639
confidence in them some people grew up without anyone believing in them and

154
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:12,760
their capacity their ability and then the fourth is

155
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:20,240
autonomy and uh autonomy is uh very important in hospitals medical

156
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:26,760
situations where a patient is um doctors are constantly supposed to uh think

157
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:32,600
about um how to respect the autonomy of the patient meaning their ability to

158
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:41,200
make decisions for themselves and I think we have a profound need to feel like we have a

159
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,279
choice and the choice is not taken away from us by other people who choose for

160
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:52,720
us and um and to not be limited and oppressed by other people's

161
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:58,480
choices but to be respected for our ability to make a choice our ability to

162
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,960
do things for ourselves and uh in thinking about this

163
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:10,360
I think about uh growing up from birth to old age that you know before we're

164
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:17,519
born and in in well we're just daating in our mother that

165
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:22,960
um everything is kind of done for us but when we're born then we start breathing

166
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:29,000
for ourselves and soon thereafter start digesting food for ourselves and slowly

167
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:36,559
as we grow up we're able to do more and more things for ourselves we're able to sit up able to stand up able to walk for

168
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:42,320
ourselves and get around without something having to carry us at some point we're able to go to the bathroom

169
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:49,480
by ourselves and clean ourselves and shower for ourselves and and at some point we're able to use forks and spoons

170
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:56,279
by ourselves and be able to feed ourselves at some point we're able to take the bus by ourselves to school for

171
00:32:56,279 --> 00:33:01,519
example or go to the store by ourselves or um walk down the street to our

172
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:08,200
friend's house without someone accompanying us and so it's a slow process of growing up of greater and

173
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:14,799
greater autonomy uh doing things for ourselves and something profoundly problematic

174
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:20,440
happens if that growth of autonomy growth of doing things for ourselves is

175
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:26,559
curtailed as we grow up and uh some people um are not given a chance to grow

176
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:33,679
up because they have people who are constantly doing things for them um taking care of everything for them and

177
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:39,000
so and protecting them so they can't really kind of go out and experience

178
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:46,480
that possibility of how they find their own way in their world and uh so just a healthy growing

179
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:55,039
up is a greater and greater capacity for autonomy until finally at least classically in modern culture that um

180
00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:01,840
you know some point we leave home and go off and start our own home someplace

181
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:08,200
else and move away from our parents perhaps and um go to college and locally

182
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:13,480
in local cultures many people go to college and or

183
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:22,158
something and um and so growing a sense of autonomy and um the um one of the

184
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:28,480
Milestones is maybe sometimes when our parents can't take care of uh of themselves

185
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,878
and we now have the strength the ability the autonomy to be the one who cares for

186
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:39,720
them at some point as we're dying um some people find that it's wonderful to

187
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:46,919
have loved ones around Some people prefer to die alone but dying is a profoundly personal thing that we go

188
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:52,878
through um and so to have the capacity for really to have grown and developed

189
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:57,920
over the course of a lifetime to enter into the dying process with a very

190
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:04,599
healthy sense of this is just me this is my process and uh and and be able to

191
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:10,240
follow through with some confidence and letting go and

192
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:16,839
Clarity so discovering and having autonomy is really

193
00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:22,920
important and uh we can't uh there's things we can not

194
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:28,880
uh expect other people to do for do for us uh we don't ask people

195
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,960
to generally unless we're sick or something we don't ask other people to

196
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:40,440
shower us or we don't ask other people to pee for us or all kinds of things we

197
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:46,119
have some things we have to do ourselves and there's a profound human need for

198
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:51,839
autonomy and where we don't have it it's a problem where we do have it how to

199
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:59,200
have a healthy sense of autonomy is a very important thing to reflect on and to explore

200
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:05,800
it gets complicated in U in some some culture subcultures of the United States

201
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:12,680
where um individualism is uh has a lot to do with self assertion where uh

202
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:17,960
there's a building of self and asserting a self and where freedom is confused

203
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:26,400
spiritual freedom is confused with a freedom to assert our desires get what we want seize the day um be ourselves uh

204
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:32,240
assert ourselves on Tik Tok or on social media to be someone for others um

205
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:39,240
there's so many ways in which to be free to do that is actually harmful for the people who are doing it it's

206
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:44,640
reinforcing something UNH wholesome it's enforcing an attachment a clinging

207
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:51,000
delusion even fantasy sometimes and um and so this the strong

208
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,160
need for autonomy gets confused sometimes with uh the strong impulse to

209
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:03,920
get our desires met our attachments met to to our to assert ourselves in some

210
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:09,079
way and uh in Buddhism autonomy is not about

211
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:14,920
assertion it's something different it's something very profound not

212
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:21,920
interfering not uh grasping onto not adding pressure

213
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:28,280
or judgments or ideas of right and wrong but allowing each thing that arises

214
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:34,440
to arise freely without feeding it without

215
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:40,839
getting involved in it without fueling it and um and to discover this kind of

216
00:37:40,839 --> 00:37:47,680
autonomy uh gives autonomy to each thing that arises and so we become The Giver of

217
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:55,160
autonomy not the taker of autonomy that we have a certain autonomy because we

218
00:37:55,160 --> 00:38:02,319
are free uh from there's no we don't resist anything we don't hold on to anything

219
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:08,640
we're not pushing anything away we're more like we're open space and things can just go right

220
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:15,359
through and it doesn't land nothing lands on our identity nothing lands on

221
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:22,160
the way in which we've built up a sense of self or holding on to some sense of self um we can still be completely who

222
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:28,119
we are and even some ways you can say we can be more fully Who We Are

223
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:34,640
when we're not trying to build and assert who we are and um so to find this profound

224
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:40,319
place of autonomy of kind of freedom from other

225
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:45,680
people's projections other people's judgments other people's Prejudice uh

226
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:53,880
find a inner place where we're free from that um is a powerful way of not exactly

227
00:38:53,880 --> 00:39:01,240
fighting what people do to us uh but not giving into it uh not participating in

228
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:10,119
it and uh and in a certain way in that way may be uh uh standing against it but

229
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:18,000
not assertively we don't give in to what other people are pushing on us demanding

230
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,680
of us but we also don't need to assert ourselves in that process we can just have confidence in our capacity to be

231
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:30,839
free in that moment in those times so to discover a kind of

232
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:36,400
autonomy that uh that uh is

233
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:44,040
nonresistance autonomy which is non- clinging non-assertion that uh that uh it's

234
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:52,000
beautiful because we can be fully who we are but it we don't have to be anybody

235
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:59,000
at the same time uh we can be space for all things with without uh being in

236
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,200
conflict with anything as I began the week with that he have non-c

237
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:10,960
contention so uh healthy autonomy so as I've been saying this

238
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:17,440
week I'm offering you my Reflections on this I'm not saying that this is the

239
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:24,000
best way for anyone to understand these Concepts I'm offering so today I'm not suggesting this is the best way to

240
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,880
understand this idea of freedom and autonomy that I'm offering but I want to give you just enough um

241
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:36,280
orientation around this topic of autonomy that uh you can grapple with it

242
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:43,800
for yourself you can consider and explore it for yourself what it might mean for you and um and maybe even come up with a

243
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:51,280
different word that's related to autonomy a synonym that may be is more meaningful for you and um but I think

244
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:57,319
it's a very significant concept to use to reflect on yourself and see

245
00:40:57,319 --> 00:41:04,520
how this works what's your autonomy and where do you don't you feel you don't have autonomy

246
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:10,280
Choice uh agency these kinds of things where do you feel like it's really good

247
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:16,599
for to have some sense of Independence uh not uh or say more more

248
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:23,520
subtly different in Buddhist language rather than Independence uh Buddhism talks about a

249
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:30,040
nondependence where do you have a place of nondependence on anything the subtle difference is

250
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:35,280
that sometimes in America Independence is uh can be interpreted as

251
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:41,760
an assertion independent enough to assert ourselves nondependence means that uh

252
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:49,599
we're free so autonomy and um and uh the fact that

253
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:56,960
it's such a it's a central ethical principle one of the three or four Central ethical principles in American

254
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:04,000
uh Medical Practice it's a very important Concept in our society as a whole and um so I think it's well worth

255
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,400
kind of grappling or considering this topic and maybe there's um um and

256
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:16,640
certainly it's a important followup of the idea of agency to have autonomy in

257
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:23,880
our ability to act uh as we see is necessary important for us autonomy to

258
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:31,079
practice the Dharma so um maybe you'll consider it uh today

259
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:38,640
and reflect on this in different ways that you might have including talking to friends about it and um then we'll

260
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:45,960
continue tomorrow with um what follows from this uh which is the concept of

261
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:51,200
identity and uh which is a little bit of a hot topic for Buddhists so um we'll

262
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:57,920
see what how that goes so thank you very much and um I wish do well with your

263
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,920
reflections
