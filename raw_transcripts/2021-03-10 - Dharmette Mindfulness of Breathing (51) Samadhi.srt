1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,319
so

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,759
the 16 stages of anapanasati

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,920
each stage each step along the way

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,439
i think it's nice to think of it as

5
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,320
being complete in itself

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,560
to not be so concerned about making

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,439
one's way through these steps

8
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,840
but to be fully with present for

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,320
practicing with what is

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,120
and content with whatever the practice

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,800
is whatever the focus is for the time

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,360
but then as it develops practice sooner

13
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,280
or later

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,280
the body starts feeling settled and

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,600
unified the whole body we're breathing

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,440
with and relaxing

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,039
the whole as we develop kind of

18
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,120
ability to be a little more content and

19
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,719
happy to be here

20
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,079
then we have a kind of a

21
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,280
a feeling of well-being

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,640
that makes it easier to both notice

23
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,400
what's going on in our mind the mental

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,040
activity and to relax it

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,920
to tranquilize it and it's nice to have

26
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,759
a sense of well-being

27
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,680
so we can look at some of the craziness

28
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,920
that goes on in some of our minds

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,880
and not so we're not disturbed by it or

30
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,560
troubled by it or

31
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,040
reactive to you know the unusual things

32
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,920
that we can think

33
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,759
and do and feel but see it as just a

34
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,280
um you know mental activity as opposed

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,439
to making it personal or

36
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,079
material which should judge ourselves

37
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,200
and so to experience the mental activity

38
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,520
and to relax it and calm it down

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,600
and kind of in a little summary that's

40
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,960
the first eight steps of anapanasati

41
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,439
and then the whole practice of these 16

42
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,159
stages

43
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,119
takes a dramatic shift with step nine

44
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,200
experiencing the mind

45
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,840
and it's kind of like this is a pivot uh

46
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,759
into a deeper dive

47
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,440
into our you know maybe we could say our

48
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,280
spiritual life

49
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,400
and the word mind cheetah is a

50
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,360
um you know it's usually translated as

51
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,360
mind or mind heart or even heart

52
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,959
sometimes

53
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,319
and uh it probably is to use to kind of

54
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,360
be a little bit of

55
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,959
heretic buddhist heretic

56
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,840
uh border on it is that the word mind is

57
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,800
the cheetah is so

58
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,319
important in the teachings of the buddha

59
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,519
and so generally respected and

60
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,239
that it's the closest thing we get from

61
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,040
the buddha

62
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,879
to something that we would maybe in

63
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,040
english called the self

64
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,040
and but the self this idea of self is

65
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,400
in put in buddhist kind of orientation

66
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,840
is all seen as represents some activity

67
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,280
of the mind some idea

68
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,720
interpretation some thing we're holding

69
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,760
on to

70
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,720
and so there's a kind of a desire not to

71
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,519
get

72
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,840
involved in this whole idea of self and

73
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,640
what is the self and who am i

74
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,959
that that investigation is considered

75
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,440
more complicated and more stressful

76
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,120
than is useful for deepening our

77
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,920
meditation so we get to put the self

78
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,680
idea aside

79
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,280
but the cheetah the mind is kind of what

80
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,159
takes its place but the mind is not a

81
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,200
thing

82
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,640
the mind is a the gestalt

83
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,200
of all the mental activities in the way

84
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,080
that we experience that

85
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,080
and so it's a fluid thing it's not

86
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,400
nothing not a thing to get attached to

87
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,280
or to

88
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,159
reify into like a solid thing it's

89
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,000
dynamic and fluid and

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,920
it gets very clear as we go deeper and

91
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,280
deeper in meditation

92
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,439
how fluid and changeable the mind is and

93
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,360
how the experience of mind

94
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,280
changes in different levels of

95
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,840
concentration different levels of

96
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,239
clarity

97
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,200
and and it's fascinating to watch this

98
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,200
how we sense and feel the mind

99
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,959
kind of oscillates between sometimes

100
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,879
being contracted and small and sometimes

101
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,319
being expansive

102
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,840
sometimes being you know all kinds of

103
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,159
ways

104
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,440
but when the when the

105
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,759
body gets relaxed the mental activity is

106
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,959
relaxed

107
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,600
generally the cheetah the mind state

108
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,440
tends to become

109
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,479
very welcoming very wholesome very

110
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,639
wholesome nourishing feeling

111
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,240
it's like we've discovered a treasure

112
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,880
inside as treasure of well-being of

113
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,080
goodness of

114
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,360
wholeness of intimacy that

115
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,120
that is a kind of a state rather than a

116
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,000
thing

117
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,680
and it's a dynamic state it's not

118
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,360
something that's easy to hold on to or

119
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,400
cling to

120
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,160
i mean we can have desires for it and

121
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,320
all that but if we get close to it

122
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,840
we realize there's nothing here to cling

123
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,919
to or it doesn't make sense to cling

124
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,759
because if we cling to this

125
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,400
this this mind we're actually getting

126
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,639
involved in a mental activity

127
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,000
which is a subset of the mind and any

128
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,479
kind of

129
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,479
to too involved with these activities of

130
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,759
mind the thoughts of the mind

131
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,680
interpretations of the mind

132
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,400
certain arrows and collapses the freedom

133
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,520
the openness the

134
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,960
fullness that is the sense of the mind

135
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,919
and that's why in step 10 uh we we're

136
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,320
allowed we can satisfy the mind we

137
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,080
nourish the mind we gladden the mind

138
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,000
with this sense of wholeness the sense

139
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,199
of being complete or centered or

140
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,720
that can happen so there's a sense of

141
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,080
well-being a certain kind of well-being

142
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,039
and this is the foundation this is the

143
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,720
for when

144
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,039
the practice of anapanasati switches to

145
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,320
something we can call an english

146
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,320
concentration practice

147
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,919
or that concentration practice is

148
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,360
separate practice

149
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,479
but where uh the that we can develop

150
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,479
concentration in doing mindfulness of

151
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,080
breathing in mindfulness are breathing

152
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,960
out

153
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,840
because we center ourselves we have this

154
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,479
this

155
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,120
mind state that we're intimate with and

156
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,919
feel

157
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,479
and we take the whole mind state with us

158
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,360
as we center ourselves on the breathing

159
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,880
or the breathing becomes the very wind

160
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,280
that moves through the mind state kind

161
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,600
of the massage that moves through it

162
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,520
and it becomes the breathing becomes

163
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,600
more and more the place in which we

164
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,080
gather

165
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,479
ourselves the place in which we the

166
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,479
concentric circles of our life

167
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,080
hold counsel hold gather together

168
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,080
and be present for and supported for

169
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,600
it's not like you're sitting at the

170
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,759
center

171
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,240
of a room and there's concentric circles

172
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,360
around you

173
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,960
and all your best friends and family

174
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,800
and supporters just come there because

175
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,199
just to be with you and hold you and

176
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,280
and love you and you know show that

177
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,720
you're you know that you

178
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,680
you're you know you know you can you can

179
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,599
you're good you can rest in yourself you

180
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,199
can be at ease

181
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,960
and so we gather together all of

182
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,240
ourselves

183
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,520
and um and the word for uh

184
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,639
that's usually translated as

185
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,720
concentration for step

186
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,000
um 11 of anupanasati

187
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,400
is uh is not actually samadhi it's a

188
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,240
different word that looks like

189
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,960
samadhi i think i didn't look and get

190
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,720
exactly right but sama

191
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,400
sama hiti or samahati and

192
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,479
it more literally means a gathering

193
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,680
together

194
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,960
a gathering together or a settling

195
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,800
a settling in here and

196
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,680
so breathing in one settles in

197
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,800
breathing out one settles in breathing

198
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,120
in

199
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,000
one gathers oneself here breathing out

200
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,800
one gathers

201
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,400
oneself here and this gathering

202
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,319
centering settling is difficult to do

203
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,560
if we're preoccupied with thoughts and

204
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,759
ideas and

205
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,120
feelings emotions it works best when

206
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,160
those are uh we're relaxed enough about

207
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,199
that we're not

208
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,120
tight or contracted around that or

209
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,039
nervous about those things

210
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,199
that those things can still happen but

211
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,720
we don't want we don't have to be

212
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,319
involved in them they can be

213
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,639
in the background or on the side or they

214
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,319
can be in the outer chairs in that

215
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,879
circle of all our supporters there

216
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,599
or as we get more and more gathered in

217
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,080
the thoughts and feelings and emotions

218
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,200
all kind of get started getting oriented

219
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,240
as supporters for this process of the

220
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,719
mind

221
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,919
being centered in on the breathing so if

222
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,039
we are thinking

223
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,640
they're very simple and innocent

224
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,399
thoughts about staying with the breath

225
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,920
feeling the breath

226
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,640
if there are emotions happening or

227
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,920
feelings

228
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,959
they really feel connected to the

229
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,480
process of being settled it's like

230
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,320
almost part of settling

231
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,000
the goodness the wholeness the

232
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,600
wholesomeness and nourishment

233
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,560
seems to flow with or out of being

234
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,160
settled on the breathing and being with

235
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,480
the breath

236
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,680
so this process of settling of gathering

237
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,320
together

238
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,200
gathering in every all of who we are it

239
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,120
continues this process

240
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,959
of becoming whole in the first tetrad

241
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,200
experiencing the whole body and then

242
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,800
relaxing the bodily

243
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,200
activity in the in the second tetrad

244
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,800
experiencing the mental activity

245
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,880
all the activity and relaxing it

246
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,560
contributes to that sense of

247
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,519
the mind as a whole the gestalt of the

248
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,720
mind

249
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,680
and then go further settling everything

250
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,560
begins to

251
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,360
come in and when it gets really sweet

252
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,200
the sense of being settled and

253
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,839
deeply connected and not distracted by

254
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:52,640
things

255
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,959
then when there's a sound or something

256
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,200
else happens in the body a sensation

257
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,680
it just seems to be soft and tenderly

258
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,360
held and included

259
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,440
it's not a problem it's just kind of

260
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,720
part of this wonderful

261
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,000
landscape of of subtleness of softness

262
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,440
of intimacy of

263
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,839
care of of attention

264
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,200
so samadhi is a

265
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,079
sometimes called the unification

266
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,200
unification of that mind

267
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,040
making it whole so i'm very aware that

268
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,839
this is not easy to experience and

269
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,600
describing it this way can set up

270
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,000
expectation or striving for it or

271
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,760
comparative thinking like

272
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,760
i'm not any ever going to be in that

273
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,160
kind of state

274
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,839
so if those kinds of things happen

275
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,279
that's why the earlier steps of

276
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,519
anapanasati is so important

277
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,240
because we're always staying attentive

278
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,160
to the stresses and the strains that

279
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,560
happen in the body around our reactions

280
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,800
and then relaxing those we're always

281
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,560
attentive and sensitive

282
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,800
to how we get trapped and caught in our

283
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,399
mental activity our thoughts our

284
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,760
judgments our

285
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,320
our interpretations are expected you

286
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,279
know

287
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,600
and our comparative thinking and we're

288
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,240
always ready to relax those

289
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,640
and this is so important these early

290
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,240
steps of anapanasati

291
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,320
to always keep them close by always

292
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,920
being content

293
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,160
to do those and that's the massage

294
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,279
that we do to always go back catch

295
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,399
ourselves

296
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,360
do the earlier steps again and massaging

297
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,399
yourselves and

298
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,360
and then we come back into a nice mind

299
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,959
state a nice way of being and then we

300
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,480
get caught again

301
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,120
and there's a massage back and forth and

302
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,399
rather than thinking of this as a

303
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,519
mistake

304
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,200
or a problem and we're supposed to be

305
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,640
always at the growing edge of the

306
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,079
practice

307
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,320
it's actually this massaging and going

308
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,240
back and forth and discovering ourselves

309
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,880
and

310
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,560
works our slowly is working out the

311
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,040
kinks slowly working out the

312
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,800
wrinkles that need to be ironed out

313
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,560
so we get more and more whole and

314
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,519
holistic and settled in this practice

315
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,800
so uh don't um

316
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,920
don't be concerned too much if these

317
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,360
teachings we do now for

318
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,079
these deeper and deeper teachings don't

319
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,680
quite work for you

320
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,680
they'll work in some way don't you can

321
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,959
trust that

322
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,839
you might not be aware of it consciously

323
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:22,160
and

324
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,519
always be content to do whatever step

325
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,959
that you're on

326
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,480
and we'll continue so um

327
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,160
thank you for today and we'll probably

328
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,920
continue for a while now

329
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,480
if at least a few days into the week

330
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,040
with

331
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:44,560
the samadhi and concentration thank you
