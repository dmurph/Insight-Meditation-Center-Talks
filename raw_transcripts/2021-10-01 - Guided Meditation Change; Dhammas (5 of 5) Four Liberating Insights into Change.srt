00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:08,799
hello everyone and welcome to our meditation time together

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,599
and i'm offering this week one exercise for each meditation

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,119
that goes along with the fourth foundation of mindfulness and

4
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:27,359
so today's the fifth one and the final one and this one i want to give a little bit

5
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:34,800
more introduction for if i'm walking in in the city and i notice my

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,640
shoes are dirty i might notice it and say oh when i get home

7
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:48,239
i'll clean them and that's it don't think about it again or i might notice my shoes are dirty and

8
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,760
immediately start uh ruminating about this i'm stuck on this idea and

9
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,480
and thinking of how everyone's judging me as i walk down the city streets because my dirty shoes and my value as human being

10
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,560
is dependent on being having clean shoes and i'm in trouble with these dirty shoes and my mind is

11
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,479
stuck on this idea of dirty shoes but then i go along and i see a window

12
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,560
of a shoe store and i see the clean shoes in there oh i should buy some of those shoes and that'd be good

13
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,240
i'll come back and buy some new fresh shoes and i'm walking down thinking about how i'm going to buy these new shoes and

14
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,280
then my mind is stuck on buying these new shoes and then i start ruminating about how

15
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,600
well i don't quite have enough money to buy those shoes they're quite expensive and then i'm ruminating about that and

16
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,759
i'm stuck on that idea and then i occurs to me that i'm a

17
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:49,119
buddhist and for dharma's sake you know i shouldn't be stuck on thinking about shoes and and caught in that web of

18
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:57,119
shoes and now i'm stuck on the idea that i need to be a buddhist in certain way but then i remember buddhism and i said oh

19
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,719
look at that change just in the course of a minute walking down the street

20
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:10,000
my mind has gone through all these changes and i was stuck and i was stuck and i was stuck but the commonality is that

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,360
they don't i move on to the next stuckness the next stuckness and some of them only last a few seconds some of them last for hours

22
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,840
uh maybe some for decades but there's kind of stuckness around these things

23
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:32,239
but in recognizing the change it's all changing all the time then there's a different kind of oh okay

24
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:39,040
it's just changing i don't have to take it that seriously and isn't it quite something how much my mind goes from one stuck thing to the next

25
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,640
and um and but now that i see it i can kind of flip it float above it or away

26
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,319
from it or not gets pulled into it sucked into it so strongly

27
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:58,080
so the last exercise of the buddha's teachings on mindfulness has a lot to do with seeing change

28
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:05,120
in such a way that we are liberated from being stuck and so the mind becomes unstuck

29
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,159
and now there's something profound about noticing change both the change in our

30
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,760
perceptions of what we perceive the sensations of our body and sounds

31
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,000
around us whatever it might be but also um the change in

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,720
what we get stuck on that you know the mind is kind of fleeting it stays stuck sometimes on one thing and

33
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,879
even if it's one thing that's the primary theme it jumps around inside that theme to be stuck on different

34
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:40,879
ideas and thoughts so to recognize change

35
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:48,000
is an antidote for that so for this uh meditation

36
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
my recommendation is that um you recognize change how things are

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,519
changing both in your experience and in your what you

38
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:07,680
what you put your mind on and if you find yourself stuck on something involved in distracted thought

39
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,480
remind yourself that things are changing all the time that you weren't stuck on this some time ago

40
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,720
and you will be you probably won't be stuck in a little while it might be a theme that reoccurs over

41
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,880
and over again but that doesn't mean that you're stuck every moment and to recognize that there's uh

42
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,240
change and um can begin loosening up

43
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,360
the ways we're attached and caught so change you might just say that word

44
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:46,000
to yourself periodically change so assuming a meditation posture

45
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,160
and whatever posture you're in can you

46
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,520
adjust it so that there's a little bit more energy in the posture

47
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:06,800
just uh maybe i just adjust it so that the the spine is a little bit straighter or

48
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,120
the chest is allowed to come out even if you're laying down in a bed you can sometimes

49
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:20,719
move it so your shoulder blades go down the the back a little bit and the chest maybe can comes up a little bit

50
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,160
and now so there's more space in the chest to breathe

51
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:35,680
and lower your gaze about 45 degrees to the floor or whatever 45 degrees is to straight

52
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,560
ahead and

53
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,639
relax your eyes your gaze

54
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,000
and then gently close your eyes if that's comfortable

55
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:09,520
and then taking a few long slow deep breaths and as we do so

56
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,199
we are attuning ourselves to experiences that are changing

57
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:21,919
the changing sensations of breathing changing sensations in the body with the

58
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:28,880
breathing breathing in deeply

59
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,840
and exhaling on the exhale relaxing on the exhale

60
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,319
taking a deep breath and relaxing

61
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:56,160
and then letting your breathing return to normal

62
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:08,160
continue relaxing as you exhale with a normal breath relaxing the muscles of the face

63
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,800
the shoulders

64
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:26,319
the belly and whenever you're able to relax that's also change

65
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:33,039
when you move your attention from the face the shoulders the belly that's change

66
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:40,800
and to make another change now let your attention center itself

67
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,240
in the breathing where you usually experience breathing

68
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,599
and allow yourself to receive to experience

69
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:09,680
the body breathing and as you do so

70
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:17,639
you're experiencing change the changing sensations of breathing

71
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,880
and if you get involved in your thoughts chances are it's a little bit of a

72
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:48,959
stuckness there stuck on some idea or theme or concern

73
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:57,560
but appreciate how even our thoughts are fickle and change

74
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,160
periodically you might just remind yourself there's change

75
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:19,160
ever-changing change

76
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,399
and to relax into the changing of the experience

77
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,360
not just to focus on breathing but to rest in the changing nature of

78
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:50,640
breathing the changing nature of everything

79
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,279
that's interrupted when we get stuck on something

80
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,920
and when you're stuck remind yourself of change

81
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,040
so

82
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
so

83
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:31,279
if you're stuck on something now in your thoughts that's just the current way that change

84
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:39,600
has ever come to it'll change again and again

85
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,639
appreciate change and relax

86
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:52,879
let go into the flow of changing nature

87
00:16:53,600 --> 00:17:00,360
when we're not stuck there's just change

88
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:32,799
in the course of this meditation chances are there's been a lot of change

89
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:40,799
in your thoughts your concerns your focus your attention to the body

90
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,519
your breathing

91
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,039
in what way does recognizing change loosen

92
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,039
stuckness

93
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,720
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

94
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:27,760
may we through this practice learn to walk through the world

95
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:33,520
unstuck not fixated on anything

96
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:39,120
so we're able to be so we're ready to respond

97
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,760
to the circumstances we find ourselves in

98
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:53,278
so we're ready to respond with care kindness compassion

99
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:00,360
ready to respond with clarity honesty

100
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:09,600
ready to respond being self-aware of what's going on inside of us

101
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:19,840
being ready to respond really sensitive to the people we're with

102
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,360
and through being unstuck

103
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:36,320
may we live in such a way that we support

104
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,720
the welfare and happiness of many people

105
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:48,320
that maybe that's one of the great tasks of human life

106
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:54,799
to live for the welfare of happiness of many including oneself

107
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:04,000
may all beings be happy may all beings

108
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,880
be safe may all beings be peaceful

109
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,720
may all beings everywhere be free

110
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:23,158
which is another way of saying being unstuck

111
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:42,460
[Music]

112
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:54,640
so good morning and uh

113
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:03,278
so this is the final talk on the fourth foundation of mindfulness

114
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:10,720
and uh this is the area of mindfulness practice that we're studying being attentive to the ways

115
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:17,279
that we get stuck in the ways that we get unstuck and or to say it in more buddhist

116
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:24,159
language how we get attached where we get attached the nature of detachment and how we get unattached or free

117
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:30,080
liberated and and i've presented this as a kind of a

118
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:36,000
process of first we spend our time moving through the layers of attachment

119
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,360
we have the layers of stuckness and getting more and more subtle

120
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:47,120
but at some point when it's subtle enough when our preoccupation stuckness doesn't predominate

121
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:53,679
then meditation practice opens up to a native and natural feeling of well-being

122
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:59,600
that's here and which is the seven factors of awakening which

123
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:05,039
we don't be so concerned with exactly all seven but right now i just want to say a sense

124
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:10,320
of well-being tranquil happy equanimous

125
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:17,120
feeling a kind of being at ease deep deep way in this world and that is the foundation

126
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:23,600
for the last foundation at last exercise which sometimes is called the four noble truths so it's not

127
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:30,480
called that in this exercise and it's a little formula that appears

128
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:36,159
repeatedly hundreds of times in the teachings of the buddha and that is to

129
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:43,120
to know suffering to know the arising of suffering

130
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:50,559
to know the cessation of suffering and to know the way to the cessation of suffering

131
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:57,919
and and sometimes this is called the four noble truths as i'm but but that confuses it a

132
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:04,320
little bit because what the four noble truths have become down through the ages of wonderful teaching

133
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,760
is a little bit more complicated than the simplicity of seeing change

134
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:16,640
and in this fourth uh this fifth exercise is seeing rising and passing a phenomena

135
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:24,159
rising and ceasing of um of things and really kind of uh uh

136
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:29,600
because we're so at ease and quantumnous and peaceful then we're at a

137
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,799
have a readiness and ability to um kind of flow and go along with the

138
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:41,360
changing nature of the present moment the river of change that's happening here and

139
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:47,760
uh the changing sensations of breathing body emotions thoughts sounds

140
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:54,720
um they're all changing except for when we get stuck in the concepts of ideas and stories

141
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,840
related to it and that also has layers of subtlety so if we're

142
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:05,519
at the grosser level we're stuck in the stories at the most refined level we might be

143
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:12,399
stuck in very simple concepts ideas of what things are and the idea of breathing is not the

144
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:18,559
breathing itself and you can think about your breathing and have no connection to your breathing

145
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:25,919
and but to really feel and sense the breathing and not not so drum so strongly through the

146
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:31,440
filter of the concept the idea and then we're able to see the changing

147
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:39,440
nature of all the little sensations are coming and going and rising and passing and um and to really start resting or

148
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,640
taking in this radical way in which things are flowing changing

149
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:51,279
all the time is a kind of a massage on the remaining places in our mind in our hearts that

150
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:57,039
are stuck that are frozen that are tight and um and so

151
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:03,519
uh it's a little bit hard to keep that stuck keep it there and so there starts to be a

152
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:09,358
willingness and a relaxation into this place of ease and freedom

153
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:14,878
that comes with resting and change resting in how things are always moving and changing

154
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:22,000
and and become more and more sensitive to the subtlety of being stuck

155
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,280
and it can be even the idea that i am aware

156
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:34,000
or i'm here and that's the change that i'm watching is a very very very subtle kind of

157
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,200
innocent almost a stuckness that also begins to dissolve when you

158
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:45,839
really kind of rest in the ocean of change and just be with it and um

159
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:51,919
and the um and so at some point this experience of just seeing a rising and ceasing becomes

160
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:57,359
the predominant experience of meditation and mindfulness meditation and it doesn't really matter anymore

161
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:04,000
what you're experiencing like what it is it's just the fact that everything is arising and passing and and there's no

162
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,520
overlay of concepts on top of it and um and now there's

163
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:15,359
you know that even the subtlest kinds of stuckness are no longer operating at least for the time being while we're in

164
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:22,079
meditation and then at some point the ceasing the rising and ceasing

165
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,119
the ceasing happens more dramatically and there's a ceasing that really feels

166
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:33,520
like something has radically dramatically stopped something that's been in like the hum of

167
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:41,280
the refrigerator suddenly stops and um and it's like wow that i didn't realize was humming even

168
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,560
so and so something that we didn't even realize was there drops away

169
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:52,320
and falls away

170
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:59,680
evaporates collapses into itself or

171
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:06,560
just set free in some way and and then to recognize oh

172
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:12,800
being able to see change at this level that's the way to freedom and and in

173
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:19,200
this fourth foundation of mindfulness that's what it means at the last last you know

174
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:25,200
knowing knowing that this is the way to um to the cessation of suffering

175
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:31,920
is to stay in the current of change and now the language here is suffering

176
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:39,440
knowing suffering knowing the rising of it knowing the ceasing of it and knowing the

177
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:45,200
the way to the ceasing of it because as we get more and more into this field of change

178
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:51,119
then um the it's that stuckness the place where we still suffer that stands out in the

179
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:56,880
highlight and um and um it stands out above the flow

180
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:03,280
and so then we bring our attention to that to to be present and see that until we start seeing that it too breaks

181
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:09,280
up and is made up of rising and ceasing of things and so at some point in in

182
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:16,000
you know after meditation is quite deep um and there's a lot of like i said the seven factors awakening are established

183
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,280
there's a lot of well-being um that that

184
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:27,599
kind of the name of the game becomes um just tuning in to the subtlest forms of stress

185
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:33,359
of uh tension contraction all words for the subtlety of suffering

186
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:38,560
in deeper meditation so definitely buddhism is about

187
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:43,680
addressing suffering and we do it all along the way and

188
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:50,720
and because any place we're stuck has to be somehow resolved in order to drop into

189
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,320
change and so at the coarsest level you know we're caught up in the hindrances

190
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:02,640
and that might take years to work through some of the stuckness we have at a more refined level we're stuck on

191
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:07,680
self and identity issues that we're attached to and then in a more even subtle level

192
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,720
we're still caught up in comfort and reacting to pleasure and pain and

193
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:18,880
wanting or not wanting and in the world and the sensations we have

194
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,880
and so kind of working through that it's not an easy process you know but boy is it worthwhile

195
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:31,680
it's a fantastic thing to practice mindfulness and and and make go through this process

196
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:38,160
and end up in a process of radical change and and that's a change that's freeing it's

197
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:44,079
liberating all along the way throughout the four foundations of mindfulness throughout

198
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:50,400
the whole process of what happens in meditation the basic practice actually is always

199
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:56,320
the same it's just to be mindful attentive carefully attentively to

200
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:04,160
what's happening now and in doing so slowly learn how to free attention from any kind of

201
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:12,000
stuckness any kind of agendas any kind of attachment to self any kind of reactivity to

202
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:19,040
anything at all and um so it's first we start meditating mindfulness is not so so

203
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:24,400
uh clean but that's okay it's always the same practice just do

204
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,599
the best we can to be mindful of what's here and keep going doing it over and

205
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:36,960
over again doing it in daily life doing it in meditation develop the capacity to be aware to live in awareness

206
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:43,440
to live in awareness more and more and more and so as we go through our life

207
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:49,200
we're living in a field of awareness we're present and aware for what's happening in our minds and our hearts

208
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:55,839
and all around us and as we do that process the pro the practice is always the same being aware

209
00:39:55,839 --> 00:40:02,800
being mindful and at some point especially if we do enough meditation

210
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:08,160
we drop into this world of change and the change that is liberating that's

211
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:14,720
freeing and um and so um

212
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:20,240
the um so that is uh

213
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:25,760
the exercise the the fourth foundation and hopefully that's uh

214
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:32,079
was clear enough there's maybe many other ways of understanding it or interpretations

215
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:38,640
but this is the one that that i liked like to present and uh

216
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:43,920
and um so if um

217
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:51,920
so that's enough thank you so announcement so next week i'm going on a small vacation with my wife up into
