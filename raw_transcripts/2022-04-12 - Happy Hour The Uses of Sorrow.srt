1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:07,680
so hello and welcome everyone welcome to this rendition of happy hour lovely to

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,120
be with you dear sangha it makes me very happy to see you to see your

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:19,760
faces your square sense of presence was coming together and practicing

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,160
so for today's practice um [Music] i'd like to

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,199
um bring a

6
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,239
paragraph that i recently read from joan halifax

7
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:43,680
as an inspiration for us practicing with uh compassion this evening

8
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,640
karuna practice so here is here is the this paragraph from

9
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,760
joan halifax and i'll share it with neil so that he can send it to the google

10
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:03,839
groups afterwards if you thinking oh i want to hear that again you'll get it later so

11
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,080
so [Music] she says in thinking about trauma and resilience

12
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,520
as i reflect on what is unfolding in our world at this time

13
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,119
from the point of view of systems theory systems that break down have the

14
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:28,320
potential to reorganize themselves at a higher more robust level of functionality

15
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:35,200
the experience of breakdown can give one a very deep and optimistic view of the

16
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,720
potential of others to grow from trauma instead of being diminished

17
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,439
this is called post-traumatic growth and refers to the benefit from psychological changes

18
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,720
that can be experienced as a result of the struggle

19
00:01:52,720 --> 00:02:00,079
with challenging life circumstances and can foster greater resilience

20
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:07,040
we have to remember that people who have survived trauma can come back transformed by the experience

21
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:13,200
and see that suffering has made them more resilient rather than more fragile

22
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,959
with the ability to thrive in the present rather than being overwhelmed

23
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,640
by the past beyond the ending of the old way of

24
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,000
being there is hope for the emergence of the new

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,840
and to imagine a future in which the wounds are still there but

26
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,519
in a form that makes one wiser and humbler

27
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,440
and helps one to thrive

28
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,680
so wiser and humbler and more compassionate i like to add that because

29
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:00,800
another use of challenge difficulty trauma suffering whatever you want to

30
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,879
call it is us are growing in compassion

31
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,400
not just growing in resilience but also growing in in compassion in wisdom and

32
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:19,599
compassion for ourselves and for others so i like to use that the as the basis

33
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:25,040
for our practice tonight it's the use of um

34
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:32,799
there there is a poem by mary oliver called the uses of sorrow so i think of the uses of sorrow the

35
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,080
uses of challenge the uses of difficulty in our lives to

36
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:44,159
um refashion us in the more resilient in the more wise

37
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,840
not in a more fragile as she talks about of course but more resilient

38
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:57,599
pull through post-traumatic growth and growing in compassion

39
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,720
is an important part of the uses of sorrow

40
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:11,439
the uses of challenges the way that it helps us grow and become more fully human more beautiful more

41
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:18,799
gracious more kind knowing that all of us have challenges

42
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:26,720
many lives look perfect perhaps from the outside from

43
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,160
the outside oh yes they don't have problems they have a perfect life they're happy

44
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:38,800
perfect bodies and minds and jobs and relationships and

45
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,560
knowing what i know and actually our deep wisdom

46
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,880
tells us that suffering

47
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:58,320
unsatisfactoriness the sword dukkha in pali is part of everybody's life is a mark of

48
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,759
existence as long as you live your human being for

49
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:12,000
you're an animal your sentient being there is there is there is challenges

50
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,280
there is suffering there is not that everything in the world is dukkha definitely not there are plenty of joys

51
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,639
yes enjoy joy um savor joy

52
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:32,080
and yes there's also challenges there's tookka which again doesn't necessarily diminish us but helps us

53
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:39,440
grow in wisdom and resilience and compassion so i've said enough to set the frame

54
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:46,960
i'd like to invite us to now meditate together so let's settle let's arrive in our sitting

55
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,600
posture so that you can sit or if you need lie

56
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,240
down comfortably for the next 30 minutes

57
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,759
i invite you to close your eyes

58
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,599
if that's comfortable for you

59
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,960
arriving arriving in the body ah

60
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,120
first and foremost embodiment

61
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:36,240
turning away turning away from thoughts from entanglement

62
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,560
in this moment in time to give our hearts to this practice

63
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,720
to give our hearts this practice

64
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:57,759
turning the gaze inward the gaze of awareness it is so sweet

65
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:04,240
the peace within we keep mixing it up

66
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:12,400
shaking it up no need bowing to all the steering

67
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:19,120

and right now ah can we relax can we let go

69
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,520
release into this body into this moment

70
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,080
feeling of the bones

71
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,599
hugging the cushion the chair

72
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,960
you know there is a gecko that has tiny little suction cups

73
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,800
all along its its hands

74
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,039
and feet imagine imagine there were tiny little

75
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:18,639
suction cups like like the gecko

76
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:25,280
ah on your bottom on your feet

77
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:32,080
if you're sitting on a cushion the lower part of your legs wherever there's contact

78
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:38,640
really really connecting to the earth

79
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:45,519
connected yes connected stable

80
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:52,200
stable can release your weight

81
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:31,120
i let the body release its weight

82
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,760
towards the bones to the feet the legs

83
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,040
rooted well rooted

84
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:51,839
to the earth and just as we are well rooted

85
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,920
let there be a sense of uplift

86
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,040
uplifting the heart

87
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,839
and uplift through the breath aspiration

88
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,759
the breath being breathed on its own

89
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:37,959
let it be received in the lower abdomen to calm soothe settle

90
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,560
there's any tension in the next shoulder neck and shoulders your face

91
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,920
your jaw your eyes

92
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:09,600
anywhere else in the body release with the next out breath

93
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,079
release

94
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,959
one more time taking an in-breath maybe holding for a

95
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:27,120
few seconds ah

96
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,600
and release landing more deeply and the third time

97
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,800
intentional breathing

98
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:46,399
holding let's go ah release into the body

99
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:53,279
now let the breath be natural no controlling holding [Music]

100
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:58,839
let it be received let the breath breathe

101
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:18,120
continue like this for a few minutes just to settle before we turn

102
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:33,760
and as thoughts entanglements her eyes let there be no judgment just clear

103
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,120
seeing smilingly

104
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:45,120
smilingly let go let go give up

105
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,959
offer up thank you not now dear thought come back

106
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:56,000
later turning towards the seclusion of the

107
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,240
heart and mind this moment of cultivation

108
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,639
settling peace

109
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:05,799
and notice if it is possible if it is easy

110
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:13,839
to allow the breath to to have an image of the breath entering

111
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:20,640
through the heart center center of the chest to warm up

112
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,400
to prime sense of kindness

113
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,280
associated with the heart center the proverbial heart center

114
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,799
not on the left where the heart is but the center of the chest

115
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,559
maybe if it feels right for you invite you to

116
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:53,919
put a hand in the center of your chest connecting with yourself

117
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
connecting with a sense of kindness

118
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:06,720
could do well for this being who is you who has the challenges

119
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,400
that you have had or currently have in this life

120
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:25,320
oh dear oh sweetheart i care for you i wish you ease

121
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,440
holding yourself with care with kindness

122
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:59,679
now i'd like to invite you to bring to mind something that has been challenging for you

123
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:06,720
stressful [Music] perhaps not the most traumatic experience

124
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:13,279
not the 100 pound weight but maybe the 10 or 20 or even 50.

125
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,200
but something that's challenging

126
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:30,080
and recognizing that this is difficult

127
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,279
this is difficult

128
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:42,320
this is hard it's not easy anyone

129
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,760
anyone going through the circumstance would

130
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,160
find it challenging

131
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:01,120
and yet it doesn't diminish you it doesn't make you small

132
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,280
or fragile

133
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,120
it is challenging yes holding it with care with love holding

134
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:19,640
yourself with care with love

135
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:32,440
there is strength in compassion as you wish yourself well

136
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,039
of compassion i offer a few

137
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:47,440

138
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:53,120

139
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:59,600
or may i be with it carry it go through it with

140
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:08,320
grace with ease with as much ease as possible

141
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:15,640
may i have ease in the midst of this challenge

142
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:32,960
may i grow in compassion in care and love and wisdom

143
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,240
with respect for respect to myself and others

144
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:45,840
with this difficulty made open my heart

145
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:54,559
to care and deeply love myself hold myself tenderly

146
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,840
preciously

147
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,720
to see others caringly compassionately

148
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,640
for their challenge their suffering

149
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:28,880
holding oneself holding yourself with love and care

150
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,480
as a beloved being as a beloved compassionate being with

151
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,039
no judgment

152
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:53,159
just as you hold yourself with care with love with tenderness

153
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,279
also realizing your own resilience

154
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,240
your own strength

155
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:22,880
yes the challenge is here and yet you're not defined by it

156
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,720
there is so much more beauty

157
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,640
goodness mystery to you and just this challenge

158
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,840
this difficulty

159
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:26,480
yes this is hard this is challenging i love and care for myself and yet and

160
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:33,840
yet there's so much more to me to this being who is me

161
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,039
now let us invite invite to our

162
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:59,360
mind's eye others in the world we may know them we may not know them

163
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:06,480
personally who have suffered or

164
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:14,640
are suffering or feeling challenged in the same way that we have we are

165
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:25,440
it's okay to use our imagination imagine other beings other people

166
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,278

so inviting all the beings hundreds thousands tens of thousands

168
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,880
millions

169
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:02,320
of beings are challenged in the same way and

170
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:09,440
sharing our compassion our care may all of us

171
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,919
may all of us have ease with our challenge in the midst of our

172
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:22,240
challenge may we be free

173
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,679

176
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:51,840
all dear beings just like me you suffer just like me

177
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:58,000
i see you in my mind's eye there may be a child

178
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:05,679
an older person so on another continent

179
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:11,039
different race different language nationalities

180
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,399
all of us siblings in this way they may not know you

181
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:30,240
and yet we are connected in this way i wish you well i wish you ease

182
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,120
as i wish it for myself

183
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:01,600
this is hard friends isn't it this is hard

184
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,039
they understand they know

185
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,760
they feel your pain you feel theirs

186
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:55,600
if we could make all the suffering be eased suffering for all

187
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:03,159
all of you all the beings who suffer in this way all of us

188
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:21,960
i'm expanding the circle of compassion of care

189
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:28,799
to include not just those who are challenged in the same way you are but in different ways

190
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:35,039
all beings all beings with their unique challenges

191
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:40,880
or not so unique challenges similar

192
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,000
tuka you may not know them but everybody has them

193
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,159
friends family loved ones strangers

194
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,399
people you have challenges with everyone

195
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,720
oh dear beings

196
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:09,279
if i could make it all go away be eased

197
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,158
may we all have ease

198
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:19,200
and just as we hold everyone all beings

199
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,840
in this practice with kindness with compassion

200
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:32,720
wishing ease freedom grace with suffering also knowing that

201
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:40,000
none of us is defined by limited

202
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:45,120
to or pain or sorrow

203
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:57,399
there's so much more magnificence to each and every one of us

204
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,799
then our pain

205
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:17,360
may our suffering our pain open us up

206
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:25,039
the compassion more compassion for ourselves and others

207
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:32,559
feeling with feeling our pain their pain

208
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:41,480
may we all grow in wisdom all of us

209
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,679
and for the last moment of this practice period

210
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:50,240
holding with kindness whatever arose or did not arise

211
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:56,240
no need for judgment you showed up and did your best that's

212
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:02,400
enough we're planting seeds planting seeds

213
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:08,720
don't know when they will flower all we can do is to plant them

214
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:15,040
we can't force them to flower under our timetable

215
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:21,839
offering the seeds you have planted this goodness co-created all of us

216
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:30,119
together in the sangha offering this goodness may be a cause

217
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:36,559
for ease for happiness for freedom

218
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:42,400
for all beings everywhere may all things be happy

219
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:48,599
may all beings be free including ourselves

220
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:55,559

235
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,280
for yourself and others get uh oops

236
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:44,960
um nikki i have a question um can you speak to the role of the

237
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:51,520
noticing the feeling tone in holding difficult emotions which

238
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,880
i remember during the meditation that it can be a way of simplifying

239
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:03,839
stories and um bringing things from potentially overwhelm to something

240
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:10,720
that we can hold because it is feeling tone and not all the interpretations stories and

241
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:16,880
other narratives that might come with it but i don't remember much more it just occurred to me suddenly and it came in

242
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:23,200
quite helpful but i might be representing that incorrectly yeah yeah i'm so

243
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:29,359
uh glad you brought that in guitar yes um that is one way to simplify

244
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:37,040
especially if the mind sometimes might fall in to sink into the storyline and

245
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:42,880
if it's a really heavy storyline then one can stay with um

246
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:49,280
so i would say multiple things there's the feeling tone which is the vedana and that's what you're referring to so it's

247
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,320
just unpleasant just very ever so simply unpleasant

248
00:38:54,320 --> 00:39:02,240
this is unpleasant holding the unpleasantness there's also staying with the feeling

249
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:10,160
right staying with the feeling so i'm expanding on what you said there's also staying with the feeling and the feeling

250
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:18,800
then there's the feeling in the body the feeling of maybe heaviness contraction in the heart

251
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:24,960
sadness you know there could be like these various feelings or emotions well actually they're too

252
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:31,920
bifurcating more there's the feelings in the body and then there's the emotions in the mind and of course there's interaction

253
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:38,079
there so so um letting go of the storyline yes very

254
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:43,440
helpful but there there there are different levels one can attend to

255
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:50,079
i said oh poor me this is awful this is terrible why me yeah definitely let go of that i'm so glad you brought this up

256
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:56,960
for everyone's uh benefit and then it could be just like oh this is this is hard this is

257
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,160
hard this is ah sad disappointed whatever the emotion

258
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:09,359
might be and then another layer of feeling in the body what's happening in the body or even

259
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:14,640
then going even one level simpler which is the feeling tone so all of these are available

260
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:19,760
and whatever is skillful to work with yeah thank you guita

261
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:25,680
um [Music] jamie says thank you for helping me touch the most tender most wonderful

262
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:32,319
parts of myself and see they can be gifts ah lovely thank you jamie

263
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:37,440
beautiful yeah

264
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:43,680
um marianne says it was relaxing to think about how anyone would be challenged by a

265
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:48,880
stressful circumstance yes another question comes on youtube

266
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:54,480
how can i have compassion towards home doing mean things and very

267
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:59,520
egotistic so how can you have compassion towards people who have harmed you

268
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:04,640
[Music] that for that one needs to separate

269
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:10,400
the actions from the humanity because they've done actions to harm and you do

270
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,760
not condone the actions and yet they're hurting it's often said

271
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:22,160
that hurt people hurt people so you feel you open up to their their hurt and you

272
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:29,520
feel compassion for them and you don't have to condone the actions or even forgive the actions but you can be in

273
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:35,599
touch with the humanity there fossil says this was a challenging day

274
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:42,240
at work with your instructions at the end of the meditation though what happened is okay

275
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:49,280
may the seeds of practice bear fruit in life whenever they may

276
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:56,560
yeah yeah beautiful thank you for sharing that

277
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:02,960
appreciate that for everyone yeah it's okay may the seeds of practice bear fruit and life

278
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:09,520
whenever they may yeah it's all okay

279
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:15,599
beautiful so dear friends

280
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:21,200
let's transition at this point let us transition

281
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:26,800
to um small groups where our practice from the

282
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:32,119
cushion with our eyes closed compassion for not available

283
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:39,139
[Music]

284
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:51,680
this small groups as i was making the breakout groups in a moment remember please speak

285
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:59,839
just from your own experience um not commenting reflecting managing the group

286
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:07,920
or other people's experience not asking probing questions just speak from your first person experience

287
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:14,960
and each person if you have five nuggets you want to share just share one in the first round you'll say something

288
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:21,040
the next person will go in alphabetical order the next person will say

289
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:27,920
something and then the third person will say something there are three people then you'll go around and around again speaking just

290
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:33,359
from your own personal experience and having a sense of meta compassion for

291
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:38,480
yourself and others these are fellow practitioners in this space

292
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:45,040
practicing just like you you may not know their challenge but can you and also if it comes to you you

293
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:50,480
can say pass you don't have to speak you can say pass and you can just hold

294
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:57,359
uh compassionate space it's perfectly fine if you're feeling quiet or if you want to witness

295
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:05,359
for a few rounds so so um and remember be kind to yourself be

296
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:10,800
kind to yourself be kind to others this is such a precious

297
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:18,160
opportunity to practice kindness and be embodied easiest way to actually

298
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:25,200
monitor what you're saying is to be embodied see what it feels like in the body if you feel like oh i'm saying this

299
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:31,280
to impress like oh yeah maybe i don't want to say this i just want to stay with my experience stay humble stay

300
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:37,440
close to your experience so and again you're speaking for your own benefit not to educate or impress

301
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:43,839
anyone very important so creating the rooms take care of yourselves

302
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:50,480
take care of each other here okay everyone's back the rooms are closed so

303
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:57,920
we have just about a couple of minutes for any insights any last words maybe reports from

304
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:03,280
um the uh the groups any insights

305
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:11,200
and type in chat or raise your hand don't be shy especially if you haven't spoken

306
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:22,880
picky thank you nikki um could you expand a little bit on the

307
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:28,560
feeling um how to bifurcate feelings and be

308
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:35,119
authentic with how you're feeling not reactive i i was trying to

309
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:42,000
process that a bit yeah there are two different questions here okay you're asking so let me help me

310
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:48,000
understand which there's not being reactive and there is the question about bifurcating the feelings and like

311
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:54,240
say your question clearly again so when you were speaking before it it

312
00:45:54,240 --> 00:46:01,119
seemed that i understood it but when i started to try to talk about it i realized i hadn't

313
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:08,560
okay okay so what was i talking about all right that's a clear question okay

314
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:14,880
maybe the person who asked it could say but it was about staying like i get it i

315
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:20,319
get it let me say one more time so so so the idea is you know there is the um

316
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:26,839
storyline right oh actually let me change the settings in the chat i see hold on here we

317
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:32,800
go the the um the reflections um you know there's there's

318
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:39,839
with what is happening there is often a storyline like oh i'm sick this is hard it's terrible my back hurts like you're

319
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:45,920
right there's a storyline right there's a story line and then there's often second arrows why i mean like there's

320
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,119
all that and then there's actually let's say your back hurts there's the physicality of it

321
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:58,160
and then there is a kind of a sadness oh i really wanted to go play tennis like i can't do that right there's just these

322
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:05,119
different levels right so letting go of the storyline

323
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:11,760
and just feeling the physicality of the pain right which is unpleasant has a

324
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,800
unpleasant feeling tone right there

325
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,920
or and also perhaps just the so there's physicality of it and then there's the

326
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:27,920
emotional uh sense oh there's sadness there's sorrows like oh this is heavy oh and

327
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:34,000
that also has a feel an unpleasant feeling tone if you wanted to feel that

328
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,280
but whichever way you go which you can choose any of those you can

329
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:46,079
choose the physicality you can choose the emotion you can choose the feeling tone or all of them together let go of

330
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:53,359
