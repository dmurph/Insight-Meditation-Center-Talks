1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:08,700
so good morning good day welcome back

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,719
it seems to be Tuesday

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:20,300
meeting again on the theme of social and communal Harmony

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,560
let's begin with the setting um this morning where we will uh for the

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:35,520
meditation we'll start we'll start with just a little bit of grounding collecting ourselves in the body and the breathing

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,860
and then um we'll shift to a meta meditation

7
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,440
and in a in a way that it's um very similar to a way that Biko

8
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,980
inalio teaches meta meditation will first generate the feeling and then we'll radiate in all directions

9
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:58,699
but first let's get grounded so let's find our

10
00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:04,260
aligned meditation posture whether we're reclining

11
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,659
or sitting foreign

12
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,420
s right here

13
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:54,140
for our time together there's nothing else we need to do

14
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:14,300
welcome back to these senses this body

15
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:28,220
if you like a few deep breaths savoring the sensations that come

16
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,599
nothing to do

17
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,139
but allowing the mind to collect

18
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,860
this thought that that thought

19
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:35,419
just like raindrops all around

20
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,340
okay

21
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,620
yes the attention

22
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,099
is moving this way and that

23
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:15,599
to rely on the breathing each breath in each breath out

24
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,919
to call us back

25
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,080
foreign

26
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,640
shift

27
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:25,820
continuing with this meditation

28
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:36,800
we will switch the emphasis to loving kindness meta

29
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:47,540
if you have a loving kindness practice

30
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:54,620
you can start by arousing meta in the way you know best

31
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,000
and if we're just starting a loving kindness

32
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,360
practice

33
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,660
to very gently generate the feeling of Goodwill

34
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,880
with the support maybe you have a phrase

35
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,140
may I be happy

36
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:45,420
and saying to yourself internally and feeling the wish

37
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,040
that accompanies the phrase

38
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,079
may I be happy

39
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,279
may I be healthy

40
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,180
may I be safe

41
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,160
and may I live with ease

42
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,300
and then repeating at a pace that's appropriate for you

43
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:53,720
arousing this inner sense of Goodwill

44
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:38,839
foreign as we continue with the

45
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:46,339
phrases important to register

46
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,920
register the effect

47
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,980
it could be a lightning or brightening

48
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,699
or maybe a welling up in the heart

49
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:11,959
this wish for well-being

50
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:23,279
foreign

51
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,480
this Goodwill

52
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,620
the feeling of wishing well-being

53
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:44,340
it's like a light maybe a soft Candlelight

54
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:51,799
in the heart maybe a bright afternoon sun

55
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:05,299
the light filling filling us

56
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:21,200
and now we can radiate that light shine it out on all beings

57
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,900
One Direction at a time

58
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:36,059
first to the front we might even imagine there's a

59
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:39,679
a curtain in front of us

60
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:46,220
so the light can't quite yet shine on all the games

61
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,059
put in one swift motion draw back the curtain

62
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:59,240
and naturally without pushing the light shines forward

63
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:06,320
male beings in this direction be happy

64
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,840
may they all be happy

65
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:47,240
shining the light of matter now to the right

66
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:56,280
quickly drawing back the curtain may all beings to my right

67
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,840
all beings be happy

68
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:11,360
no need to push just let the light shine

69
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:45,380
now to our back just the same

70
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:54,600
draw back the curtain and let the light of Goodwill of Mehta

71
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,760
shine to all beings in this direction

72
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:37,640
and to our left

73
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:47,280
just the same throw back the curtain

74
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:55,340
and let the light shine may all beings be happy

75
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,779
allowing the light to shine in all four directions

76
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,620
no need to push

77
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,039
now also above

78
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:15,860
drawing back a curtain and letting the light shine upward

79
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,919
and so also below

80
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,720
all around

81
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:21,799
radiating in all directions may all beings be happy

82
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:36,919
you can rest in this nourishment

83
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:50,778
and when the feeling Fades if it fades arousing again

84
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,778
may all beings be happy

85
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,880
now as we come to the end of the sitting

86
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:03,200
May any goodness that's accrued any Merit any benefit

87
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:12,900
nourish us in our practice and benefit all beings everywhere

88
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:19,919
without exception may all beings everywhere be happy

89
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:25,278
peaceful and liberated

90
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:49,020
[Music]

91
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,100
foreign

92
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,820
so good morning again

93
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:57,659
what a joy foreign so the the topic for the week we will

94
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:03,080
continue with the Buddha's teachings on social and communal Harmony

95
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:12,200
ah just pausing and feeling so refreshed from The Meta practice

96
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:18,120
yesterday we talked about right view as the Forerunner of Harmony

97
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:23,960
mostly in terms of what uh Gill might call conventional Right View

98
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:30,419
translates as mundane Right View two aspects one that our actions are

99
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:36,240
consequential and the second is that we can discern

100
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:44,340
well it's beneficial what's helpful what's unhelpful the trajectory trajectory for the week

101
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:50,460
mostly we're moving from the personal personal practice to the social

102
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:58,020
though of course on inspection it's uh it's pretty difficult to isolate these two today we will extend this practice

103
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:03,659
of Right View uh and we'll bring it into

104
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:11,240
um clear practical terms for the purposes of cultivating communal Harmony

105
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:17,940
so the theme specifically for today is that for Right View to transform us in

106
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:24,299
our communities it takes our effort it takes our effort

107
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:30,360
I'd like to introduce this by um pointing out

108
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:38,460
it said that nibana the final goal of this practice is the

109
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:45,240
destruction of greed hatred and delusion and just to point out

110
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:52,620
the highest goal in this sense defined in terms of its social implications

111
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:58,580
the manifesting of a life freed of greed hatred and delusion

112
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:08,159
so I I'd like to look at the the social aspect of the Buddhist teaching through his teachings as a father actually

113
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:15,360
um they're a handful of sutas where he teaches his son rahula

114
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:21,659
rahula was known for later in his life of course being known as the Buddha's

115
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:29,000
foremost disciple of those desirous of the training he really wanted to practice

116
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:34,740
so I asked the question is desire enough is desire enough

117
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:40,080
um because body points out in this book social and communal Harmony he says the

118
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:47,460
process of personal transformation does not occur automatically for Right View to exercise a positive

119
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:54,720
influence personal effort is required he goes on a deliberate Endeavor to

120
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:00,240
harmonize our conduct with our understanding and intentions

121
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:07,580
a deliberate endeavor to harmonize our conduct with our understanding and intentions

122
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:14,640
so I'd like to I'd like to pull out some of these themes and look at them in terms of one of these teachings of the

123
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:22,260
Buddha to rahula one of my favorite suta stories it's called the Buddha's advice to rahula at mangostone

124
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:28,740
now the setup is that um Rahul is very young he is he's supposed

125
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:34,130
to be maybe seven years old he joined he joined the buddhistoric very very young

126
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:40,320
[Music] um and of course we know that he he's going to be known as the disciple that is

127
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:47,340
foremost desirous of training so maybe it meant all the more that his father the Buddha admonished him this morning

128
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:54,000
in the suta um about the importance of never telling a deliberate lie

129
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:01,740
he used he has this beautiful image of throwing away the water in a water Dipper and says that if we're if we're

130
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:07,980
willing to tell a deliberate LIE there's no evil we wouldn't do and we're throwing away our life in the training

131
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:14,158
so that's the setup before he says what do you think rahula

132
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:21,060
what is the purpose of a mirror what's the purpose of a mirror

133
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:27,020
and being an astute young one ragla says for the purpose of reflection

134
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:33,240
the Buddha says Ah so too rahula an action with the body

135
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:40,020
should be done after repeated reflection an action of speech should be done after

136
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:45,060
repeated reflection and an action by the mind

137
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:51,540
should be done after repeated reflection and then the reflection that he that he

138
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:57,420
that he explains to Raul he repeats nine times there are nine variations on this

139
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:02,420
so I'm going to read this whole paragraph because I think it's that important

140
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:08,040
and teaching goes like this [Music]

141
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:13,260
when you wish to do an action with the body you should reflect upon it

142
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:18,660
with this action I want to do lead to my own affliction

143
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:23,700
or to the Affliction of others or to the Affliction of both

144
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:30,720
is it an unwholesome bodily action with painful consequences painful results

145
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:37,980
when you reflect if you know this action that I wish to do with the body would lead to my own Affliction or

146
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:44,700
to the Affliction of others or to the Affliction of both it's an unwholesome bodily action with

147
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:52,619
painful consequences painful results then you definitely should not do it

148
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:57,780
but when you reflect if you know this action that I wish to do

149
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:04,560
with the body would not lead to my own Affliction or the Affliction of others or the Affliction of both

150
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:10,740
it's a wholesome bodily action with Pleasant consequences and pleasant results

151
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:16,099
then you may do that action with the body

152
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,359
so he's teaching a Labuda here is teaching a seven-year-old

153
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:26,940
a basic reference point by which he can begin to train himself in the ethical life

154
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:32,520
by which he can take his understanding of the consequential nature of action

155
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:38,700
to develop his discernment develop his discernment about what's harmful and what's helpful

156
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:44,300
in his actual life he's training ramula and Right View

157
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:49,859
what's interesting about this to me first of all is that it's not a

158
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:56,220
um it's not a complicated philosophy about causality it's something observable Here and Now

159
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:02,579
observing harm observing not harm something that would be evident to a seven-year-old child

160
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:06,920
and as a sound basis for our own development

161
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:13,619
of course the Buddha goes on to to encourage and admonish rahula to reflect in this way before

162
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:19,619
any action during any action and after any action

163
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:25,680
more or less saying rahula every action that you do analyze it in these terms and if you

164
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:32,220
find at any point in the process oh I'm going to harm someone stop don't do this

165
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:38,940
and if you reflect and to the best you understand this action will not generate harm

166
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:44,400
unbeneficial actions Affliction for myself or for others or for both

167
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:49,740
and go ahead every action I hear this and my eyes get

168
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:56,460
big it's a lot of reflecting to do we act a lot uh during the day

169
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:02,579
and at night perhaps um maybe it's that the monastic life is

170
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:08,400
one of relative simplicity maybe so there's extra time for such

171
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:14,099
circumspection but still we can aspire

172
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:21,119
I take bikubody's Point here that it takes it takes our effort to infuse our conduct with Right View

173
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:26,900
and maybe it's not every action but what we can muster

174
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:32,540
a second thing I want to bring up is is that

175
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:39,060
this observation of the world that we live in the life that we live

176
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:45,960
how often do we have to act on partial information where we really don't know

177
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:51,660
if we're if we're going to cause harm or benefit

178
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:58,500
the the layers of causality are so complex the request of this particular practice

179
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:05,940
I think normalizes the fact that we can't always know for sure but we can reflect as best we can

180
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:12,660
with the information that we have and if to the best of our discernment it looks like this this action that I'm

181
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:18,540
about to do will cause benefit rather than harm then I go ahead

182
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:25,140
and then while I'm doing it I still have time to reflect and then after yet again

183
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:30,780
and I think the recognizing that they're the part of the invitation is reflecting

184
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:37,260
after the action it recognizes that we don't always have the information at the beginning

185
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:44,700
and it also it also recognizes that sometimes we'll be wrong sometimes we do harm

186
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:51,060
so there's a significant variation in in these um in these instructions to rahula

187
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:57,480
for after you've done an action and the instruction is if you find upon

188
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:04,320
reflection after after acting that you have done harm

189
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:09,560
you have cost Affliction for yourself for someone else for both

190
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:14,940
then that the ask is that you quote lay it open

191
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:20,940
you confess it you tell a good Dharma friend you let them know

192
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:26,640
which I think in our in our more modern language it undermines shame

193
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:32,099
it undermines the closing off and the hiding of something that we've done

194
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:38,820
if that's available to us and healthy right now so we

195
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:44,160
We Lay it open and the second part is we resolve

196
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:50,280
to restrain ourselves in the future to do something different to try something else we continue with this

197
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:55,980
experiment of making Right View real through our conduct

198
00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:02,760
and after an action impartial as our information might be if we find that we've actually done

199
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:12,240
something wholesome something beneficial for ourselves and for each other then I love this it says you can abide

200
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:18,420
happy and glad Training Day and Night in wholesome qualities

201
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:24,800
we can celebrate our goodness celebrate when it's gone well and in this way in a very very basic way

202
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:31,020
training ourselves learning over time ah this is this this action leads to harm in these

203
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:36,079
circumstances this leads to goodness let's go toward goodness

204
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:42,060
so you can hear already how our personal training in Right View and conduct

205
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:47,700
and this form of repeated reflection um

206
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:55,980
of course it's done through our restraint it's done through cultivation it benefits us and it benefits others

207
00:41:55,980 --> 00:42:02,099
just a couple of quick examples first is uh I'm going to be going on a

208
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:08,700
family vacation sometime soon I'm gonna go see my family and stay with uh stay with my sister for a little while it

209
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:15,359
might occur to me while I'm there to uh cook my sister a meal

210
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:21,900
may occur to me oh this uh this arises in my mind I reflect upon it is this an action that

211
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:28,099
will cause benefit cause harm affliction or help

212
00:42:28,099 --> 00:42:35,460
or can it be done in such a way that it leads into the wholesome and it's pretty easy to see that internally I'm doing

213
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:41,700
I'm doing something beneficial I'm practicing generosity relinquishing of attachment and stinginess

214
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:48,260
and it also comes along with this inner wholesome feeling

215
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:53,540
and then after I give the gift I might imagine reflect in the future

216
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:58,680
that uh I see the happiness that it causes her I

217
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:04,380
can see her being nourished say she had a hard week and oh I really didn't want to really didn't want to cook today oh

218
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:10,500
this wonderful thing my brother's cooked me a meal and then the joy multiplies

219
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:16,680
foreign on the other hand can take an example of something that

220
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:25,099
maybe we see is unhelpful to borrow an example from Gill say I slander a friend

221
00:43:25,339 --> 00:43:31,079
and immediately when I do it say it was just absent-minded but immediately when I do

222
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:37,760
it I feel an inner ouch but also that friend might find out and end the friendship

223
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:43,859
think upon reflection if I had had the presence of mind to look ahead I would

224
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:50,240
have known this will cause Affliction this will cause hurt this will cause harm don't do this

225
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:55,440
because it only occurred to me after the fact I reflect back I see

226
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:01,859
this is an action that caused harm I'm going to confess this to a good friend and I'm going to resolve for the sake of

227
00:44:01,859 --> 00:44:07,319
my my practice my inner life my social life my friendships the care that I have

228
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:14,640
for these people I'm going to resolve to not do this in the future so these are two simple examples

229
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:22,140
so maybe show something about how this practice of repeated reflection makes real our right View

230
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:28,740
foreign as I said the process of this mental training this inner training

231
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:35,220
it does bring about a sort of inner wisdom but it simultaneously conduces to social

232
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:42,780
harmony and to close maybe we can just think about the the social ripple effect

233
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:49,700
if you can imagine yourself 24 hours of action this one person reflecting in this way before during and after actions

234
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:55,800
how many interactions large and small Ripple out in beneficial

235
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:01,260
ways to create beneficial action beneficial impact for the people in our lives

236
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:07,440
and Beyond how much goodness is that and then we can

237
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:14,040
we can maybe extend that and say half of us do that today or all of us do that today how much

238
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:20,339
goodness does that bring into the world so our effort training in Right View

239
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:27,480
making our right view real tomorrow we'll turn to another aspect of the teachings on

240
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:33,480
social and communal Harmony dealing with anger hope to talk to you then

241
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:39,000
please take care may all beings benefit from our practice together

242
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,540
