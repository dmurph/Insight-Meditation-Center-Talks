1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:07,040
so good morning I think I have the technology figured out having been gone from doing

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,120
this for 3 weeks it's little bit Rusty and all the all the little

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:22,599
steps so welcome and warm greetings so we're about to do a

4
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:31,000
meditation and uh what does not often what's often not

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,879
associated with meditation is ethics is ethical

6
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:43,480
Integrity but the two are very closely connected but maybe

7
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:50,640
uh uh they don't have to be consciously connected but the connection is that

8
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,680
when we sit down to meditate there's all kinds of uh

9
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,879
unethical things we're going to refrain from doing we're not going to

10
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:11,759
be actively killing or injuring anybody else we're not going to be stealing or

11
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:19,360
lying or engaging engaging in sexual misconduct um that uh we're sitting very

12
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,400
quietly and still and so physically it's a time

13
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,680
where we're avoiding Behavior which is would be considered

14
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,240
ethical internally we are training ourselves to

15
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:43,720
not be distracted not be caught up in compulsion or thoughts and um and the kind of impulses

16
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:50,520
that uh get us uh um reactive to what's

17
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:58,039
happening and the most impulses to be unethical are ones that take us away

18
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:03,479
from being mindfully present here now in the present moment so the degree to

19
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:09,800
which we're practicing present moment awareness going back here we are disengaging

20
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:16,599
ourselves uh from uh unethical impulses and thoughts they might still come up

21
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:22,120
but we're not participating in them anymore we're not giving into

22
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:30,519
them and so there's an inner ethical stance inner ethical space

23
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:36,879
that we are entering into even if we hadn't never thought about it that way and couldn't care less whether that's

24
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,680
the case or not but uh it is the case and um there

25
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:49,120
is value in appreciating that and it supports the meditation practice and the

26
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,239
thing I'd like to emphasize today is that this inner

27
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,840
ethical space that uh uh arises in

28
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:07,799
meditation um uh it is something beautiful there's a beauty to it there's

29
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:14,280
an a um a Harmony to it there's a

30
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:20,000
um something uh uh quite lovely about

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,840
it and to attune oneself to that beauty to that

32
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,480
Harmony that loveliness to realize oh here there's almost like a work of

33
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,640
art it's uh kind of the beauty of so just

34
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:45,280
listening with a quiet mind has a kind of Elegance or kind of clarity or kind

35
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,560
of beauty to it Simplicity the beauty of

36
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:58,319
Simplicity to uh feel and sense peacefully what we feel might not be so

37
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:04,239
wonderful but the ability the capacity to feel peacefully is

38
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:11,159
beautiful the capacity to know clearly has a kind of beaut the beauty

39
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:16,840
of a clear you know Clear Mountain Lake

40
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:23,680
maybe and even though everything might be confusing and we might be dull or we might be

41
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,880
groggy there can be a beauty in the Simplicity of knowing that that's the

42
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:36,080
case whatever we can know with Clarity the obvious thing that we can

43
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:44,320
know clearly there there's a kind of Truth statement oh I'm groggy I'm dull I'm

44
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:52,479
sleepy and there's something about saying the truth even though it's so obvious is also a kind of beauty to

45
00:04:52,479 --> 00:05:00,240
it so as we meditate today maybe you can

46
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,000
have a sense maybe a glimpse of how sitting in

47
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,039
meditation not only is ethical but even but even more important

48
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:19,320
maybe more deeply that that the ethical nature of sitting

49
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,720
quietly gives us access to a kind of inner beauty Inner

50
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,680
Harmony inner Clarity something that feels inspiring

51
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:36,160
in and of itself something that we happy to gaze

52
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,560
upon like we would gaze upon a beautiful object or beautiful

53
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,400
painting So to assume a meditation

54
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,000
posture and to lower the

55
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,560
Gaze perhaps close your eyes

56
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,199
and if you were going to do so in a beautiful way and graceful

57
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:15,039
way gently take a little bit deeper

58
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,639
breaths and a little longer

59
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:31,120
exhales seeing if you can feel the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out

60
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:40,520
that feels harmonious or feels

61
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,759
graceful and then as you exhale

62
00:06:52,360 --> 00:07:00,439
gracefully peacefully let go of your thoughts

63
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,199
loosen up the grip of thinking

64
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:39,080
as you breathe in feeling your

65
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:44,120
body a wide experience of your

66
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,479
body relaxing the body as you exhale

67
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,879
and then letting your breathing return to

68
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:27,639
normal and then be aware of your breathing in whatever way is most

69
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:30,639
obvious

70
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:37,399
not straining or trying to do too

71
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:44,880
much aware of how the bo the breathing appears on its own in your body into

72
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,040
your

73
00:08:52,880 --> 00:09:00,800
awareness in whatever way there's Clarity a clear awareness of of

74
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,279
breathing or part of the

75
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,279
breathing and maybe beginning to get a sense of that there's Beauty

76
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:27,720
here in the knowing in being

77
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:34,839
aware if we're not straining or Contracting or judging

78
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:40,519
ourselves the Simplicity of awareness

79
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,320
and even if part of you feels

80
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,279
agitated to have a receptive

81
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,480
awareness of how you are

82
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:37,959
where you give yourself permission to be as you are so that the receptive

83
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:45,600
awareness can feel graceful

84
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:56,079
generous harmonious maybe even a beauty to it

85
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,639
centering yourself on the body breathing

86
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:38,720
to see how simple the awareness of breathing can

87
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:46,839
be with the idea that the more simple the knowing the

88
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:54,839
awareness of breathing can be the more it is

89
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:01,240
beautiful there's a Harmony or Grace to it

90
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:17,199
and then staying with the rhythm of

91
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:26,800
breathing by being attuned to the quiet peaceful

92
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,800
clear loveliness

93
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,560
of being receptive to in breaths and out breaths

94
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
for

95
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
for

96
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
for

97
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
for

98
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,959
for for

99
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:56,440
Beyond whatever way you're distracted below your

100
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:02,680
thinking deeper inside than any judgment you can

101
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:11,120
have is there a place of being of

102
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,280
knowing of intimacy with

103
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:26,640
yourself that has some quality of beauty or

104
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,760
loveliness gentleness

105
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:40,039
that is predisposed to having being harmonious with all

106
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,679
things a harmonious

107
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
knowing

108
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
for

109
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
for

110
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720

111
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
for

112
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

113
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600

for e

117
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:26,880
whatever is not beautiful within you in this

118
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,919
practice is just a small piece of the

119
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:39,919
hole to allow your awareness to

120
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:47,559
expand into the whole wide and

121
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:52,919
open deep and

122
00:23:52,919 --> 00:24:00,679
still there you might find what is is

123
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:21,120
beautiful the beauty of being open to the whole all of

124
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,840
what's Happening without picking up anything

125
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,360
reacting to anything

126
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
for

127
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,278
for e

128
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:16,880
and then coming to the end of this

129
00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:29,559
sitting to allow yourself to be still and quiet just temporarily

130
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:34,679
and gaze upon the world

131
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:45,399
kindly gaze upon the world bring up to mind the people you'll see the

132
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:54,679
situations you'll be in and imagine moving through them

133
00:26:54,679 --> 00:27:00,039
beautifully gracefully harmoniously

134
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:11,600
and how do you have to show up how is it with the support of

135
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:17,840
mindfulness you can move through your day

136
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:29,559
beautifully a beauty which is simultaneously ethical

137
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:40,039
simultaneously avoiding causing harm and a beauty which is nourishing

138
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:42,278

151
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:35,090
[Music]

152
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,440
thank you

153
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:43,880
so welcome to this third talk on introduction to Buddhist eth ethics

154
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:50,519
or the foundations for Buddhist ethics and bringing together the topics

155
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:56,519
of the first two days that of non-harming and

156
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:05,080
wholesomeness those two coming together living in US point to or evoke Beauty a

157
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:12,519
kind of inner beauty or an ethical Beauty and that one of the reasons to be

158
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:20,120
ethical in Buddhism is not because of some you know ethical strictures and uh

159
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:27,639
and uh you know Commandments or righteousness or um sense of uh you know

160
00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:33,000
that Purity maybe depending how you mean what we

161
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,440
mean what we mean by Purity um but

162
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:47,000
rather to um to be ethical

163
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,519
because we're inspired to stay close to an feeling a

164
00:31:53,519 --> 00:32:00,919
sense an understanding of our own inner heart Harmony

165
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:09,120
Beauty what is beautiful within us is not harmed is not covered

166
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:15,039
over by living an ethical life and that we can feel that when we do something

167
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:22,080
out of hate or greed or if we lie or

168
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:28,159
want to cause harm to someone else it's uh we lose touch with this beautiful

169
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:33,639
wonderful capacity within a wonderful possibility within of feeling our own

170
00:32:33,639 --> 00:32:40,919
loveliness our own goodness and um and

171
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:48,000
uh so one of the words in the Buddhist teachings that can be translated as

172
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:55,159
ethics or ethical is the word yesterday cusa and today the word that also can

173
00:32:55,159 --> 00:33:01,159
have mean ethics is a word that um and some people some of you know it's

174
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:06,679
kalana and we know it through the expression kalana Maita often translated

175
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:11,720
as good spiritual friend however the word kalana its first meaning in all

176
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:18,919
kinds of ancient dictionaries and modern dictionaries is that it means Beauty

177
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:23,960
beautiful it also means the trans the dictionary say can

178
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:29,320
mean Excellence um and sometimes means good

179
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:35,600
but good is a little bit kind of cheapening something which is really spectacular and

180
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:41,760
wonderful and um and uh and often in the ancient

181
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:47,360
Buddhist teachings the beauty or the Excellence that's being pointed to is uh

182
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:52,799
ethical in nature that a good spiritual friend is someone who knows how to live

183
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:59,720
a life of non-harming knows how to live a life that is whol some and spreads

184
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:06,240
that wholesomeness wherever they go and inspires others inspires us in our practice to do the

185
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:13,200
same and U so rather than calling a good spiritual friend um we can call Kalita

186
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:19,960
the beautiful friend and that um uh what word and

187
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:25,440
there's an expression that sometimes uh translated as the Dharma is good in the

188
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,878
beginning good in the middle and good at the end end and certainly that's good

189
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:36,440
good is good but uh to say that Dharma is beautiful in the beginning beautiful

190
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:43,878
in the middle beautiful in the end is a is a pointing a pointing to a

191
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:49,240
possibility pointing to what we're capable of it points to the something

192
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:56,800
within ourselves which is more than just good um it's uh inspiring in its sense

193
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:04,680
of uh um how how it feels kind of

194
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:11,880
inspiringly lovely inspiringly beautiful inspiringly calming or peaceful or a

195
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:18,160
sense of clarity rather than using the word purity I like to use the word uh

196
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:26,359
cleanliness something about the inner inner life that can feel completely clean and um and so the sense of Beauty

197
00:35:26,359 --> 00:35:32,760
overlaps with clean or the sense of ethical and overlaps with this deep sense of there's an inner feeling of

198
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:40,079
being cleansed that why would you harm why would you um Sully that inner feeling of

199
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:48,320
being cleaned U by doing something which is unethical so it's not uh being ethical

200
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:55,720
because of rules it's being ethical because there's an inner reference point of something really good and nice that

201
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:02,640
we don't want to we don't want to harm we don't want to cover over we don't want to lose touch

202
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:11,240
with and um now I've known people whose dedication to Truth uh is not just an

203
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:16,720
idea or a commitment you I felt it in their whole being that these people are

204
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:22,040
are completely incapable of of lying there's a commitment to truth that has

205
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:28,839
been quite inspiring for me to see I've known people who um they who I have a

206
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:34,520
deep trust in them because of how strongly comes through them that these

207
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:40,319
are ethical people these are people who are not going to do anything that's going to harm others not intentionally

208
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:47,359
at least uh and so to be with them it they there I you know um there's a

209
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:53,599
safety but also uh what what I I value more is a deep trust or confidence in

210
00:36:53,599 --> 00:37:00,560
them um and a mirroring in those people of what's possible for me as

211
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:07,720
well it evokes the same kind of orientation for me as well and so one of

212
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:14,400
the foundations for Buddhist ethics then uh is kalana a kind of inner excellence

213
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:21,079
and inner beauty and inner goodness and inner you know you have some choice

214
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:26,200
about what word you want to use to translate kalana but it does uh speak to

215
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:31,720
something within us that's inspiring something that's worth maintaining or

216
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:41,839
staying close to something that's worth within us to be inspired by and um and uh and one of the things

217
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:48,480
that was I tried to say yesterday about wholesomeness is that um we don't want

218
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:54,760
to be conf a little bit careful to uh assume that there's something

219
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:02,119
inside that is the thing which is beautiful or wonderful uh that's separate from how

220
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:07,359
we're aware of whatever is happening how we're relating to whatever is happening

221
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:13,160
and there is some maybe some element of choice here that we choose to be present

222
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:19,560
to be attentive to be mindful of whatever is going on in a way that is uh

223
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:25,119
not harming ourselves in a way that is uh nourishing

224
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:31,359
for us wholesome making for us that uh a way we're aware in a way that

225
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:37,280
the the beauty is in how we know how we're aware so it can be very simple

226
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:42,800
something like the mind wanders off and I've spent years uh being upset with

227
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:48,359
myself the Mind wandered off and then I um jerk my mind back sometimes in a

228
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:55,319
harsh way and um and it just certainly was not beautiful how I came back from

229
00:38:55,319 --> 00:39:03,280
being distracted and slowly over time I've learned how to uh um notice that

230
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,839
I'm distracted and then knowing that uh not being in a hurry to judge or

231
00:39:08,839 --> 00:39:14,200
criticize but make space to feel that and know that that feels good it feels

232
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:21,359
wholesome to just know it in a simple clear way and then if I'm going to come back to my breathing to begin with my

233
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:26,520
breathing again in a way that just feels nice to do it's part of the meditation

234
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:32,760
it's part of the the the spiritual life the manner in which I come back to my

235
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:37,960
breathing so it almost doesn't even matter if I make it back to my breathing

236
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:43,119
just the the movement itself of the Mind the opening up of the Mind the the

237
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:48,640
switching to receptivity in the mind just feels so nice it's there's no

238
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:54,760
harshness there's no demand there's no disappointment no aversion to anything

239
00:39:54,760 --> 00:40:02,319
it just feels so nice just to keep coming back and being here and so how I relate to wondering

240
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:08,680
off is where part of that loveliness is that kalana is how I can be my own good

241
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:14,920
spiritual friend or my own beautiful friend or my own uh good friend here

242
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:21,839
come back be here in a nice way so it's easy to judge ourselves that who we are

243
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:29,599
or something wrong with us or inadequate or not good enough or something and have a global view that that's the case and

244
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:35,160
so then it's hard to find something uh uh inspiring within us that we feel is

245
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:41,000
beautiful and lovely and and satisfying but where we feel s a Harmony or

246
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,319
goodness and so but if that's the case then maybe you

247
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:51,359
can find it in how you know that you know it kindly you know it with

248
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:56,880
compassion that you know it with Clarity and uh in the very Clarity of

249
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:02,160
knowing something there's some beauty sometimes uh mindfulness has a

250
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:10,560
lot to do with truth telling that we're telling ourselves the truth of what's happening in the moment so if I'm being

251
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:17,599
um self-critical then the truth would be that oh this here we have self-criticism

252
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:24,119
going on and there's something about the clarity of that truth telling that frees

253
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:31,240
us from believing that that's who we are or it creates a different context for

254
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:37,680
recognizing what's what feels good in the truth telling itself and this

255
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:43,319
ability to say the truth is uh whether it's uh we directly

256
00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:50,599
see it that way or not is a characteristic of mindfulness that is the continual Act of

257
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:55,880
being with a truth of the moment continual Act of seeing it feeling it

258
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:01,640
recognize it and um and in doing so there's something quite lovely and

259
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:07,079
beautiful and profound about this ability to tell ourselves the

260
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:13,800
truth and um so uh one of the

261
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:21,119
important sources of Buddhist ethics

262
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:28,359
is appreciating something valuable about

263
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:35,240
ourselves some some some way in which we discover within ourselves an inner

264
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:42,800
beauty and Inner Harmony and inner cleanliness and Inner Harmony and inner

265
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:50,680
goodness and that that is uh uh where the motivation to live a life comes

266
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:58,319
living a life of beauty living beautifully uh rather than

267
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:04,040
living a life of clutter and hurry and wanting and

268
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:10,640
reacting and it is a life that requires giving a little extra time to

269
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:17,440
everything to live beautifully is to give time to each thing if you don't

270
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,640
give time chances are you won't feel the

271
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:29,280
inner beauty and if you do give time maybe each thing you'll

272
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:35,119
do will be more thorough and complete and there be less to clean

273
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:41,440
up after yourself may you live a beautiful

274
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:49,040
life and may you understand how inner beauty is an inspiring source for living

275
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:55,319
an ethical life thank you
