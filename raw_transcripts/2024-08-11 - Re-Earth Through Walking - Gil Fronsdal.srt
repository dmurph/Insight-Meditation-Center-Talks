1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:09,840
yes good morning is that loud enough for you the volume so I'll do one announcement and

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:20,240
in my mind uh it's been interesting that what I'm going to announce also kind of sets up my talk as a contrast

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,840
almost so this uh evening at 6 PM I'm going to do an online Zoom teaching

4
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:33,040
meeting uh for Spirit Rock and then asked me to do a kind of a book reading

5
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:40,719
I suppose I have a new book that came out called Everything Is practice and uh and it's a manual for

6
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,079
sitting inside Retreats especially a manual for our at our Retreat Center in

7
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,079
Santa Cruz and uh so I see it not so much as an opportunity to talk about the book

8
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:59,559
but to talk about my enthusiasm for uh Insight Retreats and uh even more so for those

9
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:04,920
that are the longer ones the monthlong and I think it's one of the great things that Spirit Rock offers is the monthlong

10
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,840
or the two-month long retreat every year so that will be the topic and uh but in

11
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:18,759
uh thinking about that and happy to do this um uh there has been a bit of a

12
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:25,320
problem with teachings like that that I do and that is that uh people will

13
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:34,520
assume that what the teachings are for a retreat are how we're supposed supposed to practice in daily life and um and one

14
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,920
of those has to do with walking meditation and on Retreat walking

15
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:46,000
meditation is very particular generally there's many ways of doing it but there's a kind of sometimes we call a

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,479
formal way of doing walking meditation and so people get the idea that this is the way we practice walking

17
00:01:52,479 --> 00:02:01,799
in this tradition just walk you know very slowly and back and forth and um and uh another way is to

18
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,000
see that Retreat practice meditating every day at home whether it's formal

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,280
Med sitting meditation formal walking meditation is a

20
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:18,519
laboratory for walking in the world both metaphorically and

21
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:24,120
literally uh uh bringing discovering the

22
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:30,959
that the temple is not at IMC or IRC or anywhere but we live in a temple we live

23
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:38,160
in a sacred world and that we can walk in a way that um gets us connected to

24
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:45,480
that but not you know slowly walking down the street you know and you know lifting moving placing looking at the at

25
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,879
the sidewalk and everyone like has to deal with our slow walking

26
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:58,040
and you know stand that get up out of the way and this person doesn't seem to be noticing me and it's we you know they

27
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:04,799
look like we're walking zombies but um you know this practice we do is a

28
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:12,480
kind of a preparation for living our whole life and walking is a powerful way to

29
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:19,440
practice in everyday life but the way of discovering how to do that is different than this kind of the more detailed way

30
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,680
we do it maybe on Retreat so walking so uh one of the uh

31
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,080
very significant metaphors in Buddhism is the aide of the

32
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:38,200
path and with that metaphor a path is a place we walk so the metaphor of

33
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:46,239
walking and uh one of the very significant places where that appears in that tradition is uh with the poly word

34
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:53,920
for walking which is literally is gachami in the ancient language but that's used to talk about what's the uh

35
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:01,079
for many people is a very important phase or very important uh uh expression of their

36
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:07,879
Buddhism which is called um uh going for Refuge going for refuge in the Buddha

37
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:14,040
Dharma and the sa going for support going for inspiration going for orienting our life around the values the

38
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:21,720
practices and the teachings that Buddha Dharma sa represent and and the word for going is

39
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:30,039
literally walking one walks with the three refuges one walks

40
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:37,400
in the three refuges walks by the three refuges they of walking to the you know

41
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:43,560
go going to The Refuge puts it out there somewhere uh but we're walking in them

42
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:50,680
we're walking with them we're walking by them puts us much more here and so this idea of walking the

43
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,680
path and in Buddhism the path doesn't exist in the

44
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,479
external world uh per se you don't you don't go find the Buddhist path someplace and you

45
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:08,919
don't you don't come to IMC please to look for the Buddhist path and you come in you open the door you look in where's

46
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:15,360
that path and um must be the blue tape on the

47
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:22,080
carpet the um the um the path is something that we

48
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:30,560
create with every step we take we we it's our job to make the path

49
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:38,120
in every breath we take and every step we take literally and uh and so walking becomes

50
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:44,199
a powerful both metaphor but also a reality for where we discover and how we

51
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:49,440
find the Dharma how we find our peace how we find our freedom our Awakening

52
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:56,360
how we find a lived life that's valuable as we live it it's not like we're

53
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,680
looking for in the future that we're trying to get someplace place and not a

54
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,800
few meditators will engage in meditation with the idea that uh if they just

55
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,919
meditate um you know sit quietly and meditate every day that somehow that's

56
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:19,360
going to be the solution for their life and they they meditate some people meditate very diligently sincerely and

57
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,800
thinking that's what's going to do it and then they get up from their meditation and then they just run around like crazy you know just live life as

58
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,240
usual without they giving any more thought to it expecting the meditation is sometime somehow it's going to

59
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:38,560
magically you know affect the rest of their life you know provide the key if you just have the big bang Thea of

60
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:45,240
Buddhism I'll sit there until I get that big bang of Enlightenment and then I'll just everything will be happy ever

61
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:53,560
after the um but rather meditation it teaches us a way of being that then we're

62
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:59,759
responsible for living that way in our life and it and it's not a matter of

63
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:06,879
then you know this magic thinking that somehow we're going to be just be calm forever if we do meditation but it's

64
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:12,560
rather okay now I've touched into something here in meditation I've discovered something and now how can I

65
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:19,879
bring that into how can I discover that or be that live that in my life how can I discover the path be the path create

66
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:25,319
the path every step I make every conversation I'm in every activity that

67
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:32,840
I'm doing and to do that is to discover something very special that the lived

68
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:39,199
life as it's being lived is invaluable the lived life as we're

69
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,520
living it is a miracle the lived life as we live is a

70
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:52,120
wonder and there's a lot of thoughts a lot of forces a lot of emotions that

71
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:59,080
tell us otherwise and some of you are already going to debate me you know this can't

72
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:04,639
be so and you don't know about my life you know how difficult it is or something

73
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:12,000
but again one of the things we learn in seated meditation if those are people who do it and uh we could also learn in

74
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,720
Walking meditation anytime you start doing mindfulness we start disc discovering this and we discover that

75
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:25,199
how easy it is to live a disconnected life how easy is to live an ungrounded

76
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:31,000
life how easy it is to live a life that the body and mind are

77
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:39,159
separated how easy it is to live in our thoughts to live in the future to live in our imagination to live in the past

78
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:45,279
how easy it is to kind of live through the filter of

79
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:53,240
desires how to live through the filter of our fears through the filters of our

80
00:08:53,240 --> 00:09:00,279
aversions and resentments and there's a kind of narrowing and a selectivity of our

81
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:07,519
attention around particular themes ideas thoughts fantasies projections

82
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:14,079
imaginations that um uh we disconnect from ourselves we live in that that

83
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:22,120
world rather than the lived world of the wholeness of who we are and I would venture to say that I

84
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:28,320
think probably more true what I'm going to say than not true that um the way

85
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,360
that modern society is set up in the modern West

86
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:39,240
especially uh is so many ways in which the whole whole activity of this life

87
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,600
becomes more and more disconnected so just the phenomena of

88
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:50,320
devices screens that we have I mean screens have opened up a fantastic world

89
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,760
and they're kind of a miracle what these computers and the web can do for our lives and they should be

90
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:02,640
celebrated and at the same time they're almost deadly something gets shut down

91
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,800
something dies in people to spend so much time on the web and on the computer

92
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:14,399
and and I see it in myself that I go and look at one thing and then I go check something else out and then I go check

93
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,240
something else out and pretty soon my mind is on its own drive like next

94
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:28,079
what's more more there let you know and I'm losing touch with myself I'm in this head world of this

95
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:34,800
this this this and my posture changes and I'm not really connected to my posture anymore and my feelings change

96
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:41,120
and I really don't feel what's going on and but if I bring my mindfulness what's happening as I get pulled into the world

97
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:47,720
of the screen I feel how much I'm getting disconnected for myself and my body and my feelings my emotions the

98
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,959
wholeness of the moment and disconnected from the environment around

99
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:59,880
me I I venture to say that most people who spend a lot of time on screens do it indoors

100
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:05,240
and that's a very limited world the time of the Buddha they had

101
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:13,200
indoors but I think most people lived in one room indoors they you know they didn't have

102
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:20,440
malls I had a friend who used to live in Phoenix and it was so hot there she would go her morning walk would be

103
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,920
walking in the you mile long Mall because that was air

104
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:32,680
conditioned but you know so along hallways you know and there are people who can seldom go Outdoors anymore

105
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:39,079
because their work is just big building and just complex and it's not necessarily wrong

106
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:44,920
to live that way but it's an easy way of being disconnected to the Earth

107
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:51,200
disconnected to the Natural World the sky the air the outside

108
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,959
and and that's not just a disconnection to those things but it's a disconnection

109
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:04,200
to how we can be a tuned to that world how we can be sensing it and feeling it

110
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,839
and as human beings we've been designed to be attuned to the natural world to

111
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:15,639
the temperature and air and smells and tastes and and the terrain and to be

112
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:20,959
reading and taking it all in and not a few people find it so healing to go to a

113
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:26,360
park and going for a walk go outdoors and something uh it

114
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,839
settles the preoccupations of the mind that we caught in and spinning out in it

115
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:41,320
helps us feel reged and uh the the expression that I've come up with is we feel uh

116
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:47,199
reared and many of us live deared we don't live connected to the

117
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:53,680
ground and the Earth walking if we can especially if we can walk outside gets

118
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,480
us grounded it can get us grounded it can get us reared even if we walk on fa

119
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:07,320
or C in sidewalks there's something about being outside something of walking and um and there's there's a way

120
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:13,600
in which ordinary everyday walking in our lives can be can be a profound

121
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,639
activity and we can learn that again from meditation because we can learn the

122
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:27,240
opportunity in walking outside is to just like in meditation sity seated meditation is to heal the

123
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,480
Divide between the body and the mind to no longer live so much in the mind

124
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:39,920
and thoughts that were disconnected to the body and it's almost like gu for many of us the body and mind are in two

125
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:46,160
different places at this at that kind of the same time the mind is thinking about

126
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,560
tomorrow or another place or other situation the body is

127
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:58,320
here and um now occasionally we bring we take the body to where the mind is but

128
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:06,519
the real task is to bring the Mind into where the body is which means here and now to discover how to be here so that

129
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:14,199
the mind and body are operating and working together and that's such a phenomenal thing to have happened that

130
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:20,000
we can call it a healing we heal that split between the body and mind and

131
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,279
that's hard to do because the thinking mind the feeling mind the mind that gets

132
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,920
preoccupied and cut up has a lot of publicity that it sends out a lot of

133
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:36,759
advertisements a lot of lawyers a lot of politicians a lot of

134
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:42,480
that are arguing how important it is to stay preoccupied and caught up in that

135
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:48,360
world and uh and it can seem so important the authority of that mental

136
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:54,440
world that we get lost in uh can be you know the authority is huge that we Grant

137
00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:00,680
it and the cost is we lose ourselves we lose not just ourselves but we lose

138
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:06,680
sometimes a a deep connection to this world that we live in so if we

139
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:12,040
walk walk down the street and we're starting to bring together the body and

140
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:20,240
the mind so that every step we take we are making the path every step we make

141
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:26,959
we are discovering something that we can may be deeply respect and value every

142
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:34,160
step we take we are waking up to this moment in the fullness of the moment and

143
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:39,319
what the fullness means means the whole show it means includes how we're

144
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:44,600
distracted but not to just keep being distracted but to wake up to all this

145
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:51,040
whole picture here's a body walking here's a body that doesn't feel seen and

146
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:57,880
recognized here's a mind that's caught up in thoughts and we open this is what's happening let's walk now with all

147
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:05,759
this going for Refuge with the Buddha Dharma and the s means to going for Refuge with all of who we are in this

148
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:12,160
moment and something can begin to settle something begin shifting when we're not

149
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,399
caught in the world of thoughts something begin shifting if we begin

150
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:23,040
being attuned to the the whole body and mind as it operates

151
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:29,440
together our body and Minds were designed to work together and our bodies are kind of like

152
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:36,040
a miracle the walk just you know we take walking for granted those of us who can

153
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:45,240
those of us who can walk and um I read recently that um one of the

154
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:53,120
first first thing that characterized homins hom you the homo

155
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:59,040
kind of class of mammals was that they

156
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,720
walking upright in two legs it's one of the first things and slowly over time

157
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:12,199
these kind of beings that evolved into homos sapiens uh they um or nowadays as homo

158
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:20,038
homo consumers consumers um is um uh the very efficient

159
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:26,600
walking we do apparently we walk more humans walk more efficiently than chimpanzees and other things that walk

160
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:32,280
with can walk on two legs and and um and there's amazing it's amazing engineering

161
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:38,600
feat that somehow Evolution has shaped this phenomena of walking and we do it without thinking about

162
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:44,120
it and um but it's an amazing thing and and we're walking in the Footsteps in a

163
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:52,480
sense of three million years of hum of you know humanid humanid

164
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,679
Evolution so we walk and uh and we walk and we feel the ground there's a so

165
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:07,400
that's as a feet touch the ground we walk in a speed that gets us connected to now

166
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:13,440
rather than disconnected it's easy to just walk around so fast that we're not connected

167
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:20,280
it's another thing to consider what's the speed of being reared what's the

168
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:27,760
speed of mindfulness what's the speed of reverence what's the speed as if each

169
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,919
step we're in a sacred world and maybe that sounds kind of

170
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:37,960
romantic or silly to talk about every step being sacred but there are places

171
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:43,440
we go where it feels special it feels like really like that it do feel sacred

172
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,080
or have a kind of reverence uh those of you who've been been to M Woods

173
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:55,360
especially if you can go there early in the morning before everyone gets else gets there I mean you you'll probably be

174
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:03,000
OD into kind of Silence being there it's and actually one of the Groves of trees there is called the Cathedral

175
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,840
Grove and um and then another one called The Bohemian Grove and if you go to the

176
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,039
Bohemian gr Grove read the sign for the Bohemian gr actually don't read it you

177
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:19,760
don't have to read it even look at the picture at the behemi gr Grove because

178
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:26,919
it's a picture that in 1892 the Bohemian Club met there and

179
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:32,760
there's a picture of the 62 foot Buddha they put in that place

180
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:40,559
1892 United States a Buddha a 60 foot Buddha in Mir Beach Mir Woods anyway I

181
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:45,600
mean that's a sacred place or a awesome place or a wonderous

182
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,799
place um and um sometimes there're religious places temples that or

183
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,919
Cathedrals literally that feel sacred the beauty about this mindfulness

184
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:01,360
practice is we could have that feeling that sense in every step we literally

185
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:08,360
take in this world and so to walk to to find that and uh there is lots of people

186
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:14,919
who love going for walks and one of the opportunities if you walk long enough is

187
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:21,559
uh is over time in the walking uh there's a kind of coming into harmony of

188
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:26,960
the body and mind it settles together again just like in meditation it settles

189
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,760
especially if you're walking with that in mind walking coming back to your body coming back to your steps just like in

190
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:39,360
City meditation we keep coming back to our body back to the breath and walking becomes over and over again doesn't have

191
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:46,600
it can be ordinary walking just walking around but to have a walking be a place we discover a whole different way of

192
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:51,720
being in the world and and this is what I'm about to

193
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,760
say now is very important walking in a way that's we're

194
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:03,360
walking mindfully we also discover all the reasons we think we

195
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:10,799
can't do that all the reasons we feel pulled into something more important or the value our thoughts or confusions or

196
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:16,360
all this stuff and is that really true and this is where you should have a

197
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:23,760
debate with yourself you should have sit down with yourself or go for a walk with yourself and take this seriously and

198
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:30,279
question the forces the beliefs the attitudes that pull you into your world

199
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:36,320
of distractions pull you into the concerns and preoccupation of everyday life that you have that these are so

200
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:45,120
important to be there and do this and be thinking about that that you become deared dis disconnected

201
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:51,279
here and uh and the arguments your arguments your Your Capacity to kind of

202
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:57,200
hold your own spiritually against this all this force of the profane profane

203
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,640
world of Destruction to return to the sacred world of here is

204
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,480
helped if you've discovered how invaluable it is to live in a world

205
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,640
where you're grounded and settled and present for

206
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:22,240
yourself so you have available to you the full capacity of of uh intelligence that

207
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:29,520
comes when the body and mind work together the full capacity of being really here with all of who you you are

208
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:35,240
not just from the eyebrows up or the neck up or

209
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:41,720
something and um and so walking is one of the great places to discover this and

210
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:48,240
one of the real Great uh proponents of walking meditation in daily life uh was

211
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:54,960
tikn Han and uh he's famous for taking these 300 people for a walk and he would

212
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:02,640
be in the front and he would just walk every step he took like you could almost feel like he really was there for the

213
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,840
step and he didn't do the next step until he had completed one step and

214
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:14,080
everyone would slow down and just be with him and it was profound people had the experience of walking with

215
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:20,480
tianan and he had um he has he has you know he has one of the best Buddhist

216
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,158
book titles that I know sometimes I got his books just for the

217
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:31,919
title but uh there was um uh peace in every step was one of his bestselling

218
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:38,600
books peace in every step what a great title and uh the Mira the subtitles is

219
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:45,520
the miracle of mindfulness in everyday life it's also a great combination and then uh he has another

220
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:52,200
one called um The Long Road turns to

221
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:59,760
Joy uh a guide to walking meditation so the long road

222
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:07,799
my wife is a through hiker if you don't know what that is a through hiker is someone who goes and and walks for a

223
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:13,360
long time like she goes for like right now she's just finishing up a relatively

224
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:19,240
short through hike which I think it was 18 days she was trying to walk from Oregon

225
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:24,640
to Canada but she had to stop halfway because of all the fires up

226
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,799
there but one of the things she talks about is uh you get into this Rhythm by

227
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:35,159
walking and walking until the body and mind are together it's a meditation practice for her that puts her in the

228
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:41,880
present moment and she's really here uh you know because she's walking all that's what she's doing all day and

229
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:47,480
there something about walking that really helps us to be present you know

230
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:55,559
this sitting meditation that some of us keep champing it's pretty wonderful but um we

231
00:24:55,559 --> 00:25:02,720
don't move we're sitting still and that has value but walking the body

232
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:11,120
is there to help you the kinesthetic Sensations and feelings activity of the body moving and waking up and expressing

233
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:19,080
itself and there's something about the fluidity and the moving of the body that can be a great help to loosen up the way

234
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:25,880
the mind is stuck and but and to keep walking and I sometimes am stuck in my thoughts and my

235
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:31,480
feelings I have big things going on and I find it invaluable to go walking and

236
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:39,080
just walking and I find it helpful to walk with all this because I allow how I am to be there but the walking protects

237
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:47,000
me from getting um um uh unconsciously caught in it all it keeps me kind of

238
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,600
kind of fluid and kind of moving and kind of you know not caught and so I can

239
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:59,559
let everything be there but then it all begins to move it all begins to find a way and I can respect it and be with it

240
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:09,000
and just let it be held or all held by the walking so um walking

241
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:16,679
meditation uh being grounded not ungrounded being embodied

242
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:25,240
not disembodied connected not disconnected reared not

243
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:32,200
deared so I so in thinking up this I I think it's a new word in English de

244
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:39,520
earthed and then I I looked at that I wrote it down and I said well if you just take out one of the

245
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:45,440
E then you have dir and then I looked up what what's the

246
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:52,720
atmology of the word dir which means like the absence of something right the scarcity or something so I looked at up

247
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:59,240
and it turns out that the English word dir comes from the word dear

248
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:05,159
with a suffix th that means like a state of the condition of the condition of

249
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:10,679
being dear so how do you get from the condition that something is dear to the

250
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:16,799
English idea dir means scarcity so the theory I don't know if anybody knows for sure the theory is

251
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:24,480
that uh when there were famines in England and places like that that um uh

252
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:31,880
uh what was dear was scarce and so somehow that got kind of turned

253
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:37,320
into dir meaning scarce but so isn't that kind of can't

254
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:42,440
we kind of revive the original meaning of

255
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:52,640
dir and um so that uh we go from being deared to a state that's that's um dear

256
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:59,840
a world that's dear living in this dear world where we value you we love we care

257
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:07,320
for every step that we do and every conversation we're in why

258
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:13,320
not do you have something better to do do you know something better than

259
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:18,960
just being present for this moment for what you're doing to be here

260
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:25,320
fully if you do question that sometimes maybe there's an

261
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:30,519
emergency you have to take care of it but but don't live a life of

262
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:37,039
emergencies live a life of emergence where something can emerge

263
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:42,679
here in the present moment something that who you are what's this life is let

264
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:49,640
life be lived live the lived life don't live the imagined

265
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:59,880
life and the lived life it turns out who would have known only happens in the present moment

266
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:07,600
and you're only alive for a short time it's amazing that we have all been given

267
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,480
this opportunity to live remember to live

268
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:21,159
it don't imagine it don't live in fantasy for it don't

269
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:27,200
live in projections and don't be caught in the memories don't be caught in the

270
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:34,720
futures where we don't we lose the lived life so walking meditation just walking

271
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:41,440
just not even call it don't even call meditation just walk walk the lived

272
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:49,480
life and let that be a life that sacred every step is a sacred step every step

273
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:55,919
is how we discover the path of Freedom there's no Buddhist path outside of

274
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,039
that if you want to discover

275
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:06,440
Buddhism don't go get another Buddhist

276
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,000
book Walk go walk

277
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,159
instead and Li and discover the lived life of walking and see what that book

278
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:25,799
teaches you what what comes alive what emerges

279
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:32,360
what's there for you if you walk rearing

280
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:38,840
yourself walk on this Earth we're we're made for it we are the

281
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:45,519
Earth walking on the earth and so this wonderful activity of walking that's

282
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:52,240
both meant literally and also figuratively some people can't

283
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:59,919
walk and um so I'll end uh maybe partly thinking of the people who can't walk

284
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:10,399
um that um one of the wonderful ways kind of to to um maybe

285
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:18,919
um tho thoch charge you know kind of this called movement towards a lived

286
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:25,639
life is um if you

287
00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:31,880
walk go walk someplace in your city your place that you've

288
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:38,559
never been to before go walk someplace new maybe without a

289
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:45,159
map maybe following the trail of the trees or the butterflies or

290
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:52,480
something there's something about going into new environments that wake something up in US takes us out of our

291
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:58,519
distracted world and um so so if you can't walk

292
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:04,399
then maybe drive to a new place go someplace

293
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:11,120
new sometimes there's a wonderful quote from teacher named uh Cham truna if you

294
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:17,760
can't meditate travel so that sometimes brings out the

295
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:23,360
lived life we we're suddenly paying attention and we feel and notice much more what's going

296
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:28,639
on but maybe you don't have to go even to a new place maybe every place you're

297
00:32:28,639 --> 00:32:34,799
in is a new place maybe every step is a new

298
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:44,440
world and as we step it mindfully uh we are authoring our own

299
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:51,600
life each step is a new life

300
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:58,279
emerging so um I hope that that inspires you to walk

301
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:05,200
more and or take your walking kind of more seriously for its

302
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,320
potential and with that if we have some time if anyone wants to ask questions or

303
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:18,480
comments or would like to make have testimonials about the value of walking I'd love to

304
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:24,440
hear I do a strange thing um I go walking sometimes with my cat with your

305
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:31,039
cat with my cat and and she actually leads the way it's very very slow what

306
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:37,440
happens to you when the cat leads you way leads you I just follow her and but what happens to you internally it's it's

307
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:43,200
wonderful yeah it's a new adventure every time even though it's the same street you see the world in a different

308
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:49,000
way yeah that very nice yeah going going for a walk with a little kid toddler is

309
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:56,360
also fascinating to see the world in a different way so there so there and then up in the

310
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:03,919
stage where then Martha maybe up SEC you're up up

311
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:22,358
there okay yeah so this isn't a question it's a testimonial as you know Gil I

312
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:28,599
lived in trucky for three years and just got back a few months ago

313
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:35,919
and um every day was an incredible Delight uh I felt like a child in a

314
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:42,800
candy store it literally would think what which which hike am I going to take today I had about six

315
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:48,240
favorites and what I didn't like as much was hiking with people and I didn't want

316
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:53,800
to be antisocial but I didn't know a whole lot of people when I live there it

317
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:59,119
I was much more present when I walked alone and um this is really a

318
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:06,720
continuation from last week cuz you were talking about Forest walking and I have felt grief and loss

319
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:14,560
since I've been back even though I you know they wonderful places to walk here it's just not the same as in the sieras

320
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:20,160
and being surrounded by the mountains and the smells and the reservoirs and the

321
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:26,000
lakes um so the idea is not the same for sure and it's inspiring to be in those

322
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,400
places yeah but the task is to do those walks and discover how you could be

323
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:39,839
different and then and then and then bring that let that emerge as you walk through the city yes and the city can be

324
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:46,400
just as awesome yeah it can be amazing wow yeah there's so much Wonder here and

325
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:52,960
if you want a little help they now had here in R City there's now created a they're starting to put a path that goes

326
00:35:52,960 --> 00:36:01,000
like from the library almost I think it is uh under uh 101 out onto the the bay

327
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:07,400
the bay land there and that's a it goes along that Redwood City Creek they that they kind of revived that was kind of

328
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:14,040
covered over or abandoned or lost it's kind of fun to see the Old Creek that's still there so that's kind of I did the

329
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:20,839
other day and that was kind of cool to walk can see something new I've you know in redid City I've been here for 20

330
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:28,400
years and wow see that hello

331
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:35,640
um my question is uh not pertaining mainly to walking but it it's uh

332
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:42,000
something triggered based on what you said and uh so I do a lot of walking and

333
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,880
trying to be present is easier when you're outside and when you're moving so

334
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:54,839
when I'm trying to be present for me it means that I'm fully absorbed and aware

335
00:36:54,839 --> 00:37:01,000
I'm trying to be aware of what I'm thinking what I'm feeling and this is just a daily

336
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:07,880
practice now one day it so happened I was in the outdoors and I was by a beach

337
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:13,720
and I saw a little gopher come out of a hole okay and I just started playing

338
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:19,640
with it and giving it some little bits of whatever sand uh whatever was growing

339
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:26,760
on the sand and this game continued for I don't know how long but then at some point he got bored and just put a lot of

340
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:31,880
you know mud sand up in the hole and just blocked me

341
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:37,040
out but what I realized because when I

342
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:45,520
was playing with that gopher all I was aware of at that moment was this

343
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:53,599
amazing encounter and I was aware that I was aware and I was aware of the Sea and the

344
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:59,920
sand and the breeze but I all my friends everything else was just blocked out so

345
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:05,440
I'm wondering what was that quality of presence that I had at that moment

346
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:11,040
because I'm still going back to that to see was my noticing different was my

347
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,760
presence different and how can I bring that Wonder into my everyday life it's a

348
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:22,520
great question and I think one of I think hopefully good answers is um that

349
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:29,440
that uh points to something for you to look at is um you were not

350
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:37,119
distracted and uh and maybe even when you're walking in your in touch with your feelings and emotions and what's

351
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:43,920
going on for you there might be U still even there you're a little bit distracted by it you're a little bit

352
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:50,960
selecting you have priorities you have think this is important to notice and you're kind of zeroing in in a way that

353
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:57,680
is a little bit stressful or a little bit too choiceful but uh to be undistracted

354
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:03,520
and and and then absorbed in what you're doing without any stress it's almost

355
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:09,119
like a self forgetting and this this idea that you're aware that you're aware but maybe

356
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:15,400
the more you can almost forget yourself the clearer awareness of awareness

357
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:20,880
is sorry I didn't hear that would you just repeat the last B uh the the less

358
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:26,960
you're thinking about yourself the strong the the more uh clear can be the

359
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:34,520
sense of awareness aware of itself and uh and there's a lot of ways

360
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:39,560
in which many ways that seem so M second in nature that we are oriented around

361
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:45,280
the idea of me myself and mine and it's not necessarily wrong but it's a little

362
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:52,040
bit stressful and uh and it's wonderful to have a non-distracted state we're really

363
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:58,800
present but without the distraction of self and that's probably was so the go

364
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,960
for it was so fascinating that you know you know the fact that you hadn't done

365
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:10,359
your taxes was not important or something like

366
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:15,680
that yes please uh I'm a I love walking

367
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:22,640
um and I agree with you there's something special that happens in fact that I I try to walk every day at

368
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:27,960
lunch leave the office and my energy definitely shifts when I come back

369
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:34,960
and I'm also a lover of connection amongst us that gives me a lot of energy too and in my experience I have

370
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:40,119
found uh walking with a loved one is

371
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:45,200
magical to me and we open

372
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:51,839
up the the the the walls crumble and I do believe you know nature gives us that

373
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:57,760
energy and the experience of walking alone is wonderful I also have

374
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:03,720
found that the experience of walking with a loved one is just as powerful so

375
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:09,520
I don't think it's a necessarily a practice of solitude but it's a practice of

376
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:14,560
connection uh to yourself connection with the natural world and then

377
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:21,359
connection amongst us and it's wonderful topic today and it's wonderful wonderful and just to add a

378
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:27,319
third option is to is to walk in Silence with others and know we I've done these

379
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:33,520
the Buddhist pilgrimages where uh a group of us are walking together but walking in silence and it's been very

380
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:40,640
profound to share the walking and share each other and sense each other together on this uh you know this kind of a it's

381
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:48,160
a way of making every step sacred and then sharing that thank

382
00:41:50,839 --> 00:41:55,920
you I'd just like to give a short testimonial about um doing the walking

383
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:02,960
meditation on treat a lot of people I've noticed um take it as a time to go get a

384
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:09,160
cup of tea or take a nap and and I I do that sometimes but um I just love

385
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:15,800
walking meditation I really recommend you try it um um this is terrible but

386
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:22,280
sometimes I like walking meditation better than sitting meditation especially if your back is kind of

387
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:29,200
hurting it's it's it's it's fun so I just I just want to really recommend to

388
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:34,520
people that um that skip it and it's really great to go up and do walking

389
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:41,480
meditation during that 15 minutes when everybody else is standing in line for food um kind of sneak in another walking

390
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:47,079
meditation anyway I just really recommend it and um thank you yes one

391
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:54,880
one of the things I've done on Retreat um I love walking meditation on Retreat as well um it's a I'll I'll follow an

392
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,319
alternate schedule to everyone so when everyone's sitting I'm walking so then

393
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:07,020
I'm quietly by myself and then when they come to walk I go and sit sh don't tell

394
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:13,240
[Applause] anyone yeah and the opportunity of

395
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:18,559
walking meditation and Retreat is is uh that's a situation where you can really

396
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:27,000
get absorbed in it and there into the Simplicity of it and simple simple simple and um but sometimes to try to do

397
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,280
that that that level of concentration in everyday life that then is then

398
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:38,920
something is lost actually in everyday life um but uh I I mean Some people

399
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:44,000
prefer doing walking formal walking meditation like this uh at um as a daily

400
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:50,760
meditation instead of sitting meditation every day different different forms of meditation work for different people and

401
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:57,559
some people every day will walk for 30 40 minutes and that's what they that's their primary meditation practice

402
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:03,240
other people at sitting practice and some people it's both when I was in

403
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:10,200
Burma I was doing a lot of sit sitting meditation but my very Stern

404
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:17,280
strict meditation teacher in Burma he said Gil always do walking meditation before

405
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:22,839
you do sitting meditation it was kind of like it's okay you're sitting so long but you should

406
00:44:22,839 --> 00:44:28,440
always start with walking so for many years that's what I did I would do at least 10 minutes before before I would do sitting

407
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:33,760
meditation can I add one more thing sure okay so what you have to get over is

408
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:39,880
thinking you're being judged by the person by the person that's walking next to you the first thing is you think

409
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:47,839
you're being judged and if you're being judged that's their practice and your fear of being judged is your practice so

410
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:54,559
once you can drop that um then it you know it's it's just helpful fantastic

411
00:44:54,559 --> 00:45:01,359
yeah it's their practice and it's your practice ice and know to know what's your practice is to know where to

412
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:08,520
discover the sacred in every moment so thank you very much and uh yes

413
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:14,078
oh today is tea time so you can walk over

414
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:25,839
to good s uh great so uh maybe as a way of breaking the ice for some people who

415
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:32,160
are new Maybe just turn next to to to people next to you say hello and say your name and it can just be that simple

416
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:38,559
if someone has to go but it's nice to kind of break the eyes a little bit
