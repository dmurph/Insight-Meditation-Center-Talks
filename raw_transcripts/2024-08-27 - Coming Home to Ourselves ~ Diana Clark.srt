1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:08,120
so there's a number of different ways in which we can talk about this uh path of practice this movement towards greater

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:15,000
ease and freedom there's number of different ways in which we might like

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,359
characterize what it is we're doing here like you know why we even have a meditation practice to begin

4
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:29,599
with and one way we could talk about not the only way but one way is this idea of

5
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:35,079
like coming home to ourselves like coming

6
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:40,480
home the sense of oh yeah I'm at home

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,520
certainly this idea that maybe there's some ease when we're at home we're

8
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:55,440
thinking about home not literally but uh metaphorically this idea of not only

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,199
coming home but also implies that like we're not elsewhere and uh I'll talk

10
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,920
about in a little bit more what that means to be elsewhere but instead this

11
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:14,520
sense of when I think about what it's like to be at home I'm thinking about you know wearing comfy clothes and my

12
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:21,320
bare feet just wandering around maybe I'm uh like like looking

13
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:27,840
for my glasses I'm often taking my glasses off at home and I'm like where are my glasses so you know things aren't

14
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,600
necessarily like uh quite as in focus and I don't know there's a certain

15
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,880
amount of ease there what does that mean to come home

16
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,920
to a place where there's a certain amount of ease and this sense of there's

17
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,079
nowhere else to go like there's not this sense that we need to be anywhere else

18
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:56,439
that uh it's that's just where we are and we're happy to be

19
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,520
there or maybe there's this other way that we can think about coming home is

20
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,879
this idea of like we don't have to be anywhere

21
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:14,720
else I'm sorry we don't have to be anybody else I know uh when I was working in

22
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,000
Corporate America I wore very this was you know back uh some years ago but I

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,440
wore very kind of like formal clothing you know just kind of like buttoned up uh definitely more than I am

24
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,280
here now uh often wearing suits or you know something like this and uh I couldn't

25
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,920
wait to get home like just take all that off you know and uh for my first Meditation

26
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,080
Retreat which uh happened kind of like near well anyway I'll just say so here I

27
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:51,800
am working in Corporate America and I my first Meditation Retreat was was a 10day

28
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:59,360
retreat and uh I had forgotten what it's like to spend 10 days just in sweats and

29
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,680
t-shirt shirts it was it just quite something like wow so just this idea of

30
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:12,760
coming home the sense of like sense of ease uh a sense of and not

31
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:18,239
having to be anybody else I was partly I was dressing that way at work because I

32
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,480
wanted people I thought they would respect me or I don't know exactly what ideas I had but you know they had to

33
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:31,760
look the part or people see me in a particular way or you know something like that

34
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:40,640
maybe we would also say that uh coming home is that we can express ourselves in

35
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:49,000
a way that feels whatever is the easiest for us maybe that includes dancing around

36
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,519
singing in the shower singing in the Shower dancing around maybe dancing and singing whatever we're doing but just

37
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,640
this way that we can express what we want maybe there's a

38
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,879
way and we speak differently at home than we do when we're with others or in

39
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:13,159
our professional roles or if we have if we're have professional

40
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:19,479
roles but maybe there's something that's uh really important about this idea of

41
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:27,320
coming home and that is this idea of safety of feeling safe and again I want

42
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:34,639
to talk about this uh metaphorically cuz I want to acknowledge and recognize that for some people being literally being at

43
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:42,919
home isn't a safe place for them are they emotionally or physically this is a terrible awful thing that

44
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:49,600
happens but is there a way in which we can feel safe that we can feel like we

45
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,080
don't have to be guarded that we don't have to be bracing

46
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:01,280
ourselves because there's something that definitely happens with a meditation practice as the mind and the body start

47
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,479
to settle with meditation either during a particular sit or just as we do more

48
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,680
and more meditation we start to become more and more sensitive to the ways in

49
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:19,759
which we are bracing ourselves or not quite at

50
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:27,080
ease this way in which we don't feel safe we don't feel like uh we can

51
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:32,880
be completely like let go and feel content with what things

52
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:40,039
are and then what often happens is in a in an effort to feel more safe maybe we

53
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:45,199
adopt communication Styles or just our way of being in the world where we're

54
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,440
kind have this little bit of uh we don't want people keep people at a distance

55
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:56,720
I'm thinking that's going to help us feel safe and instead that just contributes

56
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:03,479
to a sense of isolation and loneliness and dissatisfaction with our

57
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:10,800
lives so coming home to ourselves is a way of maybe recognizing the way that we

58
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:17,639
are showing up in the world and saying is this is there a way

59
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:23,280
that uh I can meet myself as I

60
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:29,240
am at this moment is there a way that I can meet

61
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:35,319
whatever is arising and maybe not only just meet it but can we meet it with a certain amount

62
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:42,680
of open-heartedness can we meet it with a certain amount of

63
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:51,039
ease and this is where um safety often Lies We tend to think that it's uh

64
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:56,360
having to be tough or it's uh having to

65
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:02,000
be um like I said maybe like separate from people in some way but you know the

66
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,599
truth is of course that human beings are vulnerable and so many different ways so

67
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:16,960
many different ways emotionally and physically right but this idea of uh safety is

68
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,400
about more about can we meet whatever is arising instead of trying to get

69
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,120
everything out there you know to be perfectly organized and

70
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:34,400
nonthreatening there's this way in which you know we don't of course we don't control the our external environment

71
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,840
nearly as much as we think we

72
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:49,960
do so why is it that we are if we're not feeling at home if we're not feeling

73
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:56,919
connected why is that like why are we like leaving home so to speak feeling

74
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:04,440
disconnected and part of it is just this idea that

75
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:10,400
um we have difficulties in life maybe we don't feel safe maybe we have some fear

76
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,960
maybe we have some unfinished business of the heart as Jack cornfields expression we're having some emotional

77
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,440
turmoil we're having some difficulties maybe there's some real legitimate

78
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:29,000
difficulties happening in our life terrible diagnosis maybe we uh lost a

79
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,200
job that we really liked or maybe there's some uh difficulties in our

80
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:41,279
relationships whatever it might be what often happens is we have this sense of

81
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:47,480
like oh I have to go figure this out and often this go figure this out is a sense

82
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,560
of like going out there and getting

83
00:08:52,560 --> 00:09:01,920
something this so way in which we want to like I don't know read uh all

84
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:08,399
those books and not all of them but some of them in the bookstore remember bookstores that uh I still love

85
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,880
bookstores I'm one of those people that um that self-help section or you know

86
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,920
all those podcasts or you know go talk to this person that expertise or this

87
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:25,440
coach or that Mentor or something like this which is fantastic to do right we don't have to do everything alone but

88
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,959
there's also a mindset that can be about okay what whatever uh issue or

89
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:39,079
difficulty that I'm having I have to go out there somewhere to figure it out and

90
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:45,399
there's this way the figuring it out means that we're the going out there and figuring out is means we're all in our

91
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:52,680
head thinking thinking thinking thinking thinking thinking thinking trying to figure it out trying to solve it trying

92
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:58,079
to understand it better and there's this way that I just

93
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:03,880
um um kind of like imbue our thinking with this idea that it's going to solve

94
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:11,279
everything kind of like disconnects us from what we're actually

95
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,760
experiencing from the maybe there's some lonel for

96
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:24,959
example this uh which can feel like this heaviness sometimes like in the shoulders kind of like there's uh maybe

97
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:31,440
you know this uh not sitting up straight so much but can feel like this weight on

98
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,839
the shoulders or something part of the reason why

99
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:44,240
sometimes we don't feel safe is because we're feeling like um we have to hide parts of ourselves and we don't want

100
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,480
other people to see certain things about ourselves so there's a way in which uh

101
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:55,920
we try not to you know let anybody see some of the ways in which we feel

102
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:03,040
vulnerable but if we can just be with our

103
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:10,320
experience as best we can as best we can whatever it is we're

104
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,440
experiencing then there's a way that it feels like this connection with

105
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:21,440
ourselves this connection to come home so to speak and then we

106
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:29,440
don't uh feel so vulnerable it might be uncomfortable

107
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,839
feeling the loneliness for example the sadness the anger whatever it might

108
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,880
be might be exactly what we don't want to feel but there's this way in which

109
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:49,240
it's a sense of like arriving again instead of just being in our thoughts

110
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:55,120
because there's a way in which being in our thoughts is turns out to be a big uh

111
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:01,120
source of our not feeling like we're at home feeling disconnected from

112
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:08,839
ourselves feeling disconnected from others but this feeling of not being at home is so much about the thoughts that

113
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:15,279
we have about how we should appear or what we should be doing or oh the people

114
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:21,800
down the street are probably doing that so I have to do something to keep up with them or you know whatever these uh

115
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:27,320
stories that we have and to be sure these stories are

116
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:33,880
subtle it's not something that's obvious that we're saying to ourselves there's just this way in which

117
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:39,839
it's uh influencing the actions we do and

118
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:46,519
the it's influencing our actions or may like the way that we are speaking to

119
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:51,079
ourselves and the way that we're showing up in the

120
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:58,440
world so there's a way in which not only we might feel like we have to figure things out or maybe maybe it's even the

121
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:05,240
same but I'll use different words we just want to avoid we just simply want to feel comfortable so we're going to

122
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:11,920
avoid any of this discomfort and uh We've created this uh

123
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:18,040
society that has endless distractions have you

124
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:23,160
noticed it's amazing if you think about like media these days like all the stuff

125
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:29,519
that's available to just uh distract yourself endlessly if you want you can

126
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,600
do that and it's so easy sometimes I find myself uh want to look up a

127
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:42,720
particular YouTube video a particular talk I want to listen to and then before I know it I'm you know you know going

128
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,760
down looking all these little things like time ticks on and then I'm like oh

129
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:54,839
yeah so I've set a timer on my YouTube videos that there I guess my phone can do this it'll interrupt me and say are

130
00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:01,079
you sure you want to still be doing on this this turned out to be very helpful otherwise I'll watch K kitten videos all

131
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:08,120
day or something not that there's anything wrong with kitten videos of course I happen to be a fan of them but

132
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,880
it's not how I want to spend my life energy so watching them but there's this

133
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:20,279
way in which where we don't feel at home just because we have a we want to avoid the

134
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:26,959
uncomfortableness or we have this sense that there's like so many to do this

135
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:32,560
like that are oh well I have to do this and take care of that and email this person and do that there's this way it's

136
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:38,199
so you know we can just be always busy busy busy and our life just feels like

137
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:43,800
one to-do list after another or maybe just one to-do list one

138
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,000
just giant uh to-do

139
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:57,759
list so that's part of the reason why we might feel a little bit disconnected from ourselves and maybe also related to

140
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:03,560
this I'm kind of like giving a list list so that maybe you can recognize what are some of the patterns for

141
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:11,079
you but maybe there's a way also in which we have this like The Grass Is Always Greener idea like we have oh the

142
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:16,480
next you know best thing is it going to be out there and so we find ourselves

143
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,959
you know kind of like ignoring or dismissing like what's actually

144
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:27,440
happening in our lives right now meanwhile you know our lives are

145
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:33,519
passing Us by we might be thinking like well you know

146
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:40,319
I I'll get uh connected to myself maybe we have this sense that we need to

147
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:46,880
attain something or acquire something as soon as I've paid off the

148
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,560
house got this promotion my kids have left or my grandkids are at a different

149
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:58,639
place or you know whatever it might be educational goals career goals these

150
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:06,199
are you know great supportive things but there's also a way in which we can use

151
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:12,040
them I don't know if we're we are not doing this intentionally so much but you

152
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:17,319
know as as as a uh justification for not really being

153
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:23,880
connected to ourselves so then this whole idea of

154
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:30,240
coming home to ourselves in some ways it doesn't even sound attractive because it feels like oh but then I have to asso

155
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:38,759
all these other things that are important to me my goals or is my things with my relationships my

156
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:44,319
professional life pursuing always feeling more and

157
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:53,639
more comfortable or entertained but there's a way in which

158
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:58,800
we can feel connected no matter what we're doing

159
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:06,640
and a lot of that if not most of it is about being connected to the felt sense

160
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,959
the physical body what does it feel like to be

161
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:20,640
sitting in a chair right now it doesn't take time just to let the

162
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,280
mind just like uh incline that direction and like oh yeah I can feel the pressure

163
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:33,360
of the chair the cushion against the body if you're using the back rest just feeling the pressure against the

164
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:39,200
back and there's a way in which if we can use some of these obvious

165
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,760
um indicators of the present moment that can help uh disrupt some of

166
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:50,840
the momentum away from the thinking mind here we go again I'm going to make

167
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:58,080
it maybe that's okay is that is the volume okay

168
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:07,120
we can disrupt the momentum of the thinking Mind by know connecting into

169
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:15,360
this bodily experience this is where the home is

170
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:21,919
actually we all know this our thoughts are always like in the p i shouldn't say always but are so often in the past or

171
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:27,880
in the future that's you know not our home so much the home is you know what's

172
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:35,919
being experienced and with this sense of ease and

173
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:42,280
safety but I also want to acknowledge that this whole notion that I'm talking

174
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:49,200
about like coming home can feel kind of like a let down

175
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:55,799
kind of feel disappointing like really maybe we started meditating

176
00:18:55,799 --> 00:19:01,120
thinking that we're going to have these astral projections I don't even know what those are

177
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,159
so we're going to have some you know wild experience or something like this

178
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:15,720
and maybe there's this way in which you kind of want to be dismissive of uh what this ordinary experiences of being at

179
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:24,120
home literally or metaphorically but the truth is our life

180
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:32,280
is filled with ordinary things it's filled with ordinary

181
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:41,120
things so why not be present for it and we can find a certain Delight in

182
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:48,799
it yesterday I asked a friend to uh help me with the change the cabin filter in

183
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:54,880
my car never never having done this it turned out to be so much fun I

184
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:02,520
was like so excited like wow and partly why I was doing this because I thought I had mice in my car turns out I did and

185
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:07,679
uh there's a little mouse uh Nest there on this cabin filter come to find out

186
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:13,799
this is a common thing and if you put it on YouTube there's all these things

187
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:20,559
people take out their cabin filter just like I did I don't know it just turned out to be like such a fun

188
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:27,080
delightful simple you know little chore but it's like wow look at this okay I

189
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:33,760
have to come up with you know some I'm going to work with here but it was you know like I don't know I got to

190
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:40,320
connect with my friend he felt very happy to be able to help me he wanted you know was an easy thing for him

191
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,600
and so why not take Delight in some of these simple

192
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:54,159
things part of the reason is because um maybe we are afraid of if we have like

193
00:20:54,159 --> 00:21:02,159
let down our the bracing or let down the guard or something like that that it'll be

194
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:10,200
uncomfortable it will be uncomfortable it will be there's no

195
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:17,760
avoiding it and that Buddha talked about this right he used this word Dua there is

196
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:24,640
Dua somehow when we hear this word we think like yeah that's talking about the big existential unst or really big

197
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,120
things but uh I like to think about it there's just this comfortableness

198
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:35,559
and I've discovered that I have so much more capacity than I thought I did to be

199
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:43,600
with discomfort and when I'm uh in the role of like a retreat teacher

200
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:49,520
and I'm meeting people who are on a Retreats and encouraging them to meet

201
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:55,320
some of their difficulties I see them I watch them discover how they have so

202
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:01,039
much more capacity to be with their ulties to be with their uncomforta to be

203
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:07,440
with their uncomfortableness much more than they imagined or

204
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:14,400
knew so there's there is this way in which we are often like running away but

205
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:22,159
we don't really need to there this way in which we might

206
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:28,640
think that all the answers and what we're looking for is somewhere out there and I'm doing this gesture with my my

207
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:35,720
hand out there and I'm uh saying this word out there but another way could just be we

208
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:41,000
have this idea that it's all in here it's all the mind that has this idea it's going to be out there and that's

209
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,279
really the experience of out there and you know how many thoughts do

210
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:52,000
we have a day countless they're just

211
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,919
thoughts it's going to be better out there if I worry enough it's going to be better if I avoid this it's and then be

212
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:03,639
better those are just thoughts those are just

213
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:11,480
thoughts but if we're actually home with this

214
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,919
experience turns out that there's this richness and this depth and not only

215
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:23,200
that there's a um a sense of being

216
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:30,240
grounded and a sense of okay I I I can see a way forward from

217
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,480
here whereas you know just thoughts lead to more thoughts lead to more thoughts lead to more thoughts and you can spend

218
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:41,559
your whole life doing nothing but chasing thoughts thoughts chasing thoughts but there's a way in which

219
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:49,200
we're when we're here there can be a start a sense of oh okay I'm a little bit grounded I can see how I'm going

220
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,159
this direction is not going to be so helpful but going this other direction I

221
00:23:55,159 --> 00:24:02,679
think is going to be more helpful I'm using that word I think we have a sense what going to

222
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:08,520
be more helpful so it's and there's this way in which we

223
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:15,000
can meet our experience with warmth and care and often this warmth and Care is

224
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,360
coming from our embodied experience not from thinking thinking

225
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:27,200
thinking don't don't get me wrong thinking is important we need to do it it helps solve so many problems I'm a

226
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,880
big fan of thinking and if we have the notion that that's

227
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,159
the only way to solve things is we have to like non-stop thinking

228
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:45,880
then then our life is filled with this with this notion that okay just in

229
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:54,440
the next moment I I'll figure it out so the invitation is to come home to

230
00:24:54,440 --> 00:25:00,200
ourselves so this kind of this coming home to ourselves in some ways this

231
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:07,919
meditation Pro meditation practice is a support for this process I would say it's a process I

232
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:14,559
know for me it certainly was a process of like orienting towards

233
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:23,000
ourselves but not only that to orient with some warmth and care and

234
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:30,720
compassion can we meet our experience with a

235
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:38,440
invitation sense of welcoming sometimes I talk about this

236
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:45,080
you know have our our experience as uh we see something that's uncomfortable not what we want can we do it in such a

237
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:50,559
way that we there's this gesture of opening up like come on in you can join

238
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:57,360
the party the party being whatever the experience is because what we start to notice with meditation practice is how

239
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:03,840
much we are pushing away pushing away pushing away I don't want this I don't want this I want that other thing over

240
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:10,080
there I don't want all these things and our life energy is often

241
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:15,679
spent with this pushing away saying

242
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:22,200
no saying no to things that are already there being experienced in some ways

243
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:28,720
that's like denying reality to be clear I'm not saying that

244
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:36,120
we should say yes to everything we do need to say no to some things we need to have boundaries and to say

245
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:44,399
no but this coming home to ourselves this like orienting towards ourself with

246
00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:50,840
a with warmth and care you know bringing some of the heart into it softening the

247
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:58,799
sense of no and so I was pointing to

248
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:04,480
like the bodily experience you're feeling the pressure against the body but there's a way we can also do this

249
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:11,320
with any of the senses and like a what's being heard just orienting towards that

250
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:20,080
what are the sounds or the visual

251
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:26,360
field just seeing without having to figure things out or make them different

252
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:33,799
in any kind of way just a very relax seeing without necessarily looking but

253
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:40,360
just seeing hearing not necessarily without listening I'm sorry

254
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,880
yeah as a way to come home to ourselves and then as soon as we do that then the

255
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:56,639
mind and the heart have a place to rest and something different can unfold

256
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:04,440
maybe some new ideas maybe there's just a a sense of

257
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:11,600
catching one's breath so to speak a sense of more ease and that is part of

258
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:19,399
the coming home so this connecting with ourselves

259
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:26,760
in this warmhearted way it's not the it's not the same as

260
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:34,120
um like judging ourselves and saying okay everything's

261
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:39,840
good it's about just being with what is putting aside the whole judging we're

262
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:46,600
just putting aside that whole thing of good and bad and instead is there a way

263
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:53,200
that we can meet uh our experience and more with a sense

264
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,960
of yeah I'm having difficulties right now

265
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,679
what what can I what can I do here how can I respond to my difficulties with

266
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:10,518
kindness how can I respond to my difficulties with

267
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:24,159
care is there this way that we can come home to ourselves is in some

268
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:30,120
ways the same as welcoming ourselves all aspects of ourselves

269
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:35,440
sometimes there's these aspects that we're secretly trying to

270
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:42,000
disown but can we welcome all aspects of

271
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:49,559
ourselves there's this way in which this meditation practice really supports

272
00:29:50,840 --> 00:30:00,039
this when we often have so much pressure to prove ourselves in some kind of way

273
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:06,760
some people even feel like they have to like prove they're they're even worthy you know to exist to be

274
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:14,240
here we have to prove ourselves that we are not suffering that we're capable or

275
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:20,279
we have to prove that you know I got it together I'll I'll get it done whatever needs to be

276
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:26,440
done or something like that there's a way in which meditation

277
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:32,000
practice when we just just sitting we don't have to prove anything to anybody

278
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,360
but just to sit simply with no one to impress including

279
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:47,440
ourselves this meditation practice allows that kind of like this movement towards

280
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:55,360
connecting to ourselves with this openhearted warmth and

281
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:01,720
care and to be open to whatever is

282
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:11,039
arising so this idea of coming home to ourselves is a way of

283
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:17,600
connecting with I would say the senses with the body with hearing and

284
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:25,519
seeing recognizing how so often we are separated from our thoughts sorry that

285
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:30,799
we are lost in our thoughts separated from our

286
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:39,559
experience and then just reorient to the senses as a way to come home to

287
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:51,600
ourselves maybe I'll stop there and uh open it up for some comments or

288
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:57,000
questions yes can we it's back here

289
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:11,960
I wonder it seems like some people in the world their outer circumstances are

290
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:17,159
so harsh how could they come home I mean like I read I just read this story about

291
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:22,960
a young girl in the Middle East she was raped and then the man married her so he

292
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:29,799
didn't get charged with the crime and she committed suicide and it broke my heart but I'm wondering it's like some

293
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:37,679
people were blessed with a middle class life in the Bay Area where some people their outer life is so hard how can they

294
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:43,080
come home so I yesterday the other day I

295
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:49,399
listened to a podcast about a person who is s s present sentence for life I don't

296
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:55,799
know what crime he committed and uh he told the story about

297
00:32:55,799 --> 00:33:01,360
uh how uh he had been a very violent person and in prison the first 20 years

298
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:08,159
he was in prison it was a very violent life and then um he was able to

299
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:17,559
participate I guess this is at Fulon prison in this thing it's called a circling where people meet in this case

300
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:24,880
men in prison and they start talking about the truth of what's really happening with

301
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:31,120
themselves and he talked about it took another 20 years maybe no it wasn't 20

302
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:38,919
years I don't know how many years actually but it took a number of years completely transformed his life

303
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:46,799
the way that he understood himself and all the way that all the abuse that he had had as growing up is why he ended up

304
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:52,320
having a life of crime and he ended up um being uh

305
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:59,200
released from prison because they had noticed what a what a different person he had become so I don't know if

306
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:07,000
everybody can do this I want to think so but he talked about uh that uh it was he

307
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:13,440
it was the courage to meet what was inside of him and not only that the

308
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:21,440
courage to meet what is inside of others I felt really touched by this

309
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:27,720
this idea and so he talked about that he um if you were to look at him he he do

310
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:34,520
doesn't look like he comes from a middle class he doesn't look like those of us in this room I would

311
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:40,398
say and he said um if you were to look at me you wouldn't think that um I'm

312
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:46,480
necessarily the uh safest person but he said but I am the safest person anybody

313
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:53,000
will ever be with because I have no fear to be vulnerable I have no fear to be

314
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,520
with other people's vulnerabilities and empathy and whatever they might have

315
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:05,280
I don't know I just feel really touched by this so what you described is just awful right it's just like

316
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,200
sickening but I think that we underestimate

317
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:20,200
the I want to believe that we underestimate the power of the heart the power of transformation that's

318
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,920
available I want to believe

319
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:32,640
that thank you for asking though I mean these stories really they're they're heartbreaking they're really

320
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,640
heartbreaking

321
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:49,040
yeah anybody else have uh something they'd like to

322
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:57,240
say I like that feeling of coming home do you want to use the microphone here oh that's it you like the feeling of

323
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:03,640
coming home yeah yeah yeah thank you they may be up

324
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:14,240
here yeah thanks for the talk tonight um I appreciated it and um especially so

325
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:20,640
the idea of coming home and it's really just a comment I think what I'm taking away from it and what I want to do going

326
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:26,000
forward is catch myself whenever there's the

327
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,880
senses I find myself doing this is there's also thoughts associated with them very hard to just sit there you

328
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,760
know feel things or hear things and not have thoughts and so what I want to do

329
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:47,839
and I don't know if this makes sense but try and just not have the thoughts while the senses are happening so yeah I you

330
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:53,000
know I would uh I would look at it a little bit differently this idea of not

331
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,839
wanting to have thoughts that's a really high bar instead why don't we just let

332
00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:07,359
them be in the background thoughts doing what thoughts do and just uh be more tuned into sensitive to experiencing the

333
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:13,160
senses and let the thoughts just do what they're going to do because they have a lot of momentum behind them and we have

334
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:19,839
a LIF time of fueling them and thinking this is the way forward so instead just

335
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:25,440
to like just pay attention to the visual field or hearing and this and there's a

336
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,920
way in which the thoughts they start to just just lose some of their Authority they'll just naturally start to lose

337
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:36,400
some of the momentum if we just aren't highlighting them or giving them

338
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:42,359
as much attention because if we're trying to get them to go away there's this way of like oh go away thoughts I

339
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:48,520
want them to go away and then we're all tangled up in the thoughts and then we're thinking that we're thinking I

340
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:55,359
wanted to get rid of thoughts and then that's a thought again and then that's gets complicated so I I just to offer

341
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:59,359
this yeah

342
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:06,119
yeah does anybody else have a a

343
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:17,119
comment how about to up in the Peggy up in the corner up

344
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:27,520
there um this idea of the friendly meeting ourselves and what is

345
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:35,200
with friendliness when um when difficult things come up and I I think of that and

346
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:42,440
it's but I'm so reactive and it's going like round and around okay what does this mean to be friendly and

347
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:48,160
um yeah so I I don't know if you could say anything about that you know I try

348
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:53,880
to think how I would meet a friend and um you know it's just like oh but um it

349
00:38:53,880 --> 00:39:00,240
you know it lasts a while so it's it's tricky for me yeah do what

350
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:06,760
lasts a while the the my reactivity I guess I see yeah I see so I would say

351
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:13,040
actually being with the body or like feeling your feet on the ground is a great way to kind of like dis disrupt

352
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:20,800
the momentum but what will happen it'll be like thoughts feet thoughts feet thoughts feet thoughts feet thoughts

353
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:27,520
feet feet feet thoughts feet feet feet so it it's not like something that is

354
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:33,880
going to go but it does it act it can really disrupt the momentum of them if

355
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:39,480
you can remember the thing I forgot to say is a

356
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:45,440
lot of times there's someone in front of me I see like that I need to kind of I

357
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:51,760
would say that's even more so the reason to be tuned into one's feet to like I'm saying feet but like feeling your feet

358
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:58,240
on the ground so that you're grounded because often what happens is when we get triggered then we're

359
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:04,040
thinking about other things or what am I going to say or I hope they think this about me or don't think that about me

360
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:12,400
and the last time I spoke with this person and we're not really uh maybe meeting them in a way that

361
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,720
uh that they are feel like they're being felt or actually maybe I should ask you

362
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:24,319
is it uncomfortable for you because this is somebody who is saying harsh things to you or is it just yes or perhaps

363
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:30,960
they've stopped but I'm still in a position where I some sort of response is

364
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:39,760
required yeah or I guess I could run away walk away I don't know um you could

365
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,760
say I I I'm not quite sure what to do with

366
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,440
that I appreciate the honesty right cuz that's the truth and then you there's a

367
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:56,319
way of like okay you're coming home to yourself this that's the truth of the moment I'm not sure what to do with that

368
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:02,599
or wow that that was that was that was a lot that's a good way to put it yeah cuz

369
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:09,520
sometimes I'm not even sure if it's harsh it might be like a trigger for me so yeah or you could say wow I I I I'm

370
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:16,480
feeling a little unsettled now I'm feeling triggered just a simple sentence like

371
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:22,640
this you know kind of the honesty of the moment and then that's a great one yeah thank you

372
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:27,960
you're you're welcome Peggy and then I think this person right here that's I'm on the step

373
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:33,839
yeah well just real quick coming back to the home

374
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:41,440
um I guess in my case having a toddler and parenting and the whole

375
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:47,560
jumping up everything day is different Discovery but then we had this pause uh

376
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:53,119
my wife and I decided kids's going to be with the grandparents and we're going to have

377
00:41:53,119 --> 00:42:00,359
three days where it'll be just the two of us and all these thoughts are going in our heads for like couple weeks say

378
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:06,400
oh we'll go out for a date or we'll go to a movie or we'll do all these other things and yet when it came to the time

379
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:15,000
it was to be home to make some tea to be in the space to

380
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:21,559
think about very little things or just the things that grounded us yeah and the few

381
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:27,319
simple things that we might take care of that gave us

382
00:42:27,319 --> 00:42:32,599
that might have negative energy we wanted to take care of or some positive

383
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:38,240
energy things that might and I don't want to go into L specifics of that but

384
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:44,480
we sort of naturally came to that place because all the busyness all the

385
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:52,520
thoughts all those things we know will come again yeah they will be there and they'll be all those surprises

386
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:58,000
and all the joy and Discovery and the suffering um they will still be there

387
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,319
but uh we recognized that that was the place to be and that seeking for

388
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:10,800
everywhere else you wasn't there for us yes I've

389
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:16,880
had a similar experience not with a toddler but this idea of like you know what it just feels good just to sit here

390
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:25,480
and uh read this or something yeah thank you thank you okay so it's uh 8:30 so thank you

391
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:32,440
for your attention and I wish you a wonderful rest of the evening thank you
