1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:14,960
so good day greetings and uh happy sitting here seeing the greetings

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:23,760
on the chat and the names and so thank you all and

3
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:32,640
so the topic is still samadhi and uh

4
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:40,000
i like to sometimes translate this word as to be composed and that's a wonderful i think concept

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,360
that brings together some of the qualities of somebody of

6
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:52,800
landing on some place being established being calm and

7
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:59,359
centered being steady with the experience that we're focusing

8
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:06,000
on if um we go i've gone into the wilderness like up in the mountains

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,360
where there was no trails but there were cairns there were these little piles of stones that people had

10
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,960
built that indicated where more or less where the direction was to walk

11
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:24,479
and so we would hike along and we would look for the cairns and and then we'd find our way

12
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,000
but if uh we hadn't looked you know if i hadn't known about karen's and also just was fascinated by

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,600
everything up there and and um and was looking at everything equally i

14
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:42,240
wouldn't have found uh you know the way forward if i was if i was really scared about running

15
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,920
into trolls up in the high sierras in california and was constantly looking out for

16
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:54,000
trolls i also wouldn't have found my way because i wouldn't have seen the cairns if not even if i knew there

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,960
to look for them but if we know to look for karen's then we know how to find the way so the same

18
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,640
thing with meditation we can be afraid of trolls and spend our time looking for trolls

19
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:13,760
we can be searching for long lost treasures in

20
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,080
the world lottery tickets and we don't really pay attention to what's really here

21
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,640
and but there are karen's there are these markers these uh signposts that for samadhi it's

22
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:33,519
helpful to recognize them and in recognizing them that's how we find our way

23
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:40,640
and um and there's many signposts but i would like to emphasize two of them

24
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:48,640
now one is um a uh to be steady a certain kind of steady

25
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:56,000
composure with the experience and if when we're steady when we hold ourselves steady when the the gaze

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,319
is steady when the when the our composure is steady when our attention is steady

27
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:10,000
or that part of our attention is steady so we're looking for that part of our attention that

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:19,519
is steady or can be steady and we're steadying ourselves in that the other is um a quietude

29
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:28,000
a tranquility maybe it's a a serenity and and

30
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,560
even if we're agitated we might be able to just pick out the corners of the mind

31
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:41,440
the heart the body where there is some tranquility uh some quietude

32
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,480
and uh and then to include that to kind of orient ourselves oh this is the place

33
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,799
this is the way forward here in this part and um and but if we don't recognize that

34
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,720
quietude that tranquility then we don't uh we know we don't see the signposts

35
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:05,200
and the third is um to um so composure quietude tranquilly

36
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,640
and third is non-destructibility a kind of a non-dispersal of the mind

37
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:19,359
non-distractedness of the mind and even if we're you know 99 distracted we might kind of pick up

38
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,479
uh the signpost of that way in which the mind is not distracted

39
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:30,080
is not dispersed not spinning out centrifugal force are kind of just scattered and all kinds of thoughts and

40
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:36,080
ideas and as the as samadhi begins becoming stronger there's a stronger and stronger feeling

41
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,360
of the mind not being dispersed not being scattered not jumping around not being

42
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,800
fragmented the mind starts feeling composed quiet

43
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,400
centered um and it is just a feeling like the mind is really here now it's

44
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:59,680
not just non-distracted or non-dispersed kind of feeling and

45
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,000
and and so

46
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:13,600
so these are three signposts that we can follow so to take an upright

47
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:20,160
meditation posture and if you're lying down then upright means

48
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:30,479
laying with a certain dignity and vitality or openness some way that

49
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,160
maybe expresses

50
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,720
an integrity or a wholeness or confidence in being here

51
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,240
and gently closing your eyes

52
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,440
and being a little bit delightfully serious at the beginning of the meditation

53
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:04,400
to prepare yourself to so that you can really be here and the sacredness of the present

54
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:11,680
moment so you're preparing yourself and so you take a few long slow deep

55
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:18,240
breaths and the deep inhale is a

56
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:25,199
for affirmation that indeed you are here that you've

57
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:33,039
showed up here i am i'm showing up for this deep breath filling the torso with

58
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:40,319
not just air but with sensations and expansion and maybe even

59
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,720
confidence here i am

60
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:55,360
and then to exhale long gentle exhale letting all of that go

61
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:03,840
letting go of it tension and holding and

62
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:18,000
and then letting your breathing return to normal and we prepare the mind and the heart by

63
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,720
relaxing the body all these are very closely connected

64
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,840
so relaxing the muscles of the face

65
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:45,840
around the eyes the jaw

66
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:52,240
and to soften and release the shoulders

67
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:59,840
the area around the shoulder blades perhaps

68
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:10,319
perhaps the outer edge of your shoulders as the shoulders turn around to go down the arm

69
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:17,759
the very top of the upper arms

70
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:27,840
perhaps relaxing the chest softening in the chest

71
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:42,560
and then relaxing the belly in such a way the belly the weight of the belly

72
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,800
gets lower

73
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:55,839
settles into a foundation the lower torso

74
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:31,279
and then with your attention your mind

75
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:39,279
gently placing it on your breathing wherever you're going

76
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:47,120
to be primarily focusing on breathing imagine that attention is gently

77
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,839
placed on that area

78
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,839
but clearly kind of settling into your breathing

79
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:09,279
again affirmation that here is where you're going to walk here's where you're going to be

80
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,839
present

81
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:30,959
if you can make some small adjustments in your breathing to make it more comfortable

82
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,560
relaxing some part of the musculature breathing

83
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:47,839
breathing a little slower a little faster a little deeper or shallower

84
00:10:49,120 --> 00:11:00,240
whatever makes it comfortable for you

85
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,279
and adjusting how you are with your attention

86
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:15,839
is there some way that your attention can be less forceful or strained

87
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:22,640
less up in the control tower trying to stare at the breathing

88
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:30,399
and more that the attention the awareness is within the breathing itself

89
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:43,839
in the sensations of breathing

90
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,880
and then noticing whatever's quietude or tranquility there might be

91
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:03,759
here even if it's in the cracks between any agitation

92
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:11,839
or in the side or deeper inside

93
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,519
that's right letting them thinking mind become quieter

94
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,920
slower maybe the thinking mind can even be more

95
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:31,440
gentle so it's easier to notice the quietude

96
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,399
the tranquility

97
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,839
that

98
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:49,279
and let that tranquility be part of the atmosphere within which

99
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,839
you're mindful of your breathing

100
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,760
and notice whatever degree of

101
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,760
stability or steadiness

102
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,120
you can establish with your breathing

103
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:35,839
whatever steadiness on breathing that's here for you

104
00:13:52,480 --> 00:14:01,199
and then also notice any way that you are non-distracted

105
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:06,399
the mind is not scattering out into all kinds of thoughts

106
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:13,760
and even if you are doing that look for the signposts look for that part of you which is not

107
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:22,160
that way that's capable of being undistracted

108
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:31,839
with your breathing

109
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,519
relaxed calm

110
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:50,720
steady undistracted

111
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,120
these are the signposts

112
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,000
that point you to samadhi to staying present

113
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:08,959
to being intimate with the experience of breathing

114
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,839
one breath at a time

115
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:18,559
when you notice yourself thinking a lot look for the quiet and tranquility here

116
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,960
let that tranquility of mind spread

117
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:32,480
open up further so it's easier to stay with your

118
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,840
breathing

119
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,840
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

120
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:44,159
you could begin by remembering that we're still meditating

121
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:55,200
there's nothing you have to say to anyone or do for anyone for this few next two minutes

122
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:05,278
there's no responsibility and obligation to to do anything but sit here quietly

123
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:12,159
and in the privacy of just sitting here with nothing you have to do

124
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:19,360
can you somehow let the your heart open

125
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,120
your kindness open

126
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:32,320
to think of people around you and here on this youtube

127
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:38,399
sitting together or in your homes or communities places of

128
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:45,520
work think of them with

129
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:51,840
goodwill a very private goodwill

130
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:58,720
they don't have to know about it you don't have to do anything

131
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:04,880
just opening your kindness goodwill

132
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:13,840
in a sense

133
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,000
being aware of these people around you

134
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:27,840
within the quietude the tranquility that might be here

135
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:41,679
and without needing to bring them into your bring too close to you just there

136
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:50,480
in the privacy of your own heart perhaps you can feel or sense or extend

137
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,840
the sentiments of these words

138
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,840
may you be happy

139
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,840
may you be safe

140
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,480
may you be peaceful

141
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:25,840
may you be free

142
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:40,000
and if in the safety and privacy of meditation

143
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:47,039
in your own heart if it's possible easier than to have

144
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:51,840
good will for others

145
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:58,480
stay close to that maybe you don't have to confuse it with

146
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,760
what you actually do

147
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,880
or feel obligated to do stay close to that place where it's private

148
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:16,480
maybe even secret trusting

149
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:26,240
that having good will for others will some way or other spread from you

150
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,840
with benefits for the world

151
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,960
may whatever benefits that come from this practice this morning

152
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:44,320
spread from us like the scent of a rose spreads out

153
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:51,518
into the garden so may this benefits that we've had today

154
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:59,760
laughed out into the world for the welfare and happiness of all beings everywhere may all

155
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:15,840
beings be happy

156
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,840
um

157
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:26,159
so some people are fond of reading books

158
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:32,799
about buddhism and if they want to learn about meditation they might go find a book

159
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:39,840
or maybe nowadays some people go find audio recording

160
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:47,600
for the book people the book we're trying to read is

161
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,799
found within ourselves we're learning to read

162
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:59,600
ourselves read the signposts the symptoms the movements the

163
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:06,559
process of meditation that unfolds within us that's the book to read or that's the

164
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:12,800
audio recording to listen to really listen deeply into what's happening here

165
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:19,118
and sooner or later all that we are to discover in buddhism

166
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:24,800
is meant to be discovered here in our own body in our own experience

167
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:30,240
so to learn to read the signposts to read the to you know to leave to read what's

168
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:38,638
happening is part of the skill uh for samadhi for developing concentration

169
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:44,398
they uh the stability this composure this unification of mind

170
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:50,720
there are signposts and the pali word for signposts

171
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:58,079
usually translated into english as signs is nimita n-i-m-i-t-a

172
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:03,839
and it's um it's used in a very different way different ways down through the history

173
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:09,280
of buddhism it has different meanings what this is sometimes it's reduced in

174
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:15,280
meaning to being a visual image that some people will see when their

175
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:21,520
concentration gets strong maybe they're seeing a light maybe a white light or yellow light this this

176
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:27,839
it kind of lights up as they get concentrated and so the the image is called the nimita but in the

177
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:34,240
early buddhist tradition and nimitz any kind of sign or indicator of the presence of

178
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:41,680
something or that something is about to happen and and so the the buddha said that the

179
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:46,800
nourishment for samadhi what feeds and supports somebody

180
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:54,240
is is two of these two of these signposts that we can find and

181
00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:03,560
we can read we can recognize in ourselves and one of them is this word samata

182
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:08,640
s-a-m-a-t-h-a and which means tranquility or calm or

183
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,680
quietude and the other is a word that means

184
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,760
something like non-dispersal or non-fragmentation or

185
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:24,560
non-um agitation of our thinking mind and so

186
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:31,359
as part of this unification process this gathering together being centered here we're not being

187
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:38,240
de-centered by spinning out and and

188
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:45,160
i think the pali word that's translated as non-dispersal could maybe uh be read as a

189
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:50,640
non-de-centered uh as a as a um

190
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:56,960
you know so and so so these these are nimitz so as as we start getting

191
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:03,680
concentrated as we start getting settled and start a steadiness of mind then um

192
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:08,720
to recognize these signposts to recognize that there is a quietude or a

193
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:17,040
tranquility or serenity however we want to translate this word samata and and to recognize we're

194
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:23,280
starting to be non-de-centered we're starting to be not scattered or dispersed in our minds and

195
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,640
the mind's not jumping around and chasing every thought that comes along and we're wandering off for minutes at a

196
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:34,640
time in our fantasies or our thoughts but there's a real feeling now of being

197
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:40,640
gathered in being non-dispersed being here and uh that doesn't have to neither one

198
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:46,640
of these have to be very strong at first and this is where learning to reckon

199
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,760
know that these are signposts they're kind of pointing the way so

200
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:59,920
there might be a lot of agitation there might be a lot of dispersal of the mind but if we keep focusing on those we

201
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:06,320
it's too easy to reinforce those and the nourishment for samadhi is to

202
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:14,240
take in to allow our son to experience to experience or to be supported by tranquility and

203
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:21,119
non-dispersal of the mind this centeredness of the mind and um

204
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:28,160
and so this um and so even if there's a lot of agitation uh to recognize maybe in the cracks of

205
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:35,200
it behind it in the back room of it in the attic and the basement somewhere inside to recognize oh there's

206
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:43,200
a little bit there yes i'm agitated but in fact a little bit in my sternum there's a

207
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:48,560
little feeling of tranquility there a little bit in my hands my hands feel

208
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:56,560
steady and confident and a little bit calm tranquil and so to find where it

209
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:03,040
might be don't manufacture it and don't worry too much if you can't find it

210
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:08,160
we're talking about now as meditation deepens and deepens

211
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:14,720
not just from you know just sitting down and boom there you have to be able to do this but as you begin feeling yourself

212
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:20,400
settling and feeling yourself getting more and more here and calmer than you were before

213
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:27,119
um that's when you start feeling that's where the to appreciate to affirm

214
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:33,920
to validate these signs these signposts this is good this is the path forward

215
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,960
this is the direction to go this is the now i'm now i've picked up the book

216
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:45,280
where the chapter where i left it this is where where you know now i'm picking up again where

217
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:53,520
you know the place where my practice is really deepening and and so to recognize these

218
00:39:53,520 --> 00:40:00,079
um um uh you know these these signposts so i

219
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:08,960
see there's a for the other uh nimita there's two nibitas in pali what is samata and the other one is

220
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:17,680
a v y a g g a and aga could mean like center and

221
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:24,400
uh and the vui is divided or separated and a means not

222
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:32,560
not separated from the center so this idea being centered

223
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:39,520
so there are other signposts for samadhi there's a lot of them and so over time you might learn these

224
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:46,400
different ones that that can support us oh this is good now that

225
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:52,480
we're in the territory this is the direction forward because to recognize it not so much to

226
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:58,560
be a not at all to be attached to it or try to engineer and work too hard to get concentrated

227
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:05,520
but simply to uh not for the mind to begin recognizing that

228
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:12,319
this is the way forward this is the path in the forest as opposed to being distracted by every

229
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:18,400
little troll and bird and insect and butterfly off into the forest and we go chasing

230
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:26,720
after it and we lose the trail so to gather ourselves together

231
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:33,520
to start feeling and recognizing these signposts so some of the other ones are as

232
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:40,240
some people feel the physical sensations that shift and change that show they're getting concentrated there can be tingling feeling of

233
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:46,079
lightness a feeling of warmth the glow the feeling there might be

234
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:53,359
some people there's a strong feeling of physical pleasure uh sometimes a little bit of pressure uh

235
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:59,200
vibration that begins happening someplace some sometimes in the forehead the people feel it there sometimes in

236
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:05,839
the chest sometimes the belly and sometimes parts of our body like the

237
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:14,240
arms start feeling so light and maybe even they seem to disappear because

238
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:23,040
things are so tranquil so peaceful there or other parts of the body the um there might be a

239
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:28,720
visual uh signpost like i said there might be uh the field of vision starts it might

240
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:34,319
get completely white or some other color sometimes there are

241
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:41,119
some people when they get concentrated will see little shapes in their field of vision sometimes geometrical shapes

242
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:47,280
and it's important not to get distracted by these things by the by the visual uh

243
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:54,720
images especially if there's like geometrical signs or shapes or something um but they are supportive and so to

244
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:00,560
take them kind of like in the background of your experience oh i'm on track i'm getting this is this

245
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:07,280
this is a signpost that i'm getting concentrated that i'm deepening here and um

246
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:15,280
and uh is is and then there are um what could be

247
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:20,960
considered may be more mental uh signposts or emotional signposts

248
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:26,079
a common one is joy and feeling a joy welling up

249
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:32,000
a delight the kind of pleasure sometimes it's even a sense of rapture when the samadhi gets strong but there's

250
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:40,079
a feeling of delight of gladness of relief that might be there and sometimes it's a deep sense of

251
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:45,200
happiness something is more sublime more subtle more more of a sense of contentment a

252
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:50,560
deep contentment in the quietude here and sometimes a sign of getting

253
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:56,800
concentrated is that the mindfulness gets clearer and clearer the awareness gets clearer and clearer

254
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:03,200
and there becomes more equanimity in that clear awareness which is equanimous we're less likely to be reactive to things

255
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:10,160
and feeling that equanimity feels so good and um so don't expect all these things

256
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:16,160
to happen at once um and maybe don't even memorize don't even try to memorize and look for all

257
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:23,359
the things i've said i've talked about the two things that buddha emphasized as nimitz was this

258
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:28,480
tranquility or calm quietude samata

259
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:34,640
or this non-de-centeredness the non-dispersal non-scatterness of the

260
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:40,319
mind the mind being composed and both of those are supported by the two

261
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:46,160
actions verbs that buddha used when he instructed us for what in english we

262
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:51,680
might say become concentrated he didn't use the english word concentrated because he

263
00:44:51,680 --> 00:45:00,640
didn't speak english he used two words one was the word to settle and the other is to steady

264
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:09,520
to settle on something and to steady oneself on something so the those four can be your signposts

265
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:18,000
settle settle the settling on the breathing or in your experience

266
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:25,040
a steadiness with your breathing a delightful warm

267
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:33,319
content quietude tranquility and and and in

268
00:45:33,319 --> 00:45:38,480
non-de-centeredness a feeling ah this is good to really be

269
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:44,319
here not scattered anymore and perhaps you can read the read at the

270
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:50,240
inner book read yourself and see if you can find

271
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:57,200
the you know that supports you and guides you and gives you kind of more something to

272
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:03,520
in a good sense of the term hold on to as you're developing concentration and and or be cheerleaders or support

273
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:08,560
from the side just stay there be there this is good this is keep opening to this keep opening to

274
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:14,480
this and if you're not ready for that or if you're not uh you know if it didn't it doesn't work

275
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:20,079
because you're trying too hard or you're not you know it's too much work just put it aside

276
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:27,599
um but sooner or later hopefully you begin begin recognizing your signposts for what it means when

277
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:34,079
the goodness of samadhi goodness of being settled and unified begins to come into play

278
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:40,880
and then to appreciate that to validate that to affirm that so the mind knows this is

279
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,920
what's important this is what's valuable thinking about trolls and

280
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:54,078
butterflies and all the other things are useful sometimes but not for the purpose of meditation

281
00:46:54,480 --> 00:47:03,359
so um thank you all very much and and we'll continue

282
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,800
tomorrow
