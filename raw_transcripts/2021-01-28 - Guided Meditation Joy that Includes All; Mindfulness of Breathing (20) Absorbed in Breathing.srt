1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:10,240
so good day and uh it's actually feel quite wonderful to be

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:18,560
here with you all and not only is there an opportunity to meditate and

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:25,840
talk about the dharma it's also remarkable to

4
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:37,280
feel the good will and the warmth and the gratitude that uh comes through the chat

5
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:44,079
and i'm sure represents many other people who don't participate in the chat and

6
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:50,800
for all of us to be sharing in this together quite remarkable and maybe it's

7
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,960
almost uh certainly adds to the richness of the meditation we do to feel like

8
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,840
we're doing it in such a friendly community so thank you very much

9
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:13,840
and um

10
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:22,960
when doing meditation it's really best not to try to be a perfectionist

11
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,640
any attempt at perfection probably goes in the opposite direction

12
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,960
it makes it harder we strain more and maybe it gets more brittle

13
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,079
and i think that the idea is to be at ease with how things are

14
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:46,079
not how we think they're supposed to be to be at ease with how things are not

15
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,399
with what we think they're supposed to be and to have that and then and to have

16
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:59,439
that ease not be perfect so that not looking for perfect ease and what

17
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,280
this means is that we're partly

18
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:11,520
learning to hold [Music]

19
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,640
ourselves be mindful of ourselves without it needing to be all one way but we have an ease with holding

20
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,800
things together that are maybe some good and some not so good some some pleasant

21
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,800
some not pleasant some uh you know what we think this what we is what's happening is what we think is

22
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:37,360
supposed to be happening what's happening is not what we think is happening all these things can co-exist so for

23
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,440
example um people associate meditation with a quiet mind not thinking so much or not

24
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,080
thinking at all and so people some people that are trying to have that no thinking state

25
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,840
i think it's better to be at ease with the mind that thinks and certainly it's nice to let go of thoughts and

26
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:04,159
quiet the mind and it's nice to come to a place where the mind is not thinking so much but even better is not to be disturbed

27
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:10,720
by your thoughts and to be at ease with them and in that way it's possible to let some

28
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,800
thinking just recede into the background and rather than being preoccupied by

29
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:24,159
with the idea of having no thoughts at all it's um it's uh we could just um

30
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:29,360
let some you know some thinking can just go on in the background and we can kind of know what we're thinking

31
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,400
or maybe not as long as in the foreground we're just staying with a breathing or

32
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:41,519
staying with our present moment experience and so those two can co-exist

33
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:48,319
and uh and so but when thinking comes into the foreground then we learn to practice with it but

34
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:54,080
even then the idea is to be at ease with it and the same with discomforts in the

35
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00,000
body some people have like a homing instinct

36
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
maybe because of fear to just kind of really tune into uncomfortable painful sensations the

37
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,080
body be worried concerned but you know and expecting they're supposed to be completely comfortable

38
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,680
all the time but also comfort and uncomfortability can co-exist

39
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:24,000
and sometimes it's just fine to have a certain level of pain discomfort also be kind of

40
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,120
in the background or just be part of the overall environment and not needing to zero in on it and

41
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,400
focus on it and that allows us to kind of open up and focus on

42
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:40,320
all this allows us to then gently focus on what is onward leading what is really supportive

43
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,479
of us to develop the meditation further it's supportive to focus on that part of our

44
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:51,600
experience where we're not thinking a lot where we're feeling and quietly calmly

45
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,120
feeling the experience letting the thoughts be in the background at some point in meditation

46
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,400
it's onward leading to to become aware of the pleasant

47
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:10,639
sensations that um they're not there because of some we're getting you know some wonderful ex

48
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:17,520
sensual experience but rather as we settle as we settle and feel more

49
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:24,320
content here more then then we feel kind of the meditative contentment

50
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,520
meditative comfort and pleasant pleasantness of the experience

51
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,639
and that is a useful thing to open to and in the background there might be

52
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,960
discomfort but if it can just be in the background don't worry about it too much and gently open to the

53
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,560
pleasant to the meditative pleasure joy contentment that might be there

54
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:53,680
or the feeling of rightness the feeling of this is good to be here so there's a wide

55
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:00,560
range of kind of pleasant enjoyable or right feelings that might come as we meditate

56
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,720
and to open to those and let them spread or i like the notion of just opening the body to them and

57
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,759
so they they fill us more or they expand more

58
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:20,080
so taking a meditation posture and gently closing your eyes

59
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:26,880
and and kind of settling into your posture

60
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:34,080
and here also we don't want perfection with the posture i like the expression just good enough

61
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,199
just good enough for you to be here and settle settling in

62
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:52,560
and then you can set yourself at ease

63
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,840
set yourself at ease in your body

64
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,160
and that can mean to be easy be easy with what's happening in your

65
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:15,280
body ease up a bit around the body

66
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:31,840
and then as you exhale settle and relax the body further

67
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:45,759
and then set yourself at ease in your heart in your emotional life

68
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:53,198
let yourself be easy with whatever feelings and emotions you might have

69
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,879
ease up on them a bit not to make them go away or make them different

70
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,520
but ease up be easy with it all

71
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:13,840
an easy relationship

72
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:22,000
and then set yourself at ease in your mind with the things you're thinking about or

73
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,599
concerned with see if you can let yourself be easy

74
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,440
with the activities of your mind

75
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:42,320
easing up the pressure easing up the heaviness the contraction

76
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:54,399
around the concerns

77
00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:02,640
and then as you exhale to relax your emotional

78
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:09,839
being relax and soften in your heart

79
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:23,839
as you exhale relax and soften in the thinking mind

80
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:32,640
maybe the notion that you're making lots of space for your thinking mind

81
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:51,839
so you start feeling the peacefulness or the calmness of the space around it

82
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:04,800
and then settling into your body and feeling your body

83
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:12,720
globally in whatever easy way there's

84
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,279
maybe a broad awareness maybe awareness that gently slowly

85
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:33,839
roams around the body to touch into things to be aware of the body

86
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,959
as you exhale softening the shoulders

87
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:52,000
as you exhale softening the belly

88
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:02,800
as you exhale settling in to your body your posture

89
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:15,839
your place here

90
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:26,320
and then to if it's possible if it's available

91
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:33,519
perhaps you can feel some modicum of contentment

92
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,920
or allow yourself yourself to feel some degree of contentment

93
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:47,440
to just be sitting here quietly peacefully

94
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:54,839
aware of whatever is here for you whether it's comfortable or

95
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:00,800
uncomfortable pleasant or unpleasant

96
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:10,480
it's very significant and valuable to be aware of how things are and to be

97
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,680
content with just this opportunity to be quiet enough

98
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,279
to be aware of it all pleasant and unpleasant

99
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:30,160
difficult and easy it's all okay just to be here aware

100
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:53,839
maybe letting go of perfection that things have to be just so

101
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,000
and then feeling your breathing more fully

102
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,000
being at ease with whatever way you're breathing

103
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:26,320
being easy with your breath even if it's labored or tight

104
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:34,079
be easy ease up

105
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:41,279
not needing the breathing to be perfect it's okay for it to be unpleasant

106
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,560
if you're feeling it

107
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,680
it's okay for it to be pleasant if you know it

108
00:13:54,399 --> 00:14:02,079
and maybe there's a little bit of both with breathing

109
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:08,560
as you go through the cycles of in-breath and out-breath some of the experiences of breathing a

110
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,639
little bit more pleasant some are a little more

111
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,839
unpleasant

112
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:30,079
offering yourself the gift of knowing just knowing how it is and just knowing

113
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:38,880
is enough as you go through the cycle of in and out expanding and contracting

114
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,839
inhaling and exhaling

115
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:13,839
settling in to breathing

116
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:28,240
and in the breathing itself as you exhale relax

117
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:41,759
and let go soften go with the releasing

118
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:49,600
like you would let go of at the top of a slide just like to slide down

119
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:56,320
let go with the exhale sliding down the

120
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,519
length of the exhale

121
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:09,839
let go

122
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:30,399
and then as you inhale receive the full inhale

123
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:37,839
allow your body space to breathe in

124
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:09,678
and then as you're breathing breathe with whatever is pleasant

125
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:15,679
letting the unpleasant be there but not focusing on it so much

126
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:25,600
any feelings of contentment or comfort or pleasure

127
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:33,039
delight or joy happiness or well-being

128
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:42,399
maybe a subtle glow or a subtle warmth or a brightness

129
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,840
tingling or vibration

130
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:58,000
or maybe a pleasant energy that seems to come along with breathing through the

131
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,840
body

132
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:14,240
sliding down the exhale allowing for the inhale

133
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,960
sliding down what is pleasant

134
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:29,840
allowing for what is pleasant the joy the happiness well-being

135
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:44,960
letting the thinking mind become quieter so you can better feel the goodness of

136
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,720
just being here breathing

137
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:58,720
allowing that goodness the pleasure to fill you to spread throughout everywhere

138
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:07,520
even the places where that are uncomfortable let those be touched and filled

139
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:25,840
by whatever degree of well-being that might come meditating

140
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:23,840
so as we sit here to remember that things don't have to be

141
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:32,240
all one way or we don't have to focus on just one aspect of our experience

142
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:38,640
there's a way in which we can be at ease and inclusive of all of it

143
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:49,600
the pleasant and the unpleasant but then open more to the pleasant side

144
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:55,039
not at the exclusion of what's difficult but to better more balance in a more

145
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:59,278
balanced way to hold it and be with it

146
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:07,919
and if we turn our attention now to the suffering of the world suffering of people you know and

147
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,919
suffering of this covet time and

148
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,240
so many people challenged

149
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,480
there can be a strong tendency to focus on the suffering

150
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:36,080
exclusively to feel the suffering the pain of the world or of other people

151
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:42,320
and think that caring about it means you have to really focus on it exclusively

152
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:50,960
i believe that compassion is richer fuller

153
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:57,440
more compassionate if it doesn't exclusively focus on

154
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:04,080
the suffering but realize there's always more there's

155
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:13,840
always the pleasant the non-suffering that's happening at the same time

156
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:21,360
and to include what is good and what is

157
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,720
healthy and has sense of well-being to it or

158
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:34,159
goodness in it and to have a broader field of attention

159
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:41,440
so we the suffering can be held together with or inside of

160
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:48,158
a sense of well-being or sense of subtleness or ease

161
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:54,480
and so we can better recognize that the people we're thinking about or focused

162
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:02,159
on it they're more than just suffering people

163
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:14,480
and you are more than someone who just focuses on suffering there's a wider context

164
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:23,120
in that wider context of well-being and wellness and not wellness

165
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:30,799
allows compassion to be fuller and more penetrating and more pointing

166
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:38,880
to the end of suffering so as we end this meditation now

167
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,960
may it be that our ability to be inclusive of it all

168
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:51,760
allow us to meet the suffering of the world with greater care and kindness and

169
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:59,679
compassion may it be that the meditation we do

170
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:05,840
is a direct support for us to enter the world

171
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:14,639
with compassion for all may all beings be happy

172
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:21,760
may all beings be safe

173
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,919
may all beings be peaceful

174
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:47,840
may all beings everywhere be free

175
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:58,339
[Music]

176
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:16,640
so continuing the topic of anapanasati mindfulness of breathing in and

177
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,880
mindfulness of breathing out the we're kind of moving into the

178
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:30,399
territory now of the second tetrad where we train to experience joy

179
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:37,279
as we breathe in experience joy as we breathe out and then we train to as we breathe

180
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:43,679
in to experience happiness as we breathe out to experience happiness

181
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:50,000
and so all along here in all the 16 steps what

182
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:57,279
they have in common is mindfulness while breathing in and mindfulness breathing out and there's a connection

183
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:02,720
to this rhythm of breathing in and out that goes on and um

184
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:09,440
and as we move into this the joy part the the happiness part the

185
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:16,320
kind of the sense of wellness well-being that comes along uh i think it's important to remember

186
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:23,120
that we're that how important this rhythm of breathing in and breathing out is

187
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:28,240
so it's as i've said the the continuity of breathing

188
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:34,240
is keeps us can keep us in the present moment uh it's a breathing is always a present

189
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:42,559
moment experience and it keeps us going and moving along in the present and it's also but it's

190
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:48,080
also inconstant there's a discontinuity because the in-breath is only there

191
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:54,080
while you're breathing in and the out breath is only there when you're breathing out and one leads to the other and there's

192
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:59,519
this rhythm of one after the other the sensations at the beginning of the in-breath are different than the

193
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:05,519
end of the out-breath the sensations the beginning of the out-breath are different than the end of the out-breath

194
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:12,158
and so there's a constant change of sensations of movement experience in the body sometimes for focusing mostly on a

195
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:17,280
little spot of the chest or the belly we feel the changing texture of

196
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:23,200
sensations there if we're aware more broadly we might feel changing

197
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:29,919
ways and places where that are activated with sensations as we breathe so there's both this

198
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:35,040
constancy and this inconstancy with mindfulness of

199
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:40,480
breathing the constancy of the rhythm of breathing and the inconstancy of all the pieces of

200
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,679
it the subsets of it coming and going and

201
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:53,040
and so we can't hold on to any one part of the breathing without causing problems if you hold on to the

202
00:34:53,040 --> 00:35:00,400
exhale you know you never inhale and so you know then you you know run out of

203
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:06,640
breath if you hold on same thing with the inhale some people kind of prioritize really don't want to

204
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:12,240
let go at the top it's very so it's going to be very very subtle some people come to the top

205
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:17,599
of the inhale and they don't really want to give up anything they kind of have a

206
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:23,119
policy of holding everything they don't want they want things for themselves so there's a little subtle

207
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:28,160
resistance there to let go some people don't start the

208
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:33,200
exhale because it's a kind of letting go especially the end of the exhale people get little

209
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:39,280
very very subtly people get a little bit anxious there or there's a very subtle attitude maybe

210
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:45,920
at the beginning of the in-breath no i don't want to breathe in it's just a bother just more work

211
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:53,599
and now just leave me alone there's enough input coming my way so there can be very subtle attitudes uh

212
00:35:53,599 --> 00:36:00,480
in that cycles of breathing and that kind of little bit operate when you

213
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,680
when we get to that a little bit of holding perhaps a little bit resistance

214
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:12,320
or a little bit triggering of thoughts fear or resistance or or you know a

215
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:17,760
version or something and and you see if you're really attentive you can watch and see in that

216
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:25,040
cycle where it is that some little psychological thing is triggered occasionally don't don't try

217
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:31,920
too hard to look for it but it's a little bit there and or if we start thinking about something else

218
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:38,560
and it's really you know preoccupying really as major issue you can feel the breath gets

219
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:46,400
held and we're still breathing in and out but maybe it's all chest breathing and it's you know the belly's tight and and

220
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:52,320
and so there's this holding going on but if you just stay with the inconstancy in the

221
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:57,440
flow of breathing and remembering that this is constantly

222
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:04,000
letting go constantly opening up constantly releasing and softening and allowing the

223
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,480
flow to go that it's a protection from getting attached to anything getting hooked too

224
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,680
much on things getting caught in our thoughts caught in reactivity whatever

225
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:21,280
it's a way of keeping us limber keeping us relaxed or loose or not so caught

226
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:29,200
and that it's by degrees and so i don't think it's all or nothing again but we slowly the breathing begins

227
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:35,760
to massage us and begins to support the letting go and with time as the breathing becomes

228
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:41,200
more like a flow that goes smooth and easy that

229
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:47,920
the the watching the breath tuning into the breathing becomes a little bit like sitting at the

230
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:54,880
edge of a river and just watching the rippling occurrence so the water flowing down

231
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,960
the river and it's kind of like looking at a fire sometimes we can just spend a long time

232
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,480
just looking at the changing patterns of the water flow that you know that's

233
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:14,560
not that different from each other but it's changing and it can be just a watch that can be very relaxing and it we're not

234
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:20,400
necessarily trying to quiet our mind or stop thinking about anything but just letting that be the

235
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,920
you know the way the mind kind of the attention uh gets absorbed in and flowing with

236
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:32,400
something gets quite quieter and quieter and stiller so the same thing as with time

237
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,760
as the breathing becomes more relaxed more loose more open more flowing and we can kind

238
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,960
of be within constancy the and the constancy the inconsistency of

239
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,160
the little wavelets of breathing on top of the constancy of just the flow of the river of

240
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:54,480
breathing we get absorbed in it we get pulled into it

241
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:00,960
and there's a lot of it's not like we're looking at the surface of uh water we're actually what we're doing is

242
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:08,640
feeling sensing all the sensations that come alive as we breathe and and especially as we

243
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:14,880
kind of get settled in and really begin to settle into the present moment and stay with that rhythm and flow of

244
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:19,920
breathing that there gets born

245
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:26,560
pleasant sensations and that er that kind of can take the form

246
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:33,280
of contentment it can take the form of pleasure it can take the form of a joy

247
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:40,480
or delight or happiness a sense of goodness a glow a warmth and i know i'm repeating

248
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,520
my things i've said now but i think it's worth repeating i know so

249
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:51,200
and everyone will experience a little bit differently some people might feel something a glow in their chest as they settle

250
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:56,240
into breathing some people might feel it in their belly a warmth something good some people maybe it

251
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:02,400
feels intense um joyful tingling and kind of a delightful

252
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:10,640
uh in the nostrils that the air goes in and out it gets more and more intense the the the sharpness of the joy of the

253
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:16,720
the pleasure that's there and it's kind of a thrill almost it might be there's a kind of a sense of

254
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:23,599
uh locationless thrill throughout the body that comes as we really settle in and

255
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:32,000
get it get absorbed just like you get absorbed and watching the river get absorbed in this thing

256
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:37,359
my first experience of like this of being absorbed and feeling the goodness of it

257
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:42,880
was when i was about 10 years old and i would

258
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:48,960
take the public bus i was living in italy in a little town in italy and

259
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:56,160
i would go to school in town and we live in the outskirts of town and and my my bus stop that i got off on was

260
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:01,760
right near the very end of the line and i i learned at some point oh so

261
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:07,520
there was a driver and there was a conductor who sold the tickets to two people and the conductor would go

262
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:12,640
up and down and sell tickets as people got on board but the conductor at some point when we

263
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:18,000
kind of got outside the city enough that really not new people were gonna get on

264
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,119
the the conductor would sit on a particular seat and do the accounting of all the

265
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:29,200
different seat uh tickets uh he'd sold you know a round trip one way children

266
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:34,880
you know senior citizens whatever it might be um and he had his ledger he'd write on and

267
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:41,359
i learned that if i sat in a particular seat behind his seat and kind of looked over his shoulder and

268
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:47,119
watched him do his accounting in his ledger of the different kind of tickets he got

269
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:54,079
i would just start feeling so good i would just kind of feel so warm my chest would kind of glow and

270
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:59,440
delight and joy and i feel so content i felt safe and settled and

271
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:05,359
everything was right in the universe and just watching him and i have no idea why i didn't ever thought about it

272
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:11,839
i just knew that if i sat there i'd have this really good feeling and many years later when i started

273
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:18,560
meditating i realized that i was getting absorbed in this very simple

274
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:25,040
thing that he was doing maybe i was tapping into his concentration of working but just the movement of his

275
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:31,680
pencil on the paper and and his focus on it somehow i got kind of absorbed just

276
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:37,440
it wasn't like trying to get concentrated i wasn't i didn't know i was you know really getting absorbed

277
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:44,800
um it just like my my world kind of got so content and happy and settled and just him his pencil his

278
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:50,960
piece of paper watching him and um so this is the this maybe captures a

279
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:57,440
little bit the sense of what's possible in on breath meditation as we get into this

280
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,880
fifth and sixth step we're not trying too hard it's almost

281
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:09,760
like we're just sitting back and watching the you know on a nice quiet day and nothing to do nothing to be just

282
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:18,720
watching the river the conductor do his leg ledger in the on the bus and and and allowing ourselves to

283
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:24,480
include include the good feelings that come with that now remember they don't come

284
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:30,400
automatically and right away the first four steps of anapanasati are always the default

285
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:37,280
and and the basic default is the first two just becoming familiar with the breathing and and developing just kind

286
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:43,200
of developing capacity to stay a little bit in the present moment with things and we're always going back to the

287
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,720
beginning and you might go back to the beginning during some sittings it was one way in the beginning and then

288
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:56,960
we're kind of back near the beginning at the end because who knows all the ways that things change in our mind and body and

289
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:02,880
so uh don't have some idea of linear if it's linear don't have some idea that it has to be a certain way don't be in a

290
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:11,040
rush but when you're settled enough and present enough then at some point the fifth and sixth

291
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:17,839
steps might be relevant and this idea of kind of gently allowing yourself to be absorbed in that

292
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:24,800
and feeling the goodness of that and and kind of let the breathing in and bring out always going on that rhythm keep you

293
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:32,240
from getting attached and wanting keeping you loose and limber in the mind staying with that flow in and out and

294
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:39,520
then letting that rhythm of breathing and out move through or with the goodness that's there as well

295
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:45,359
and let that grow and be expansive and let it grow and be expensive so it includes

296
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:51,200
it can include all the challenges as well without us needing to be preoccupied

297
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:58,480
with the challenges or caught by them or needing to fix them they're just there in a relaxed way and

298
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:06,800
so um so i hope that um

299
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:13,440
you'll feel content contentment and perhaps the assignment for the next

300
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:21,440
24 hours is maybe you can look for more opportunities to be have contentment in your day

301
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:27,440
and i suspect that it you you can do it if uh even if it's a minute or so that

302
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:32,960
you'll have more opportunities if you look for them and and

303
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:39,839
and hang out with them a little bit and that contentment in your daily life will maybe support you to feel this

304
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:47,119
meditative goodness and contentment uh that supports a deepening of this practice

305
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:56,800
so thank you very much and i look forward to our time tomorrow
