1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:07,919
it feels wonderful to be here with you all of you even though it's this uh unusual world

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:13,840
of not being in person but still i have

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,920
strong sense in my heart of

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:28,720
all of you many of you who are participating here in our zoom practice thank you for being

5
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,320
here for this meditation today

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,719
uh i'd like to evoke the concept the practice

7
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:49,519
the virtue of truth of truth-telling it said that

8
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:58,559
there's all kinds of reasons why people think it's okay to do small lies white lies lies to save people's face

9
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:05,198
or you know little little ones uh as a way of taking care of people so

10
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:12,320
maybe that's true i don't want to engage in that now but what um

11
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,080
is never true is that it's okay to lie to oneself

12
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:25,680
that if you want to grow in the dharma if you want to grow in this mindfulness practice then never be and

13
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:33,920
never lie to yourself always be truthful to yourself and so we sit in meditation to support

14
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,280
that ability to develop the capacity to sit

15
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:46,560
in truth sit truthfully to recognize it to recognize when we're veering from it

16
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,920
and to sit in the truth of the moment

17
00:01:51,920 --> 00:02:00,079
and maybe that expression sitting in the truth of the moment has two wonderful meanings it means

18
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:06,479
um and it means to sit in the middle of it not

19
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:15,760
reacting to it not turning away from it uh the truth and um

20
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:23,840
and to really be there in the middle just there sit in the middle of truth

21
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,200
so here we are to sit or whatever posture that works for you

22
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:38,080
to meditate and um assume your posture

23
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:45,280
give some initial care to the posture you're in and maybe some

24
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:55,920
wiggling around twisting and swaying supports you to be here in this body of yours

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,840
and then to gently close your eyes

26
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,640
and with the truth of this moment the truth of here and now

27
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,959
in the immediacy of what you're experiencing now in your

28
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:29,519
body what's immediately around you within you know a foot from the edges of your

29
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:38,000
body maybe or less to take a few long slow deep breaths

30
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,680
to encourage the mind to remember

31
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:52,720
that in meditation this is the meditation center your body here and now

32
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:03,439
to make of physical contact with the truth of this body of yours

33
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:17,680
and as you exhale to release and relax the concerns you have the

34
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:29,840
tensions you hold

35
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,919
and then letting your breathing return to normal

36
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:59,759
and with a normal enough breathing as you exhale relax into the truth of

37
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:06,080
this moment the truth of your physical embodied experience

38
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,240
relaxing the muscles of your face

39
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,840
relaxing the shoulders

40
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,840
and relaxing the belly

41
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:04,160
and then centering yourself from the body's experience of breathing

42
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,680
not to avoid anything but to sit in the middle of it to be in

43
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:18,639
the middle of it in the middle of the truth of this

44
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,960
moment let the breathing be at the center

45
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,240
and when your mind wanders off in thought and you found yourself distracted

46
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,360
ask yourself what's really true

47
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:51,919
what's the truth of this moment that's deeper than your thoughts your distractions

48
00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:02,479
or it's a deeper truth that's underneath them or behind them that if you recognize that truth

49
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:09,840
you might find it easier to settle in to being here and now

50
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:19,520
breathing in the middle of all things allowing yourself to be simple just

51
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,840
breathing

52
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,960
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

53
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:59,679
to consider that when we're truthful when we're true to

54
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:06,960
ourselves we actually have more to offer others

55
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:15,760
that it's a position a place a resting place

56
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,720
with which to gaze upon the world

57
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,919
kindly and supportingly

58
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:35,760
compassionately feel and sense the challenges of other people

59
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:49,600
and to perhaps live with the wish that all beings could be well

60
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:56,000
that all beings could find joy and peace in their

61
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,320
own truth being truthful to themselves being honest

62
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:15,840
may it be that all beings be happy

63
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,640
all beings be safe

64
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:31,200
all beings be peaceful and all beings be free

65
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:39,840
and may we contribute to that

66
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:53,840
supported by our capacity to be truthful

67
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,988
[Music]

68
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:08,720
[Music]

69
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:20,320
so so for this dharma talk i'd like to

70
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:27,440
begin with a story and it seemed that there was a

71
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:35,440
young woman who very much wanted to meditate she'd been introduced to meditation in college

72
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,560
and but college was a busy time especially the last couple of years and

73
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:48,160
coursework and all the other things of college and uh

74
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:54,079
but she looked forward to a time when she could finish college and she really wanted to live a

75
00:35:54,079 --> 00:36:01,200
dharma life she was hoping to go live perhaps in a monastery or live at a retreat center someplace we

76
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:06,960
should really devote herself kind of full time to the dharma and

77
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:12,320
integrate all of the practice into her life not just meditation but

78
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:18,240
an integrated a life integrated with

79
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:23,838
with the path of liberation path of freedom path of love

80
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:31,040
and um so but then soon after she graduated uh her older sister

81
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:37,200
and her older sister's husband uh were in an accident and died

82
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:43,440
and her own parents were quite elderly and needed a lot of care

83
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:50,160
so she was left as a sole caretaker for her her sister's two

84
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:57,359
children and her plans to be able to go off and live this integrated dharma life that

85
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:02,480
didn't work out so well and she found herself caring for two kids needing to care for

86
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,599
her parents needing to work uh long hours in order just to have the

87
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:14,960
the finances to do all this and there was no time for even for meditation letting alone

88
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:20,079
thinking about or engaging in integrated dharma life but she went to

89
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:28,160
and found a meditation teacher and and asked the teacher um told her about

90
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:36,320
told the teacher about her problems and her challenges and and what could she do and

91
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:41,040
the teacher said to her uh well

92
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:46,400
if you don't have time for meditation and you want to live an integrated dharma life

93
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:53,410
and your life integrated with practice then what you can do is

94
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:59,920
[Music] have the practice of making sure that your words when you

95
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:07,599
speak are gifts practice generosity in your speech

96
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:14,480
whatever you say think about how it can be a gift to the person you're speaking to

97
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:20,320
so that's what she did and she learned a lot about herself in that process she learned

98
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:27,040
how often she was speaking not as a form of generosity but as expressions of

99
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:34,560
anger or spite or fear anxiety or desire and wanting something

100
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:40,640
and trying to get someone to behave just right so that she could get what she wanted

101
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:46,880
and she got to see so much about what she what was operating was driving her

102
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:54,400
and um but she was told not just to look not she wasn't told to look at that but that's what came up and

103
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:00,800
and then she had to work through that and adjust for that and find another way to come from a different place

104
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:06,400
and and to have her words be gifts

105
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,520
arising out of generosity generosity can't be an obligation it can't be

106
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:16,960
forced it's a it's a kind of upwelling of

107
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:23,280
goodness in the heart and she found that in practicing letting

108
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:30,240
her words be a gift she slowly learned how to do that and and over time it really transformed her

109
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:37,520
she grew in amazing ways and uh she grew in freedom she grew

110
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:45,040
in love she grew and understanding and wisdom in a way that made her life integrated

111
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:50,640
with the dharma so

112
00:39:53,040 --> 00:40:00,079
are your words gifts could they be gifts for others could there be generosity

113
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:06,800
practiced in what you say and this begins maybe by for you to understand

114
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:12,800
what motivates you for what you're saying uh what do they

115
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:18,560
underline what drives you to say what you say is it generosity or is it something else

116
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:24,079
is it kindness and care and respect for others or something else

117
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:29,680
is it what is what's being expressed through

118
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:35,359
those words and what would it take for your words to be gifts

119
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:41,359
what are the gifts that people would like to receive through words could you say all the things that you

120
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:47,440
need to say but do it in a way that seems pleasant for other people to hear that

121
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:53,599
feels right for other people to hear that maybe helps people relax or open

122
00:40:53,599 --> 00:41:01,359
or or trust you in some deep way how do you take care of yourself

123
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:06,560
socially and interactively with others if your speech is always going to have this

124
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,760
quality of generosity in it this goodness this gift-ness

125
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:18,319
in the words themselves so that's maybe not an

126
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:24,880
easy task but it's a phenomenal task and if what if some of you would like to

127
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:30,000
really take your meditation practice and really

128
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,760
learn how to integrate it or expand what's happening meditation into the rest of your life

129
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:42,079
so meditation just not just a refuge relief from your life but rather it's the

130
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:49,040
source from how you live your life and if you that and you want to kind of

131
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:55,680
grow into your life with a sense of freedom integrity openness truthfulness of

132
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:01,599
um love and sensitivity that comes from meditation

133
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:08,160
if you want to spread that into your life so that your life is integrated with this

134
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:13,760
then practice generosity and speaking

135
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:22,319
do it as an exercise do it as a way of learning about yourself do it as a way of of stretching yourself

136
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:29,839
do it as a way of understanding other people better be attuned to them rather than just

137
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:37,440
attune to yourself you better better attune to other people and attune to care for them and but not

138
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:44,560
at your own expense because you want to stay rooted in generosity and then you can't

139
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:50,640
sacrifice yourself because you have to really be available for yourself for this

140
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:57,920
upwelling of this beautiful quality to be there if we diminish yourself or forget yourself or sacrifice yourself too much

141
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:04,400
for others maybe that generosity is not really there available

142
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:11,680
so to practice generosity as a practice to learn about yourself to

143
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:19,520
learn but others to learn about how to relate to other people and i'm confident that

144
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:26,240
if your gen if your speech is generous to others you might actually be benefiting more than the other people

145
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:32,800
because uh we all benefit from the the uh the um

146
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,839
from our own generosity when that generosity comes with this upwelling of the heart this

147
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:42,960
freedom of the heart this loosening up of the constrictions the

148
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:48,640
fear the defensiveness the resentments the the

149
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:56,240
ambitions that get in the way of simple ordinary generosity

150
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:02,880
and you might argue with me that that this is maybe not such a profound

151
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,960
spiritual thing to do or maybe a little bit of a of a sentimental way of practicing or

152
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:15,359
something artificial way of practicing and that's far from what i intend to get

153
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:20,480
across but rather it's a vehicle it's a means by which

154
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:26,480
to really get deep into our hearts and minds to understand it to find out what really makes us tick

155
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:32,960
and to question it and maybe even debate it and with yourself and really find out uh is

156
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:39,280
are you really coming from the best place the most nourishing the most healthy place for you

157
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:46,400
when you speak and if you learn to speak with generosity you'll come from the best place i'm

158
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:52,640
confident in that you'll come from place that will help you to grow into phenomenal health freedom

159
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:59,440
and wisdom and understanding so to speak with generosity

160
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:07,760
so when the buddha taught about speech he talked about five

161
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:14,560
he said different things at different times but there's a point one uh one list of five criteria for speaking

162
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:21,440
and um and generosity is not one of them but but maybe all five of these are the

163
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:28,800
means or the support to help us understand how to speak generously and as a gift

164
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:35,920
and what they point to is that uh for the buddha buddhist life practice life is also a

165
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:43,280
reflective life it's a life that reflects and considers what it's doing it doesn't just act

166
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:48,560
impulsively or intuitively but there's a consideration and that consideration can be

167
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:54,079
second nature it doesn't be a lot of work but sometimes it's completely appropriate to actually step back and

168
00:45:54,079 --> 00:46:02,319
think go through these like five criteria for speaking so the first one is the question

169
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:09,440
is what i'm going to say now what i want to say is it timely is it the right time for me

170
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,960
is the right time for the other person is the right time to have the conversation it might be something very

171
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:20,640
important that needs to be talked about but it's not that time for it someone is stressed out they're busy they're doing

172
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:28,560
something else they can't focus their mood is not really available for a real

173
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:34,720
you know conversation about what needs to be talked about um at different time the more receptive

174
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:41,200
the most different time they're more ready and available so is it timely and and uh

175
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:48,079
and when it's we ask the question is it timely uh you take into account the circumstance of the other person

176
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:53,920
is it timely for them and would be better to wait until it's the right time

177
00:46:53,920 --> 00:47:01,359
the second is is it true what i'm gonna say is it truthful and um and here's where

178
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:07,119
it's so useful to be true to oneself to be honest about to oneself

179
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:14,480
and to grow in this self-honesty self truth in truthfulness in itself but

180
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:19,599
self-truth self-honesty in particular is a

181
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:25,520
is a guaranteed way to grow spiritually guaranteed way to grow on this path of

182
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:31,760
liberation and freedom keeping back and be really honest this is what's happening this was

183
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:37,760
and not just with the first thing you see but that to keep looking what's really going on here what's happening

184
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:44,640
here with me what's really true here it's a way of healing to do so it's a

185
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:50,559
way of creating healthy relationships to really stay close to what's true and

186
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:56,960
sometimes what's true is not the right time to speak it to other people but it's always the right time to know

187
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:03,280
it for yourself so to consider is what i'm saying true is it a is it a lot

188
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:09,760
you know probably most people don't lie automatically but is it a lie is it a falsehood am i twisting a little bit

189
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:15,440
am i adjusting what i'm saying so it's mostly true but i'm putting a little spin on it

190
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:22,319
in order to make it look better or something is it true the third is

191
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:30,240
um is how i'm going to speak is it gentle and a gentle might mean

192
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:36,160
is it harmonious is it is it uh with a tone of voice that is friendly

193
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:41,760
that is uh that people want to hear that feels you know a voice that's supportive for

194
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:47,760
others as opposed to a voice which is harsh that comes across a kind of critical or

195
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:55,839
angry or or demanding or something so um so it is is what i'm going to say

196
00:48:55,839 --> 00:49:04,160
can i am i going to say is it gentle or is it harsh the fourth is is it beneficial

197
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:12,480
is what i'm going to say going to be beneficial does it have a good purpose and and part of that also is that maybe

198
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:18,720
you'll say yes it's beneficial because of what my purposes i have for it however

199
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:24,400
i don't think the person is going to be receptive so yes i hope it could be beneficial but in

200
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:29,599
fact when i realize a person is not perceptive i'm just going to waste my energy to

201
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:36,000
keep saying this to the person over and over again and so to maybe if it's not going to be beneficial

202
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,119
to say it even though in theory it should be maybe there's no

203
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:46,720
point of saying it and actually maybe maybe it makes it worse if the person is closed to hearing what i

204
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:52,880
need to what what i want to talk about is it beneficial um has other

205
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:58,960
connotation other associations as well is it going to have a good impact on

206
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:04,240
people it's going to have a good consequence if i say this um maybe i feel it's the

207
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:10,720
truth maybe i feel like i need to you know i can say it gently

208
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:16,960
but maybe the person will get angry maybe the person will not want to see with talk with me

209
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:22,079
anymore and so the doors are closed and that's maybe not beneficial to have

210
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:27,359
that kind of reaction so is it beneficial that people learn from it do people

211
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:35,280
change beneficial way because of how we speak what we're saying is it beneficial and there's a lot of

212
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:41,200
speech which is not particularly beneficial um the uh

213
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:47,680
yesterday i was at a talk and uh public talk and and uh i kind of thought

214
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:52,839
that the talk wasn't so you know very good talk um to say it

215
00:50:52,839 --> 00:51:00,559
simply and um and i could i found it so strange that i had this inside i could feel this compulsion

216
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:06,079
to want to tell my companions you know that wasn't a good talk was it and i look at myself and say why would i

217
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:11,680
want to say that why bother is it beneficial to say that maybe it's

218
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:19,599
true that it was a talk wasn't particularly good um but why would i

219
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:25,440
say that out loud what's uh maybe some another uh approach i can have to talk

220
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:30,880
about what the person talked about and maybe i can highlight what was beneficial maybe

221
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:37,119
there was something beneficial in what the person talked about and then we can all benefit from the conversation

222
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:43,760
if we spend time talking about how it was not a good talk do we benefit from that

223
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:49,520
so is it timely is it true is what i'm going to say

224
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:56,720
gentle is it beneficial and the last one is is do i speak with a mind of loving

225
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:04,720
kindness a line a mind of care a mind of friendliness and um and sometimes

226
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:10,319
there's difficult conversations being made but can i do that with a mind of kindness

227
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:17,760
of kind regard or friendly regard for self and others and uh this is the in

228
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:24,640
the teachings of the buddha this has a very high value very he puts tremendous importance

229
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:30,318
on this idea of coming from a kind loving space

230
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,880
coming from metta and uh kind of my my assumption and my

231
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:42,079
understanding of why the buddha puts such a high level of importance on

232
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:49,359
coming from loving-kindness is that the alternative the more of so often is to come from a

233
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:54,400
place that's not beneficial to come from a place maybe of ill will

234
00:52:54,400 --> 00:53:02,800
uh it's to come from a place where there's not much freedom that uh good will metta

235
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:10,240
is when is really genuine when it really is sometimes again this upwelling of the heart when

236
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:17,200
it's healthy and nourishing it is an expression of freedom it comes from the

237
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:22,319
kind of letting go of attachments and clinging we're no longer contracted around something or

238
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:30,160
tight around something and so this idea of opening to the world and so

239
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:36,640
uh anything less than that it goes in the opposite direction to this uh wonderful dharma path the

240
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:42,559
dharma path of freedom so if and that's the big big word

241
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:48,079
if what a person wants what you want is to really take what you're maybe

242
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:53,440
learning in meditation about yourself and the capacity for freedom for peace

243
00:53:53,440 --> 00:54:01,040
for ease for love finding it here in meditation and and want to kind of not leave it as

244
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:07,040
something you do only in meditation but to learn how to bring that into the life so that

245
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:13,680
you live that because maybe that's where real honesty real integrity real being

246
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:19,440
true to yourself really resides in this place of of

247
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:27,520
being being free and to bring it into life this is one of the great satisfying tasks

248
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:32,960
and certainly for me as a teacher this is kind of what i love to hear this is what people want to do is to

249
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:38,240
is to integrate or bring it into the whole of their life

250
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:46,319
and so today i'm suggesting that one way to do that is to practice generosity with your

251
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:52,480
speech have your words be gifts to the people you speak them to

252
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:57,680
and and learn how to do it in a timely way

253
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:05,520
and speak what's true speak in a gentle or caring way

254
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:12,160
speak with what's beneficial and speak with a mind of loving kindness

255
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:17,599
a heart of loving kindness and in doing that especially the beneficial one

256
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:26,160
there's a feedback loop that we'll constantly want to kind of reassess and see how was that gift

257
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:34,240
received was that a useful way to do it because perhaps it takes a while to learn

258
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:43,279
how to be generous in speech so that it feels authentic for ourselves and and is not too

259
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:52,640
maybe contrived so that it makes other people actually uncomfortable because there's just too much trying to

260
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:59,359
be generous how to make it natural and simple and and so that when we speak

261
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:06,079
maybe we help people smile we help people readjust their direction in which their

262
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:12,480
mind and heart is going from talking about how a public talk was not such a good thing it wasn't a good

263
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:17,760
talk and and kind of commiserate with each other oh that wasn't so good

264
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:25,680
versus talk about something that was beneficial that kind of is a spark of joy and delight and and and

265
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:34,160
and we benefit from talking about it and so how can we

266
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:44,559
spread joy and delight and benefit and growth to grow in the dharma

267
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:50,000
one of the great ways to grow in the dharma is to be truthful

268
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:59,760
maybe there's very little growth in the dharma without truth that being true true honest to oneself

269
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:07,119
so those are my thoughts this this day and i hope that it gives you some

270
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:14,799
suggestions of how to practice in your life and i hope that you benefit from it and

271
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:20,480
and maybe run it as an experiment for a week and see what you learn in the process of

272
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:34,078
practicing generosity and speech so um thank you very very much
