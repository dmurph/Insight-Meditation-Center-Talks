4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,400
eclipse the full the totality as it's called so so maybe that will come into

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:33,520
our meditation somehow whether or not we were able to see the totality of the

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:40,160

practice so tell you what let's sit together and and be surprised see what

8
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:53,079
arises in the practice of meta and and uh yeah embodiment together so like to

invite you to arrive to

10

busy or or full or challenging

15
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:42,119
or whatever it's been can we release for a moment not pushing away that's a

16
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:48,719
different energy not pushing away but releasing for a moment to

17
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:58,840
settle this is a fresh new moment how can we Embrace this fresh new

18
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,840
moment

19
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:10,879
with our presence feeling our bodies sitting in this

20
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,440
moment and with our

21
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,840
breath

22
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:44,080

moment

25
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,440
allowing inviting the breath to

26
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:33,400
embrace this moment of being this freshness of this moment of

27
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:40,120
being in this body in breath the out

28
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:48,200

lulla

30
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:21,079
spending another few minutes

31
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:26,800
cultivating embodiment and presence feeling the body feeling the

32
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,240
breath moving through the body in this moment try it

33
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,240
here right

34
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,639
now

35
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,639
e

36
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,639
e

37
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
e

38
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
e

39
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:29,319
and now as we are sitting allowing the breath to move

40
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:31,879
as as it

41
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,520
does and we bring a sense of appreciation and awe the same way

42
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:53,520
that many have reported today seeing the total eclipse of the

43
00:07:53,520 --> 00:08:00,479
sun sense of awe

44
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:07,680
in some ways every moment of experience is

45
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,680
aome

46
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
amazing

47
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:43,200
and we for a moment just for a moment receive the sensations of the

48
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,000
breath in this

49
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,320
body with a sense of awe

50
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
awesomeness

51
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
e

52
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:06,440
let yourself play around with this perhaps with this sense of awe we notice

53
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:13,680
something new about the breath we hadn't noticed before or the sensation somewhere in the

54
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,240
body we hadn't sense or we sense in a new

55
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:28,000
way as if we're watching a total eclipse this worldly

56
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,320
otherworldly EXP

57
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:51,959
experience just as the eclipse for us human beings does not occur too

58
00:10:53,800 --> 00:11:00,000
frequently giving the span of our limited lives this breath too

59
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,440
this breath even though it is our companion

60
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:12,440
from the moment we come to the world to the moment we take our last breath but

61
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:20,720
in this body in this unique

62
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:27,040
being it occurs briefly compared to the life of

63
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:33,200
the universe it is awesome it is

64
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
awesome

65
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
e

66
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:43,360
oh it's such an uplifting State similar to meta

67
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,320
gratitude compassion

68
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,120
Etc now let's

69
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:09,040
switch if you like switch to mudita practice gratitude

70
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:15,519
mudita mudita happiness for the Good Fortune of

71
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,920
others if you did not see the total eclipse

72
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:27,920
today can you have happiness for those who are fortunate to be on the path of

73
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:34,800

74
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,160
it were your own as if you had been

75

privy to this happiness for their happiness if you are one of the lucky

76
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:53,959

e

84

e

85
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920

notice the more you allow your heart to expand and hold joy for the joy of

87
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:09,438
others the more joyful you become

88
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:26,839
uplifted during all kinds of people younger people who were able to

89
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:32,720
see it children young

90
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:41,630
adults adults older adults people in their 80s and 90s

91
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:44,669
[Music]

92
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,360
perhaps or even

93
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,720
hundreds happiness for their Good

94
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
Fortune

95
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:41,640
and now for the third part of this practice period let's try something else on for

96
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:51,240
size now the same way that in the ancient

97
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:57,280
times total eclipses were construed or interpreted

98
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:05,360
as end of the world or very negative Omen etc etc taken so

99
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,720
personally so personally something that was not personal at

100
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:18,640
all the movement of the Sun and the Moon and the Earth human beings took it so personally

101
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,880
we distraught just

102
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:29,159
distraught something that was not personal at all and today we get that we

103
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:34,240
understand it it's not personal it's not because a people

104
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,640
or or a group behaved badly Etc it's not

105
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:46,120
personal celestial objects they're going about their way causes and

106
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:59,600
conditions is it possible to bring the same perspective into our lives when we

107
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:05,880
consider something so catastrophic all right I did this it's my fault it's all

108
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,880
rests on my

109
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:18,640
shoulders you're bring the same sense of spaciousness of understanding wisdom

110
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,919
yeah there's so many causes and conditions that have made this happen

111
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,960
yeah maybe I have a part in it or at the right place at the right time or wrong

112
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:35,200
place at the wrong time or other factors but it's not so

113
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:41,679
personal so many causes and conditions so

114
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:53,440
many we allow this to bring equinity

115
00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:00,600
spaciousness peace and these into our hearts

116
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

117
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

118
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

119
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:03,880
e and let's bring a sense of

120
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:09,039
gratitude that as human beings

121
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:16,640
we we [Music] can see here

122
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:25,600
appreciate and perhaps understand with appreciation events like this in the

123
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:33,919
heavens and the Stars the celestial objects that we live on in

124
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:41,000
Earth with enough development in our science our understanding to

125
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:49,320
appreciate to feel uplifted by events like this gratitude

126
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:04,200
gratitude we live in a world where such a thing happens on this precious

127
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:09,840
planet and that we have appreciation we

128
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,919
can understand it in some

129
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:20,480
ways much more than early humans

130
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:30,360
did gratitude appreciation for what is

131
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,840
and as we turn to close this period of sitting

132
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:50,600
together allowing ourselves to feel appreciation gratitude for ourselves

133
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:57,320
for having showed up as best as we were able to and without attachment to

134
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:02,600
outcome however it was or

135
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:07,640
wasn't we've planted seeds trust

136
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:13,720
it may all beings everywhere on this planet of

137
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:21,600
ours and everywhere in in all celestial

138
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,840
objects all beings everywhere all sensient beings May there

139
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:34,399
be happy may they be well including

140
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:53,039
ourselves thank you so much for your practice everyone so we

141
00:25:53,039 --> 00:26:00,279
did four practices today inspired by the total eclipse the first one was the

142
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:06,880
practice of awe the second one was mudita vicarious

143
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:14,320
joy happiness for the Good Fortune of others then we did equinity not taking

144
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:20,760
things so personally things that aren't and then we ended with gratitude

145
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:28,000
and of course if you did see the to Eclipse earlier instead of mudita you would have practiced gratitude as well

146
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,440
so four different practices pretty rich who knew one could practice with a total

147
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:44,480
eclipse and happy hour in these way kind of fun so so I'd love to invite you to um

148
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:51,440
engage to reflect to share with one another as little or as much as you

149
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:57,679
like sharing reflecting on what what worked

150
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:03,960
for you in the practice or maybe what has moved you uh with

151
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:09,279

all of them having at the same time this body bodily visceral experience of

187
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,440
seeing reviewing the day it was like taking a having an assortment of lenses

188
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,519
and picking the one that you wanted to look through and then seeing I had a

189
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:17,320
very busy day today but I could sort of see the totality of it and through a the

190
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:23,039
way you know a healthy way of seeing it basically uh and through pulling it all

242
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:07,839
second I see one question that I want to address in um in chat first which is um

243
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:12,920
one of you said I love the meditation I I loved how the meditation had a part to

244
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:18,160
be happy for others could you expand on it I love that perspective so that is

245
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:23,480
the teaching on mudita uh mud D in poly

246
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:29,280
translated as vicarious Joy or or happiness for the happiness of others

247
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:35,160
and it's a beautiful joyful practice where uh we cultivate we start where

248
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:43,079
it's easy we think of people where we can easily be happy for their happiness um and then we expand to all beings

249
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:49,599
being happy for the happiness of others and um and the Dal Lama has said that if you're just happy for your own happiness

250
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:55,359
you have one chance to be happy if you're happy for the happiness of others your chances increase to S billion or

251
00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:01,920
however many number of uh people there are on this Earth so happiness or the happiness of others it's such an

252
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:07,359
uplifting practice and there's much more on it and you're welcome to Google

253

00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:18,839

259
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:56,160

260
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:02,000
a very young adult who lost his life um this morning and so I wasn't even

261
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,560
focusing on the eclipse um and was a friend of my daughter um it was just a

262
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:15,400
accident in Big Sir um he fell and drowned so I like okay how do I feel um

263
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:21,079
Mita for others even though I was feeling gratitude to of course everybody

264
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:27,040
here and to myself but I just couldn't get my mind off of yeah him and the

265
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:32,880
family so I was just wondering is it okay I mean not feeling with I know everybody's so happy here and I

266
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:39,440
apologize but of course no need to apologize and I'm so glad thank you pmo

267
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:45,920
for the courage to to speak up this is so so important and what is really

268
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:51,800
important is to be truthful and honest to how you're feeling at at a given

269
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:58,160
moment so you might come to happier and and the topic might have you know might be

270
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:05,480
happiness or happiness of others and and you've had something tragic happen and there's so much heaviness and grief and

271
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,760
and the heart goes no I want to stay with compassion I want to stay with with

272
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:16,800
sadness I want to meet my sadness with um with kindness I want to meet it

273
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:25,359
compassion is what's needed here for me for the family who just lost their young child and that's appropriate so of

274
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:32,040
course that's appr so at any time um if you're practicing here on a retreat anything and the instructions

275
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:37,119
are you know blah blah blah and your heart is in a different place then meet

276
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:43,960
your heart meet the truth of where you are with kindness because that's where you are that's what's needed not what's

277
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:49,520
you know we we offer invitations instructions kind which are kind of

278
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:56,880
General but be uh be attuned to what's needed for you at a given time uh and be

279
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:03,040
your own inner Dharma coach so yeah maybe gratitude works but no when we're doing with want to turn towards

280
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:10,560
compassion oh sweetheart yeah this is hard this is hard and that's perfectly fine thank you so much for for bringing

281
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:16,920
in if you want to add anything else you're welcome to if not it's all good no thank you just want to said thank you

282
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:26,240

283
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:33,119
reflection and yeah Serena adds um her support to you not everyone

284
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:38,160

285
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:42,760
support here is Jerry Jerry I see your

286
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:50,480
hand yes so uh not to spoil it but uh uh

287
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:58,119
you mentioned uh uh in your own comment and then apologize for identifying geopolitical

288
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:05,400
events and so um uh oh no you're GNA take go there okay okay that's since you

289
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:12,560
you open the oh no okay so I just wondered how you sit when

290
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:18,720
like I echoed many of the comments that people said but sometimes I wonder if

291
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:26,160
I'm so I just try to stay in the moment when I think about these other things

292
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:32,599
that some of which mentioned and say well things will work out but is that

293
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:39,599
naivity or denial I guess that's what I just uh yeah yeah yeah it's U it's a

294
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:45,000
good question and I don't mind that you you're going there at Al Cherry it's fine it's part of our life right it's

295
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:51,160
part of our world um I think there's a difference between

296
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:57,880
the um naivity equinity and definitely getting overwhelmed and so anxious that

297
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:03,760
one cannot do anything so this practice is the practice of the middle way so I

298
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:12,119
know that personally for me um it does not help me to um to get

299
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:18,559
overwhelmed it doesn't help me to get overwhelmed um doesn't help me at

300
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:26,078
all so it's [Music]

301
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:32,400
um also not helpful to have the sense of resignation because usually it's

302
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:38,920
overwhelmed that leads to resignation overwhelm leads to resignation kind of they go hand in hand I've heard from so

303
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:46,000
many people that they get over I'm like ah it's all going to hell and then it's like ah there's nothing I can do so it's

304
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:53,920
almost like a pair together those two so so what what is skillful to to

305
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:59,040
realize yeah things things are challenging things are chenging and and

306
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:07,400
what can I skillfully do can I what can I skillfully do um to to be ready to

307
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:13,359
support um but to stay but to stay right here and not get into state of e neither
