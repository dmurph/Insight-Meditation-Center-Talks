1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,960
so good morning here good day everyone

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,080
and uh here we are

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:23,920
and uh here you you are over there

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:33,200
you're there as you're here my there is here so i'm confused

5
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:40,320
with this worldwide way in which we're all present on this

6
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,840
globe at the same time so

7
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:54,399
to start this meditation to see if you could enter into

8
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:02,320
a meditative posture kind of from the inside out

9
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,840
adjust your posture maybe sway back and forth a bit

10
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,680
sway forward and back and see if you could maybe twist a

11
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,400
little bit and find a place where you feel

12
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,759
most aligned

13
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:33,200
with alertness and a kind of alignment of things that

14
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:41,840
your whole body can begin to be unified in harmony here

15
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,640
one aspect of meditation is coming into a kind of unity kind of a

16
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:58,718
harmonious whole where there's no divisions

17
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:05,119
no borders as if different parts of who you are made up

18
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:11,120
of distinct countries the mind the body the heart

19
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,800
the emotions these are not distinct countries with

20
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,920
sharp borders but you are made up of a unified

21
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,959
seamless whole where all of who you are

22
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:32,160
can be included all of who you are

23
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:39,280
has a place here

24
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,959
and then to gently close your eyes and

25
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,159
taking a few long slow deep breaths maybe as if you're breathing from deep

26
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:06,319
inside and spreading the x the inhale

27
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,560
expansion through your whole body

28
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:19,519
bringing your whole body into play as you breathe in deeply

29
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,959
and as you exhale

30
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,640
to let go

31
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,959
relax and settle into this body

32
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:49,200
having a longer exhale than usual but only as long as it's comfortable to

33
00:03:49,200 --> 00:04:01,840
let go and release settle

34
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,840
and then letting your breathing return to normal

35
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,040
and perhaps a normal breath

36
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:44,720
maybe just maybe you can find that a light touch in relationship to

37
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,280
breathing

38
00:04:51,360 --> 00:05:00,160
that the body that receives the inhales do so with a light touch

39
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,800
the body that settles as you exhale

40
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,479
there's a lightness maybe even a tenderness in the exhale

41
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,840
and the body breathing out

42
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,319
breathing in and feeling the activities of your mind

43
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,400
the energies of thinking

44
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:56,720
the feeling sensations of having concerns and worries

45
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:04,160
and as you exhale to soften the mind

46
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,840
quiet the mind

47
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,639
to light not lighten up

48
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,840
to maybe lift up release some of the

49
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:40,000
weight of the mind so the mind has a lightness

50
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,319
or at least your awareness is a light

51
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,840
touch

52
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,039
and then to settle into the body

53
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,840
breathing

54
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,360
and whatever you're aware of any moment when you're aware and

55
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,439
especially consciously aware

56
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:45,840
to let that conscious awareness have a light touch lightest of touch

57
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:54,960
there's no force an assertion and there's no hesitation

58
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:01,280
just lightly touching feeling sensing

59
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,879
the experience of the moment

60
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:13,680
and the metaphor of touch suggests that there's always it's always

61
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:22,160
in the present moment touching is always a present moment

62
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:30,479
experience and to have your awareness

63
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:39,440
touch and be touched by the experience of breathing body

64
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:45,519
of feelings of whatever is happening here

65
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:55,839
staying here in the present moment relaxing the thinking mind

66
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:09,839
quieting the thinking mind to be just here with this experience

67
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,360
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

68
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:24,398
to allow your attention now and your thoughts to lightly

69
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:31,200
consider the people of your life

70
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:40,398
the people that are in your neighborhood or community

71
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:49,679
the people that maybe you're aware of through the news or through

72
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,360
communication of some kind

73
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:05,840
and gently to let your awareness spread out across the lens

74
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:14,480
as if it can reach out towards where all the people of the world live

75
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:25,679
and as you breathe to breathe in

76
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,840
the suffering and challenges and

77
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:42,559
that people live with offer to take it from them

78
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:48,720
not so it's stuck in you but so you can transform it on the

79
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:57,360
exhale with the blessings of your good will

80
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:03,360
the blessings of your well-wishing and care for others

81
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,840
and to always at the end of a meditation

82
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:24,960
to consider how the meditation practice can be for

83
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,840
the welfare and happiness of others

84
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:37,279
how whatever benefits we have received from meditation known or unknown

85
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:45,279
to have them be happily spread from us out in the exhale

86
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,480
out into the world

87
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,399
so we take into account the people we share this planet with the beings we share this planet

88
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:06,559
with and we offer our good will

89
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:13,840
our care and kindness our mutual

90
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:29,440
support and then you might say these words

91
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:35,039
repeating them after me maybe silently in your hearts

92
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,720
may all beings be happy

93
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:53,840
may all beings be safe

94
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,760
may all beings be peaceful

95
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:09,760
may all beings be free

96
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:19,440
and may i contribute even in the smallest ways

97
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:35,839
to this possibility

98
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:43,099
[Music]

99
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:53,920
so this is the sunday after earth day so some some of us

100
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:00,079
sometimes will commemorate earth day not on the 22nd of april but

101
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:05,680
on the sunday following it or close to it

102
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:11,280
and i certainly would love to speak a little bit about

103
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,640
this home that we live with in this home that we share

104
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:24,000
and the care of it and uh as many many of you know the

105
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,440
prefix eco eco like ecology

106
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:36,720
means in greek home and so ecology is the study of our home

107
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:45,200
and i just finished the two days yesterday two days of the training that i teach i co-teach

108
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:50,720
on buddhist eco chaplaincy

109
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:57,280
the spiritual care in relationship to our home that we live in this home that

110
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,320
we all share together and you know when people live

111
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:08,079
together in a home roommates family um

112
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:14,880
there's a whole different relationship we have to the mutuality of that that home space

113
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:21,520
and the mutual care of it and keeping it clean or taking

114
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:28,560
uh you know creating an environment that's nice for everyone there caring for the

115
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:34,400
people under the same roof so we share this global home

116
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:42,320
and that we call the earth and um and in the way that i like to

117
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:50,160
see things in words it's an ancient game that buddhist teachers

118
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:56,960
vacuuming back into ancient india love to take indian words and and

119
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:04,000
do kind of not exactly etymology but to tease apart things

120
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:10,000
from the word and so it turns out that the word earth

121
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,160
and the word heart both overlap with the letters

122
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:23,200
a rt art and and the art

123
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:31,200
and maybe the meeting place of our hearts and this earth is in the art of living

124
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:38,560
and this expression the art of living um is a uh offers a kind of i think a rich

125
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:43,920
series of connotations that life can be a form of art

126
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:50,800
and uh more than it is work the work of life more than it is

127
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:58,400
a duty or a burden but an art is something that uh we offer

128
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,520
our hearts to our care our creativity our attention or

129
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:08,720
to detail and uh and so this earth of ours

130
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:17,920
do we live on it with the art of living and the

131
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:25,760
so one of the most powerful uh i know most powerful one of the i think powerful images uh coming out of

132
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:32,160
buddhism our relationship to the earth is

133
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:38,240
the image here on the buddha and all altar has this what's called the earth

134
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:43,440
touching mudra i guess i'm blocking it a little bit with my shoulder but if i

135
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:49,839
lean a little bit to the side i think maybe you can see that the buddha's

136
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:56,960
right hand is reaching down over his knee and his fingers are

137
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,560
just about to touch uh the earth or maybe he's just touched the earth and

138
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:08,480
he's pulling it away and but you can see the

139
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:14,000
delicacy the simplicity the very relaxed way in which the hand is draped over the

140
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:21,200
knee and it's a relaxed kind of going forward to touch it's not grabbing the earth or attacking

141
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:26,800
the earth it's a light touch just the tips of the finger is going to come down and touch

142
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,839
the earth and um i can't help but to

143
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:40,319
think of the image on the sistine's chapel where michelangelo has painted the touch of god on

144
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:48,720
the fingers of adam and adam is just coming alive being touched by god and and there also

145
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:56,319
we have this light touch this gentle it's not a gentle touch

146
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:02,480
and to live touching the earth to live lightly on the earth a light touch in

147
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,599
how we live our lives the buddha there's a wonderful verse in

148
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:14,720
where the buddha says that like something like head like a bee collects

149
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:22,880
pollen from the flower without harming the flower so um a wise person

150
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:31,280
walks through life without harming anyone or anything so

151
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:38,400
certainly you know we get our food our water we get our things to take care

152
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:45,119
of ours what sustains us from the earth but to do so in a way that it's a light touch that doesn't

153
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:51,279
harm the very thing that is sustaining us like a bee

154
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:57,280
so here the buddha is touching the earth lightly and the story of this is a it's part of

155
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:05,119
the mythology of buddhism you don't find this story in the earliest layers of the buddhist records

156
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:10,880
from the buddha's life but some maybe 500 years later after the buddha

157
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:17,200
you find this story that is really colorful it's i think of it as

158
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:24,079
uh you know this is a time in ancient the world where there was no technical or movies there

159
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:32,000
was no color photos and um it was a very much an oral culture and uh and so

160
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:39,760
it was orality that would paint these dramatic pictures of of um that were evocative in

161
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:45,839
in this imagery maybe not just to entertainment's sake

162
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:54,240
but also to evoke the emotions to evoke a sense of awe at this life we live and so the story

163
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:59,839
goes that the buddha was sitting on the ground and the statue we have behind us we

164
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:05,440
uh it's not sitting really on a pedestal that's he's meant to be you know sitting you know on

165
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:11,760
the ground on the earth um the night uh in the evening

166
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:17,280
before his enlightenment he was sitting there uh in his quest for awakening for freedom

167
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:22,640
for freedom from suffering to really get to the bottom of what suffering is

168
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:27,760
and to find a way not to suffer what a that's considered to be one of the great

169
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:34,400
noble quests to bring suffering to an end not as a

170
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:40,160
fantasy or a fable but as a real possibility for human beings

171
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:46,880
and that was his dedication and uh so in this fable this myth that

172
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:52,480
was the um there's a lot of things a lot of forces

173
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:58,720
that want to prevent the buddha from becoming free of suffering of discovering this peace and stepping away

174
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:04,640
from the attachments addictions hostilities of the heart that might you know that

175
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:12,319
have such a strong compulsive pull and demand on our attention and these are represented by mara

176
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:18,079
mara and mara's army armies and mara came with these and the

177
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:24,160
descriptions are you know like lord of the rings and you know the huge

178
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:30,880
evil forces that are marching across the plains and with all kinds of ogres and orcs and

179
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:36,720
all kinds of awful creatures and um huge elephants that must have been like

180
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:44,560
the um broadly tanks of the ancient world fighting elephants and came marching to

181
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:50,800
um to chase the buddha away to destroy the buddha to prevent him from becoming enlightened

182
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:56,880
and the drama of the stories is you know worthy of you know something like lord of the

183
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:02,839
rings and and and they throw every possible

184
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:10,560
um uh weapon they have at the buddha arrows and javelins and sharp

185
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:16,880
edge discs and you know everything these and um and the buddha as you see in the

186
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:25,680
statue is unmoved and relaxed and breathes at ease and doesn't react or doesn't

187
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:33,200
doesn't flinch in any kind of way and in fact all the arrows and spears as

188
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:38,960
they get flying through the air at the buddha tens of thousands of them the air is buzzing and

189
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:46,480
howling with all these armies and dragons and things that are just kind of

190
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:53,280
attacking the buddha and all the weapons turn into flowers and the flowers land

191
00:45:53,280 --> 00:46:01,200
on the ground so after a while mara realizes that violence is not going to dissuade the

192
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:09,280
buddha from his calm his peaceful endeavor his calm discovery of where freedom from

193
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:16,000
suffering is and so mara comes with

194
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:23,040
his last weapon and that is to sow doubt in the mind of the buddha to challenge

195
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:30,880
him that or to claim to him you have no right to become awakened

196
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:39,440
you have no right to attain this highest capacity of human peace that a human being can experience

197
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:46,000
and and this idea you have no right so i

198
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,680
interpret all this as being all kind of psychological forces inside the buddha himself

199
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:59,359
that are casting all the forces they can to prevent him from letting go of this how he usually

200
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:07,200
has been the attachments don't want to don't want to be let go of and and his self-worth has

201
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:13,680
huge doubts whether it's appropriate for him to become awakened isn't awakening and freedom of freedom

202
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:19,680
suffering kind of a isn't it kind of an abandoning of people isn't it a kind of a

203
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:26,480
you know attaining something profound and beautiful for oneself and is that okay to do when everyone else is

204
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:31,520
suffering and there's all kinds of doubts that can come up

205
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:37,680
and um and so and one of the things that that mara says in sowing that trying to

206
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:43,760
sow doubt in the buddha's mind is that you have not

207
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:50,960
benefited people enough to deserve being awakened you have not practiced

208
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:56,000
enough generosity you haven't given enough to people in the world and

209
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:02,160
and without you know having lived for the benefit of others it's not appropriate for you to become

210
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:07,839
awake and um and the buddha says well then

211
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:13,599
i'll bring a witness who can bear witness to all that i've

212
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:19,119
done to support this world all the generosity that i've done

213
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:25,599
back over the many lifetimes i've lived in lived and he said i'll call upon the earth as

214
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:31,359
my witness and here we have this provocative idea that the earth

215
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:38,240
that's been around for so so long is the witness that keeps the record

216
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:45,680
of what we have done i grew up in the coast of italy and it was

217
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:51,040
remarkable to see it was kind of it was kind of beautiful at first seeing the islands

218
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:56,079
that around where we were lived and then to realize that they were

219
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:02,240
completely denuded of soil mostly bare rock because they had been

220
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:08,880
over farmed with grapes and olives 2 000 years ago or in the roman times

221
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:15,680
and all the soil had washed away and the over farming of them and nothing was left they'd cut the

222
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:21,520
trees and they'd farmed so the record is still there

223
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:27,599
and the records of the record of what humanity is doing to this planet that

224
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:34,079
the earth remembers it's here what do we carry with us but the earth

225
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:39,680
remembers also the good and and so the buddha asks the earth to

226
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:44,720
bear witness to all the generosity and all the benefit he'd brought people over his

227
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:52,880
lifetimes and to assert his right the okayness to let go of his clinging his

228
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:59,599
attachment to become free and experience the happiness of liberation

229
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:05,680
and and so that's when he reaches down he's going to touch the earth

230
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:12,960
to ask the earth for be that witness and i love this that

231
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:20,000
he doesn't assert his right for awakening he doesn't rely on his own feeling that

232
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:26,400
yes it's okay for me to become free that he's calling on something that's

233
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:32,960
larger than himself or beyond himself that for the support

234
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:38,000
for the validation for the encouragement yes

235
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,359
it's okay and if we see ourselves as part of the

236
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:50,800
natural world part of the earth we are the earth because we're part of the earth

237
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:59,280
we are made up of a hundred percent recycled material that has been part of the earth for eons

238
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:07,359
for a long time and in a sense were arise out of the earth and uh

239
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:14,160
as part of the earth and we are the earth that can see itself where the earth that

240
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:19,520
can hear itself through the earth i can taste itself and

241
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:26,800
then walk on itself and so here the buddha is touching the

242
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:32,000
earth this light touch of the earth and then the earth

243
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:39,280
in reply to bear witness to his right to be awakened and all the generosity and good he done

244
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:46,400
the earth has an earthquake and then the legions of morrow's armies

245
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,920
realize that the buddha has indeed

246
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:59,839
the right to be awakened and they get frightened and they run away in all directions

247
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:05,680
and they say the text says no two of them going the same direction or the same path

248
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:11,119
and they run run away and and then in the vacuum that's created

249
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:18,480
all these deities come to create light and celebration and

250
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:25,119
but the buddha just sits there and as he's sitting there uh he's sitting he's sitting under the

251
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:30,319
bodhi leaf tree the bodhi tree and as he's sitting there a few leaves

252
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:36,400
from the bodhi tree gently fall from the tree and land on his robe land on his lap

253
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:42,960
and there's no explanation about what this is about but it's a beautiful

254
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:48,160
imagery again again the buddha is in nature under the uh sitting at the

255
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:55,119
base of a tree and now this gentle movement of a

256
00:52:55,119 --> 00:53:00,319
leaf of this body treated leaf that looks coincidentally a little bit heart-like

257
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:07,200
uh comes down and lands on the on the buddha and and sits there and and i take it as

258
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:12,480
being a little bit again this this intimacy with nature the natural world

259
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:19,520
that and then only then does the buddha see deeply into the nature of this world and

260
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:25,280
um and he sees something about the interconnected nature of this world and

261
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:32,240
paticia pada is that word for this and um and in doing so he becomes

262
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:37,680
liberated and free and and then there's a in this

263
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:44,319
technicolor mythology it's the whole universe gets lit up in light even the dark crevices of the

264
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:49,520
universe light up with the buddha's enlightenment

265
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:58,000
and then he gets up eventually and he walks he walks a long

266
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:04,720
distance across northern india to find people that he can begin teaching to find

267
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:09,839
people he think are ready for his teachings now that he's awakened and so his

268
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:16,240
awakening is not the end of the story but in a sense it's the beginning of the story and in this

269
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:21,920
ancient text that talks about this it's actually made up in three large chapters

270
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:28,000
and and the third chapter begins with after his awakening it's a

271
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:35,839
new chapter in this buddhist life when he goes out to be of service and to serve and to help the world

272
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:44,240
and so um we have this wonderful myth that uh is evoking

273
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:51,119
our connection to the earth as part of practice as part of the natural world

274
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:56,480
and um and the idea of the buddha sitting under the buddha trees sitting on the earth

275
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:03,599
touching the earth being caressed by the leaf that falls down it's also said in this

276
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:10,960
mythical story that with his awakening the flowers bloom and the other trees

277
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:16,960
around and those flowers begin kind of falling petals start falling as well

278
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:23,839
and so the art of living an art of caring living in such a way that

279
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:30,559
we live beautifully it's one of the associations i have with idea of art

280
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:36,559
certainly not all art is meant to be this way but when i think of the art of living i

281
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:44,079
think of living beautifully living with a beauty living with an ease living with a

282
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:50,640
creative source from within that is not burdened by distress

283
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:58,799
not caught in hostility and aversion not caught up in self-condemnation

284
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:05,119
and feelings of guilt not caught up in

285
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:13,839
giving up despairingly giving up but rather one that feels the natural

286
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:20,559
aliveness and lived life that wants to meet life wants to be connected

287
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:26,880
that when it's intimate and connected to what we love the most then we'll treat

288
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:36,400
it like a bee taking pollen from a flower without harming the flower and to

289
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:44,559
sit and sit or meditate and become free and then have access to us in intimacy

290
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:51,040
or a closeness or of a love for what we see and what we

291
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:56,400
what we do in the story of the buddhist enlightenment this mythology

292
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:04,240
the whole universe gets transformed with his enlightenment as i said the flowers and also fruit

293
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:10,640
bloom out of season music starts being played in the skies light

294
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:18,079
spreads throughout the universe beautiful things happen and for me

295
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:26,160
this is a metaphor for how we see the world when we become free

296
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:33,160
when we settle and become intimate and present and clear and we've cleared away the distractions and

297
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:38,960
preoccupations and fears and worries that we live under

298
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:44,880
the eyes with which we see the world it changes and we it isn't that the world has

299
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:49,920
changed and it's not kind of to be polyanish about what goes on in

300
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:57,520
suffering in the world at all but the eyes see the world tenderly the eyes see the

301
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:06,240
world and see beauty and or see love or see sweetness in this mythology it says all

302
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:12,480
the oceans of the world turn into sweet water when the buddha when the buddha be fresh water when the

303
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:17,680
buddha becomes enlightened and so there's it's as if everything

304
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:24,559
changes and there's a there's a beauty in this world

305
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:32,079
so to live beautifully and uh one of the ways that the it's lost often in english translation

306
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:37,359
of the buddhist teachings is the buddha talked about beautiful

307
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:43,359
karma beautiful actions in the world and the word he uses kaliyana

308
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:50,480
and and sometimes in translation as good karma and then there's bad karma

309
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:56,400
but in many teachings the buddha talks about not doesn't use the word good but uses the

310
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:01,680
word beautiful and so that our actions how we live our life

311
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:07,440
um has a beauty to it and a gentleness or a tenderness to it

312
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:12,880
and part of that is to live beautifully in relationship this home

313
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:17,920
that we have the earth and to care for to love for it to love

314
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:26,480
it in the art of living and um and uh the art of caring for this world

315
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:32,480
and so the ques you know but to do make that be kind of the to be

316
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:37,760
really a not a subsidiary thing that we do

317
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:45,040
a sideshow for us but to really live in a way that we care for this

318
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:50,079
world the people of our lives the environment we live in

319
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:55,599
the planet we live in so that it becomes it's not a duty

320
00:59:55,599 --> 01:00:00,880
and it's not a burden it's not like we make ourselves now so much more busy

321
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:06,079
but rather it becomes a innate expression

322
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:12,960
of our love our creativity the artfulness from which we are living

323
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:19,520
our lives so that this is why we practice

324
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:26,720
we practice every day we practice all the time not because it's a duty not because it's

325
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:33,440
an escape per se but rather because it allows the best of who we are the

326
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:41,680
most beautiful qualities of who we are and the most richest ways in which we can see the world and hear the world

327
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:48,000
becomes um you know becomes natural for us becomes

328
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:55,599
where we live from we live from freedom we live from ease from peace we don't live from hurry we

329
01:00:55,599 --> 01:01:00,640
don't live from greed and wanting and

330
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:07,680
filling our plate and attacking and we live with a light touch

331
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:15,520
and um and the earth will bear witness

332
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:22,319
the earth remembers and the earth hears and one friend of

333
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:28,160
mine says it's because the word earth begins with

334
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:35,040
e-a-r with here that we know that the earth is listening

335
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:44,160
the earth is listening to us watching us and certainly caring for us and

336
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:53,839
and it kind of keeps our record and perhaps when you're ready for your enlightenment

337
01:01:53,839 --> 01:02:04,160
you can call upon the earth to bear witness to your right to becoming free

338
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:11,839
i think the earth will support us if we care for this earth that we live on may we care for it

339
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:18,880
together as if it is our home because it is our home

340
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:26,000
on this earth day earth week of 2021 so

341
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:31,280
thank you
