00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:06,799
hello everyone and

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,519
here on this friday we come to the end of the series on faith

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:19,520
and i'll probably say this later as well but um

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,880
there's so much to say about faith and i've over there over the these

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:32,000
months on youtube i think i've talked about it a few times including the topic of refuge

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,800
so there's a lot to say but i prefer and maybe it's the truth

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:45,200
not to know what faith really is there's something to me quite marvelous

8
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,039
about not knowing but trusting or allowing or

9
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,399
feeling something here and

10
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,920
you know i think i'm a fairly rational person who

11
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,159
reasons and thoughtful and and i also uh tremendously value the way

12
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,159
that then mindfulness we do know we don't know we don't we know that this

13
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,600
we know the particulars of this moment the the we know our experience as it's

14
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,280
unfolding in the moment for itself and there's a clarity that arises with

15
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,880
mindfulness that we really know and the deeper we go and mindfulness practice the positive

16
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:38,240
practice the greater the knowing quality is and at the same time

17
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,680
the process the unfolding the larger picture of what all this is this

18
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,840
human life of ours you know there's so much that i don't know and

19
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:57,600
and uh mindfulness has placed me in the middle of all of it with a deep trust

20
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,040
a deep confidence a deep faith that

21
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:11,520
is heartfelt that that is a kind of close to a kind of love or warmth storm

22
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,080
a sense of um you know maybe in kind of an in a

23
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:25,440
language that's not becoming popular a sense of this is a belonging here

24
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:32,640
of being at home here and

25
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:40,560
in one of the definitions of belonging that i'm fond of is the idea that belonging is the

26
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,599
capacity to give care

27
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:52,000
and to receive care the capacity to give and receive care

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,040
so rather than belonging being a passive thing rather than faith trust or place here in

29
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,120
this world is passive uh it does involve the capacity to give

30
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:12,159
and receive care and so that capacity what is that

31
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:19,120
how can we center ourselves in the present moment and expand this capacity

32
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,440
and one way is to expand our capacity to just know this

33
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:32,560
the more we can know this and trust this have faith in this have confidence in our ability to be present

34
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,480
for this the greater become becomes our capacity to care

35
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,640
so the simple word i'd like to offer today for this practice

36
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:51,280
is the word this t-h-i-s and perhaps uh

37
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:58,080
that little introduction i just gave can add some uh some

38
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,920
greater dimensions to the simple maybe humble word this

39
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:10,560
that this is really a doorway to a greater capacity to belong to be at

40
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,239
home in this universe and but not at home in a way that is

41
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:22,800
passive but awakens our hearts capacity to care in a deep way

42
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,400
to give and receive care so that's what i recommend today is if

43
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,520
you'd like you might try as you meditate here to use the word this

44
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:43,440
and maybe the richness of that word word or what it points to can awaken in your heart

45
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,240
so to begin to

46
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,840
belong to the place in which you're sitting

47
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,759
there's a long tradition in buddhism to take the particular place you happen to be

48
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:08,080
meditating in the physical location of where you're that which receives the weight of your

49
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,880
body as being

50
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:24,320
you're the spot of awakening this spot this location

51
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:32,320
and so to feel the weight of your body being held by whatever that supports it

52
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:40,638
and maybe appreciate the support and that contact

53
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,600
and to relax and soften the gaze of your eyes

54
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:56,720
so you're not really looking at anything staring at anything

55
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,160
letting the eyes relax in the eye sockets

56
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,360
and if it's comfortable for you you're welcome to close your eyes

57
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:26,240
and as you exhale to release the holdings of your body

58
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:35,600
perhaps through your not relaxing your muscles releasing

59
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:41,199
your heart your mind from your concerns

60
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:48,880
not to abandon them but to let them be put aside for these few minutes

61
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:55,199
it's okay to allow yourself to be here in this

62
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,199
experience

63
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,120
relaxing deeply

64
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:23,840
and taking a few moments to feel your global body whatever way is easy

65
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:30,720
for you to be aware of your body a particular area of your body

66
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,960
or the whole body whatever comes easy to you

67
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:51,599
there's a tradition in buddhism to take your body as the meditation center the meditation hall

68
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,240
and to breathe in within this body

69
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:19,599
experiencing how the body experience knowing how the body experiences breathing

70
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,400
maybe as broadly as you can become aware of

71
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,159
the impact breathing has on the body

72
00:08:52,800 --> 00:09:00,480
as you exhale relaxing the tensions contractions

73
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,440
tightness of the mind

74
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,959
the pressure that might be associated with thinking

75
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,120
perhaps by stepping away from your concerns

76
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,680
and instead appreciating

77
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:39,760
the totality of our minds all that it does for us

78
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,839
stepping away from our concerns so there can be a greater appreciation

79
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,839
of this here

80
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,320
and then settling into your breathing maybe using the word this

81
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,000
when you breathe in this in breath

82
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:23,759
gently saying this as you exhale this exhale

83
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:34,480
or if you find yourself thinking you might say this this too was included in awareness

84
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:41,680
this is a marvel it's a wonder

85
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:49,360
a sound body sensation this

86
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,640
that opens the door to not to a

87
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:01,519
rejection of anything but this too is where we find belonging

88
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:11,160
care the ability to receive and give care

89
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,039
to be in your present moment experience

90
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,280
and to recognize it as this

91
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:50,640
this which welcomes everything including

92
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:56,159
yourself into being

93
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:02,520
into belonging here now

94
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,720
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

95
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:41,039
to appreciate that we have the capacity to

96
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:48,640
give and to receive care and then when we meditate

97
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:56,640
we're doing both giving care to ourselves and receiving

98
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:03,640
care from the meditation from the dharma

99
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:13,039
and to feel degree of gratitude or appreciation

100
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:21,840
for the circle of care

101
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,159
that happens in meditation

102
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:34,559
and then at the end of the meditation to expand that circle of care

103
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:42,559
out into the world we receive so much from the world

104
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:51,120
the air we breathe the water we drink the food the farmers provide

105
00:27:53,919 --> 00:28:00,640
so many people in the world are doing services that sustain our life

106
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,799
our lifestyle and it is a kind of care

107
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:14,080
that we receive and then we can return that care

108
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:20,080
and live in a circle of giving and receiving care

109
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:28,000
and this is what it means to belong one meaning of belonging

110
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:35,760
and so at the end of the sitting to consider whatever benefit we receive

111
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:41,440
from this practice known or unknown

112
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,320
immediate or benefit that comes over time

113
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,760
may that be somehow

114
00:28:53,240 --> 00:29:01,039
transformed or inspire us

115
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:08,399
to share those benefits with others to extend ourselves

116
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:13,840
to serve and care for the world around us

117
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:20,000
may we contribute to the welfare and happiness

118
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,039
of others may the benefits of our practice

119
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:29,360
spread from us out into the world and

120
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:37,279
providing peace compassion care generosity

121
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:45,120
love good will out into the world

122
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:50,720
so that all beings may one day experience

123
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,799
happiness and peace and freedom and safety

124
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:02,760
may this practice we do benefit the world

125
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:14,599
[Music]

126
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:25,120
so before i begin this talk a couple of announcements

127
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:31,679
at the end of the talk i'll open a zoom room and we can have a community meeting

128
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:38,640
and on zoom and now the zoom link is um right now it's posted at the right near the second

129
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:45,279
to the top chat in the chat uh here and i'll post it again at some point

130
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:52,000
at the bottom near the bottom of the chat and i'll just i'll tell you when at the after the talk

131
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,720
and it's also um on the youtube page if you look probably underneath below the

132
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:05,840
the video picture that's going on where it says inside meditation center and some details there

133
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,320
it also has the zoom link there you might have to copy and paste it

134
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:18,240
and finally it's also on on the what's new

135
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:25,440
section of imc's home page and the bottom right hand corner there's a set little section called what's new

136
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,760
and they're one of the top things there is a link to the

137
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:38,000

138
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,080

139
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:49,760
and um so hopefully all those with the areas work and if you uh and then the second is

140
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:55,840
that um today and then again on sunday is a day that all the

141
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:02,240
donations which aren't specified clearly for other purposes all the donations that are coming into imc

142
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:08,320
uh we'll turn around and and give them to partners in health it's a wonderful

143
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:14,240
non-profit that does work in haiti and they're kind of on the ground working

144
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,919
with uh some 5 000 or so local health care providers people working in villages

145
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:26,720
nurses and doctors in the rural countryside all over um and where they're partnering with

146
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:32,720
people there to provide the kind of care that both the haitian government is not doing

147
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:39,360
and and many people don't have access to help so many people there who are suffering from the earthquake from

148
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:45,360
poverty from storms from uh now now a dysfunctional government

149
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:52,000
and so to support people there and i think it's a wonderful thing and these neighbors of ours

150
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,039
or can we say are our fellow citizens on our north american

151
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:02,480
kind of continent here and um

152
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:08,480
so it'd be lovely to see our youtube community we've never done this before kind of come together and as a group

153
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:15,360
kind of care for to offer you know we talk about benefiting the world the end of our sitting and here's a chance maybe to do

154
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:21,679
it more as a community so um

155
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,720
so thank you so for the talk today

156
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,880
um the general topic maybe the title can be service

157
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:40,159
faith as service and then and the idea of service um

158
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:47,200
is uh to offer care and but to offer care in that when we combine the idea of faith

159
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:54,640
uh it's maybe it's associated a little bit with devotion a little bit with trust a little bit with generosity

160
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:00,640
that faith is uh can also involve not only what we receive if what we trust

161
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:08,800
and kind of just allow for it's also something deeper in that it's also a wellspring of what we offer

162
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:15,599
that it's an action of expression of our love an expression of our faith expression of

163
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:21,280
where we place our hearts what uh what inspires us in some deep way

164
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,398
and and so faith is not we're only recipients in having faith we're

165
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:31,760
actually givers and to really have faith i think it really

166
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:37,200
helps to also to if there is a feeling or recognition

167
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:42,638
inside that there's a desire for action to do something

168
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:49,118
and many times it's its desire to serve um

169
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:56,320
whatever the source is for the faith to support it to help it out to benefit

170
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:02,400
it but it could be faith can this kind of the service aspect of faith

171
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,680
doesn't have to be to some particular the source of the faith your religion

172
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:13,599
for example or your community religious community or practice community but it could be

173
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:20,000
faith can elicit this desire to out of love or a care compassion out of

174
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,720
a fullness of heart to uh serve oh people anywhere in the world maybe

175
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:33,040
haiti maybe other places maybe your neighbors maybe more fully in your own family

176
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:39,920
and this idea of service to serve is a beautiful thing of the heart

177
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:47,760
it's a there's um it's kind of a wonderful rich multifaceted quality of generosity

178
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:54,880
of love of care and there's something about caring that's really uh

179
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:01,760
part of freedom non-clinging which i talked about yesterday as we don't cling to anything there's

180
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:07,200
much more room in the heart than the mind to be responsive to the world around us

181
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:14,880
responsive to the suffering and the joys of the world and to respond in a way that feels like uh we're expanding

182
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:21,119
um the the faith or expanding our freedom expanding our love out into the world in

183
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:26,880
some wonderful way and so to serve out of faith

184
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,800
is not to want anything in return but rather it's just a clear clean

185
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:38,839
expression of generosity of serving something that's valuable to

186
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:45,200
serve and uh and this language that i use in the meditation that

187
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:51,280
the circles of giving and receiving and to have those circles be to flow and

188
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:58,480
move and and turn freely not to be clogged up or stopped or not have the brakes on or

189
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:05,280
um you know if a wheel if you take the you know half of the wheel away

190
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:12,079
it's not a wheel anymore it won't roll you need the whole wheel to roll and so the wheel of giving and receiving

191
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:17,760
giving and receiving that arises not out of a should not out of obligation

192
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:23,760
but from being settled in some deep way in our hearts in a way that

193
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:29,200
something here we trust here we have a devotion to here we have

194
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:36,800
confidence in yesterday i talked about the confidence and non-clinging and to rest in that confidence is not a

195
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,839
passive thing but it it's kind of like the soil

196
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:47,440
the nutrients for then responding to the world

197
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:53,359
a response which again i want to emphasize is not an obligation but it feels like the most natural thing in the

198
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:59,440
world it's just what flows out of it the liberated heart

199
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:06,720
the heart and the heart that's filled with this kind of dharma faith that heart that goes for refuge

200
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:13,280
is not a passive heart it's one that has an orientation and a motivation and inspiration

201
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:19,760
to act in a new way to live a new way and uh and one of the ways of

202
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:27,440
understanding this is to live with care to uh to offer care

203
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:33,040
to care for [Music] you know it's in some ways it's natural

204
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:38,960
to care for um i think i you know say it a little differently um one of the wonderful

205
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:44,160
things to do is to care for the place in which you're practicing

206
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:49,440
that's part of the practice is the care for the place you practice part of

207
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:55,119
practice is to care for the world in which you practice

208
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:00,720
and that world spreads out beyond any walls beyond any boundaries and

209
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:07,838
open-ended and so to do that with it as a sense of

210
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:14,560
the kind of service that is almost like a devotional service or

211
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:20,960
an expression of love or good will so i've talked about all these different

212
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:26,839
qualities characteristics of faith this week and there's many more faith is a rich rich capacity

213
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:32,320
thing and and as i said in meditation i think that

214
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:39,440
i actually prefer not to have not to believe that i know exactly what faith is

215
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:46,320
i can talk about different aspects of it but it feels much more in harmony with

216
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:54,079
faith with this deep trust not to know fully what it is and not knowing

217
00:39:54,079 --> 00:40:01,440
to open myself to like trust it or appreciate something

218
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:08,599
larger and bigger than anything i could know anything that i could um

219
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:15,760
have control over or possess or or

220
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:22,480
and so there's a kind of a wonderful feeling of of this willingness

221
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:30,000
to be open that doesn't have to know but is ready to serve ready to care

222
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,800
ready to participate in this world as if i belong here we belong here

223
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:44,640
we're belonging is this wonderful circle of giving and receiving care

224
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:51,760
and maybe in the end this practice that we do

225
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,520
is a practice that

226
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:03,839
transforms us into free beings

227
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:10,079
that are deeply connected to our communities and our world in this mutuality of giving and

228
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:15,119
receiving care this so service

229
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:21,838
is an element of faith so thank you
