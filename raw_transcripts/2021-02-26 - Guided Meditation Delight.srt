1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,200
so warm greetings from redwood city

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,240
and it looks like it's going to be a

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,920
beautiful blue day blue sky

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:25,599
and uh the vast blue sky with no clouds in it

5
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:34,480
is sometimes seen as a metaphor analogy for

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:41,760
our mind and to begin appreciating the

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,320
sense of settleness wholeness clarity that can come through

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:57,198
meditation practice arouses arouses evokes

9
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:07,040
a sense of delight or satisfaction or being pleased

10
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,600
in this opportunity to sit with oneself to sit and meditate

11
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:21,280
and and that is the 10th step of these 16 steps

12
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:30,320
is being pleased or steeply satisfied or delighted the word can mean rejoice

13
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,360
and there's something about stepping back a little bit and appreciating this opportunity to

14
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,799
meditate and then as the meditation as we become more

15
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:52,320
centered in the moment with ourselves becoming more whole more whole here then

16
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,840
there is um

17
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:05,118
hopefully some deep sense of beings of satisfaction in this process

18
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,160
so here we are and

19
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:21,280
we've been doing this some of us for a while now and so to take your usual meditation

20
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,840
posture or the one that is the right

21
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:37,840
for now and gently close your eyes

22
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,280
and even if you're agitated about something if you're sitting in your regular

23
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:54,800
meditation posture is there um

24
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,000
something comforting about doing so

25
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:10,239
something settling or something familiar that's

26
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:18,080
feels good to be in this posture

27
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,640
if you've been doing this little ritual of taking a few deep breaths at the

28
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:32,400
beginning is that also something becoming a little bit comforting or settling or familiar

29
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,760
that you can get settled into so taking a few long slow deep

30
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:47,840
breaths and as you exhale

31
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:57,920
to relax maybe a long slow deep long slow exhale

32
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,840
settling in here

33
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:15,920
the deep inhale is a chance to feel the fullness of the body the

34
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:23,919
width and breadth of the body or the wholeness of the body that's always more whole than the parts

35
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:32,479
always greater than the particular places of discomfort or distress that we might have to take a

36
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:39,520
deep breath in that spreads the awareness through the body so the awareness is

37
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,360
more encompasses more than any particular issues we have

38
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:55,040
and to exhale to let go of this intensity of some of

39
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:01,120
the thoughts and concerns soften and quiet the mind

40
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:07,680
soften and quiet the heart and the inner your inner life

41
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,840
settling in

42
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:24,160
and then taking breathing normally

43
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:32,720
and to some degree the process of meditation is a process of coming to a kind of wholeness

44
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:39,120
where all things are kind of held together without any

45
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,800
and divide within us everything has a place

46
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:53,600
and the relaxing of the body moves in that direction

47
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,479
on the exhale relaxing the muscles of the face

48
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:20,479
on the exhale relaxing the muscles of the shoulder

49
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:35,120
on the exhale relaxing in the chest

50
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:49,840
and on the exhale relaxing the belly softening the belly

51
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:24,960
and perhaps on the exhale there's a way of releasing the whole body

52
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:35,199
releasing the way we might be bracing ourselves we're releasing the way we're

53
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:45,840
leaning ahead of ourselves

54
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,759
and then feeling the breathing

55
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:16,720
for a few moments familiarizing yourself

56
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:27,840
with your breathing the experience of it

57
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:53,760
and then whatever pleasure or joy

58
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:00,399
well-being that might be here even if it's in the cracks between

59
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:06,839
other things breathe with a pleasure breathe with a

60
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:14,079
well-being tingling in the body a warmth the glow

61
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,240
feeling of pleasure and the breathing maybe

62
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,800
or as you relax a kind of spread of

63
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,120
energy through the body that has a pleasant quality

64
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:51,839
breathe with a pleasant

65
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:39,360
and as you exhale relax the mental activity

66
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:47,839
quieting your thinking

67
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:01,839
relaxing any tension or contraction in the thinking mind

68
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:12,720
maybe relaxing the thinking mind on the exhale

69
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:19,519
and letting the mind become broader wider quieter

70
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:34,240
kind of like the waves on a vast lake the waves quiet down and the top of the

71
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:40,240
lake becomes still quiet the flatness the calm

72
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:57,839
stretching wide out towards the horizon so the mind gets quieter

73
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:01,279
and then be breathing with your mind state noticing the general mind mood

74
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:08,800
the atmosphere of your inner life breathing with it

75
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:18,240
allowing it to be the way it is but being mindful of it as you breathe

76
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,880
maybe appreciating

77
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:36,560
that a mood or a state is broad wide

78
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,240
maybe has no boundaries

79
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:49,839
his soft transparent translucent

80
00:13:52,399 --> 00:14:02,639
that mind state is not a solid thing it has no weight

81
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,759
maybe no color

82
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,600
maybe appreciating

83
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:19,839
the insubstantiality of mind state

84
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:31,839
breathing with it breathing through it

85
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,279
and rather than letting your mind drift off in thought

86
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:13,839
let your mind be concerned more with the breathing

87
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:23,680
breathing in the middle of this wider hole of body and

88
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:29,920
feelings and mind state

89
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:41,839
appreciating the breadth and the width of this whole

90
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:55,679
and then is there anything about sitting here now if you really settle in really connect

91
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:02,960
to the direct experience of meditating that has a feeling of satisfaction or

92
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:11,520
goodness to it something that's pleasing or something that makes you feel glad

93
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:20,159
or delighted being delighted in the being on the path

94
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:27,840
of practice having a practice being settled

95
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,080
not caught up in the busyness of the day

96
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:41,600
breathe with what is pleasing not so much the ideas of it

97
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,960
but maybe the ideas give rise to

98
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:55,760
an embodied feeling of satisfaction joy delight

99
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:04,960
in this experience of becoming moving towards wholeness or subtleness or ease

100
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:16,320
more peacefulness

101
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:25,120
and breathe with that satisfaction that delight and breathe with it in a way

102
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,159
that helps the mind become more quiet

103
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,799
a quiet breathing

104
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,399
with the inner delight and satisfaction

105
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,840
of being here now

106
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:54,320
instead of caught up in activities and concerns and thoughts

107
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,840
the goodness of just being here meditating

108
00:27:54,399 --> 00:28:02,399
stepped hand of anapanasati is breathing in

109
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:17,840
delighting the mind breathing out delighting the mind

110
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:32,799
and how might you look out onto the world with eyes of the

111
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:38,559
light how might you look upon the world

112
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:45,840
with eyes of kindness and love

113
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:50,799
how might you look out from your heart

114
00:28:52,720 --> 00:29:01,440
sharing delight sharing joy as if it's food

115
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,120
for the for the hungry

116
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:16,960
as if it is a missing resource in our lives

117
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:27,840
to no delight to no joy

118
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:41,840
and to look upon others having delight in them

119
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:54,960
appreciating others with respect and love and and may it be

120
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:01,200
that our delight and appreciation and respect for others

121
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:11,919
that we concern us ourselves with their happiness their safety

122

and may our delight and joy the existence of others support that

129
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,240
