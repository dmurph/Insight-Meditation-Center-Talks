wherever you're joining us from i really appreciate your presence here

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,480
gives me an opportunity to reflect on this practice and these

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,000
teachings aimed for our liberation

7
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:49,120
so we starting with a guided practice so you can find

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:58,000
the posture that best supports you

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,280
i'm just taking your time to find that posture

10
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:13,840
the intention is to be a lot awake and yet relaxed

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:40,159
bringing the attention to the body noticing how the body is

12
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,479
welcoming this body as it is

13
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:58,640
noticing the solidity of the body on the chair the cushion

14
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:09,440
spine is straight neck is long

15
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:17,599
the head is balanced at the top of the neck it's helpful

16
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:24,480
to tilt your chin towards the chest

17
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:32,400
it allows for an opening where the top of the neck meets with a

18
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:40,079
skull that allows for easy flow of energy

19
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,879
the hands rest on the left

20
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:02,319
if you move your lower back just a little bit towards the belly

21
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:08,480
you will notice the lifting of the upper body

22
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,800
opening of the chest area

23
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:24,400
and shoulders easily relax without movement of the lower back

24
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:33,840
moving towards the belly

25
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:42,720
softening the face dropping the jaw

26
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:52,080
allows for release of tension enhancing a sense of relaxation

27
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:04,000
away of the whole body release the body weight into the chair

28
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,200
of the cushion and noticing the pressure

29
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,958
where the part meets with the chair or the cushion

30
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:27,600
if you are on a chair notice the sensations in the soles of your feet

31
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,840
where your feet meet with earth

32
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,840
noticing the movement of the breath

33
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:57,840
resting your attention with the breath

34
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,840
taking your time to find a good posture

35
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:25,840
upright and yet relaxed awake and alert

36
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:39,840
can be helpful at the beginning of your seating to take a few long deep breaths in

37
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:06,800
we're allowing the breath to return to its normal review

38
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:14,880
we will use the breath as a place of anchoring our attention

39
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:23,759
whenever the mind goes away gets lost in thought

40
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:35,840
when we're not as that we bring back the attention to rest on the breathing

41
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,919
you

42
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:23,840
noticing where the breath is most felt

43
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:35,599
could be other nostrils as you breathe in the coolness of the air

44
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:44,639
as you breathe out warm air

45
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,000
is experienced

46
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,479
or it could be with the expansion of the chest

47
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:02,560
and the contraction of the chest as you breathe in

48
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:10,840
and breathing out oh it's the rise and the fall of the

49
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:18,160
belly just take your time and see

50
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:25,440
of those three places where is breath most experienced

51
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:41,839
then let your attention pressed three

52
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:52,560
mind will go away past or to the future

53
00:09:52,720 --> 00:10:00,480
we don't make a problem out of that this practice is about returning

54
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,839
bring back the attention to the body

55
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:19,839
resting the attention and the breathing

56
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:32,640
can be helpful to make a soft mental note

57
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:40,160
that goes breathing in breathing out

58
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,040
putting in

59
00:10:47,040 --> 00:11:01,839
bringing out

60
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:18,320
as the mind settles here with a breath we can release

61
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:29,839
the mental motive

62
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:40,639
we continue to up the rest of this setting to bring the mind back

63
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:53,839
allow the mind to rest the breathing

64
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,480
noticing how the breath is

65
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,320
maybe long maybe short

66
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:35,839
maybe smooth it is staggered

67
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:49,839
whichever way it is that's just fine

68
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,839
as the mind settles

69
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:42,959
we open our awareness to any predominant experience

70
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,079
that is there [Music]

71
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:59,839
maybe sounds maybe sensations

72
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:15,600
quotes and notice

73
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,199
what is here

74
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:41,839
one can always return the attention to rest the breathing

75
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:48,079
in a moment i'm going to add another dimension

76
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:55,839
to this kind of practice

77
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,440
where we reflect on the theme of good will

78
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,240
generosity

79
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:19,360
aim is enhancement for well-being

80
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:27,759
when we cultivate goodwill cultivation verizon

81
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:40,399
so i invite you to remember how it has felt like

82
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:51,839
for someone to be generous to you

83
00:16:52,639 --> 00:17:01,440
someone may have supported you in a way that just clicks in a positive

84
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,839
way for you

85
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:19,839
i'm just allowing the mind to linger on the actual feelings

86
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:25,360
how it has felt

87
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:33,840
to receive generosity from another

88
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,840
taking your time to be with the thought experience

89
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,160
staying with how it shows

90
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,559
allowing the body to relax with these

91
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:34,720
feelings to support this experience i invite you to bring

92
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:43,840
to mind someone who gladdens your heart

93
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,760
someone you're grateful to maybe respect

94
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:11,840
but her sense of respect brings joy to the heart

95
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:29,440
getting the feel of that cut feeling

96
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:39,840
joyful glad because of this person

97
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:58,159
adding to this experience i invite you to bring an image

98
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:07,840
of a good friend or a beloved pet

99
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:17,120
imagine this person or this pet giving you

100
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,840
full attention

101
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:35,760
get a sense of how it falls to be in a space like that

102
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,320
maybe there's a feeling of warmth

103
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:49,520
welcoming space a friendly space

104
00:20:49,520 --> 00:21:03,840
carrying space

105
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,480
allowing yourself to be with these

106
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,840
feelings

107
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:36,880
now invite you to imagine opening up the space

108
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:45,840
and sharing it with other people

109
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:57,360

110
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,080
friendliness space that's welcoming

111

to as many people as you can imagine

112
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:27,840
i'm just noticing how it feels to do this

113
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:37,919
now you can release the images and focus

114
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:55,840
by bringing attention on how the body is just now

115
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,840
attentive to the body

116
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:36,360
away with the body at ease maybe

117
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:51,840
relaxed refreshed

118
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,840

i like to invite you to pause

123
00:31:53,600 --> 00:32:01,120
