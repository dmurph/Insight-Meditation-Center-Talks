1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:05,700
oh hello and welcome to happy hour

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:12,660
so for today's practice um I think what I like to do is to invite

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:19,740
us to start with a a settling with a quiet meditation

4
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:26,060
and the inspiration for today's practice is um

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:33,840
is uh is happiness is happiness and the path of practice

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:41,520
the Buddha was known as the happy one as the happy one man there is no

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,980
no shame no problem in in Wishing happiness in fact it's part of the meta

8
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:53,460
wish wishing for ourselves to be happy wishing for others to be happy

9
00:00:53,460 --> 00:01:01,260
um and and offering it so the inspiration today is offering this wish for happiness as a

10
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:07,500
wish as a blessing not attached to it oh I'm not happy I want to be happy why I'm not

11
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,780
happy in this area of so if you become really contracted around happiness or

12
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,939
lack of Happiness that's a sure way to become unhappy it's the perfect recipe

13
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:24,600
for unhappiness just but but if wishes for happiness are are

14
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,840
shared as an intention as a blessing as a good will as a gift without attachment

15
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,860
as a gift without strings attached you don't give gifts with strings attached

16
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:43,619
so why would you give yourself gifts with strings attached I wish

17
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:49,500
myself well I really do tight no no no no may I be well may there be happiness

18
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,540
May there be Joy blessing and and seeing the effect of

19
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:01,560
that playing around with that so that's the the little inspiration for today's

20
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,600
practice and we'll play around with it

21
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:12,840
so with that invite I invite us to settle

22
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:19,200
into our bodies In This Moment In Time whatever is

23
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,920
arising and then connecting with the body

24
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,739
with the Earth the contact points

25
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,620
on with the breath in the body

26
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:15,620
and letting each breath be easeful calming soothing

27
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,760
pilling the soil

28
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,640
for ease

29
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:35,700
nowhere to go nothing to do the happiness of just being here with this breath so much

30
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:42,599
happiness happiness of undistractibility

31
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,780
not wanting just here with the breath

32
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:55,200
let's explore this happiness first as much as it's available

33
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,579
and after thoughts distractions the happiness of releasing letting go

34
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,500
non-judgment

35
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,759
and as if you're returning your radio tuning your radio your perception your

36
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:21,060
awareness tune into the subtle radio station

38
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,319

39
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:37,160
but it's definitely here for every single one of us

40
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:48,600
no matter the conditions the body and the heart and mind it's very subtle

41
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:55,819
you can just be perceived perhaps as quiet

42
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,259
settlement settling peace

43
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:10,919

47
00:07:56,099 --> 00:08:01,139

65
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:45,440
along with everything else but this is what I choose to tune into

66
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:51,000
and you can say if you wish I am happy

67
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:59,600

68
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:07,680

70
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:16,459

71
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:26,959
or may I be may I tune to it see what works play around

72
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:43,560
offer it as a wish as a blessing as an invocation aspiration to lift your

73
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,740
heart

74
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,940
turn towards the good

75
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:11,600
and be very subtle it's okay

76
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:28,640
or maybe it's just simply I'm okay I'm okay

77
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:45,240
and if this practice of tuning into this goodness the wellness contentment

78
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:52,140
happiness is working a subtle way bringing Happiness joy

79
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:57,860
as an act of matter you can continue stay with this

80
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:08,179
and if you like to switch to the more familiar may I be happy you can do that as well

81
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:17,480
as I met a wish for yourself either way

82
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,020
foreign

83
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,480
foreign

84
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:17,960
and as we turn to bring this sit to a close

85
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:26,760
feeling into any nuances of contentment peace joy

86
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:33,380
happiness might have been touched into tuned into

87
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:41,960
with appreciation letting them reverberate through your body one more time

88
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:50,299
there would be gratitude appreciation even for the slightest bit which again could be co-existent with

89
00:26:50,299 --> 00:26:54,440
challenges pain difficulty

90
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:02,299
and the attuning into what's good what's here already

91
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:10,080
and appreciating with with wholeheartedness

92
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:18,000
interesting that we are planting seeds of kindness Goodwill

93
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,720
a meta wishing ourselves well seeing ourselves while tuning into happiness is an act of

94
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:31,919
matter it's not taking ourselves for granted but taking care of our heart to tune

95
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:37,380
into contentment joy happiness self-love

96
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:44,760
the way of loving ourselves ending to our hearts

97
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:51,360
and trusting that we're planting seeds kindness care

98
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:56,820
love for ourselves and for others

99
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:03,000
to be more available or patient with others when we're happy

100
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:11,059
content and of service may we be of service

101
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:17,640

102
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:24,440

range of possibilities and and again there's so many different

109
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:22,320
channels in the mind and the heart and as I shared with you with my body there's a lot of pain right now and

110
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,539
possible to tune into tune into happiness tune into yeah there was

114
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:54,240
in pain of course you know as human beings we often get so narrow our Focus

115
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:00,179
gets so narrow especially when we have difficulty that becomes the only thing that's happening in our field of

116
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:05,880
experience completely pushing out everything else but there's so much

117
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:11,760
presence so many things that we can tune into so this was a an invitation to tune

118
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:17,940
into contentment goodness peace happiness right here and now

119
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:24,320
um and and listen to it more and more Let It reverberate and see what happens

120
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:31,320

else well that was the invitation and if it worked for you this this way

124
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:56,880
of tuning into meta and self-care great if it didn't work no problem no worries

125
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:02,100
there's so many ways so many doors into the temple

126
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:08,100
so the invitation now as we turn to small groups together

127
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:15,840
is to uh to if you wish you are welcome to share

128
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:21,659
um one one nugget about how this practice was for you oh this part oh there was an

129
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:27,539
aha moment here or this was challenging just one nugget but you practice if you

130
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:35,520
wish or you can also share um silence just kind-hearted silencing just

131
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:41,399
being present and you can say pass when your turn comes and next person will share we'll say

132
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:47,220
pass and next person will share or say pass and your turn comes again so so you'll go around and around hopefully a

133
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:54,000
couple of times not having a long monologue but but uh but just brief and

134
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:02,820
also be inspired because as odd as you listen to others you can be inspired by what they found what how they practiced

135
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:08,580
how they turned to this practice and just sharing from your own

136
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:13,620
experience not asking questions from others not directing anyone else's

137
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:19,260
experience showing as you are with kindness with humility

138
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:25,380
um and with aspiration to support others and be supported

139
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:31,860
um offering again as a way of being held witness not to impress not to

140
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:37,279
we're really speaking for our own benefit not for anybody else's benefit

141
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:43,740

time this endless thinking and uh and for me the the tuning in it was really

160
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:50,280
subtle as you mentioned and uh and for me that it wasn't so much

161
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:57,359
happiness happiness but this sort of every once in a while I would it was just quiet and it was her for me it was

162
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:05,000
like this relief of like oh god wow this is nice and um anyway thank you so much

163
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:12,420
beautiful thanks so much for sharing that Don I love it yes yes that's exactly it it's subtle they take some

164
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:18,480
tuning and there are different nuances that arise right which is this oh this sense of relief just as you you

165
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:24,119
beautifully shared oh how nice how nice it is subtle happiness so if you have

166
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:29,640
actually time to to tune into it more of that that sense of relief is is a subtle

167
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:35,160
form of Happiness yes yeah I see your nodding yeah yeah sweet beautiful that's

168
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:40,980
exactly it love it yay yay and know that this practice is always

169
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:47,760
available to you especially when there's yeah thoughts and worries and concerns and concentration yeah I'm going to tune

170
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:53,280
to something different which is already here trust that it's here for every single one of us

171
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,800
I know that it's here for all of us

172
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:04,400
I trust it nowhere else please

173
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:12,380
maybe you'll take one more reflection red

174
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:20,339
hi hi I was saying to my group that sometimes uh with a meditation like this

175
00:36:20,339 --> 00:36:26,700
with a with a suggestion involved where the fine-tuning I'll experience something in

176
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:32,040
the midst of it and then maybe a few hours later it will

177
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:37,680
will come back with greater force and I I'll feel something that

178
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:43,320
um I'll be surprised by I mean I will associate it with the meditation but it

179
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:50,160
will seem to have come around a corner and it's you know it's a happy surprise and one of the people in our group uh

180
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:56,880
use the um likened it to ripening which I thought was a really a really apt way of

181
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:02,339
putting it that it it needs to sit it incubates it uh

182
00:37:02,339 --> 00:37:07,579
I don't know why but it just seems to need a little extra time sometimes

183
00:37:07,579 --> 00:37:14,280
thank you thank you Fred thanks so much for bringing that into the space how how

184
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:22,560
powerful how important to to share that for everyone's benefit yes pay attention

185
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:28,740
and yes it does need time to ripen we are planting seeds we completely are

186
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:34,440
planting seeds even if we feel during the meditation you know something happened or not much happened or mine

187
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:40,680
was all distracting or later oh yeah well look at that and yeah so powerful
