00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:08,240
good morning and warm greetings This is a sound

2
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:20,560
check also an invitation to let me know if um you're

3
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,800
on the chat or to silently reflect what you noticed yesterday in

4
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:33,120
your practice what you noticed about staying in your seat connecting to

5
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,360
the

6
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:45,879
moment Great Thank you for the sound feedback

7
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:03,080
So this today we will be um on the fourth of fifth fourth of

8
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:08,320
five inspirations for insight this week's

9
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:13,520
series and

10
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:20,880
um invitation is to find a meditation

11
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:30,640
posture that helps connect you to the moment after you've finished whatever last bits of settling in need to

12
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:43,759
happen Perhaps taking a couple of longer slower deeper

13
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,320
breaths Inviting the attention

14
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:02,560
inwards relaxing

15
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,920
softening allowing the breath to connect you with your core

16
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,319
and then allowing the breathing to be

17
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:50,239
natural and settling in Noticing the sensations of being

18
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:59,319
alive warmth or cool a feeling of

19
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:04,120
await And feelings of lightness

20
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,440
Noticing motion vibrancy in the

21
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:38,519
body inviting attunement to that

22
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,560
vibrancy the language of sensation

23
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:58,840
Allowing attention to settle on the process of breathing

24
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,120
Setting aside concerns of there or

25
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:51,080
then to tune in to the natural [Music]

26
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,638
rhythm of your body

27
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:57,120
Attending with care kindness to any thoughts

28
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:06,638
emotions distractions that come up Noticing them allowing them to

29
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:14,759
persist and reconnecting with this

30
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:19,080
breath This moment

31
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,560
noticing whatever arises with simplicity

32
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,479
Allowing the mind the

33
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:12,720
heart to rest in

34
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:20,039
Contact with whatever is soothing whatever is [Music]

35
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:26,199
connecting in embodied experience at this moment

36
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:55,120
And as you settle into this meditation

37
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:06,200
practice noticing anything that contracts the heart and mind

38
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,440
that brings up more

39
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,920
tension Seeing if it's possible to soften around

40
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:30,760
it Perhaps take a step back Allow space for it to move through

41
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,639
And noticing any sensations or feelings of

42
00:12:55,639 --> 00:13:02,800
ease comfort pleasant sensations

43
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:15,360
and appreciating those without hanging

44
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:26,839
on allowing them resting in them

45
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,559
In these last minutes of meditation together

46
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:06,919
Noticing how it feels in this moment in the body heart and mind

47
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,320
Taking a moment to reflect

48
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:26,960
back if there were any moments of challenge or

49
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,480
difficulty Meeting them with

50
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:49,039
compassion And if there are any moments of goodness of

51
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:55,529
benefit kindness [Music]

52
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:01,360
calm steadiness

53
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:11,600
awareness appreciating those noticing

54
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:19,699
them Perhaps reflecting on what fed or supported [Music]

55
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:44,600
them Allowing them to soak through your own

56
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,240
system Nourish your

57
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:10,480
practice And then from that place perhaps with an internal gesture

58
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:17,440
of generosity offering the benefits of this

59
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,559
practice outwards to the others in your life the others in this

60
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,559
world

61
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,960
May they be safe

62
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:43,039
happy healthy May they be

63
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,679
peaceful at ease and

64
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:58,880
free May the goodness of this practice ripple out

65
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:05,799
through our own minds and hearts and lives to all of the lives we

66
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:12,039
touch and all of the lives they touch outwards and

67
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:18,600
outwards May all beings be safe happy

68
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:24,840
peaceful and free And may this

69
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:30,600
practice be a cause and condition for the growth of love and liberation and

70
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:35,080
peace in our world

71
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,360
Thank you for the sincerity of your practice

72
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,278
So warm greetings

73
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:50,799
SA Today as I mentioned earlier is the fourth of fifth five um talks in a

74
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:57,360
series on inspirations for insight These are stories from the time of the

75
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:03,120
Buddha and soaking some of the wisdom out of them together in ways that

76
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:09,600
support the arising of insight in our practice So today

77
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:15,279
uh when we left off yesterday the Buddha had just awakened We're fast forwarding

78
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:20,960
some time now and it's a story that happened not

79
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:30,120
long after his young son Rahula joined the order ordained and um this particular

80
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:35,960
story happens when Rahula is about 7 years old and it starts in mid

81
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:42,320
conversation and it's clear from the first question the Buddha asks

82
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:47,360
um that young Rahula had told a lie A

83
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:53,039
lie which was later discovered So we can all relate to this having been kids and

84
00:32:53,039 --> 00:33:01,840
maybe having lied since then The Buddha gently shows his son using a

85
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:10,320
bowl that um a lying progressively lying in the can

86
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:15,440
have a negative effect on spiritual practice He

87
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:22,240
describes um a bowl being almost empty as empty as of water as being as empty

88
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,679
as a person becomes in the spiritual life if they repeatedly lie And then he

89
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,720
kind of dramatically turns the bowl over and then turns it back upright to show

90
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:40,399
no water left And that that is the effect over time And we can imagine that his young

91
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:45,679
son became sharply attentive in this moment So it wasn't a shaming

92
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:53,120
conversation or a blaming conversation but it was direct And the Buddha rather than um

93
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:58,399
sort of castigating him or finger wagging then provides a teaching a kind

94
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:04,880
of a pathy teaching to guide him in kind of a compass for behavior in the future

95
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,878
A compass to empathize with others and to recognize the impact of his actions

96
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:16,240
on himself and others And the teaching starts out with

97
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:23,280
the Buddha asking "What is the purpose of a mirror son?" And Rahula says "Well for

98
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,800
reflection sir." And the Buddha then says "Just

99
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:36,720
like that you should reflect before each action of body speech and

100
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:43,919
mind Will it cause affliction suffering in myself the other person myself and

101
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:52,398
the other And if so don't do it And then the Buddha goes on and I'm

102
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:58,560
paraphrasing here because it's actually quite long I'm summarizing You should reflect during

103
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:06,560
each action of body speech and mind Will this cause affliction or harm And if so

104
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:13,920
stop doing it Right Then and then reflecting after each

105
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:21,280
action of body speech or mind Will this has this caused affliction or harm in

106
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:30,000
myself in the other person or people or in all concerned And if so make a resolve not

107
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:38,800
to repeat that So on the other hand the Buddha says if

108
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:46,280
you reflect before during and after each action of body speech and mind and

109
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:54,720
discover oh this action led to benefit to goodness for myself the other person

110
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:02,880
or all involved then it is fine to do to continue the action to repeat it

111
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,440
So again the image of a mirror reflecting on inward and outward

112
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:14,599
actions It's another way of talking about karma kama action and

113
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:23,640
result It's also a teaching on conditionality cause and effect and

114
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:28,680
empathy Powerful guide to behavior Simple enough for a

115
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:34,480
seven-year-old And we're not talking here about absolute standards of right

116
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:40,560
and wrong Instead what's offered is a simple way

117
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:47,280
to use self-reflection as a compass for all of the actions of life Is it harmful

118
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:58,920
or beneficial Is it afflictive or conducive to healing to peace to care

119
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:10,040
So I found this teaching supports insight both directly and indirectly As a direct support for

120
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:16,440
insight reflect on my own mind on your own mind And with mindful awareness it's

121
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:23,839
possible to observe one's own internal speech and actions of thought to assess

122
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:30,320
which are afflictive to oneself or others and to refrain from giving them

123
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:36,640
any energy or excess energy Well for most people it's usually

124
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,920
easiest to start this by reflecting after meditation maybe right at the end

125
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:47,480
of a meditation as we did at the end of this meditation preceding my

126
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:55,000
talk With practice what this repeated reflection does is help a

127
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,880
spontaneous wordless understanding to arise during meditation during an act of

128
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:06,559
me mental speech during an act of

129
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:15,400
thinking So using this kind of reflection is not an invitation to fight the difficult forces in your own mind

130
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:20,680
Rather it's an invitation to meet them with softness

131
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:29,400
care and understanding of their conditioned nature and to notice Notice the

132
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,760
impact Notice the impact

133
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:40,119
Eventually through this process that which causes suffering

134
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:45,480
dissolves it softens or is transformed

135
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:54,000
into wisdom Arrows into flowers We learn from our own

136
00:38:54,839 --> 00:39:01,760
duka Lama Surya Das Um I was at a talk of his once and um he was asked if any

137
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:08,160
of his neurosis had disappeared over his many many years decades of meditation

138
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:15,839
And I was so struck by his answer He kind of laughed and he said "Nothing's gone away but it's so light now that I

139
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:22,640
don't pay any attention to it It has no affliction for me It's just the mind

140
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:30,079
doing its thing." I'm paraphrasing there So eventually the suffering is

141
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:35,520
transformed either into wisdom or into something that we can just shrug smile

142
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:43,359
say "Okay nature of the mind The system our systems learn through

143
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:48,440
this process that for example generosity feels better than

144
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:54,760
stinginess That kindness has a much more beneficial effect than

145
00:39:54,760 --> 00:40:00,640
harshness That simplicity simplicity is more easeful

146
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:08,480
than complication And another thing I take from this story

147
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:16,920
is that mindfulness mindful awareness is a form of honesty

148
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,240
You'll notice this in your own practice that the understanding and capacity to

149
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:30,240
see one's own mental activity can get sharper keener subtler more

150
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:36,920
conducive to insight Especially if we get interested in

151
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:45,000
this reflection before and after affliction harm benefit ease that begins

152
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:53,599
to invite more discernment into the mind And this simple teaching invites us

153
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:58,880
to turn our life energy and attention to cultivating those internal mental

154
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:05,680
actions that are beneficial whole making

155
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:13,599
simplifying gradually there's more contentment and space ease and

156
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:22,000
lightness then there's an indirect support for insight by reflecting on our actions of

157
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,800
body and speech in the world not incidentally this also serves as a

158
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:36,079
compass for navigating life harmoniously reflecting outwardly if if there well

159
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:42,200
inwardly on the outward process has there been benefit or harm to

160
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:50,400
another this is another way of talking about ethical conduct sila it's also a way of continuing to

161
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:57,599
learn and grow from reflection on actions many centuries after the

162
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:03,760
Buddhist time the field of clinical chap Chapy training evolved and I was a

163
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:10,000
chaplain for a while I went through that training at first not with the idea of becoming a

164
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,599
professional which I did but with the idea of it deepening my practice and in

165
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:23,800
particular there was a model in that training of action reflection

166
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:29,280
action priceless opportunity because we learned from each other Those of us that

167
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:35,599
were embedded in the hospital or wherever the people are embedded we learned our impact on each

168
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:41,119
other through honest reflective conversations for the purpose of being

169
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:49,480
as safe for others as skillful and as self-aware as

170
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:55,119
possible And a lot of time would be spent writing and reflection on our own

171
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:00,720
interactions with others So this process actually in some ways

172
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,560
echoes the Buddha's last piece of advice to his son If he discovered Rahula

173
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:11,680
discovered that he'd done something that caused affliction or harm the Buddha

174
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:18,119
advised him to tell someone that he respected and

175
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:24,040
trusted And this itself was not for the purpose of being again

176
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:29,480
punished but for the purpose of learning changing

177
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:35,880
adapting It's a growth mindset It's helpful to work through these

178
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:43,119
things It's said that the purpose of a spiritual teacher a spiritual friend is

179
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:48,920
to hold a mirror up to the back of our heads

180
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:54,720
to help us see what we can't see Now just like in meditation the vast

181
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:00,000
majority of us learn this kind of reflection by noticing the impact of an

182
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:06,960
action afterwards If this is you you're in good company The Buddha presents this

183
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:12,839
teaching in chronological order but most of us experience it in

184
00:44:12,839 --> 00:44:19,240
reverse Reflecting on the effect of thought speech and action

185
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:24,599
afterwards and even dur during can be more of a

186
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:31,599
contemplation And Naomi Shabnai the poet glosses the word contemplation as a long

187
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:36,960
loving look a long loving

188
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:46,720
look So gradually with this kind of honesty

189
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:53,079
care love compassion mindfulness awareness ethical

190
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:59,520
sensitivity increase and we notice actions and their veilance that I've

191
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:04,640
been discussing here during and even

192
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:11,000
beforehand It's a gradual cultivation of wisdom and compassion and it gradually

193
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:19,960
leads to more confidence strength lightness and joy

194
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:27,280
So dear Sana my invitation to you for the next

195
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:32,839
24 hours your homework should you choose to do it is to

196
00:45:32,839 --> 00:45:38,079
reflect either during or after or before

197
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:45,920
one action of body one action of speech and one action of mind What do you notice

198
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:54,960
harm or benefit affliction or lightness and how are you able to be with

199
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:01,720
that The most important thing is to hold whatever you discover in

200
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:07,000
kindness Thank you for your kind attention
