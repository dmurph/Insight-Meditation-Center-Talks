1
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:08,219
foreign welcome

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:16,560
and uh welcome to the start of a new week and a new series

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:23,160
and uh this week's uh topic will be compassion Following last week's topic

4
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,519
on love and in preparation for talking about that

5
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:36,480
this guided meditation I would like to make the point that

6
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:44,000
the best forms of compassion arise out of being

7
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:52,320
well settled in awareness well settled in being mindful

8
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:59,280
that it's important not to have compassion in the lead

9
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,039
but rather compassion is

10
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:15,900
awareness is their lead or awareness is the boat that compassion rides

11
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,060
and if we if compassion is in the lead by swimming

12
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,759
it's a lot of work to keep swimming there's not much ability to do much else

13
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:32,939
but if compassion is supported by awareness then compassion can come to a kind of

14
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:40,860
fullness so awareness first and then compassion

15
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:47,880
and so we're here we are to meditate before this topic of compassion so we have

16
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:55,380
mindfulness first awareness first and perhaps to maybe interest you in

17
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:01,920
your meditation your awareness for this meditation so you're curious like what is this and

18
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,939
maybe even a little bit of awe of this capacity you have to be aware

19
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:14,760
the question is how it how is awareness

20
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,040
what is it about the nature of awareness what's the quality the properties of

21
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:27,420
awareness what are the benefits of awareness that makes it a good support for

22
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:34,680
compassion think about this so much but enter into the world of mindfulness

23
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,440
the world of awareness really stay close to it and in the process of it you might

24
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:47,060
discover some of the answers to this maybe you'll Discover it after the meditation

25
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,900
so assuming a meditative posture

26
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,840
and as I like to say lately is that it's a posture that is unobstructed

27
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,360
that nothing within us is

28
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:14,360
crunched up or blocked or held in check or

29
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:22,019
that's a posture that allows a feeling of openness in the body and it's a posture that allows

30
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:30,060
for a deep relaxation and the combination of unobstructed flow

31
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:38,959
of life within us and a deep relaxation go hand in hand

32
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:47,299
that which flows unobstructedly the way they were animated

33
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:54,079
is what brings wakefulness alertness

34
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,599
relaxation keeps everything calm

35
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:05,659
non-reactive quiet

36
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,000
and together they make a wonderful partner partnership

37
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:21,799
gently closing your eyes and feeling sensing

38
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,900
this posture of yours this body of yours

39
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:38,520
as if all you need to do is to discover how it is right now

40
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,680
no need to judge it or be disappointed or

41
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:51,440
try to fix it just become aware of this body

42
00:04:52,919 --> 00:05:00,660
and awareness at all his borders aren't being permissive just allowing it to be there and you

43
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,380
discovering

44
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,720
and then to

45
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:22,320
take some gentle deep breaths

46
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,199
maybe three quarters as deep as you can breathe

47
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,699
and exhaling longer than you normally would

48
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:42,139
Maybe a quarter longer than usual

49
00:05:53,580 --> 00:06:00,720
and as you exhale the longer exhale let there be a quieting of the thinking

50
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,020
mind

51
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,680
especially as you get to the end of the exhale

52
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,639
and then letting your breathing return to normal

53
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:39,138
and to continue relaxing the body

54
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,240
maybe with each exhale

55
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:37,039
and then letting yourself breathe normally

56
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,660
settling yourself into breathing

57
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,840
almost as if your whole body can settle into the sensations of your

58
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:58,039
body breathing them the movements of the body the expansions and contractions

59
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:10,880
maybe even settling into the belly soft belly

60
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:21,319
where the softness of the belly varies as you breathe in and breathe out

61
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:50,760
and then sitting here quietly aware of your present moment experience

62
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,100
oh where in a kind of Silent Way

63
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:04,160
without discursive thought without conversations in your head or

64
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:10,200
story images with your eyes

65
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:20,899
where you're aware of it all including the thinking

66
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:26,279
awareness that's independent

67
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,320
of everything

68
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:41,660
it knows it's mindful

69
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,820
without being for or against

70
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:57,260
without being identified or defined

71
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:01,040
by what it's aware of

72
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,480
foreign

73
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:41,300
mindful not thoughtful

74
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,820
foreign

75
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:15,440
after meditating these minutes still quiet with the eyes closed

76
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:24,259
what has happened to you in the course of the meditation

77
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,179
are you a little calmer

78
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:38,400
do you feel more aware or sensitive to

79
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,320
your experience Here and Now

80
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:54,500
might you be a bit softer predisposed to be kinder

81
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,700
might you be more aware than usual of

82
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:12,080
how involved you are in thinking and reacting to things

83
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,880
whatever way you are it's okay

84
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,940
but is there a way that how you are now

85
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:38,360
can be a support for compassion

86
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:44,299
compassion for yourself compassion for others

87
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:51,440
is there any way that you can build

88
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,620
on how you are at the end of The Meditation

89
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:09,779
to have more compassion for yourself for the world

90
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:16,559
how does meditation support compassion

91
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:25,020
both on its own in some way that we

92
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:30,860
consciously use the meditative experience

93
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:40,340
to support compassion

94
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:01,278
and then coming to the end of the sitting

95
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:07,700
to open your hearts your minds to the world around you

96
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:16,620
and to consider how you can live this day

97
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:21,659
with greater kindness and greater compassion

98
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:26,840
greater care for others

99
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:35,340
may it be that this meditation we've done today serves for the welfare and happiness of

100
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:42,799
others may all beings be happy

101
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:47,539
may all beings be safe

102
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:54,740
male beings be peaceful

103
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:00,380
and may all beings be free

104
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:18,490
[Music]

105
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,620
thank you

106
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:42,240
so with this talk I begin a five part series on compassion

107
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:50,580
and compassion is one of the wonderful capacities that human beings have

108
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:58,200
and probably it's a capacity which is underutilized maybe even underappreciated

109
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:05,399
and um they can make the central or be the central organizing principle for a human

110
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:11,159
life what gives a life purpose meaning Direction

111
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:18,960
um support inspiration and that's certainly been true for me

112
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:26,039
and I think for a good part of my adult life that compassion was a central organizing

113
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:32,159
principle that I set my direction of my life based on compassion for the

114
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:38,039
suffering of the world and whether that's still the case

115
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:43,559
um is maybe a matter of kind of subtlety

116
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:50,159
that I don't know if it's still Compassion or something that's kind of almost the same as compassions

117
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:57,179
things change and morph over time and and now maybe the central principle is

118
00:31:57,179 --> 00:32:03,659
why what I call care but the that somehow is I don't know a little

119
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:10,380
different than compassion but compassion and um the simplest definition of

120
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:17,100
compassion is um being um sensitive

121
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:22,679
to the suffering of usually others sensitive to the suffering of others in

122
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:27,720
such a way that we have the aspiration the wish

123
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:32,720
the desire to alleviate that suffering

124
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:38,100
so those two things sensitive they're suffering and the

125
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:44,640
desire to alleviate it and those when it's when it's compassion

126
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,679
the Buddhists can put focus on compassion it's not an obligation it's not

127
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:57,240
something we should be doing we might want to do it but it's but it's

128
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:03,960
meant to be something that Wells up within we talk about being compassionate but

129
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:13,080
when some people hear the idea that we should be compassionate uh they interpret the B part as do we

130
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:19,200
should do compassion and and it's very profound this idea

131
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,240
that we be compassion rather than we do compassion because with the idea of being

132
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:31,620
compassionate that's something that Wells up that something just kind of oozes out of us or kind of there for us

133
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:38,539
it's not something that we have to make happen or act in a certain way

134
00:33:38,539 --> 00:33:45,840
so the but this way of being is a is a profound possibility

135
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:54,539
that has different characteristics and qualities and the uh and uh so in this week I'm

136
00:33:54,539 --> 00:34:02,960
going to talk about five different characteristics or aspects of compassion only the fifth which is action

137
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:09,260
meaning that for this being compassionate there's a whole slew of

138
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:16,560
ways of being in ourselves that sets a stage for compassionate action

139
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:24,658
and without those prep that preparation without that Foundation then a compassionate action might not be

140
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:30,480
compassionate it might be actively involved with alleviating suffering but

141
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,580
it could be done with anger it could be done with distress to get done with a

142
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:42,720
sense of strain and stress and tension and it can be done in a way that that it

143
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:48,300
can be exhausting or stressful or worse for people

144
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:55,700
but how is it that compassion can be enacted and acted on without it being

145
00:34:55,700 --> 00:35:01,520
exhausting without it diminishing us so that the compassion is

146
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:09,119
sweet there's a there's a beauty and a kind of profound beautiful pleasure

147
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:14,700
that comes along in Us in the compassionate action

148
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:21,300
um so for that to happen four other things uh kind of would be good to

149
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:26,700
gather together and have as part of it so the four the five things I'll be

150
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:33,960
talking about today all start with a so maybe that's helpful for remembering

151
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:41,760
and uh so today I want to talk about awareness tomorrow Attunement

152
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,859
a little different than it may be empathy but Attunement to others

153
00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:53,820
and then appreciation and then aspiration

154
00:35:53,820 --> 00:36:00,839
and then action so awareness Attunement

155
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:07,099
appreciation aspiration and action

156
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:13,500
so those first four then support the action and so to be grounded in those or have

157
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:22,040
those developed in us and or practice in us then the compassionate action is well

158
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:27,680
supported as kind of has a chance to be a beautiful thing a profound thing that

159
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:33,359
we're just glad to have it to feel it there's not necessarily any distress

160
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:38,900
with it so uh it begins with awareness

161
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:44,099
mindfulness attention and

162
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:51,119
and here there's a kind of very important point I want to make about awareness practice or having a strong

163
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:57,480
presence of attention awareness mindfulness and that is that uh we're not leaning

164
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:05,579
into things we're not sinking into things but there's a kind of autonomy maybe not

165
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:11,579
in ourselves in all the ways but there's an autonomy in being aware

166
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:19,980
there's a capacity to be attentive without being entangled or caught or

167
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:27,119
reactive to what is happening it maybe it would be a little bit like being at a gathering of people who are

168
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:33,720
maybe they're you know having an angry shouting match between each other maybe

169
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:40,200
they're um I don't know what being really afraid

170
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:46,560
and running around kind of not knowing what to do and you stand in the middle of them and

171
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:53,099
you care for them you're supporting them friend of them but it's clear that you've kind of like you're not in the

172
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:58,500
quicksand with them you're not kind of involved with the anger and caught up in

173
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:04,400
the fear but your presence it's a little bit like you're been

174
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:10,619
standing on a stool maybe Above The Fray looking down that it all kind of amazed

175
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:15,839
what's going on here this is quite something an experience my first experience of

176
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:21,599
this possibility that was kind of an inkling a glimpse that made a big difference for me

177
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:30,420
was my second year in college I guess I was 19 or so we were living in US my four other

178
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:36,420
guys and I were living in a apartment three-bedroom apartment

179
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:43,020
and uh with a balcony sliding door to the living room and I was out on the balcony with a

180
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:49,859
sliding door closed and two of my roommates were on the couch the living room having an animated conversation

181
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:55,500
and all I could see was their gestures and animation I couldn't hear the words

182
00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:02,220
and and not knowing what they were talking about but just watching how animated they were I could feel that was

183
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:08,820
present and attentive but there was no entanglement I wasn't caught in what they were saying it was like I was

184
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:15,780
autonomous I was free I was available I was there and that experience of being

185
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:20,940
aware of people actively kind of having an animated

186
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:26,280
conversation in my being free of it was that was the first Glimpse I had of that

187
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:33,260
possibility this is not the same thing as aloof this is not the same thing as being

188
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:39,119
removed or indifferent it's just that we might have all kinds of feelings and

189
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:45,540
connections to them attunements and aspirations and interest in them but there's a way in which the awareness

190
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:54,420
is calm is peaceful it's not ruffled or agitated is not leaning into and one way

191
00:39:54,420 --> 00:40:00,240
that the awareness gets mixed up to and identified with what's happening is when

192
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:05,940
the awareness is pulled in to the thoughts we're having the

193
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:11,160
discursive thoughts and and it's almost as if we identify we

194
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:17,700
become the discursive thoughts and the awareness then is happening through through the filter of those discursive

195
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:24,240
thoughts or we get caught up in the emotions and feelings we have and the awareness gets

196
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:31,380
kind of channeled through those in order to be aware of the world and um and with a clear awareness

197
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:37,079
awareness is its own thing it's a um it's a kind of a when it's

198
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:43,619
really kind of strong it's there's a clarity that it's above The Fray or step back

199
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:50,099
from being entangled or it's just there present very present there but is the

200
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:57,780
upright then autonomous clear open available not identified by anything not

201
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:02,880
caught by likes and dislikes it knows that like likes and dislikes it knows

202
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:10,320
discursive thinking but it's not those things to cultivate this kind of a kind of

203
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:18,420
sense of autonomy in the awareness itself is very very important for compassion

204
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:24,599
because then compassion has a channel from which to be clean

205
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:32,820
a Channel with which not to be entangled not to be reactive not to be mixed up

206
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:39,599
with the whole range of emotions that might be coming not mixed up with all the story making of the Mind discursive

207
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:45,119
thinking and beliefs and judgments that we might have and um

208
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:51,119
and uh so the um so it kind of creates a

209
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:58,380
context and a foundation for being compassionate without that if there's a headlong rush

210
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:04,140
into being compassionate then awareness gets pulled along we're

211
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:10,400
not so present and attentive to what we're doing that whatever little awareness is present is being being

212
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:16,740
hijacked or being mixed up with our reactivity our sense

213
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:24,560
of Duty our sense of alarm our sense of being in a hurry our sense of um

214
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:31,220
requirement obligation our sense of distress all kinds of things come along

215
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:37,140
if awareness is not autonomous if awareness has this kind of upright

216
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:43,940
autonomy where it's standing on its own two feet and is not being pushed around by The Winds of life

217
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:51,540
then there's a lots of room for some of the deeper Wellsprings of of our the

218
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:58,079
best qualities we have to flow into that space but if awareness has been hijacked and

219
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:05,940
is caught up and not quite there then these deeper qualities are not as easily

220
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:12,900
available so awareness mindfulness attention to

221
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:19,440
really learn it develop it being grounded it have faith in it if someone

222
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:27,800
if you hear the idea the you should be more compassionate I would propose that the best way to

223
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:35,099
interpret that or take that on is don't be compassionate Begin by slowing down

224
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:41,579
standing straight and tall and being metaphorically and just being aware and

225
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:48,060
see if you can find that place where awareness is autonomous

226
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:56,880
or free kind of like Lotus blossoming above the

227
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,980
Muddy Waters so

228
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:07,079
the healthy foundation for compassion begins

229
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:13,260
with awareness and with that kind of autonomous

230
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:18,780
awareness then we're ready for the Attunement with someone else

231
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:25,380
that Attunement to their suffering and what that means I'll talk about tomorrow and so what I'd like to recommend if

232
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:30,540
you're interested in some an exercise for the next 24 hours

233
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:36,060
is when you're it's in some situation where maybe where nothing's really

234
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:42,560
required for you to do anything but you're aware of someone else's suffering

235
00:44:42,619 --> 00:44:49,200
see what you can see what you can discover about an autonomous awareness

236
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:55,819
being really present for the person for the situation not removed not

237
00:44:55,819 --> 00:45:01,440
aloof but to really kind of

238
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:07,680
open to the situation with clear awareness but where the awareness is autonomous

239
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:14,880
where the awareness is not entangled or caught up in the situation

240
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:20,160
to them again so the best situation options for this to doing this is a

241
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:25,680
situation where you're not going to be acting to help someone do something

242
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:32,640
um it's some situation you know in the public where you you see something that's someone's suffering but there's other

243
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:38,099
people helping you're not going to help or you read about someone in the news or something

244
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:45,319
so um thank you
