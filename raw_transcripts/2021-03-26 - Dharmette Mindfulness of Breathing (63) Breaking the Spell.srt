1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,919
so the topic continues to be the

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:17,920
13th step of the mindfulness of breathing observing one trains oneself

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,720
observing in constancy i will breathe in observing and

4
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,119
constancy i will breathe out just how the instructions are and this observing of

5
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:37,760
in constancy usually translated as impermanence

6
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,440
is really as i said yesterday is the core insight of insight meditation the core insight of

7
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,360
the buddha's teachings in the ancient texts and the definition of the buddha gave

8
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:56,320
repeatedly for wisdom wisdom is the perception of arising and passing the insight into

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,800
the arising and disappearing of phenomena that is noble and

10
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:10,240
penetrating and leads to the ending of suffering so

11
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,960
it's the experience the perception of seeing things arise and pass

12
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,840
that leads to liberation to awakening

13
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:28,400
and uh and so this side and constancy that you the way that in constancy is understood here

14
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,799
is um it is the uh it's defined as over in many

15
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,560
different words in the ancient language that are equivalent to the english arising and passing appearing and

16
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,520
disappearing and

17
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,399
things like that and it's hard to understand to appreciate

18
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:59,040
how valuable this is to have this experience until one experiences in a very deep

19
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,079
subtle quiet place in meditation that's really where this deep insight is

20
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:10,879
really it's really insight that works and it's very penetrating and noble awakening

21
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:17,280
when the mind is really ready for seeing that if an ordinary consciousness walking around the street

22
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,400
someone tells you just to notice the arising and passing a phenomena it probably won't stick it probably

23
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,680
won't be any sense of continuity with that resting in it just being open to it

24
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:34,080
because you have to take care of too many details walking on the street and figuring out what's going on and

25
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,920
and but in deep meditation to be really at rest and really able to

26
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:47,840
be centered in a receptive open observing way of the the flow of experience

27
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,160
in awareness that's possible because we're not overlaying concepts and ideas

28
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,760
on top of things we're just there in the direct experience of phenomena of

29
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,239
perception and sensations and the beginning of thoughts and even with the emotions that might feel an ordinary

30
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:13,200
street consciousness as being continuous we when your mind is very quiet and still we're beginning to feel and sense

31
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:20,800
the uh how they actually kind of um uh uh very momentarily fleetingly coming into

32
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,640
existence and out of existence there's a coming into awareness and out of a worse awareness the mind picks it up and

33
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,000
doesn't pick it up and um generally what happens is we sew these all these different

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,159
moments of arising and passing together into a feeling of constancy into idea

35
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:44,720
that it's continuous but when we don't have ideas anymore just in the experience

36
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:52,239
this arising and passing a curse and this is meant to me this is supposed to be liberating um i mean

37
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,280
to do this and partly it's because when we see that things are constantly

38
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,959
in flux that um it's hard to it doesn't make sense to cling to them

39
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:10,080
to grasp onto them it's like you're seeing the river flow vines clearly moving and in flux

40
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,280
and then you put your hand in there to grab the river and hold it and you grab a handful of the river and

41
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,840
you pull it up and by the time you open your hand to hold the river all the water has kind of squeezed out

42
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:28,080
of your fingers and run off and you might have a little bit of drops left on your on your uh

43
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,720
on your hand but you don't go with those drops of water and you're in your hand and go up to your friends

44
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,680
on the shore and say hey look i have the river in my hand

45
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,280
if you think you're holding the river because you have those few little drops you know that's no longer the river the

46
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:51,759
river is partly defined by water that's flowing and those drops are no longer in that flow

47
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:58,479
and so the idea of picking something out of the flow of experience and holding on to it if we're in the

48
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:05,840
flow really centered in it then we see it you know we've actually left the flow we've actually now kind of

49
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,199
holding something an idea of something that's just a little drop it's just a little maybe even

50
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,320
i don't know what and some it turns out that so much of what

51
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:24,240
we um get attached to cling to resist is not actually reality but

52
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,520
uh the the idea interpretation the concept we have of reality

53
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:37,360
and so to it's hard to explain that to people in ordinary consciousness but to really be centered and quiet and see

54
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:44,479
the flow of the vibratory flow of the sparkling flow the raindrop being on

55
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:50,240
the lake appearing and disappearing a phenomena becomes glaringly obvious

56
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,720
that it doesn't make sense to cling to it it doesn't make sense to resist to it but rather is to open to it and just

57
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,400
allow it to move through and and just allow it to flow and move

58
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:08,800
in there and generally when that happens our relationship to that experience changes dramatically

59
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,319
so even if it's been a very we have physical pain which is very hard to be with

60
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:20,000
i know but when we really in the ability of being concentrated and still

61
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,120
and feel it all is flowing sensation the pain gets transformed into something

62
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,280
else that doesn't really feel painful anymore it's a flow of this arising and passing of sensations

63
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,639
that becomes a whole different way of experiencing it but it requires the mind being very still

64
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:44,560
and focused and present and quiet to do that so this is the core insight to see

65
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:52,880
the appearing and disappearing phenomenon in a guided meditation i was focusing mostly on the arising

66
00:06:52,880 --> 00:07:00,000
and at some point we'll do a meditation just focusing on the passing away of phenomena and then the arising and

67
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,440
passing of phenomena that occurred together but

68
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:11,440
the um so our relationship to things begins to shift

69
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:18,240
and uh there's a wonderful um verse the dhammapada

70
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:27,360
that where it starts with a kind of a quote that all things are inconstant so everything

71
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,919
is arising and passing so even things that are continuous and

72
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:39,120
from ordinary consciousness seem like they're just unchanging in some way or they're

73
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,759
in the mind's way of experiencing it it's the experience that's arising in passing so we want to be a little bit

74
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:52,240
careful we're not getting too wrapped up in um the thing that we're perceiving

75
00:07:52,240 --> 00:08:00,960
is inconstant it's the way it's the nature of how experience happens that's inconstant

76
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:08,400
there's a momentary kind of pixelated nature of reality or this flow of this

77
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,759
flow of experience that comes and goes that is built into the very nature of

78
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:21,199
how we are aware how we experience things so um so so here the buddha says

79
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:28,080
all created things are inconstant and the word is sankara

80
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:34,800
which uh which uh it's i'd like to suggest that what we're talking about is

81
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:41,039
all created experiences all the ways in which the mind uh

82
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,320
perceives and takes in and constructs our reality

83
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:53,120
everything everything like that it's just it's inconstant it's in flux and moving

84
00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:00,000
and seeing this with insight and one becomes disenchanted

85
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,519
with suffering one becomes disenchanted with suffering so whoever believes that

86
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:13,519
they're enchanted with suffering enchanted means and maybe it kind of means enamored it means kind of

87
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:20,160
caught in this caught on the spell of it somehow if we hate our suffering

88
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,160
we're caught in its spell uh we're in it we're in enchanted by it in a certain way i

89
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:32,800
guess if that means in english to be under a spell if we hate something we're under its

90
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:39,040
spell we're caught we're entangled and there's something about seeing the inconstancy of experience

91
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:45,680
that helps us to disentangle ourselves to become to break that spell to not be so caught

92
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,279
in it and so all things

93
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:58,640
are inconstant all created things are in constant all sankharas seeing this with insight

94
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:04,880
one becomes disenchanted with suffering this is the path of purity this

95
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:12,880
is a path of purity so it's a little problematic this idea of purity but just a few verses before they talk

96
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:19,920
about purity this way this is the path for purifying

97
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,440
one's vision purifying our awareness our vision how

98
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:32,880
we see things so it's not necessarily becoming a completely you know a saint inside that kind of purity but

99
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:39,920
rather it's um uh coming to a place where our capacity to be aware is purified of all the

100
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:46,480
filters of thoughts ideas reactions emotions that prevent us from seeing clearly

101
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:53,200
but to really see clearly see things as they are we want to see the inconstancy of phenomena

102
00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:01,279
then this the verse goes on goes on all created things are suffering

103
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:08,079
seeing this with insight one becomes disenchanted with suffering and here we have the

104
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:15,360
second of the three characteristics the three are in constancy

105
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:22,800
suffering and the third is not self and these three characteristics are the

106
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:29,519
core insights of insight meditation it starts with arising and passing in the in in seeing

107
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,880
the arising and passing there's something about seeing that level of our experience that layer

108
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,399
of our experience that uh gives birth to a clear clear

109
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:46,320
um insight into the in here that this translator which

110
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,880
is me translates as suffering the word is dukkha and for now it

111
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:59,279
may be it's could be more usefully translated in this context as stressful but we'll talk more about that

112
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,800
on monday and and then it goes on to say all

113
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:13,680
things are not self seeing this with insight one becomes disenchanted with suffering

114
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:19,040
so we'll continue this idea of the three characteristics which are so phenomenally important for insight

115
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,800
meditation that's worth spending some time with it and and this movement of seeing and

116
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,399
constancy observing a constancy has an impact on the meditator and the

117
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:37,839
impact is a process of disenchantment of breaking the spell of how we're caught or entangled or

118
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:44,880
clinging or attached to things and where the allure the promise of

119
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,920
attachment the promise that grasping will somehow

120
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:58,639
save us or do something for us begins to be broken and and so that's uh

121
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:06,000
so so you might want to today during this weekend look a little bit at

122
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,800
um at this idea of in constancy and arising and passing a phenomena

123
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:19,680
and see if somehow that casts any perspective on how you might be enchanted with

124
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:28,000
suffering or caught in its spell so i have a little bit of time today

125
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,880
so we can stop uh formally here but if some of you would like to stay a little bit longer and put some

126
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:41,040
questions in the chat i'm happy to try to answer and i might not be able to answer them in order

127
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:48,720
but but if you would like to try i'm happy to stay and

128
00:13:48,720 --> 00:14:03,839
and for a little while

129
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,839
okay

130
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,600
and constancy is not bad news aha nice

131
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:41,120
so are the transcripts of your talks yes but they're not necessarily coming

132
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,320
uh right away but there's a wonderful team of people who are transcribing these talks in the

133
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:53,600
morning and i think some of the earlier ones are available now from early in the year or before so

134
00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:00,240
if you go on audio dharma where they're the audio recording of them appear it'll say if there's a

135
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:06,720
transcription available and they're likely edited luckily so

136
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,320
and and the person leading up that that

137
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:18,000
wonderful project of transcribing is meg galler who often says hello here in the morning

138
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,480
so thank you so much meg and your team for this great work you're doing

139
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:31,440
um where does awareness go when we are caught in thinking

140
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:40,560
a lovely question where does it go um where does it go um

141
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:48,000
well it depends what we mean by awareness if um awareness is

142
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,240
not the same as consciousness but awareness is conscious awareness

143
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,320
or how to say it if there's knowing awareness we know

144
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,920
what we're aware of we know what's coming into consciousness there's a lot of things we know that are coming to

145
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:11,440
awareness that we don't really you know clearly fully uh i know that

146
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,519
um like so for example just saying all this i was aware that i have these lights on

147
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:24,639
here and the kind of studio lights just that i was aware of this light that uh and then i knew oh the light is

148
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:31,120
on and uh but it wasn't the second kind of the knowing of it is different than just kind of i go

149
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:37,519
about and not paying attention i don't think about it i don't have any active formal recognition

150
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:46,079
we're thinking our consciousness our awareness i like to think of it as it gets hijacked and held hostage by our

151
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:51,440
thinking we get so glued to our thinking that that kind of

152
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:59,839
self-reflective awareness that we know what's happening and what we're doing we know that we're thinking gets lost because it's so preoccupied so

153
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:06,959
glued to it so that's probably an inadequate answer and and um but then we'll have to leave for

154
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:12,640
that can you say more about dealing with pain especially for those with chronic illness

155
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:19,199
yeah that's a huge topic and for now and um and um it's a very very important one

156
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:26,640
there's a lot of people who have uh pain and are managing their life with pain and chronic illness and

157
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,000
and uh i think one of the great benefits of mindfulness meditation in circumstances like that

158
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,120
is to help us not add second arrows to it to the when we already have tremendous

159
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:46,320
difficulty in trying to figure out and working our life with this difficulty to not add shame or self-incrimination

160
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:54,080
or or or resentment or anger or to not get attached to it

161
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:00,480
should have been different why isn't it different i should have you know whatever it might be the second

162
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:06,080
arrows but to learn how to be simpler and simpler and to allow

163
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:12,559
ourselves to be be ill and painful in the simplest possible way maybe even

164
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:18,080
an ordinary way as if oh yes i'm sick that's what's happening and then absolutely take care of

165
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:24,160
ourselves try to try to be well and try not to try to do what we can to

166
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:31,919
heal the pain or overcome the illness and this is not a passivity that we want to have about it but

167
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:38,640
we do what we can and sometimes we can't do much but the practice can help us then become very simple with it and breathe with it

168
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,240
and not add extra attention and stress to the already stressful situation

169
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:50,559
and then as the mindfulness gets stronger and more concentrated then uh it's possible to bring a careful

170
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:55,840
loving compassionate attention deeply into the pain and the illness to

171
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:02,080
really feel the direct experience of it and that sometimes allows to be different kinds of shifts

172
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,360
and beneficial shifts and i don't want to say exactly how those beneficial shifts will

173
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:14,160
look like different for different people and i don't want to set up the expectation that mindfulness can

174
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:20,559
help make the pain go completely away or the illness go away and that it's healing that way but it it can

175
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:26,640
be healing for the heart the mindfulness practice so the illness and the pain might not go away

176
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:34,320
but the heart is healed and that that's the movement of liberation and and then we become whole in a certain

177
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:40,720
way his closed captioning available for these talks you know i believe they are

178
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,000
through youtube but i'm not i don't really haven't tracked all this so well i'll try to find out but

179
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,240
i believe there's a way maybe down in the settings on youtube you can um

180
00:19:52,240 --> 00:20:00,320
they're there that way and um so

181
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:06,000
it's oh that it kind of goes by quickly so i miss i can't do

182
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,840
them in order i apologize um our thoughts the central mechanism

183
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:18,320
as to how we cling to these constant phenomena um i don't know if thoughts are the

184
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,360
mechanism for clinging but at least in my experience

185
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:32,720
that mostly what we cling to what is our thoughts is our ideas and

186
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,320
and it's not so obvious until you might you know you really see how this works in a deep quiet way

187
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,840
um um so we don't really cling to physical pleasure but it's more like

188
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:49,039
we're clinging to what what the pleasures what the thoughts the ideas the

189
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:54,720
that we have about what these the pleasure is doing for us

190
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,840
to get

191
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:12,880
oh to to get to the deepest levels of insight it seems we have to let go of every to-do list in our life how can we

192
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:19,520
function in the world if we want to go to the deepest levels of insight great question

193
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,440
yes to get to the deepest level of freedom

194
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:33,360
you have to put aside or let go of any clinging all clinging

195
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:39,919
and but we can still hold things without clinging so

196
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:46,400
you know i can i can be attached to the striker and i can feel i'm attached to it i'm so

197
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:52,559
you know i should therefore let go of it and i can just drop it drop it but another way of letting it's not the

198
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:58,880
thing that we necessarily have to let go of when we get let go of attachment it's not the thing

199
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:06,000
unless it's you know harmful and the striker is not harmful in itself it's the clinging we let go of so then

200
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,440
we can go like this and we can still hold it without any grasping

201
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:18,400
so in deep meditation we want to put everything aside and so with the to-do

202
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:24,320
list you would maybe put it on a to-do list on a piece of paper and put it up on a shelf leave it on

203
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:30,159
your table and and just put it aside and then later you come back to it and

204
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:38,320
then i look at it and and hold all the things on the to-do list with this open hand an open mind and and then

205
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:44,559
go through them and have the pleasure of checking them off but don't get uh attached to any of it or clinging to any

206
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:51,600
of it um so there's you're welcome to keep your to-do list and hopefully the deep letting go and

207
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:59,440
the deep wisdom of meditation helps you to look at that list and prioritize in a good way and maybe

208
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,720
few of the things on the list are not necessary a few of the things maybe represent

209
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:23,840
something you're attached to maybe unattached to unnecessarily

210
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:30,080
there seems to be two kinds of inconsistency how our awareness flickers and then perhaps wraps

211
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,200
things up in a constant narrative the flickering inconsistency of phenomena itself

212
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,000
is that correct yeah yeah that sounds nice

213
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:48,400
but things are not random the inconsistency of what appears and disappears is not completely random

214
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:56,240
but it arises because of preceding conditions and and so nothing arises out of nothing

215
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,600
but the conditions come together and then things arise and uh

216
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,640
and so in dharma practice we're actually putting in place the conditions

217
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:14,080
so that we have more consistency so that we have uh more likely that

218
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:20,000
we move in a certain direction we grow in certain directions we certain kinds of arising tends to arise

219
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,799
more often so for example if you practice a lot of loving kindness then that sets the conditions that when

220
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:34,559
you sit and we feel pain we're ready to feel a compassion maybe and love for ourselves

221
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:40,480
and care for ourselves then we are to be angry with ourselves or angry with

222
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,320
other people because what's happening to us and so it's there's inconsistency but we begin to

223
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,919
shape that inconsistency so it tends in one direction in a beneficial

224
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:58,080
direction so would you please say more about the

225
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,919
buddha never said no self or he had a sense of self yes so we'll talk about that next week when we get to

226
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:10,480
not self in this exploration of inconstancy

227
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:20,080
i have uh i have hopes it kind of goes away

228
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:26,960
i have uh tetanus i think it's tonight that tinnitus

229
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:36,640
tinnitus there we go oh it's an idea so where is it i was oh anyway so

230
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,720
anyway i guess i missed the question but tonight is i i've had 10 i have tinnitus so the one of the

231
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:49,600
best things for me is if no one brings up the word because then if i'm reminded then i start hearing the

232
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,640
ringing in my ears so and uh there are times where i've

233
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,960
been really troubled by this you know really draw me kind of baddy the ringing in my ears

234
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:07,679
and but no i'm not troubled by it anymore and it kind of recedes and and some people find it useful to

235
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:13,760
make it the object of meditation and it has a kind of constant constancy that

236
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:20,720
um that's is grounding for some people and uh and i found it i've never found it

237
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:26,000
particularly useful to pay attention to it and in fact some teachers actually say

238
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,520
this is one of the things in mindfulness practice you shouldn't pay attention to the idea is to pay attention to everything in

239
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:38,159
mindfulness but not to pay attention to that so it all depends on the person and uh

240
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:43,760
you know what's useful and not useful but um i mostly these days

241
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:49,919
um don't give in much attention and don't you know i've learned not to react to it

242
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:56,000
not to before against it and just to okay there it is and then

243
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,559
i'll continue with my breathing and sit there and practice and go on with other things and

244
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:09,440
and i know for some people it's really bad they just have some kind of ambient sound around and that sometimes you know

245
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,720
masks it hides it

246
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:25,679
it's a challenge to hold one's tongue and only observe yes this is the advanced graduate school

247
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,799
mindfulness to be mindful of speaking and there's so much attachment so much

248
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:36,640
force and power and desires that come into play in speaking that

249
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:43,279
but it's so beneficial to bring mindfulness to thinking it's a window into to say in

250
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:48,960
non-buddhist dramatic terms to really be mindful of our of our talking

251
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:55,679
and what drives our talking and why we're going to say what we're going to do and what what is the the emotional

252
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:03,039
motivation for our our talking it's kind of like a dramatic window into our soul into our depth of

253
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:08,720
who we actually are so it's certainly worthwhile to learn to do

254
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:20,000
that um

255
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:28,720
jose meg writes closed captioning equals the oral notes on audiodharma so

256
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,840
um

257
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:42,000
oh someone says yeah closed captioning on youtube is not available live but seems to show up later on

258
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:49,120
if things are inconstant and clinging to them causes us to suffer what does that mean for choices of the

259
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:55,919
heart like marriage and career things are in constant clinging to them causes us to suffer what does it mean

260
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:03,120
for choices in the heart like marriage or a career well ideally we would

261
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:10,159
choose marriage or a career without any clinging

262
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:17,279
and in the flow of things are still make choices that uh the direction we want our lives and

263
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:22,480
the purpose of our lives the meaning of our lives and what we want to really put our heart

264
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:29,360
into more than anything else we don't have to just kind of go randomly along with whatever happens and it's a beautiful thing for some

265
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:36,240
people to have a career or have a marriage that they want to be to devote themselves to be engaged

266
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:42,480
and other people make other choices that are just as good and valuable

267
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:50,240
now with something like marriage and maybe with careers as well if we wait until we have no clinging and

268
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:56,799
no craving no craving no attachment the buddhist idea of attachment craving clinging

269
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:01,919
before we get married and then perhaps most people wouldn't get married

270
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:08,159
because that's kind of there's you know there's kind of you know there's not a crime it's not

271
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:15,120
it's not a crime it's not in buddhism it's not a sin or a crime to be attached and to cling it just means

272
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:20,960
we're going to suffer some somewhat because of it but one way to approach something like marriage and

273
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:26,240
career or any choice we make for our lives is to enfold it into our mindfulness

274
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:33,360
practice fold it into our careful care and attention and compassion for where is our clinging where's our

275
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:41,600
attachment and marriage it can be a great place to and family and kids a great place

276
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:48,320
to discover where we're attached where our clinging and craving are that maybe uh is very deep that we

277
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:53,760
wouldn't see in ourselves unless we were in this kind of intimate committed relationship

278
00:30:53,760 --> 00:31:00,960
and um and then to work through it and come to the other side of it so it can be folded in as a path of the

279
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:08,799
practice as opposed to we avoid all these things because we're we're clinging um and um

280
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:14,480
so it's probably best not to choose to go into marriage because you want to work out

281
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,679
your clinging but uh but so hopefully that answers the

282
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:26,320
question well enough what chapter verse from dhammapada did you cite oh i think it's uh well the

283
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:33,200
chapter is first it's like in the 170s let me see

284
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,960
it is verse oh 277 that what i read and it's in

285
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:45,360
chapter 20 the path yeah this is my i'm reading from my translation that i did 20 years

286
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:51,760
ago or so and and it's a little bit fascinating and a

287
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:58,159
little bit i don't know if embarrassing but a little bit of regret that

288
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:04,080
choices english choice you know i was my poly my study of the pseudos was not

289
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:12,320
what it was now so i would translate some of this differently now and and also the use of gender pronouns

290
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:18,880
i try to avoid um in order to become more gender neutral i did many things i did in a general

291
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,919
neutral way but sometimes i would if there was two pairs of verses

292
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,960
where in the original it was in the masculine pronoun i would do one with he and the other was

293
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,240
she and at the time i thought that was good but 20 years later you know or

294
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,679
10 years later i understood that it's we really want to try to be gender

295
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:46,559
neutral more fully because of how many people don't fit into the binary of

296
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:53,200
he and she and and and so i regret that i left it and

297
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:59,600
that i mean they didn't know enough back then to make that choice so anyway

298
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:10,399
oh someone asks meg if need more help with transcription and someone else as well um yeah so

299
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:17,120
she says you can contact imc volunteer coordinator hillary boris and you can um i think if you go on the

300
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:22,320
imc's website there's probably a place there for volunteering and you

301
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:29,120
could just let let hillary know and she'll be the support at all

302
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:36,880
um okay maybe i'll do one more here are these deep insights only really

303
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:44,159
possible with lengthy meditation retreats have you read the harper's article about the possible dangers of this

304
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:50,480
um no it doesn't require deep insights but

305
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:57,840
if you're if you're uh if you for many people in our tradition at least it's usually

306
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:04,240
in in in meditation retreats that this really settles in and

307
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:12,000
really kind of becomes digested or we see it and are impacted in a very good way these deep insights

308
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,679
and for most people and but once we have a clear sense of it and

309
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:24,800
a familiarity with it then they kind of live in a delightful and wonderful way much more in our daily life as well and

310
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:30,878
it doesn't require deep meditation anymore to really have it be part of the landscape these

311
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:36,480
insights and affect us and um i might have read the harper's article

312
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:42,079
and i think i'm pretty familiar with the modern uh discussion about the dangers of deep

313
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:49,118
inside meditation and and uh so that's you know

314
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:54,800
uh generally people who want to go into the deeper meditation experiences it's good to work with a

315
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:02,640
teacher be close connected so you can ask questions of how it's going some of the some of it can be a little bit disorienting and

316
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:10,720
but some of the real dangers that happen has a lot to do with with

317
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:16,640
the attitude and way in which people practice and the people who really strive and

318
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:21,839
push and tend to uh can have

319
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:27,280
real psychological problems because they're overriding they're not integrated there's not a relaxation it's

320
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:34,720
not a a nice broad unification uh

321
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:40,720
composure or collectedness that leads to that supports and so this

322
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:47,280
anapanasati practice is really a fantastic practice because it creates a really good

323
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,800
foundation for these insights i think some of the people who have these

324
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:59,599
end up in a little bit of psychological trouble somehow leap frog over creating the

325
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:07,440
foundation of practice they're in a hurry there's a gung-ho and and so they experience this

326
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:14,960
the deep experiences of inconstancy before they really have the psychological support and well-being and

327
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,480
stability to make good use of it and so if they already have a little bit psychological

328
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,760
instability it can make it more unstable so this is a known phenomena

329
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:31,200
that can happen and one of the things that one of the reasons why

330
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:37,839
having some connection to a teacher and meditation retreats is where that can happen if you have that connection and support

331
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:45,040
if something like that happens so thank you all very much and then for
