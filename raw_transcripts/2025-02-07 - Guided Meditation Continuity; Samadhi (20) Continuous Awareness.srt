1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,880
so good morning everyone and Welcome

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:15,199
to our meditation time together and I'm going to sneeze I

3
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:21,840
think wait a minute and maybe at

4
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:36,120
best so for this meditation today I'd like to say

5
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,920
that in that somadi involves a unification Gathering a coming together

6
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,199
of everything all of who we are uh engaged in a single

7
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:52,920
activity and all supporting engaging the activity of being present here and

8
00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:00,239
now uh without being distracted and that most commonly it in

9
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:07,400
is gathering unification in the present moment around a Center Point a settling

10
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:13,119
place a gathering place that doesn't exclude things but

11
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:18,960
allows all things to have supporting roles and coming together and everything's kind of gathered and

12
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,600
collected here for the same purpose the same direction the

13
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:32,520
same and um the um and one of the parts things that that

14
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:38,119
gets unified gets collected that comes together could be understood to be uh

15
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:46,439
continuity of attention so uh time is not just place but there's also

16
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,759
the idea of the continuous movement of

17
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:58,320
time and of course time doesn't move maybe there is no time really in some

18
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,159
kind of philosoph iCal way or experiential way there's also we live in

19
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:11,520
time and and so what it what it lives what what I'm mostly focusing on now is

20
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,760
the uh unification also inv involves a

21
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:22,640
continuity of staying present here and now without losing it without wandering

22
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,959
off so we stay in time and I love this expression staying

23
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,200
in time because it kind of has a musical

24
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:42,080
Association and um the um uh being in time in all kinds of ways but living in

25
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,200
time being continuous with the way the present moment flows through

26
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:56,200
time and so sometimes I think of um uh mindfulness and meditation concentration

27
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:03,080
as a writing the wave of the present as the present moves

28
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,440
through the the you know this

29
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:14,480
um River of time and we're riding the current and we have to stay in the

30
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,239
current and be riding on it continuously if we fall off the wave if we get spun

31
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:27,879
out out of the current of the river like into an Eddy or something then we're still we we've lost the present

32
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:35,360
moment and for me this idea of catching the wave and staying on it catching the current and flowing along and then fall

33
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:42,280
off get back on and ride it again catch and sometimes I TI I connect that to the

34
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:49,120
exhale as the place where I get on again and ride is carry as much as I can so

35
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,280
the continuity of attention that's done without strain

36
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,680
that's done without Force done without um apologies done without about

37
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,959
disappointment when we fall off just get back on and then uh see if you can not

38
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:11,840
so much work at being present but ride the present

39
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,199
moment ride continuously stay on stay on

40
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,720
and some of you know my scooter analogy we can ride the scooter as long as the

41
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,840
momentum of the kick is there and as it momentum goes down we do a gentle kick

42
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,000
again to keep it going so so rather than a wave or a current of the river the

43
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,759
idea of this kind of gentle pushing casually pushing moving the scooter in

44
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:47,039
in the present moment so I I'll guide you with this so assuming a meditation

45
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,160
posture

46
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:00,800
and and assuming a posture that you think will allow you

47
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,840
you to be alert in your

48
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:14,680
body in such a way that you can allow the body to relax

49
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:21,759
deeply almost like you assume a posture that

50
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:31,600
supports the way the muscles of the body want to relax anything extra

51
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,800
any kind of muscles that are apart from the simple ones that are

52
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,680
used to hold us in the posture we're

53
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:53,240
in and to gently close your eyes and then

54
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:59,400
gently calmly as if you have all the time in the world not forcing it or

55
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:05,039
being being in a hurry take some comfortably

56
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:13,280
deeper in breaths feeling the expansion of the Torso as you breathe

57
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:23,120
in and if see if you can breathe in in a way that's not too deep but just a

58
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:30,280
deeper full or in breath that stays enjoyable it feels nice

59
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:37,599
so maybe because of how you do it calmly and slowly or how there's a gentle

60
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:42,720
stretch opening or maybe it feels very nice to

61
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,440
feel bigger with the

62
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:55,280
inhale and then allow the exhale to Exhale longer

63
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:02,319
than normally would not by forcefully exhaling more but at the end of the

64
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:08,960
exhale relaxing relaxing the

65
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:15,919
body maybe relaxing into the settling Place deep

66
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:30,599
inside so these calm slow deeper inhales will you ride the

67
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:35,680
inhale like a wave all the way from the beginning to the

68
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,520
end a continuity through

69
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:50,800
time and kind of feel what that's like to

70
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:58,440
ride the inhale continuously or to aride the awareness for the

71
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,240
duration of the

72
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:13,599
inhale and with the exhale relaxing the body

73
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:24,080
settling and then to let your breathing return to

74
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:33,320
normal and for this ability to ride the present moment continuous awareness

75
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:40,200
through time it helps a lot if you can be

76
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:45,800
relaxed because continuous present moment

77
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:53,480
awareness is what we do what the mind what our system does if we don't interfere with it we

78
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,560
don't override it with thoughts and ideas and intentions and wants and

79
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,440
aversions

80
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:14,399
doesn't have to be a forced phenomena it maybe is more of an loud

81
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:21,760
phenomena allowing it to operates we don't interfere with it so to relax

82
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:29,760
deeply as you exhale relaxing the muscles of the face

83
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,000
as you exhale relaxing the shoulders

84
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,720
relaxing the

85
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,560
belly maybe you can release and relax the whole torso so the weight of the

86
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,120
body helps you to settle more

87
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:44,639
and on the exhale to soften the thinking

88
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,480
mind relax the

89
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,120
mind and if there's a lot of thinking

90
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:07,800
can you dial the thinking down a little bit so thinking is calmer a little

91
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,800
slower

92
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:31,320
quieter can you switch your thinking from thinking about other

93
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:37,519
things to having thoughts about

94
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:47,800
meditation thoughts that a naturalist would have simply recording and knowing what's

95
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,320
Happening Here and Now

96
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,279
and then not directing your attention

97
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:26,519
anywhere but allowing attention awareness to be available to whatever is

98
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:32,600
occurring in the present moment at any sense

99
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:40,079
door with the emphasis on appreciating or

100
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:47,399
feeling what it's like to not be directed but instead to be

101
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:54,440
available open receptive

102
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:19,639
and then with that kind of open receptive awareness without moving the mind or

103
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:27,199
without in a certain way directing the Mind open the mind

104
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:35,800
to welcome or feel the gentle breeze the gentle

105
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:41,120
sensations of breathing in and breathing

106
00:13:52,639 --> 00:14:01,040
out and begin Now by being aware of the experience of breathing

107
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:10,000
by noticing whatever is easy to feel and experience regarding

108
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,360
breathing not think about it but sense what comes into

109
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:27,560
awareness around breathing in the easiest obvious way

110
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,000
relaxing any sense of directing your

111
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:46,600
attention but more like opening the window so the wind

112
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,880
the breeze comes in

113
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:11,320
not so much that you're doing awareness like

114
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:19,720
swimming but that you're allowing the current of the river to come up from behind and carry

115
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,040
you along

116
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:39,120
and let the current of the breeze the wave of the

117
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:48,240
inhale let it carry you carry your attention

118
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,600
continuously for the length of the inhale

119
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,040
monitoring yourself enough to stay there with the full

120
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,680
length of the inhale

121
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,440
and then to do that with the

122
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,440
exhale the inhale is the wave that rises you

123
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:53,600
up and the exhale is a surfing on

124
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:04,880
it the inhales the gentle push of the scooter and the exhale is carrying

125
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:11,438
Along being carried moving along on the scooter

126
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:41,919
following the exhale to the settling point the grounding point the centering

127
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:51,200
Point letting the inhale begin there and then bringing all this

128
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,240
together allowing yourself to be aware continuously of breathing in and

129
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,880
breathing out around

130
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,720
if you wonder off simply Begin

131
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:43,000
Again maintaining a continuity of

132
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,080
attention through time without

133
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:56,799
Force but with a kind of intentionality a sense of purpose

134
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:03,039
that's soft

135
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:12,960
relaxed while being committed to keeping you in the

136
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:20,120
current of time of

137
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
now

138
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

139
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
for

140
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
for

141
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

142
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

143
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
for

144
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

145
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

146
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
for

147
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
for

148
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,360
for e

149
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,320
and as we come to the end of the

150
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:15,640
sitting to take a few moments to feel into your

151
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:24,440
body whatever is there that feels more

152
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,720
calmer more settled

153
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:38,799
whatever in your body it feels comfortable or

154
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:46,159
Pleasant having spent these minutes meditating even if parts of your body

155
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:51,960
are uncomfortable feel the places where it's

156
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:57,760
comfortable or Pleasant where the body feels more

157
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,720
subtle or

158
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:09,559
peaceful even if it's just the very small place in your

159
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:22,799
body and allow your mind to relax and

160
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:30,679
appreciate the presence of some AUM of good feelings in your

161
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:36,600
body that to that degree your mind can settle more

162
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,760
relax being here and

163
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:50,360
now whatever way you feel

164
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:59,200
emotionally in a better place than you were before

165
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,960
and every whatever way your mind is more at

166
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:12,799
ease or maybe taking time to remember a time in your life

167
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:17,760
where you were quite subtle and

168
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:23,919
peaceful at ease and what that was like for you for

169
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,158
your body

170
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,080
and knowing this for

171
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:43,200
yourself wishing this for Others May

172
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:51,760
others be comfortable in their bodies May others be at ease in their

173
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,720
hearts and their minds

174
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:04,279
May others be peaceful and quiet at

175
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:11,200
home with themselves with their hearts

176
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:18,440
here and may it be that the degree to which you know these

177
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:25,039
things can be a source an

178
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,840
inspiration to somehow have it spread from you out into the

179
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:38,640
world that if you can stay in touch with it maybe it can spread maybe it can be

180
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:48,559
support others to feel that way too may all beings be

181
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:53,840
happy may all beings be

182
00:29:53,840 --> 00:30:01,600
safe may all beings be peaceful may all beings be

183
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:07,760
free and may we somehow or other contribute to

184
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:15,559
that certainly may we avoid making the situation worse

185
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:29,960
[Music]

186
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,349
thank you [Music]

187
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:32,120
so good morning and welcome to to this 20th talk on

188
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:39,399
samadi and uh the topic for the last four days has been related to the

189
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:44,440
unification the inclusivity of

190
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:50,799
um of um samadi and um that we want to bring our

191
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:58,200
body everything settle together be here supportive for uh the center of

192
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:03,720
attention in the present moment centering it on something like the

193
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:10,279
breathing and um and part of this unification bringing together being

194
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:15,440
whole is involves time that we're

195
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,600
also uh uh living in time which the only

196
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:26,120
way to live in time is to live in the present moment in the way I'm talking

197
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:31,360
about it uh uh

198
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:39,639
to uh to be continuous through time with awareness and um in a way where

199
00:32:39,639 --> 00:32:46,240
awareness is not hijacked by preoccupations and concerns where

200
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:52,720
awareness is not pulled away this way and that by desires and aversions fears

201
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,840
that were settled and um and one way to think about this that uh works for me is that

202
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:07,279
that of um uh maybe even like riding a slide or being carried in an fast moving

203
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:16,000
River that's quite safe but you have to be really present to be in the current and flowing down in a canoe or a raft

204
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,080
or um surfing body surfing board surfing

205
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:26,120
on a wave going there's a variety of things that we do that we get carried

206
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:32,320
and flow skiing for some people maybe Sports um more sports that are more

207
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:39,159
active where as we're doing this the the sport um part of what can be so

208
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:45,720
enjoyable about it is that uh we're no longer caught up in our preoccupations something about what

209
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:55,559
we're doing brings us into the present moment into the present moment activity in a continuous way and um and uh and if

210
00:33:55,559 --> 00:34:03,080
thoughts are operating they either have re SE it in the background they're not really relevant or they're support

211
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:09,520
supportive characters in the event and so rather than thinking being the main

212
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:16,359
actor they're a supporting actor for this being engaged and involved in the

213
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:30,240
activity so excuse me I don't know if you I was able to turn that off fast enough before my

214
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:37,679
sneeze and um so so the representative is on like a

215
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:44,638
slide you most people when they go sliding down especially a long slide that's not too fast um uh you know that

216
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:49,760
their preoccupation or other things goes away we're just in the in the in the

217
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:56,040
slide and um the um and uh it can be nice it's

218
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:03,359
very nice and I think there's something about our whole system that likes being fully present and engaged in certain

219
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:08,520
activities it could be a craft it could be reading a book partly because we're

220
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:16,440
not being pulled out of the present moment we're not being pulled out by fear aversion desires

221
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:22,800
preoccupations um and uh and so the awareness our ability for present moment

222
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:30,359
attention has not been compromised by the preoccupations of our mind and and

223
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:37,560
it turns out that if without the mind the ruminations the stories that we live in some of them almost

224
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:43,160
subconscious the beliefs we're operating under without those kind of in place

225
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:50,560
then natural capacity just to be aware in the present the natural capacity for attention as it moves through our body

226
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:58,599
more complete as it's kind of more uh inclusive of all the different attentional faculties we have

227
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:07,160
the happier we can be the more pleasant it is the more goodness it feels there the more rightness it feels to be really

228
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:16,079
here and um and uh so part of what we're learning in in uh in process of suade is

229
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:22,560
learning the art of staying with our experience continuously through time and

230
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:29,440
in the beginning it means that we're continuous for a short time and then we do it again and continuous for a short

231
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:36,200
time and slowly as we relax and settle slowly as the preoccupations of the mind

232
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:41,880
kind of lessen that ability to stay present is able to be more extended so

233
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:48,119
not by force not by holding ourself there with a great force little bit there's there has to be some intention

234
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:55,960
some oomph some commitment to being present open relaxed and there

235
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:01,680
um uh and um and uh so that we don't

236
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:09,000
easily wander off in thought but with time we're not feeding the thinking not feeding the preoccupations and it's able

237
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:15,160
to stay in that that flow of the present longer and longer and uh maybe in the

238
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:22,000
beginning it's just maybe if you're lucky you can do the whole inhale and then the whole exhale but over time it

239
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,839
becomes multiple inhales and exhales and this is where counting the exhales

240
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:33,520
useful some people count the exhale and the inhale and uh but the counting kind

241
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:40,599
of is a encouragement to stay present uh and to encourage encourage me

242
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:46,119
to stay into in the experience of breathing not staying the count is just

243
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:53,480
a small piece of what we're doing it's a almost using count that you're imagining yourself

244
00:37:53,480 --> 00:38:01,640
counting and um and uh it's kind of like a pointer stay there and the value of counting to 10 is that

245
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:06,960
the mind has to be a little more alert to the process of counting in the present

246
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:13,240
moment and uh and as we get into it this if as long it's not forceful or tight or

247
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:18,960
contracted but the sense of settling and opening and inclusivity of all with the

248
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:24,400
center point on the breathing staying on that Center Point um staying in the

249
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,599
really feeling that we're resting in the canoe as the current of the R carries us

250
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:35,480
um if we're um there's a natural process of goodness

251
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:40,760
of brightness of pleasure or comfort that can happen some of it because the

252
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:46,040
tensions we carry inside of us have a lot to do with how we think about things

253
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:52,319
and if we're not thinking so much um then uh natural Comfort or well-being or

254
00:38:52,319 --> 00:38:57,839
sense of relief can be quite nice quite nice and as we get deeper into deeper

255
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:06,520
into it um there's more and more pleasure that can arise with samadi so this process of this week of

256
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:15,480
being inclusive uh being oriented being settled being um here more and more

257
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:21,040
fully with all of who we are in a sense is and then today continuous through

258
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:28,079
time is a Prelude to beginning to feel the the pleasure or the joy Joy the

259
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:34,400
Delight of samadi we're making room for that in the body we're making space for it through

260
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,839
time we're making room in the mind for some deeper process to begin

261
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:46,319
unfolding and um and so continuity of attention is very

262
00:39:46,319 --> 00:39:52,640
important and uh so that's what I'd encourage you to practice and um and

263
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,800
maybe even look for the ways in the daily life that you have where you can

264
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:03,480
relax the scattered mind the preoccupied mind enough to just simply in a very

265
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:10,960
simple way um the um the enjoy your everyday attention

266
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:17,520
awareness of what's Happening going for a walk in a park and just enjoying the present moment of being with the the

267
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:24,359
trees the landscape the people uh if uh and uh and kind of

268
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:30,920
cultivate this ability to be more continuous in the present moment here and now with

269
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:39,520
this maybe uh spend less time being on your device

270
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:46,440
which certainly in the present moment with the device but generally the kind of attention when we're looking at a

271
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:51,599
screen uh does something very different to the brain it actually en encourage is

272
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:58,880
a brain which is destructible courage is a brain which is caught up in its thoughts not that uh where the whole

273
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:05,960
system the whole body comes alive with awareness so I'll end with a

274
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:12,680
um a delightful image at least for me it's delightful I hope you enjoy it uh

275
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:17,760
of this idea of staying continuous being carried in the current being carried

276
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,079
kind of on the slide of the present moment maybe the slide of the

277
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:28,599
exhale um or being is um

278
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:35,560
uh good number of years ago I uh came out to my car on the street while it was

279
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:41,480
raining and uh it wasn't raining super hard but it was definitely raining and the windshield of my car was you know

280
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:47,240
all wet and there was a little bird it wasn't very big that uh would stand at

281
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:54,920
the top of the windshield and slide to the bottom Hop Off fly up and slide down

282
00:41:54,920 --> 00:42:02,760
again it just over and over again and it was just sliding down that there wasn't any food involved there wasn't

283
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:09,640
any searching for safety or searching for a partner as far as I can tell it

284
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:16,040
was just enjoying sliding and so if a bird can do that

285
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:21,240
then um I think it represents a very for me it represents a very

286
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:29,359
deep um maybe a way in which we creature with brains have

287
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:34,800
been shaped to find a certain kind of

288
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:41,720
delight in being fully in the present moment with some experience of being

289
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:47,119
open relaxed being carried along and may it be that until we come

290
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:52,640
back on Monday that uh you allow the the flow of

291
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:58,760
time of the present moment to carry along your present moment

292
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:05,800
awareness and may it bring you delight and joy so in in meditation for these next

293
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:12,160
two days see if you can work on this topic work on this capacity we have of

294
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:21,318
having attention be more continuous through time so thank you very much
