1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,279
okay good morning welcome welcome

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,920
good afternoon good evening wherever you are whatever time it is

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:19,279
even future your future self maybe even listening to this welcome welcome

4
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:27,599
so today I'm going to continue on this theme of The Poetry of practice be introducing some poems

5
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,780
one I'll introduce during the guided meditation and I'll just drop in and then I'll

6
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:40,800
repeat it during the dermit and we'll talk about a little bit and provide some other poems that are on a similar theme

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,879
but all about you know this idea of practice and there's something about poetry that

8
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,940
allows for this we might say this compactness of expression like there's a

9
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:01,079
lot into just a few words or a few lines and there's this way that to have this

10
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:07,619
competence requires some directness or some simplicity

11
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:12,740
and then maybe in the same way that there are we have a with meditation and

12
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:17,760
non-distracted mind so this kind of Simplicity and this pointedness that we

13
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,799
find with poetry might be in some ways similar to a

14
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,840
meditation practice and we might even imagine that the poet

15
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:36,119
has a still mind in order to really hone in on some of the right words or the

16
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:41,220
Expressions as well as the one who's reading the poem

17
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:49,439
they might be someone who like reading the poem requires like a dropping of way of all the extraneous spurious thoughts

18
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,600
and instead it's kind of like brought to this directness of what's being pointed

19
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:01,500
to so in some ways poetry and meditation are just a natural

20
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:08,520
companions so I'll say that as an introduction

21
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:15,799
and I'll um let's just uh begin the guided meditation now

22
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:24,319
so taking a moment to settle in

23
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:33,480
and feeling the sensations of sitting

24
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,200
I like to begin with this feeling connected and grounded too

25
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,959
this location and this moment

26
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,579
so feeling the pressure against the body

27
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:00,900
maybe their the feet are touching the ground feeling the groundedness of the feet

28
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,280
whatever they're touching

29
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:12,420
maybe the back of legs are touching

30
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:18,560
chair the cushion feeling the connection

31
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:32,040
the buttocks sitting on the chair

32
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:38,659
cushion the bench couch bed whatever it might be

33
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:46,860
most of us spend a good portion of our days sitting I pray in a chair or some other

34
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:53,760
way it's a way that we can imbue this experience of feeling the pressure

35
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,360
against the body with some awareness

36
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,780
sitting feels like this

37
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:50,820
and maybe the back is resting against the back of the chair or couch whatever it might be

38
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:55,699
and we feel that connection also

39
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:04,259
and if the back isn't being supported can you feel that sense of uprightness

40
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:09,300
this internal support the spine

41
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,620
holding up the body

42
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:47,960
and can we inhabit this body with aliveness with presence

43
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:54,740
it's like a life to the body and the way it feels right now

44
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:15,199
you might notice there's some areas of tension some tightness

45
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:22,080
maybe the shoulders or up a little bit

46
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,880
can we let the shoulder blades slide down the back

47
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,300
and maybe took the chin just a tiny bit

48
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:44,520
such a small movement that maybe no one would notice that you

49
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,979
didn't but we took the chin and then moving the

50
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:55,560
chin back straight back

51
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,120
it's up to the back of the neck

52
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:08,600
and a review small subtle but impactful way

53
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:26,240
sometimes tension is held around the jaw or around the eyes

54
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,300
checking in with the Sensations on the face

55
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:46,979
you don't have to make them be different but it might be that bringing some

56
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:53,479
awareness allows for some softening

57
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:35,459
or just being with this experience of you might say bodily life

58
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:43,940
right now opening to it allowing it

59
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:48,019
as best we can

60
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,720
and is it possible to set the sense of direction

61
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:27,740
the attitude that we're using or is present

62
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,279
as one of kindness

63
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,320
there'll be some warmth some softness

64
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:45,680
just for this meditation period

65
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:55,320
can there be some care openness

66
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:13,019
and then allowing that attention to rest on the anchor

67
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:18,500
for most of us the anchor will be the sensations of breathing

68
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,580
for some it might be sounds or the body

69
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:34,760
but tuning into the experience of breathing

70
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:40,560
the body breathes we don't have to

71
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,720
make it breathe we don't have to change the breathing

72
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:51,380
we're just noticing the sensations of breathing

73
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:32,660
what would it be like to give yourself over to the sensations of breathing

74
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:37,519
feeling the complete inhale

75
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,040
and the complete exhale

76
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,839
and the transitions between inhales and exhales

77
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:53,000
foreign

78
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:36,959
than when the mind wanders as it's apt to do

79
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:43,639
within this attitude this field of kindness and warmth

80
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,720
just very gently simply Begin Again

81
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,639
with the sensations of breathing

82
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:21,980
foreign all right

83
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:15,260
so I'm going to drop in a poem

84
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:25,399
you don't need to do anything with this poem

85
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:34,100
just allow it to land

86
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:41,640
touch you or not it's okay it's okay

87
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,080
whatever Horizons

88
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,380
and the poem goes like this

89
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:11,039
when everyone else was meditating [Music] I'd be outside

90
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:19,760
circling the whole finally I went to confess

91
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,740
I'm hopeless I said

92
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:31,980
the Elder none smiled just keep going

93
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:38,360
she said nothing stays in orbit forever

94
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:47,480
if this circling is all you have why not make this circling your home

95
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:58,700
I did as she told me and went on circling the whole

96
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:07,460
if you find yourself partly in and partly out

97
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:16,039
if you find yourself drawn to this path and also drawing a way

98
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,740
I can assure you you're in good company

99
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:28,500
just keep going sometimes the most direct path

100
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,059
isn't a straight line

101
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:42,960
if you find yourself partly in and partly out

102
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:50,880
if you find yourself drawn to this path and also drawing away

103
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:59,360
I can assure you you're in good company just keep going

104
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:07,100
sometimes the most direct path isn't a straight line

105
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:33,020
foreign foreign

106
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,740
foreign

107
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,200
foreign

108
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,600
foreign

109
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,839
[Music]

110
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,380
okay so welcome everybody

111
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:53,520
so in the guided meditation I dropped in a poem

112
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:58,620
that's where I'm continuing this series on the Poetry of practice

113
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:04,140
and um it's a poem that's written by Maddie winegast

114
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:10,380
his last name is w-e-i-n-g-a-s-t and it's from the book

115
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:18,179
The First free women and Maddie looked at the poems of the

116
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:24,059
terrygata that is the first Awakening poems I should say The Awakening poems

117
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:29,460
of nuns that are preserved in this Buddhist tradition

118
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:36,899
and Maddie was inspired by those poems and leffert wrote his own poems that are

119
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:43,260
based on those but to include some Modern thinkings and some Modern twists

120
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:49,440
and so they're not translations necessarily but just uh use

121
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,720
them as inspiration and I think these poems are just wonderful because Maddie

122
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:01,740
is pointing to something that we recognize in practice but maybe we haven't you know articulated so well or

123
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:10,020
maybe even understood so well so the poem that I dropped in during the

124
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:16,679
meditation maybe I'll say it's pointing to you that we get to be exactly who we

125
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:22,140
are with this practice it's not asking us to be somebody different it's not

126
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:28,440
asking us to completely transform ourselves into something or somebody

127
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:35,460
that we're not I love this this is like so important I feel like it's asking us to move

128
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:40,980
towards authenticity and to cultivate the skillful the

129
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:49,260
wholesome The Helpful parts of ourselves but not to pretend like there isn't

130
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:55,200
other parts of ourself instead we just fold in everything into our practice and

131
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:01,140
this is the way forward so sometimes this uh poem is pointing to

132
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:07,620
that sometimes we feel stuck sometimes we feel like we just can't get anywhere

133
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:13,919
we think we should be different than how we are but we can't stop being how we are and therefore we kind of like feel

134
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:19,080
stuck like oh I shouldn't be doing this way or you should be doing that and not

135
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:25,919
be doing this and just kind of find ourselves going around around in circles

136
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:33,960
not really having this way forward and this poem also points to oh it can

137
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:39,600
be helpful to practice with others especially some when we're feeling stuck

138
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:45,899
others whether it's a teacher or somebody else that's on the path or maybe they're not even on the path but

139
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:52,980
they're a good listener and they're sensitive to for them to recognize maybe what's going on with us the stuckness

140
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:58,200
that we feel and maybe it takes somebody else

141
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:05,100
to point out something that we haven't seen to help us get unstuck

142
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:12,200
but I'll say a little bit more about this after the poem but uh here's the poem again

143
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:19,919
when everyone else was meditating I'd be outside circling the hall

144
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:27,060
finally I went to confess I'm a hopeless I said

145
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:33,658
the Elder not smiled just keep going she said nothing stays

146
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:38,700
in orbit forever if this circling is all you have what

147
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:46,260
why not make this circling your home I did as she told me and went on Sir

148
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:51,599
clean the hall if you find yourself partly in and

149
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:58,380
partly out if you find yourself drawn to this path and also drawing away

150
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:04,920
I can assure you you're in good company just keep going

151
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:11,180
sometimes the most direct path isn't a straight line

152
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:18,180
so I like that the poet is using this word circling and and this uh poem and

153
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:25,320
we can't imagine it might be literal circling like walking around and around the whole you know never quite you know

154
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:32,940
coming into the meditation session or maybe there's this way we like sign up for Retreats but never quite go or might

155
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:40,020
be a way in which we put on our calendar yeah I'm gonna get up and early and listen to those talks or I'm going to

156
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:46,079
stay blade and attend those Derma talks whatever your time zone might be or whatever the offering might be there

157
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:51,300
might be a way in which we feel like okay I'm going to do this but yet we

158
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:57,599
just find ourselves kind of circling around this of course is not uncommon

159
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:03,839
that especially you know this path as you know it's not the usual way in which

160
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:09,540
we do things so it might take some circling around before we can maybe

161
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:16,140
settle in so this might be one way we might understand this word circling that the

162
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:24,420
poet is using here but maybe circling also means the sense of being stuck

163
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:32,579
like not getting anywhere I'm just maybe moving a little bit but it just feels like it's a circle like there's no sense

164
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:38,420
of um forward Direction This Center movement

165
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:43,859
and then something that we might think about or consider that this feeling of

166
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:51,060
stuckness of not getting anywhere of just circling most likely

167
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:56,460
is related to holding to views

168
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:01,560
holding on to beliefs having these particular Notions that we

169
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:07,020
are maybe on uh intentionally or maybe at the top of

170
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:13,200
mind and maybe even unknowingly these ideas that we're holding on to

171
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:19,380
because views have a sense of embeddedness

172
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:25,140
a sense of inertia this like resistance to change that's

173
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:34,160
partly what makes them views is that they're there and we may not even recognize them and they're not shifting

174
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:40,160
maybe I'll say the only things in our experience ever

175
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:45,240
that don't shift or change our views

176
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:52,260
everything else is changing our experience is changing things we see hear taste touch

177
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:59,579
they're changing all of our experiences are changing only views like Notions we have are

178
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:04,800
things that don't change so if we have this feeling of stuckness there's a view

179
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,440
that we're holding on to that we're not quite noticing

180
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:17,579
so in this poem practitioner she has this view I'm hopeless she has this idea

181
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:25,380
right I'm hopeless and implicit in this idea is like I can't do this everybody else can but I

182
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:31,800
can't do this and we might recognize well okay that's just the hindrance of doubt

183
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:37,500
this is a part of practice doubt I can say it feels like this it feels

184
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:45,420
like this hopelessness it feels like wanting to give up it feels like that I

185
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:50,640
somehow and separate from everybody else I can't do this but everybody else can

186
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:55,760
something deficient or insufficient in me

187
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:02,099
and so what can we do when we feel doubt there's a few things one is I would say

188
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:07,200
is to investigate is there a way there's two things that

189
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:14,400
we can notice what what does this doubt feel like this sense of hopelessness maybe it feels

190
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:22,260
like this heaviness in the shoulders or this way in which there's a sense of

191
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:28,680
I don't know giving up it's kind of deflation it's one way we can investigate the

192
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:34,440
actual experience another way we can investigate we have

193
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:39,660
this sense of Doubt is to maybe uh see

194
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:45,240
if there's a question that we can formulate

195
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:52,980
is there is there something like we can hold maybe like boil down to this doubt

196
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:59,099
instead of I'm hopeless is there something like why

197
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:06,020
or maybe the question could be something like everybody else having this difficulty

198
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:14,000
is this part of the path is to recognize how out of control our minds are

199
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:20,520
is it the case that in the beginning practice is difficult or some days are

200
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:26,640
easier than others I just offer these as suggestions so that could be a second way to work with

201
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:33,180
doubt so this feeling is stuck this feeling of just circling is certainly not getting

202
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:39,359
in anywhere most likely related to holding on to views

203
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:45,780
one view can be in this poem the person has a sense of I'm hopeless

204
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:51,320
to this view which we might understand is doubt doubt about one's capability

205
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:57,960
and there's doubt you can investigate this is a perfect antidote for doubt I'm

206
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:04,440
not going to ask oh just believe that's not what this practice is about practice is investigating what what is doubt feel

207
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:11,579
like and what specifically do you have doubt about there's another view that's getting held

208
00:41:11,579 --> 00:41:19,859
on to in this poem that's supporting this stuckness and that is the idea that things can't

209
00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:27,839
change I'm hopeless it will always be like this it can never

210
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:36,920
be different like implicit in this idea of I'm hopeless means there will be no change

211
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:43,079
now this idea that well this is permanent and of course there's a part of us that

212
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:49,859
knows oh Everything Changes it's not true that yet anybody is

213
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:54,900
hopeless that's absolutely not true but it feels like that sometimes

214
00:41:54,900 --> 00:42:00,480
but can we notice that this is a view that things are not going to change that

215
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:07,260
is what's being held on to so when we feel stuck with practice when we feel like oh we're

216
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:15,380
just circling and circling we can ask ourselves is there a view here that's not being seen

217
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:22,140
and it's chances are it's a view that's just under the surface

218
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:29,280
and so it might be something that we could drop in during our meditation practice what view is not being seen

219
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:34,500
here and we can just tune in to the

220
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:42,200
experience that we're having and that's just right into the practice just what's actually happening right now

221
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:51,240
maybe one last thing that I'll say about this uh poem this idea of circling is that if there

222
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:57,540
are seasons of practice there are and a season May last one day

223
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:05,040
one week one month one decade different for everybody but there might be seasons of practice in which there's

224
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:11,819
a lot of learning and there's excitement and we're consuming all kinds of information listening to lots of Derma

225
00:43:11,819 --> 00:43:17,700
talks this enthusiasm and wanting to understand

226
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:26,220
there might be a season of practice in which we just really want to sit and explore the Mind explore this experience

227
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:33,000
maybe listen to a lot of guided meditations there might be a season of practice in which we just want to sit

228
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,760
without guided meditations and there might be a season of practice

229
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:43,980
in which we feel like Community is more important than being alone with our

230
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:51,300
sitting in meditation or reading Dharma books or listening to Dharma talks so is there a way that we can respect

231
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:57,240
that there are seasons of practice a lot of a retreat practice no retreat practice

232
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:04,079
it doesn't always look the same so whenever we feel stuck maybe there's

233
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:10,619
a way to just notice that there's different ways in which practice shows up

234
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:15,859
so maybe I'll just read this poem for this uh one last time

235
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:22,619
when everyone else was meditating I'd be outside circling the hall

236
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:28,740
finally I want to confess I'm hopeless said

237
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:34,500
the Elder nun smiled just keep going she said nothing stays

238
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:39,720
in orbit forever if this circling is all you have why not

239
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:45,420
make this circling your home I did as she told me and went on

240
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:50,460
circling the hall if you find yourself partly in and

241
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:57,720
partly out if you find yourself drawn to this path and also drawing away

242
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:04,140
I can assure you you're in good company just keep going

243
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:10,579
sometimes the most direct path isn't a straight line

244
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:16,500
thank you and I'll see you tomorrow for some more

245
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:20,540
poems thank you for your practice
