00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,120
hello everyone and welcome to Wednesday morning here in

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:15,560
Redwood City at the Insight Meditation Center and uh already a bit warm the

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:24,000
morning and I am feeling happy and a bit inspired to take

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,320
this seat and to be preparing to talk to you

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,840
so the this morning meditation the introduction to it is uh

6
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,079
to the instructions is that um when we do

7
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:49,079
mindfulness meditation maybe when we do most forms of Buddhist

8
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:58,920
Meditation that um stay close to what you can directly

9
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:06,040
sense see and know without any

10
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:14,320
interpretation without any judgment without any recourse

11
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:20,640
to events that are not here and now to

12
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,119
predictions of the future with that any recourse

13
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:31,920
to um um

14
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,960
what's outside of the basic sense experience that you have here and

15
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:49,520
now and so certainly the five senses uh the but also the six sense in

16
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:57,680
Buddhism is uh the knowing of the Mind knowing of chitt knowing of uh the

17
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:04,159
thinking knowing of impulses desires and aversion there's a kind of like assume

18
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:12,200
assume there's like a sense door a sense that can just know that oh that's what it is as Oppo as opposed to going

19
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,640
getting involved in what you're thinking about because if you're thinking about

20
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:25,400
what you're thinking about it just leads to more thinking uh rather than what you desire

21
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,440
just no desire to think about what you're Desiring again pulls you into the world

22
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,200
of thoughts and maybe even more desires if there's aversion just know

23
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:44,360
the aversion the Simplicity of it you don't have to go into what you have aversion towards um just a simple

24
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:51,720
experience so coming back to the basic here if there is a lot of

25
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:57,159
um wonderful experiences in meditation that you're ready to

26
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:05,560
interpret as being that you're on the brink of enlighten that that uh that uh this is your karma

27
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:11,280
that you have this good experience if you have difficulty experiences uh you want to interpret it

28
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,760
some other way that you'll never be a good meditator that uh this is your karma that you're not having good

29
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,080
meditation all that is secondary for this meditation see if if

30
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,879
you can stay really close to the primary experience the immediacy of here and now

31
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,959
that does doesn't require interpretation um doesn't add an

32
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:40,000
interpretation to it just the experience just a direct sense experience the

33
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,400
direct place where things arise and they're known initially before we

34
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:51,560
interpret if there is an interpretation just know it as an interpretation

35
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:58,200
without needing to think about what the interpretation is whether it's right or wrong just know it for that and go back

36
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:04,439
to breathing and your dire experience so it's a

37
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,519
radical stepping away from anything that takes you away

38
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:17,880
from your immedi the immediacy of your direct experience and so the center of gravity

39
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:24,479
for this can be the breathing and it's it's not we're not following the breath which you can't

40
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:32,199
really see it's exactly what we're doing is we're tracking or being attuned to

41
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:38,800
the sensations in the body that come into play as you're

42
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,120
breathing and the basic Sensations and again without interpretation without

43
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:50,720
judgment so it doesn't matter whether it's a pleasant or unpleasant sensation of breathing it just matters that you

44
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,759
know it as that that simple nothing to fix nothing to judge

45
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:04,360
nothing to be concerned about nothing to build a case that you're great or or terrible just the basic sensation stay

46
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:10,160
there stay there stay with that and um and see how that's very different maybe

47
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,240
it's very difficult to do but it might highlight for you how much time you

48
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,039
spend in this secondary world of ideas and interpretations

49
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:28,039
judgments um past and future and and concerned with things that are not

50
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:36,879
immediately here so assuming a meditation

51
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,319
posture which is the beginning of being

52
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:48,600
connected to the immediacy of our experience

53
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:54,080
here posture is always in the present

54
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:03,199
moment and making small adjustments so you're a little bit more com more

55
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:09,000
comfortable in your posture but also a little B more aligned

56
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,880
and a posture that somehow supports being

57
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,160
alert to the present

58
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,560
moment lowering your gaze

59
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,039
closing your eyes and letting

60
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:42,520
the eyes rest in the

61
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,319
sockets let your almost as if you're let allowing

62
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:08,960
the eyes to look backwards and down so the eyes are not engaged in

63
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:16,400
anything gently taking a few long slow deep

64
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:25,319
breaths as the chest and belly expand maybe the shoulders

65
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:30,759
lift a ritual of connection

66
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:39,080
to the body to be here and

67
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:50,159
now relaxing as you

68
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:59,199
exhale relaxing may be a ritual of homecoming into this direct experience

69
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,440
of

70
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:36,640
now and then to to let your breathing return to

71
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:48,200
normal and take some time to feel your body kind of Global Experience of the

72
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:55,720
body perhaps from the inside out or from the center and your torso

73
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:01,160
outwards not So Much from the thinking mind

74
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:12,079
the human body is an amazing

75
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:19,800
apparatus of sense of sensing we have many many

76
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:26,920
capacities to sense to feel the environment ourselves

77
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,800
the human body is an amazing array of

78
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:46,120
antennas amazing array of commun communication

79
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:52,240
between with all the sense data that comes

80
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:59,959
in that operates with very little

81
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:08,680
input from us except relaxing into the

82
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:14,519
body and allowing us to feel and

83
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,320
sense and within this body

84
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,000
kind of at the center of

85
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:45,079
it sensing experiencing what it's like for the body to be

86
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,360
breathing our human bodily apparatus

87
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:07,720
is finely attuned or finely in relationship to the body

88
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,519
breathing breathing is attuned to the

89
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:28,600
body s softening relaxing as you exhale

90
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:43,320
relaxing all the way to the end of the

91
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:59,600
exhale with an Ever So slight pause before you allow the body body to

92
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,959
breathe

93
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:32,639
in as you exhale soften the thinking

94
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:38,480
mind relax the tension or agitation of

95
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:51,360
thinking at the end of the exhale ever so

96
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:58,120
briefly as the exhale as there's a pause in the

97
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:03,760
breath let there be silence in the thinking

98
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:16,120
mind maybe it's an infantes silence but let the thinking mind become

99
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,880
still and quiet for a moment

100
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:41,360
and when the thinking mind is quiet then it's

101
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:49,759
easier to stay with the immediacy of Sensations in your

102
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:56,519
body the immediacy of our direct experience now without

103
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,040
interpretation thinking judging

104
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:30,839
Orient yourself towards the world of direct experience

105
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,240
letting the thinking mind recede to the

106
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:46,720
background free of interpretations feel the

107
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,279

homeostasis resting trusting the direct experience allows the deeper capacities

of Being Human to operate

134
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:06,039
effectively the more we stay in our interpretation

135
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:14,639
reactions ideas fantasies distractions the more we

136
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:22,760
interfere with a full and deep natural capacity we

find the answer to all

142
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:15,279
things and as we come to the end of this

143
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:23,519
sitting to expand that trust in our relationship to

144
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:30,559
others that our ability to be present for people Direct directly

145
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:36,320
simply listening well seeing

146
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:44,039
well without with Clarity without the obscuration of

interpretations judgments

148
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:59,600
bias problem solving and distraction is is a great gift we give

to

150
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:12,559
others may it be as we come to the end of this sitting that whatever we learn about

151
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:18,840
trusting our direct experience is remembered when we stay

152
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,600
present to listen to

153
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:31,760
others to see others so that everyone we encounter feels

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:38,080
respected cared for attended

155
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:50,080
to as if they're important and valuable and so they too can

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:59,720
rest in themselves may all beings be happy

peaceful may all beings be

159
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:18,080
free and may our capacity for mindful

160
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:26,039
attention support this possibility for others

[Music]

162
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,080
thank you

163
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:32,799
so hello everyone one and welcome to this third talk uh the series called

164
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:38,760
core teachings and that's a short hand for the core teachings or core

165
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:44,039
understandings that underly how I teach Buddhism and I thought it was probably

166
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:50,159
high time for me to um be explicit about my particular

167
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:55,760
orientation around Buddhism and Buddhist teachings that um so you don't have to

168
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,880
guess or not know uh and this in the background of

169
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:06,480
probably everything I teach one way or the other and so how I teach has a particular

170
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:12,840
orientation that um uh is maybe a subset of what Buddhism

171
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:20,880
is it is definitely a subset of what Buddhism is but maybe it's a subset of what the earliest teachings are because

172
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:28,799
of the orientation of what I select and what I'm oriented towards and um so

173
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:35,639
um the first talk was about the emphasis on um Dua and freedom from Dua often

174
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:41,200
translated as suffering and the end of suffering uh yesterday's talk was about

175
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,519
um the having no views having no um not

176
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:52,559
operating finding a place of no views not centering or basing ourselves on a

177
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:57,639
particular um a dependency on an understanding or a

178
00:32:57,639 --> 00:33:04,120
view view but a freedom from views uh freedom from taking anything as

179
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:10,399
ultimate views of ultimacy which is common in religion and both of these belong to the

180
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:15,919
world of our direct experience um the idea of ultimacy that

181
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:23,000
this is what the Ultimate Experience is Ultimate Reality is is a kind of interpretation and you can ask your

182
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:30,159
yourself the question where did I learn this from where's that interpretation come from um and uh is it from my

183
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:36,960
teachers is it from my sacred texts is it from um this a popular idea or is it

184
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:45,720
from my logic or my my own interpretation of what's going on and uh and uh what are the views that

185
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:52,320
I have that uh overlay my experience and what happens when there's no views

186
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:57,880
overlaying our direct experience so all of this brings us into what I would like

187
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:05,240
to call uh the natural world of our direct experience and I one of the ways of

188
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:11,919
characterizing the kind of Buddhism that I or oriented towards is naturalistic

189
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:18,079
Buddhism and what uh that means one of the things that means is that uh it's a

190
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:24,520
it's orientation in Buddhism that does not have recourse to the sup

191
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:30,000
Supernatural world and what I mean by super natural world is the world that

192
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,280
the natural laws of science the laws of nature as we know them

193
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:42,240
today uh are not understood they don't uh that uh the Buddhism I'm orist is

194
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:50,040
kind of that world which is um relates to uh that fits into the natural laws of

195
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:55,480
of um nature that we understand today it doesn't mean that there are not

196
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:00,800
things outside of that that exist but it means that the Buddhism is centered on

197
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:06,000
that our direct experience what we can know for ourselves and uh

198
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,400
directly and um and so for many people

199
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:16,720
the experience of um heavens and hells that Buddhism emphasizes is not part of

200
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:23,280
their direct experience and um it's not something they can know themselves you can read about it teachers can talk about it and

201
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:32,280
we can believe in it but it's not something most people have a direct experience of and um uh the idea of rebirth for most

202
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:41,800
people that's not part of their direct experience that uh there is rebirth and so to to uh it's a common belief in

203
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:48,560
Buddhism but for someone who hasn't had any direct experience of it then we have to accept it on faith or accept it as a

204
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:56,839
belief system rather than something we can have known directly for ourselves and so um so I don't want to

205
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:02,800
diminish the value of people or say that it's non-existent ideas of Heaven and

206
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:09,319
Hell or rebirth uh it's um maybe I'm agnostic about it but it's

207
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:16,160
I don't I respect people have these experiences people have those experiences but uh they're not my

208
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:23,720
experience so I'm not going to base my Buddhism on those experience my own practice is not based on it and so I

209
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:31,440
stay close to the naturalistic world and um and uh and exactly how we Define

210
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:38,319
naturalistic is maybe a little bit you you know can be variable but um uh and

211
00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:44,160
then I then I take support to doing this that if you go back to the ancient teachings of the

212
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:50,200
Buddha whenever he's going to talk about specifically like what is the his

213
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:56,079
Dharma in brief what is his teachings in brief what are the essential things you should be teaching if you're teaching

214
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:02,200
the Dharma um what are the things that the early tradition was most focused on

215
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:09,000
memorizing as the the what represented the teaching the earliest texts there were so many texts but within those they

216
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:16,200
have some uh discussion about what the people of the time the monks and the nuns at that time uh were reciting and

217
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:22,680
memorizing and directly and and and what you see is that uh in all

218
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:28,000
these kind of more targeted or uh focused discussions about what's

219
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,800
important in the Dharma it's all naturalistic and um there's no mention

220
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:41,880
of rebirth as part of it there is discussion about rebirth in the text but it seems to be um not Central to the of

221
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:47,400
what the Buddha think says is most important to teach and I understand that

222
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:52,800
because um uh he was teaching a practice he was teaching at practice to the end

223
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:58,400
of clinging and uh when he talks about the goal of practice he talks about it as

224
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:04,640
the end of clinging the end of suffering and um end of

225
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:10,280
craving and those are naturalistic experiences they can experience you can you can experience those and know those

226
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:18,240
for yourself they fit within the kind of natural laws of what we know and um and

227
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:24,119
um uh in talking about rebirth is often sometimes a discussion about if you do

228
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:30,359
that you won't be reborn but it's not that that uh the purpose is not to be reborn he doesn't

229
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:37,000
say that that's a rare idea it's just almost like a add-on to what is really

230
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:43,520
core my own teachers in this country and Asia that I had

231
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:48,560
emphasized uh only believe in what you know for yourself I feel like that'd be

232
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:54,800
really disappointed in me if I if I had uh relied on Buddhist teachings I can

233
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:01,960
only know from uh belief there's more Supernatural uh beliefs that uh that

234
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:09,000
um that appear in the text um the emphasis only know for what Rec focus on

235
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:15,760
what you can know yourself don't rely on like the kalas famous teaching of the

236
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:22,319
Buddha that don't rely on tradition don't rely on what you know by faith

237
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:30,640
don't rely on what you know by your rationed reason don't rely on um uh your

238
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:35,720
religious texts don't rely on your what your teacher says rely on what you know

239
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:41,880
for yourself of what is wholesome and UNH wholesome what is uh harmful and not

240
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:47,839
harmful what is peaceful and not peaceful that's what you rely on and

241
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:54,640
those those criteria wholesome non-harming peaceful that

242
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:00,920
belongs to the world of direct experience that we know for ourselves and so we can guide ourselves

243
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:07,240
and find our way through the practice uh through this naturalistic Cate uh uh

244
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:13,560
criteria uh we don't have to not Guided by uh or in the practice Moment by

245
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:19,839
Moment by the more Supernatural beliefs the more abstract beliefs the more um

246
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:24,920
and um in addition to the metaphysical beliefs there's also met uh Supernatural

247
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:30,440
beliefs there's also metaphysical belief beliefs beliefs that have to do with the

248
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:36,880
uh ultimate nature of reality uh beliefs that have to do with

249
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:43,160
um the ultimate nature of what enlightenment is and enlightened Consciousness and all kinds of ideas

250
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:48,200
like this and um and this is also something we cannot know

251
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:56,079
directly and um and that's this is very Nuance when I was in Burma um there was

252
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:04,640
a tremendous emphasis on impermanence and they emphasized everything is impermanent and and uh I spent a lot of

253
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:11,599
time reflecting on this teaching that everything is impermanent everything is changing all the time logically it makes

254
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:18,119
sense and um but uh uh I finally came to

255
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:24,680
understand that really what I could take a stand on was not the metaphysical idea

256
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:32,480
that everything is impermanent but rather uh the uh the uh the act of

257
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:37,920
perceiving in the act of perceiving whatever is perceived can be seen as in

258
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:45,000
constant and changing all the time that like a mountain doesn't necessarily change that fast but the perception of

259
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:53,000
the mountain is constantly shifting and changing and I was then delighted to read that the Buddha never talked about

260
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,440
uh impermanence as a characteristic of reality that was a later idea and terad

261
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:04,560
Buddhism but he emphasized that um impermanence is a perception and once we're into

262
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:10,400
perception we're into this natural world of our human functioning and human

263
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:17,960
life so um so um maybe this talk today is a little

264
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:23,720
bit more abstract and philosophical but it let underpins my orientation to the

265
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:28,960
Dharma or explains it that I have this very strong natural istic orientation

266
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:35,720
and so generally that's what you'll hear from me um and it's very rare that I'll talk about things that are

267
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:43,640
Supernatural uh or metaphysical because uh that is not uh navigating the Dharma

268
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:50,280
through the direct experience of what we could know ourselves and uh and where we can find the path to practice which is

269
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:58,359
only found here and now in the natural world uh what we can see uh what's immed

270
00:42:58,359 --> 00:43:05,079
OT and what we can know for ourselves directly and as we do this uh we become

271
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:12,839
uh this mindfulness practice in this way over time we become more and more uh

272
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:18,400
um understanding of the overlays we put on Direct

273
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:25,720
experience uh many people uh who are not practiced will say uh you know that um

274
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:32,240
you know will will make a statement which says this is my experience but it's really they're

275
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:37,760
describing something that's through their interpretation of things and

276
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:43,359
um and uh so I'm sitting here in this this room here and I say this is my

277
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:48,960
experience of what a meditation Hall is like and uh and so we call it a

278
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,079
meditation Hall so uh it's kind of an accurate enough statement but this could

279
00:43:54,079 --> 00:44:01,400
also be a dance hul it could be a studio which it is at this moment for this broadcast it could be a conference room

280
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:08,599
it could be a uh during the pandemic I used to have a corner of it with a an exercise machine where I exercised here

281
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:14,839
I used to have a table this used to be my office and um and so uh to say that

282
00:44:14,839 --> 00:44:22,319
it's a meditation Hall is a kind of a overlay that it's not necessary to have

283
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:28,319
and so as we practice mindfulness become more and more attuned to how we add a

284
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:34,280
little something on top of our experience that um that is interpretive

285
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:42,720
and how much we live in the world of interpretation and how there's a path of freedom to be found when we see that

286
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:48,119
clearly and find out how not to be attached or caught in those overlays and

287
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:56,480
those interpretations and we can live more and more in our in this naturalistic world

288
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:02,720
which is which I'll talk about tomorrow which is a amazingly powerful resource

289
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:08,559
it's an amazingly the naturalistic world of who we are as a human being is full

290
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:14,880
of intelligence and creativity and capacity for healing and compassion so

291
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:21,480
it's a um that also is will be uh you know as a foundation for the my

292
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:27,119
orientation in the Dharma and that that talk will be for tomorrow

293
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:33,119
so thank you uh for giving me this chance to explain myself and uh and I do

294
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:37,720
look forward to continuing tomorrow
