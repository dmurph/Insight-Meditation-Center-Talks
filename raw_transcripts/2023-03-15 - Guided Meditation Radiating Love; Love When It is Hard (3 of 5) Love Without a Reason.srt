1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:07,980
so I think uh it's all set up here for now

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,559
I couldn't get uh the IMC internet to work

3
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:18,660
and even though we do have electricity here and much of the neighborhood around

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:26,240
here including at our home there's no electricity so uh

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,700
a little bit found my way this morning at home at candlelight which was kind of sweet

6
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,640
and um and then other things happening so

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,160
hopefully this works and uh hopefully the connection is strong

8
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,640
enough so

9
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:02,719
so welcome and um

10
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,860
one of the teachings of the Buddha that I

11
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,900
love very very much appreciate for tremendous value on

12
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,320
is that for there to be

13
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:31,020
for us to have care to care for the welfare of

14
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,119
oneself for others for self and others and for

15
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:43,920
the whole world it's not one or the other not self or others

16
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:51,439
but they're all all four of these areas have a kind of equal value equal weight

17
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:59,100
and uh it might seem a little strange to put the whole world and give it on the

18
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,520
scale and put oneself on the other end say equal weight for both

19
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:12,480
but it's true for each person that uh what's important is not the weight of

20
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,959
the object of our attention but rather the way in which our

21
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:23,280
attending or a care spreads from us

22
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:30,420
and sometimes I think of love or care or kindness as being a light

23
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:37,440
deep in our hearts deep in our body and if you turned on the light and you

24
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:44,040
could slow the flow of light particles light waves

25
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,400
so you could just kind of track how fast they spread from the center you would see that they would they

26
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:58,140
actually kind of touch what's closest first and then they go to what's next closest and it spreads out from there

27
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:04,440
and uh and so um the

28
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:11,280
and we know that in kind of Galaxy time that it takes a while for the light of the sun to come to us so the light that

29
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,819
bounces off the moon to come to us it's we don't see instantaneously we see a little bit delayed

30
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:23,879
so our love we turn it on goes through us first

31
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:29,040
and so it's indiscriminate it Cares For What

32
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,040
for where it cares for what it lands on but then it spreads and grows beyond

33
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:42,900
that and in that through regard what it touches first

34
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:49,680
is given equal weight to what it touches later

35
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:57,480
what the touches first is just as appropriate for its care

36
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:04,340
as anything else to not have that be the case

37
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:11,400
to not have that could be the case is

38
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:20,340
to turn something off in the heart to not have care for oneself

39
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:26,419
actually takes more work than to care

40
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,880
this implies that care is maybe different than what most people think it

41
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,900
might be it's something very very simple

42
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,720
and this is why as we become quieter and certain way simpler in

43
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:52,440
meditation the care the love the kindness

44
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:58,979
will more naturally just be here and not maybe even intentionally

45
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:05,900
directed to oneself but rather encompassing oneself

46
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:16,380
so let's uh meditate and think of a process of simplification

47
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,560
into this present moment Here and Now

48
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:29,539
and to gently close your eyes

49
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:41,479
and bring your attention establish your attention here in your body

50
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:48,500
enough to familiarize yourself with how your body is now

51
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:01,620
and if kindness and care doesn't so much care doesn't matter what

52
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:07,919
it lands on it just cares for where it lands

53
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:13,280
see if you can just be aware of your body as it is

54
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,740
without judgments or wanting it different

55
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:28,460
just taking it in being aware

56
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,840
registering how your body is now

57
00:06:51,180 --> 00:07:00,139
and then within that body to take some long slow deep breaths

58
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:07,080
imagining that as the body expands so does your kindness your care your

59
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:13,039
love for this body touching it all

60
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:21,680
friendliness good will foreign

61
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:28,620
as you exhale you're relaxing down to the very source

62
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:34,860
the little light bulb went in within

63
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:43,080
where kindness begins and then as you inhale

64
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,660
that light of kindness radiates out through your whole body and

65
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:54,620
Beyond back and forth as you breathe

66
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,680
relaxing as you exhale

67
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,699
and then

68
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,700
letting your breathing return to normal

69
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:48,740
he's sitting here simply sitting here gently

70
00:08:53,880 --> 00:09:00,600
with the light of Love or kindness

71
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:08,420
good will care for yourself and for others

72
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,579
radiating out within

73
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,760
maybe riding on the waves of breathing

74
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:34,279
whatever awareness senses nose feels

75
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:44,100
in the body and mind as you're meditating imagine that the light of care

76
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:53,339
the light of love is included is part of the awareness

77
00:09:53,339 --> 00:10:01,100
so that you're touched with love touched with care kindness

78
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:11,060
not a kindness for any reason you don't have to deserve kindness

79
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:21,240
but rather because it's the nature of light to light to shine and light things up

80
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,220
it's the nature of the heart's kindness

81
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,240
to touch everything with its kindness

82
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:03,440
in a Simplicity of being

83
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:14,120
love does not need to have a reason does not need to have an object

84
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:22,640
love just is part of the Simplicity of being

85
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:29,580
kindness friendliness meta

86
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,840
can irradiate

87
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:43,919
just like a candlelight when lit

88
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,759
radiates

89
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:55,280
without discrimination for what the light lands on

90
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:09,500
it can land on anything

91
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,380
that you're aware of

92
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,539
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

93
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:15,260
to let there be some good will

94
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:22,820
even if it's good will that's a wish

95
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:31,740
a wish for welfare some kindness some love

96
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,640
for yourself

97
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:43,559
Maybe with with thoughts speaking to yourself

98
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:48,020
or the hard feeling for yourself

99
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:54,419
somehow let all of Who You Are

100
00:24:54,419 --> 00:25:01,080
no your kindness for yourself your

101
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:06,919
friendliness your respect

102
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:16,280
not so maybe not because you deserve it you probably do

103
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:23,120
but from that kindness that care and simplicity of being

104
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:28,640
which loves just because it's the nature to love

105
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:34,259
nature to be kind and respectful

106
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,799
and to have that land on yourself

107
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:50,340
wishing yourself well wishing yourself happiness safety

108
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:59,299
and then to have that kindness

109
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,480
radiate Beyond yourself out into the world

110
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,100
without leaving yourself behind

111
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:16,399
almost as if you become the magnifier

112
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:22,500
for the heart's capacity to care and to love

113
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,960
as it spreads through your body and Beyond

114
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:37,039
and then to wish well for everyone

115
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:44,778
may all beings be happy

116
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,840
may all beings be safe

117
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,919
may all beings

118
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:09,320
be peaceful may all beings

119
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,039
be free

120
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:23,760
and May many people many beings

121
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:32,580
as possible no that there are others who care for them

122
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:38,539
who are positively inclined ready to be friendly

123
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,899
ready to support their welfare and happiness

124
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:51,659
let people know that they're not alone in this world

125
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:55,340
there are people who care

126
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,658
and may we be some of those

127
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,609
[Music]

128
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,539
thank you

129
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,700
so hello everyone and

130
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:40,980
for those of you who are have been facing big weather challenges

131
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:45,919
I hope you're well and um

132
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:52,320
today here in California at least locally here where we are looks like it's going to be clear skies and no

133
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:57,480
winds or rain yesterday we had been here in Redwood

134
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:05,279
City in town a number of large redwood trees fall down fell down went right across the street from here

135
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:12,179
somehow miraculously fell across the street in a way that not even a car was damaged

136
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:17,399
Park cars parked there and um

137
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:25,760
so there were three big between here and my house there were three big big trees that came down and lots of small things

138
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:32,580
but now it's a quiet day so we have these challenges life is full of challenges

139
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:40,140
and I think part of what it means for many people to be challenged is to be a

140
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:46,740
little bit activated to be preoccupied to be concerned more than just that it's

141
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:53,159
a puzzle to solve uh puzzle challenges can be fun and that

142
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:58,740
can be engaging and you know creative and to engage the mind

143
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:05,100
but uh human challenges can be seen that way but human challenges often come along

144
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:12,179
with some way that we're activated and activated reactivated

145
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:20,100
something gets kind of energized and and stirred up and and that can often be together with

146
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:25,740
emotions it can often be together with imagination where imagining what where

147
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:35,360
this is going and what's going to happen if it if it just continues and and that activation reactivation

148
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:41,940
creates a certain mental focus engagement it kind of

149
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:48,899
engages muscles and all kinds of energies which in a time of immediate

150
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:54,779
crisis are useful perhaps but as an ongoing basis

151
00:31:54,779 --> 00:32:01,440
um limits us and complicates our inner life so that

152
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,779
some of the simpler yeah maybe quieter innate capacities we

153
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:13,020
have get drowned out and um

154
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:19,140
and one of those is our innate capacity to love

155
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:24,480
and I use the word love here as a broad umbrella term

156
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:31,440
for a wide family of human intentions sentiments attitudes

157
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:37,860
that we have and so some of these words that I use are

158
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:43,640
care kindness friendliness good will

159
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:51,440
even respect depreciation generosity they um

160
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:58,500
friendliness maybe I said and so all these together kind of belong to this

161
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:04,620
family of love and they have to do with a positive attitude towards others

162
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:11,100
or positive ad towards anyone and in Buddhism we put a lot of emphasis

163
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:18,539
on the practice of loving-kindness of Goodwill and one of the classic ways in which is

164
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:24,179
practiced is Goodwill towards oneself and first start there and then for

165
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:29,460
people who are benefactors and then friends neutral people and even enemies

166
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:34,740
are included and we often call them difficult people rather than enemies

167
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:41,460
and um and there's always an object for that meta

168
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:46,620
but one of the profound things that can be discovered through this practice of

169
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:56,899
inside practice meditation practice is that love kindness care Goodwill compassion

170
00:33:56,899 --> 00:34:03,840
can exist without there needing to be an object it can exist without there needing to be

171
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:09,480
a reason to do it and probably it's fair to say for most

172
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:14,580
people that love is triggered by an object something

173
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:22,560
that we adore something that we really value something we really appreciate and and um and it kind of stirs our hearts

174
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:27,599
or inspires Us in some way and kind of opens our hearts and all this kind of

175
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:35,760
love or Goodwill flows because the object is so wonderful I know some people who um in doing

176
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:43,040
loving kindness practice to kind of awaken that capacity they'll think of

177
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:51,000
puppies or they'll think about some very cute little animal that just stirs them

178
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:57,240
up in a nice way and makes them kind of but it's always that with an object

179
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:04,440
and the miraculous thing is that yes we have the capacity for love

180
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:09,980
and that capacity doesn't require an object maybe it's easier with an object

181
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:17,400
partly because there's more energy sometimes around a love for an object

182
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:23,640
because then the object lives in relationship to us and we have a relationship to it that

183
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:31,800
somehow when we exist or our sense of self is kind of kind of pulled into it that often

184
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:39,060
activates or stirs a a little Ecology of things that are in

185
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:45,720
addition to love love as well there's nothing wrong with having an object but also it's easy

186
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:51,780
sometimes for our desires for our aspirations our dreams in relationship

187
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:58,920
to those people those kind of to be activated as well which maybe gives a richness and a depth

188
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:03,960
to that love but it's possible to have kindness care

189
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:10,320
compassion without an object without a person that it's directed towards

190
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:16,320
if the ma if the heart and mind if the if we're settled enough here

191
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:22,020
that we can feel and allow for the the warmth

192
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:29,280
of the heart to the warmth of the place that loves to just kind of be shining

193
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:35,579
just kind of be unobstructed and it's almost as if and maybe it's the

194
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:43,740
case that our capacity to love is often eclipsed by being activated by challenges by

195
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:50,720
concerns by desires and all that and the question is how can we

196
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:58,578
deactivate ourselves enough so that it's not eclipsed

197
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:06,180
so when we feel challenged then it's possible to remember oh

198
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:14,040
I have this innate capacity for kindness for love for compassion and it's not present right now

199
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:20,400
and then justification can come along well of course it's not present it's too dangerous right now of course it's not

200
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:26,339
present um the person doesn't deserve it that I'm with of course it's not present because I'm

201
00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:31,859
Justified being angry I'm Justified being filled with

202
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:37,619
resentment or something because it was so horrible what happened of course it's not present I feel so

203
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:43,380
hurt and so you know so disappointed so betrayed

204
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:49,020
and I would like to propose that um without diminishing the fact that we do

205
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:54,140
have these feelings of betrayal of hurt to fear

206
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:59,640
they don't have to Eclipse our capacity for love

207
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:07,040
in fact if we allow it too much to Eclipse it that it's too easy for

208
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:12,200
selfishness conceits self-preoccupation self

209
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:18,780
to kind of take over in a way that's actually not even healthy for ourselves

210
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:23,820
but we but if we can relax deactivate quiet down

211
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:28,980
not become activated by your activation

212
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:35,400
maybe we can come back to that place where there can be some modicum of Love

213
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:42,960
or kindness and um and the most fundamental

214
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,140
I like to think that the most fundamental kind of capacity for love

215
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:55,920
begins with a wish for someone's welfare the intention for love the wish for

216
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:03,480
having kindness so in the middle of a challenge that this doesn't require you know our full

217
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:08,359
100 attention to be safe

218
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:14,040
to ask the question where is the love where's the kindness

219
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:22,040
and if it's not available um to take the time

220
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:27,740
to deactivate to take the time to maybe go for a walk

221
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:34,920
meditate talk with a friend um do something that you know what to do

222
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:40,800
that lets your activated system calm down quiet down a bit

223
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:47,460
and certainly not continue doing the very thing that keeps you activated and

224
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:54,180
reactivated and um and you know without aversion for

225
00:39:54,180 --> 00:40:00,480
the activation without condemnation but with this principle that yes we're

226
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:06,780
looking at coming back to the Simplicity of being where a basic Goodwill basic

227
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:13,859
kindness and friendliness has a chance to shine that doesn't need a reason

228
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:22,079
and because it doesn't need a reason it has the capacity capacity to shine

229
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:28,260
its Good Will equally on everything it can Shine the Good Will on our

230
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:34,380
activation on our anger on our sense of betrayal on our hurt

231
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:40,140
on our enemies on our you know all of our just you know all

232
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:45,780
maybe maybe we're disappointed with ourselves in a challenge maybe we made a

233
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:51,420
mistake but that Simple Kindness is there just

234
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:58,619
to hold it all all of Who We Are we have this capacity Within

235
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:05,880
for unconditional kind regard we have this capacity within for an

236
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:11,220
unconditional um good will

237
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:17,339
regardless of what's happened regardless of what we've done regardless of how we think

238
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:23,520
about ourselves and that that should live within us

239
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,859
the capacity to Love Without A Reason without that justification just that the

240
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:35,880
nature of the Heart To Love is a phenomenal thing

241
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:42,599
and so where's the love where is the kindness

242
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:47,940
in the middle of a challenge where is it and just that question carrying that

243
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:53,160
question with us might be enough to for us to recognize little hints of the

244
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:59,880
kindness that's there but if there's none it's probably an indication

245
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:06,119
that what's important to do now is not to stay in the middle of

246
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:11,640
being activated but finding some way to deactivate enough

247
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:19,099
do you reactivate enough cannot caught in the cycles of activation and reactivation

248
00:42:19,099 --> 00:42:24,660
and this is where meditation comes into play mindfulness comes into play

249
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:31,920
this is where learning to relax comes into play relaxation is a skill that we can get

250
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:40,680
become good at by practicing it and then to come back to the challenge

251
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:46,740
with some kindness some kind regard some good will

252
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:52,260
so the challenge is not the only game in town there's another game there's another

253
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:57,859
perspective there's a perspective of love

254
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:05,760
so um as you go through today

255
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:11,880
and you run into challenges ask yourself the question where is the love

256
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:19,859
and if there's not available how are you activated and what can you do that's realistic and

257
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:25,200
reasonable to deactivate enough that there is this unconditional

258
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:30,900
kindness kind regard for yourself for all things

259
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:38,400
as you find your way with the challenge so thank you very much and I wish you a

260
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,560
lot well with this exercise of Good Will kindness and love

261
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:49,619
and um it's a very worthwhile thing to do

262
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:52,279
thank you
