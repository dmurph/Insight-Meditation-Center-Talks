1
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:10,240
so good morning everyone and welcome and

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:21,520
there is a um some of us a surprising aspect of

3
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:27,519
this meditation practice and uh

4
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:34,000
there's a pro one of the surprising aspects is that it benefits a lot

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,920
from not doing anything or undoing a lot of the doings that we

6
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,960
do stress is often a symptom of

7
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,719
over activity in the mind the heart it involves tension and stress always

8
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,800
involves some kind of something is activated and so to be stressed or be tense

9
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:03,600
something has contracted or gotten tight or overused or exhausted

10
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,080
turns out that a lot of emotions that emotions that are stressful

11
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,240
are not just uh sitting around we're just sitting doing nothing and they kind of just

12
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:24,000
glide through effortlessly and are there for a while effortlessly at some point they effortlessly leave

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,079
the difficult emotions are uh activities they're processes that

14
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:36,240
are maybe we don't say that we personally are involved in are doing

15
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,720
but something about our being is involved in doing them we're activated in some way and

16
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,720
chasing after certain thoughts involved in certain thoughts involved in certain desires and

17
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:56,560
involved with memories and involved with aversions and preferences

18
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,719
and uh and so a big part of meditation is undoing

19
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:09,360
is beginning to let go of all the doings the activities that what goes on

20
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:17,360
and some people who have a strong habit for doing will overdo meditation

21
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,040
they'll just transfer their tendency i have to fix something i have to do something and make something happen

22
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,560
and engage in an overactive way to meditate and that just keeps us

23
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,879
agitated so an important part of meditation is learning to

24
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:41,680
the art of doing less sometimes teachers will say do nothing

25
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,800
but be alert alert and nothing else

26
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,480
the um and uh so

27
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,680
i wonder for this meditation whether [Music]

28
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,840
we have to do some things we have to for example sit down and assume a meditation

29
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,400
posture and ideally take time to find a posture that is

30
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,879
suitable for being alert given whatever conditions you have physically and mentally

31
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:21,360
emotionally but to promote alertness to be

32
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,159
aware in a way that feels like we're clearly aware

33
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,840
and to remain that way but to remain that way maybe by mostly

34
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,239
letting go of all the other doings that take us away

35
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:45,599
if we start thinking about something yesterday think about yesterday then we're involved in an activity

36
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:53,280
if we're planning for tomorrow not only are we involved in those thoughts but it might be fueled by

37
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,319
anxiety and that anxiety is not

38
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:04,959
effortless it involves something in our system which is activated and doing

39
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,480
and so what can we let go of

40
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,840
what can we stop doing and the ending of a lot of doing

41
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,199
is not nothing but allows this psychophysical system that we are

42
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:28,160
to operate in the most healthy way possible it's stress and excessive doing that

43
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,880
interferes with the natural kind of healing and healthful healthness

44
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,840
of this being of ours so

45
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:49,520
um to assume then a comfortable alert posture

46
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,840
and to begin with relaxation is um

47
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:07,840
his process of beginning to let go of a certain kinds of doings

48
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:16,720
certain kind of activities that are not only physical but express something that's happening mentally

49
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:24,639
and so to gently close the eyes

50
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,960
and so that the relaxation maybe can be a little fuller

51
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,880
you might take a deep long inhale so in that deep inhale

52
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,919
you really feel more of the body than you usually do

53
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:49,360
it's like entering more fully into the realm of your body as you breathe in deeply

54
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:56,240
and with that connection to your body on the exhale to let go

55
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,199
to relax

56
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,759
for a moment or two to do nothing except to

57
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:14,759
let go and let go with the exhale

58
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,840
and then letting the breathing return to normal

59
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,919
and on the exhale

60
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:52,000
i kind of think of the inhale as more of a doing and the exhale is more of a not doing

61
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,800
letting go of doing so on that exhale

62
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:05,599
to relax more of your body recognizing doing so you're relaxing

63
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:11,520
something deep inside as well maybe you can even

64
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,639
sense and feel how relaxing the body does something

65
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:23,360
good for the rest of our inner life

66
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,280
relaxing the muscles of the face

67
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,560
relaxing the shoulders

68
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,240
relaxing the belly

69
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:17,240
relaxing maybe the whole body in some global way

70
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:38,640
on the exhale maybe just maybe you can release the grip of

71
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,560
anxiety you might be holding

72
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,560
maybe you can release the grip of resentment

73
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,160
or hostility you're holding

74
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:23,839
and maybe you can let go of any way you're holding on onto or

75
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:33,000
leaning into sadness and grief

76
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,959
and then to settle into your breathing

77
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:06,720
in a way of doing less with breath meditation

78
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,399
maybe do less is too

79
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,079
at the beginning of the inhale

80
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:26,240
to imagine that the body is receiving

81
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,000
the sensations of breathing in

82
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:47,399
that you're not actively going how to feel the inhale

83
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,680
your awareness is receiving

84
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:01,000
your settle back and open up and receive

85
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:10,399
and that at the top of the inhale

86
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,760
to allow the exhale

87
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,880
to allow the exhale to begin

88
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,320
and get out of the way allow it to proceed

89
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:54,519
receiving the inhale allowing the exhale

90
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:09,320
and if the mind starts getting involved in thinking that's a doing

91
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,639
that's not needed and maybe you can relax the thinking

92
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,639
mind

93
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,800
relax the reactive mind

94
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,600
relax the stress in the mind

95
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,560
and then receive the inhale

96
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:05,320
and allow the exhale and all you do is accompany

97
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:15,160
this process of breathing stay there accompany it intimately

98
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,759
ah

99
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,839
[Music]

100
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,280
be being alert enough to notice when you're doing something

101
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,280
unnecessary

102
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:05,679
unnecessary thinking unnecessary acting unnecessary stress

103
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:20,400
and either let go of it or lessen the intensity of it

104
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,320
quieting the mind

105
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:26,960
and the receiving of the inhale can be expanded to sitting here doing

106
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:33,279
nothing but receiving the present moment

107
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:40,960
trusting there's so little to do but be aware of how things occur

108
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,760
receiving it

109
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,919
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

110
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:08,559
there's a wonderful reciprocity of receiving and giving

111
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:15,360
not the giving that is willful or assertion of self or trying to do the

112
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:20,480
right thing but rather

113
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:26,640
it is the giving that wells up from this

114
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:34,799
receptive quiet non-doing place with which we can be aware

115
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,159
the simplicity of giving

116
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:53,519
where they say that they talk about the emptiness of the giver the receiver and the gift

117
00:29:53,600 --> 00:30:01,440
meaning the lack of a lot of assertion judgments needs

118
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:09,158
the absence of reifying self or other and

119
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,799
close to a natural welling up of generosity and care and

120
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:24,399
love compassion and may it be that on this day

121
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:30,159
that you explore a little bit what it's like to

122
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:37,120
be in a receptive mode to take in situations you're in more

123
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:44,240
fully without the assertion of self for the contraction of self

124
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:51,679
to receive do less then

125
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,600
see if there's a natural giving

126
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:03,399
a caring a good will that might be there as well

127
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:14,080
and may it be so may this practice that we do tap us into the wellsprings

128
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:20,480
of love of care generosity goodness

129
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:28,480
that is found within us so that we can live this life

130
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,640
contributing to a better world for everyone

131
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:42,640
may all beings be happy may all beings

132
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:47,840
be safe may all beings

133
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:54,480
be peaceful may all beings be free

134
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,240
and may we contribute to that

135
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:22,480
[Music] thank you

136
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,840
so continuing on the theme of emotions

137
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:39,039
i think if us english-speaking people might have a lot of focus on emotions

138
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:44,159
some people more than others some people that's where their life

139
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:49,919
primarily is focused the reference point for the life less than what they're thinking about is what

140
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:56,720
they're feeling and some people have manifestos that they

141
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:02,960
have composed maybe in their head about celebrating emotions the importance of them and really kind of

142
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:09,679
really get into them in a big way some people are afraid of their emotions or they

143
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:15,679
feel like they have to keep them very private and are very you know

144
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:21,679
reserved about showing anything or even knowing it through themselves

145
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:28,080
and you know hold their emotions at bay so we can talk about it that way as if

146
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:33,360
emotions are something i find it uh fascinating that if you go

147
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:38,559
back i've gone back and tried to search in the language of the buddha

148
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:45,519
for a word that's equivalent to the english word emotions and it's hard to find maybe you can kind

149
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:52,880
of squeeze something out and say it's similar to what we call it english word emotion but the fact that there is no

150
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:59,200
word or it's hard to find a word that really fits points out that maybe the english word

151
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:05,919
emotion is just a convention it's a label it's a kind of a way of

152
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:12,000
categorizing a certain realm of human experience and that we in

153
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,720
kind of in our local english cultures um have you know if you take the the pie of

154
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:26,320
human experience and that pie can be sliced into many different kinds of slices many sizes and

155
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:32,079
different choices about where the lines of the pies pieces are made

156
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:37,118
so we take the whole human experience and as a whole

157
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:43,760
and it can be divided and looked at in different ways and maybe different cultures have different slices they take

158
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,960
out and for some reason here in the english speaking world we have this slice called

159
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,320
emotions but it's not something that's inherently like a thing or a

160
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:00,078
set thing it has kind of vague boundaries what actually is an emotion

161
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:07,119
um so uh the uh

162
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:14,960
the uh but i think one of the things to be looking at when we do this practice is

163
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,640
not to have a clear opinion or you know or a policy around emotions but

164
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:27,760
rather to always look more closely to see emotions just kind of like a pointer just gets us into the territory

165
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,200
of something and then we need to kind of study it more carefully be more present explore

166
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,560
it more deeply and as we explore it one of the things

167
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:44,560
to notice is what are the emotions that come along with stress

168
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:49,920
come along with some kind of attention

169
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:56,400
tightness contraction something that feels unpleasant what emotions come along with

170
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:04,240
a whole realm of what can be called dukkha in buddhism stress tension unpleasantness pain

171
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:09,680
suffering and and which of them come without

172
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:16,000
and when in your life is there an emotion that is kind of stress-free

173
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,839
a state of mind an emotion a mood a feeling that comes without any stress any tension

174
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:28,240
any tightness any unpleasantness any dukkha or suffering

175
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:34,720
and and which are the ones that are more painful which are the ones that are more pleasant and enjoyable

176
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:40,320
and and the ones that are stressful and sometimes in buddhism are called

177
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:46,480
afflictive because of the pain that they cause it doesn't it's not necessarily a value

178
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:52,480
judgment that they're wrong or bad it just means that that's what they come with

179
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:57,599
and if when they're afflictive when there are are um

180
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:04,960
come with stress the interesting question is um does the stress need to be there

181
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:10,800
is is the stress in addition to the emotion or to what's happening or the

182
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:17,520
state is even the emotion itself that we're having in addition to something that's

183
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:23,359
happening that covers it over or or or

184
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:29,280
overrides in such a way that we're not really in touch with the deeper wellsprings of what's happening in our

185
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:36,400
life the offsprings of wisdom receptivity registering seeing what's happening

186
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:42,480
and and probably what you'll find is that there's a lot of extra doing

187
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:48,400
when we are involved in these reactive emotions afflictive emotions

188
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:54,000
these um ones that are kind of uncomfortable or stressful

189
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,839
and if we can see it as a doing as an activity then we can put a question mark at the

190
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:05,760
end of it and say does this doing this activity need to happen

191
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:11,280
and and uh and sometimes even pleasant emotions

192
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,880
enjoyable ones or ones that are celebrated um they're not stress free

193
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:22,480
because of attachments or clingings or agendas or wants or desires or fears

194
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:27,839
that come along with a pleasant one as well so this idea of becoming sensitive to

195
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:33,520
the stress sensitive to the unpleasantness that comes along

196
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:40,640
has a great value because then we can begin addressing it we can begin or

197
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:47,040
undressing it maybe is a better word we can begin undressing the extra layers

198
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:52,880
of activity that we put on top of situations it takes a fair amount of trust

199
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:58,640
to not do takes a fair amount of trust to settle back and allow ourselves to feel and

200
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:04,320
sense and step away from the doing the activity the straining the directing of

201
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:10,720
attention the mind feelings that goes on but the the

202
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:17,920
the gift of that is that this psychophysical being that we are

203
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:25,359
moves towards health when it's not stressed out it moves towards a deeper sensitivity

204
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:30,400
and deeper wisdom about our life

205
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:36,640
when when that wisdom is not overridden or eclipsed

206
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:43,839
by overactive mind over stressed mind over

207
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:51,680
agitated mind and i've certainly had an overstressed over-activated over-agitated mind

208
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:57,359
and at least in me i could see that it fools me

209
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:03,119
and it fools me this way that um uh it pulls me into thinking what i'm

210
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:10,880
thinking about is really important what i'm concerned with is really important and i have to and it's really you know i

211
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:17,040
have to be involved in it i have to be thinking about i have to be chasing after it or fixing doing something

212
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:24,400
and it's a kind of a self-fulfilling idea because as i feel stressed

213
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:31,040
the i feel uncomfortable and then there's a reaction i have to fix this discomfort so i have to have to

214
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:36,240
think more get more involved in all this and something has to happen here because

215
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:41,599
that's part of sometimes the the the call of stressful say something needs to

216
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:47,839
happen here and so there's a pull into being more stressed

217
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:53,599
and then if i go and relax it settle down meditate

218
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:59,839
that then i find that actually i was tricked into thinking all this stuff out

219
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:07,839
that the stress was uh was it so i had a huge influence impact on

220
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:13,119
how i see the world how i see myself the situation that was not wise and that in

221
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:18,880
fact it might have been a little bit diluted and so to be able to undo

222
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:25,119
to not address something but to undress something in the mind just quiet down

223
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:31,920
settle down become more peaceful and practice kind of an undoing

224
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:37,520
meditation as an undoing as a as a rather than a doing

225
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:45,119
rather than addressing the issues of a lie of our life it's a kind of an undressing the issues of our life

226
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:51,839
and um so that and then something begins to flow or move or

227
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:57,599
arise that restores us to emotional health

228
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:03,920
that is a restoration of a deeper sensitivity a deeper understanding a deeper wisdom

229
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:10,880
that can only be there if we're settled and peaceful only be there or say it differently so

230
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:17,280
we don't over emphasize the importance of being peaceful because that can be dangerous too if you hold on to that as

231
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,400
being the way to be so much of this uh ancient buddhist

232
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:28,319
wisdom has not so much about being something even like being peaceful

233
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:33,599
but has to do with um of trusting

234
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:41,520
not doing not doing greed not doing attachment not doing hate not doing delusion

235
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:47,680
not doing stress not doing not pumping up

236
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:53,359
anxiety not doing our emotions not leaning into them and feeding them and fueling them

237
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:59,200
with the stories that we do there's this deep undoing and um and

238
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:05,119
then there starts being room for the blood to flow more freely in their body it's not contracted by

239
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:10,480
tension in the muscles there's more ease for the neurons perhaps

240
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:16,560
to to uh you know flow more smoothly and and um

241
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:23,119
without being i don't know what happens with them but everything flows more the feeling of flow is

242
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:28,720
a very common experience as they settle in deep and well

243
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:34,960
so so as we relax we talked about on monday

244
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:40,319
as we learn to recognize more deeply as we learn to respect these emotions

245
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:46,960
that we have then at some point at some point we can begin

246
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:53,920
to allow in a deep way trust in a deep way

247
00:43:53,920 --> 00:44:00,400
so that we don't have to do so much it becomes an undoing a non-doing

248
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:06,480
and a non-doing is not inconsequential it allows the wellsprings of some of the

249
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,680
best qualities we have to come forward and you know it's not your best

250
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:17,280
qualities if it comes with stress it comes with feelings of unpleasantness and

251
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:24,000
tension contraction if it comes with forcefulness and assertiveness

252
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,480
the most beautiful qualities are not assertive but they are powerful

253
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:37,280
and they're freeing so restoration of a healthy emotional

254
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:43,680
life it's one of the great things to do so thank you

255
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:49,240
very much and we have one more talk on emotions tomorrow
