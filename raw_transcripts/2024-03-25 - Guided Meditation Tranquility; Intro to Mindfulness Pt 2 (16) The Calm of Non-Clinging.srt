00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,160
hello everyone and warm greetings on this Monday

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,400
morning and so

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,519
today the guided meditation will be around

4
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:25,640
tranquility and calm and the idea being that uh when we

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:33,840
let go when we relax when we stop our clinging releasing our

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,840
attachments one of the signs of that one of the consequences of that is some

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:47,760
degree of Tranquility some degree of calm or peace or ease

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:57,000
or uh lightness a lightening up and there's one thing to let

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,879
go it's another thing to appreciate appreciate the consequences of letting

10
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:10,439
go it's one thing to have compulsion addiction be caught up in something and

11
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:17,360
it's something else to become aware of beyond the edges of the

12
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:25,079
attachment there is some modum of Tranquility of Peace

13
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:31,880
Serenity ease calm I use all these different words

14
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:37,479
because different people resonate with different

15
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:45,159
words so in this meditation I'll guide you a bit to

16
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:51,640
appreciate the calm that's there or the peace or the

17
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,960
degree of Tranquility which is there when we're not attached not clinging to

18
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:06,640
something and sometimes that that calm is the calm of recognizing an

19
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:15,560
absence in the absence of agitation in the absence of

20
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:23,680
clinging there right there in that sense of absence there's a hint of Serenity of

21
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,840
Peace so assuming a meditation

22
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:36,760
posture and gently closing your

23
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,920
eyes and gently maybe slowly as if you have all the time in the

24
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,800
world take a comfortably deeper breath than

25
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,440
usual and let go release exhale longer than

26
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,959
usual but only to the degree which it's comfortable to do

27
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:18,239
so comfortably slow inhale and slow exhale comfortably longer than

28
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:32,400
usual on the exhale re relax your body

29
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,319
especially around the

30
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,480
shoulders and let your breathing return to

31
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,720
normal

32
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:17,200
and with a normal breathing on the

33
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:24,280
exhale soften in the face around the eyes

34
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720
cheeks

35
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,759
around the

36
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:05,520
forehead as you you exhale relaxing around the shoulders or softening around whatever

37
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,918
tension might there be

38
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,479
there on the exhale softening the

39
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,639
belly

40
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:31,560
and there can coexist tension

41
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,960
and relaxation different parts of the

42
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:44,199
body there can coexist agitation and

43
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:48,479
calm in different parts of the

44
00:06:53,240 --> 00:07:00,240
body find in your body the places of calm places of

45
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,800
relatively more relaxed

46
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
easeful

47
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:49,639
and if there is tension in the thinking mind as you as you

48
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:54,000
exhale Relax The Thinking

49
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:04,800
mind maybe with a vision the image of a lake surface of the lake that when

50
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:11,599
the wind dies the waves disappear

51
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:18,319
and the surface becomes still and quiet and wide

52
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:27,680
broad so relax the thinking mind the waves of thinking slow

53
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
down

54
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:01,160
gently lightly

55
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:08,440
stay in touch with your breathing with a very light

56
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,640
touch whatever way you're breathing let it be that

57
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:19,600
way without any judgments of

58
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:26,079
it whether it's comfortable or uncomfortable let it be the way it

59
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:34,240
is almost as if awareness through the

60
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:40,880
body is lightly touching in touch

61
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,760
with the oscillation of breathing in and breathing

62
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
out

63
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
for

64
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
for

65
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
for

66
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:07,959
and and is there some place in your body and mind a degree of

67
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:17,279
calm

68
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:26,279
peace or maybe

69
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:34,959
ease there might be other places place there might be

70
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:45,360
agitation tension a

71
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:54,160
heaviness it's okay that's there but for now be on the edges of it

72
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:01,120
elsewhere find the places there is calm and peaceful

73
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:17,160
breathe with that calm gently letting the breath accompany

74
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,399
the

75
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
calm

76
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
for

77
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
for

78
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
for

79
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:50,720
and if you find yourself thinking a lot caught up in your thoughts or

80
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:59,000
concerns or caught up in some feeling of resistance or tension or holding to how

81
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,319
you're feeling let

82
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:10,440
go relax soften up a

83
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:17,160
bit and notice in the relaxing letting

84
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:23,240
go is there some Tranquility some

85
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:30,920
calm that you can appreciate

86
00:16:53,279 --> 00:17:01,360
whatever degree of calm there is let that calm be a

87
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,798
companion to your breathing mindfulness of

88
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
breathing

89
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:48,520
releasing any hold there is on your

90
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:59,919
thinking sometimes called the fist in the mind open the hand of the Mind

91
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:07,840
release the clinging and

92
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:15,919
appreciate the Tranquility or calm lightness or

93
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:21,039
ease that might come with letting

94
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
go

95
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
for

96
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
for

97
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

98
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
for

99
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:56,440
agitation and peace can coexist within

100
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:06,159
us if we identify or are oriented towards the

101
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:13,200
agitation the clinging it can seem like it's the whole

102
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:20,200
world if we identify with the peace the

103
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,799
Tranquility if we're oriented towards

104
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:32,720
that they can make space for this agitation to settle

105
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:40,080
more can make room for release of our

106
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
attachment

107
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

108
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

109
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,880
any degree of Tranquility you might feel

110
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:29,000
calm as you exhale

111
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:36,520
make a small adjustment to your exhale that is some equivalent for

112
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,400
you as going

113
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:50,000
ah savoring enjoying the calm that's

114
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
here

115
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
for

116
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

117
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
for

118
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
for

119
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:52,480
and as we come to the end of this

120
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:02,960
sitting imagine being with whatever calm you have right

121
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,278
now whatever way you might be

122
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:16,760
settled in the midst of some of the challenges you expect

123
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:24,200
today however small however big imagining that you don't have

124
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:29,399
to respond or react right away

125
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:37,600
but you're allowed to just be there in the middle of it calmly in the way you are

126
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:43,279
now present

127
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,279
at

128
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,120
attentive

129
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:17,080
and for you to remain calm in these

130
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:24,600
situations what did you let go of what was not present that usually

131
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:30,120
present for you

132
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:45,640
and in this act of imagination for a few more breaths

133
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:50,960
appreciating the absence of that reactivity or

134
00:28:51,840 --> 00:29:00,039
attachment you're allowed to be here breathing simple relaxed

135
00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:53,080
and then from whatever calm place you have now extending your good will out into

136
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:58,320
the world considering the people you'll meet

137
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:06,360
today and others Beyond them may it be your

138
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:12,399
wish that they be well that they be happy and

139
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:18,679
safe and may it be that you contribute to that in how you are with

140
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:26,080
them may all beings be happy may all

141
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:33,760
beings be safe may all beings be

142
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:39,200
peaceful may all beings be

143

00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,039
thank

146

you

147
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,840
e

148
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:24,600
so hello on this Monday morning and as we begin a new theme for

149
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:31,039
this week a theme which is a continuation of this series I've been giving

150
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:36,360
on uh introduction to mindfulness this is part two of that

151
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:41,840
series and today last week I talked about mindfulness of

152
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:49,279
clinging and uh the one of the Buddha's common teachings about clinging is the

153
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:54,880
way that clinging gathers together collects and accumulates over time so

154
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:02,639
that there is B there are bundles of clinging and um

155
00:33:02,639 --> 00:33:09,600
the so the opposite of that is non- clinging and the absence of B the

156
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,760
absence of accumulated clinging and so what we want to start

157
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:20,799
noticing in mindfulness not just what's present but there is a time in mindfulness we want to notice so be

158
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:28,279
mindful of what is absence and any given moment uh there is um

159
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:35,760
you know infinite number of things which are absent to our awareness so you can be quite busy if you try to be take into

160
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:43,159
account all of it but in the teachings in this practice we want to notice some the Salient absences that are really

161
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:49,519
significant in the moment in relationship to clinging the absence of

162
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:57,919
clinging and um and we want to appreciate that absence to make room for more of it uh the recognition of the

163
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:03,000
value and the goodness and the healthiness of non- clinging supports

164
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,079
the heart the mind the body the whole system we have to start becoming more

165
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:15,599
oriented to the world of non- clinging uh growing up many people are

166
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:21,760
not taught to pay attention to the qualities characteristics of a non-

167
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:27,760
clinging heart non- clinging mind and what we're anything we we by somehow

168
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:33,679
rather we get the message to cling more want more be attached have more do more

169
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:40,520
and uh or because we're afraid we get the message that we have to kind of uh

170
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:48,040
you know uh clamp down hold back shrink resist and which is a form of clinging

171
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:53,240
as well but there's something phenomenal that could happen when we start

172
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:59,359
orienting ourselves to non- clinging and so that's a theme for this week and so

173
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:05,160
one of the ways that this works is We Begin recognizing the symptoms of non-

174
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:11,240
clinging the qualities the characteristics of what it's like when we're not clinging as

175
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:16,400
much rather than setting up a really hard line between clinging and not

176
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:24,000
clinging either or uh I think it's more realistic to start recognizing that there's a

177
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:31,480
range uh where maybe it's like a seesaw where there is um uh sometimes there's

178
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:39,119
more clinging sometimes less clinging but they can kind of coexist and so we might have some minor

179
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:44,760
clinging but mostly we're peaceful at ease there might be some major clinging

180
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:52,079
and we don't really recognize that part of us is calm and relaxed and um so these things can

181
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:58,440
coexist and we want to start recognizing that there is non- clinging here one

182
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:04,599
exercise that uh can be done is um recognize

183
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:10,359
something obvious that you're currently not clinging to and maybe it doesn't

184
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:16,359
have to be something that you have previously clung to it could be but it could be some ordinary object that's

185
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:23,160
around you it might be that you have no clinging to the light switch on the wall

186
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:30,359
it never occurred to you to cling to that or be attached to it and and um and you can feel how you can take in be

187
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:37,920
aware of the light switch on the wall um and you can be aware of it and there's no there's an absence of for or against

188
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:43,640
an absence of trying to hold on to it absence of associating with building up

189
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:49,400
a sense of self around the light switch and um now if it's a light switch

190
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:54,920
in your house maybe it's not completely you're not completely innocent about it but there might be something else you

191
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:00,359
can you can uh think about that has that quality that something ordinary around

192
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:06,599
that You' never would have occurred to think about clinging to it and somehow getting a sense of there there is an

193
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:12,520
absence there and um and absence of tension absence of resistance absence of

194
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:17,599
identification perhaps and so in that absence there

195
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,640
might be some calm some hints of calm or peace or

196
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:28,440
Tranquility the Buddha said that Tranquility is the food for

197
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:35,640
tranquility that if you notice are aware of the ways in which you're calm that

198
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:43,880
cultivates that just develops more calm and so whether it's Tranquility or

199
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:50,440
calm or peace or ease that is a word you like one of the things we want to notice

200
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:55,480
when we is the Tranquility of non- clinging and that's one way of

201
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:02,880
recognizing it and to appreciate it and to uh you know

202
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:10,960
I've been in situations where I let go of something but my mind was so oriented to

203
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,160
grasping that letting go of one thing just was meant that I my hands were

204
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:22,160
ready my my hand in my mind was ready to just grab the next thing the metaphor

205
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:28,599
that the Buddha gave for this for the clinging mind is a monkey

206
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:34,839
that's swinging from Branch to branch and uh as soon as it let go of one

207
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:42,880
branch it's even before it lets go of it it's already reaching for the next branch and so this continual grabbing

208
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:49,400
grabbing grabbing as it swings along and so in this in this way the

209
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:55,760
movement of grasping can be so great I remember uh once when my son was

210
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:02,760
quite small going to the Super Market with him he was small enough that kind of held him uh in my arms as we were

211
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:07,800
going around shopping for things and I he was very he was sometimes he start

212
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:14,440
wanting things in supermarket and um but I remember once

213
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:22,480
um he wanted something really desperately but he didn't know what it was because he just took his arm beh

214
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:29,440
behind him I was holding him to grab at what was behind him it didn't matter what it was he just wanted it this

215
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:36,119
movement of grasping and uh so

216
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:44,160
um uh so non- clinging notice the degree of non-clan

217
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:51,040
that is present for you when you have some degree of Tranquility some degree

218
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:58,359
of calm look for the calm of the day look for how you can be tranquil look how you

219
00:39:58,359 --> 00:40:05,920
can be calm um and it certainly it's possible to

220
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:11,200
overemphasize calm and Tranquility it's possible to get attached to it and it's

221
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:16,800
kind of a paradox to uh that you know people get calm and then they hold on to

222
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:24,920
it they cling to it and then they get tense holding on to it and uh there can be a very strong

223
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:31,680
preference for calm that it would it qualifies as a kind of attachment there can be a lot of judgments about being

224
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:40,680
not calm which is a kind of attachment as well and the idea is to hold this very lightly it can hold your calm

225
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:47,359
lightly hold your tension lightly and begin appreciating the

226
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:52,400
degrees by which we're no longer grasping

227
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:58,359
clenching uh no longer compulsive no longer being driven by whatever it is

228
00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:04,680
that uh is driving our emotions our thoughts our

229
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:11,119
our activation of our body and

230
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:17,599
appreciate calm appreciate so this is a very important

231
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:23,839
teaching uh for people who develop is practice and maturing it as they begin

232
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:29,960
to get a greater and greater feeling for or experience of letting go of non-

233
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:35,280
clinging is to start appreciating what that feels like the field of non-

234
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:41,160
clinging the the body the mind the heart that doesn't cling it's a very important

235
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:49,079
thing to feel and feel into that and to take in the goodness of it the wholesomeness of non- clinging and for

236
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:54,839
today that the uh suggestion is to notice the calm or the

237
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:59,240
Tranquility that comes with non- clinging

238
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:07,599
so may you on this day um make your calmness or Tranquility

239
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:13,520
or ease or peace uh lightness whatever quality

240
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:21,760
speaks to you the most let it be a theme that runs through your day and and uh appreciate when it's

241
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:28,440
there take time to appreciate that if to find whether it's there even without

242
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:33,960
having noticed it because you're so busy doing things make more room for

243
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:39,599
tranquility and notice if Tranquility is a food for

244
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:46,440
tranquility that Tranquility supports more Tranquility but more importantly does

245
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:52,119
tranquility support nonattachment non- clinging

246
00:42:52,119 --> 00:43:00,200
non-grasping non compulsion so so I hope you enjoy a day

247
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:06,119
of Tranquility at least the exploration of it and

248
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:13,520
um and if you find no Tranquility at all um I hope you enjoy um how that

249
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:21,599
highlights what is happening for you and that you can be mindful of that thank

250
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,720
you
