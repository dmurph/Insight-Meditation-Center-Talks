00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:06,779
hello everyone Welcome to our meditation together

2
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:12,719
and uh I very much appreciate that the

3
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,880
gatherness of this practice that we never really walk this path Dharma path

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,580
path alone even if we're meditating alone it's not really alone

5
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:29,160
we're accompanied by generations of

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,920
practitioners before us and many practitioners who are

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,879
practicing to this day and and then for all of us here

8
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,100
sharing this time together to meditate thank you

9
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:52,980
and as we begin I want to

10
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,340
and

11
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:04,739
as we begin I want to evoke a description of the school of Zen that

12
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:10,560
I practiced in the sotozen school many years ago

13
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,840
and the way that they describe themselves first they said they

14
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,060
were they were claimed to be more the Zen of farmers other forms of Zen were

15
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,159
more of the sin of the Samurais and I like this idea of farmers who are

16
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,340
tilling the soil and the kind of certain kind of humbleness of

17
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:40,020
being with a um the you know the soil and that life Outdoors

18
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,900
but also they describe that kind that form of Zen as being the description of

19
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,740
it was attention to detail and there's something powerful about

20
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:58,280
attending to the details of our life as if they matter

21
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,979
and so one of the things that matter it's a small detail

22
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:09,860
but is the posture you assume when you meditate

23
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:16,980
and some people air in the side of being as comfortable as they can

24
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:24,900
and that could be fine it can be appropriate but in doing that maybe you miss an

25
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:32,599
opportunity because one of the details of a healthy life a strong life A Life That's not

26
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:38,819
swept this way in that way by The Winds of Life by the tragedies of life

27
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:44,519
is a life that has some degree of confidence in it

28
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:54,379
confidence is the ballast confidence is the way in which something is rooted so it doesn't move so easily

29
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:02,160
and in terms of attention to detail even if you don't feel much confidence

30
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:10,519
to assume a posture that expresses confidence

31
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:17,459
let your put your body in a position that if someone saw you or if you

32
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:22,620
saw someone this way you oh that person's confident

33
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:29,280
and there's nothing insincere about placing the body in this posture

34
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,220
even if you feel a lack of confidence

35
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:41,760
but sometimes if you lead with the body the Mind follows

36
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,860
if you lead with a body there's a marvelous reference point

37
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:52,440
to understand ourselves better and maybe one of the reference points of

38
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:59,459
a confident posture is that it's easier to see the lack of

39
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:04,920
confidence that maybe we don't have to believe in him

40
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:12,120
maybe we can kind of sit strong firm

41
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:18,479
rooted here and not be pushed around so much by The

42
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:25,500
Winds of the Mind so assuming a meditation posture

43
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:32,600
that maybe if you're up for it you feel expressive some confidence

44
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:41,240
maybe a posture that allows the chest to be open a little bit

45
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,660
coming forward into the world not puffed up certainly

46
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,340
confidence is not arrogance

47
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:04,340
and maybe one where the back is a little bit straighter more self-supporting

48
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,120
a little bit more upright

49
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:16,080
and then take some time to feel a solid

50
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,259
contact with whatever is holding up your body if you're sitting in a chair it can

51
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:28,380
begin with the feet maybe both soles of the feet firmly

52
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:35,539
on the floor and some block you have to hold up the feet

53
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,639
if you're sitting cross-legged take some time to feel the triangle of

54
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,460
the knees and the butt and maybe even Rock back and forth and

55
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:57,900
feel the stability of the contact your weight resting

56
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,000
against the mat your cushion your floor

57
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:16,500
and there's an art to relaxing parts of the body

58
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:22,440
not so that you sink but so that your spine

59
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:28,560
is gently lifted up up straightened

60
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,840
sometimes relaxing in the waist

61
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,759
relaxing the small on the back

62
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,759
relaxing the top of the thighs

63
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:54,539
it's a way of doing that again allows that kind of lifting

64
00:06:54,539 --> 00:07:00,740
up out of that it'd be spine to be a little straighter

65
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:15,479
and if your eyes are not closed to close them now so you can better feel

66
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:23,900
the solidity of your body the weight the substantiality of it

67
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,940
the three-dimensionality of your body sitting here

68
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:48,979
and is there some place in your body that you associate with confidence

69
00:07:52,680 --> 00:08:00,240
or if not confident someplace where some kind of inner strength resides

70
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,099
however weak however small

71
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:16,699
and put your attention in that place breathe with it

72
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:26,000
and if it's there to feel the confidence the strength appreciate it

73
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:45,180
confidence and the physicality where the body knows it is here

74
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:54,080
the body knows feels its Vitality its livingness

75
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,399
the body has no doubts

76
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:09,260
of the time and place where it resides Here and Now

77
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:21,620
and then taking a few long slow deep breaths

78
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:29,120
and as you exhale relaxing the mind

79
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:40,220
as you exhale letting go of doubt

80
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:51,980
of any thought that diminishes your own value

81
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,040
as you exhale letting go into

82
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,300
foreign body

83
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:29,100
a body that supports breathing

84
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,380
makes room for breathing

85
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,480
a body that yields to the movements of breathing

86
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,660
no resistance just yielding

87
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:10,339
and as we continue meditating perhaps some of the body's confidence

88
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:19,980
can gently lovingly support you to be present here and now

89
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,959
with your breathing with your body

90
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:33,680
confidently letting go of any thoughts that you have

91
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:35,039
by having a posture which is confident

92
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:42,780
the confidence can be silent no thoughts no ideas that have to go

93
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:49,320
with it in fact it's a confidence that allows

94
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:55,520
the thinking mind to rest

95
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:50,220
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

96
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:58,080
in the subtle ways in subtle ways

97
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:05,460
can you sit up a little bit with more confidence

98
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:11,880
or revoke more confident way of being

99
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,380
here in this meditation

100
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:22,580
even if you just imagine yourself confident

101
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,380
a certain Inner Strength foreign

102
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:35,840
faith in one's own capacity to be present

103
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:42,679
to be able to face the challenges of life

104
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:51,020
kind of confident that is Pleasant

105
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:57,980
that you appreciate having it

106
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:08,360
then with this confidence gaze out upon the world

107
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,740
looking upon all things kindly

108
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:24,140
with kind eyes friendly eyes

109
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:33,720
where the confidence supports your ability to remain

110
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,419
with a kind regard for all things

111
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:51,120
that kind of confidence that supports

112
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,120
Good Will supports kindness

113
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,980
may all beings be happy

114
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:20,600
male beings be safe

115
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:27,140
may all beings be peaceful

116
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,240
may all beings be free

117
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:40,760
and in directing this Good Will to all beings

118
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:49,039
we are directing it also to our fellow meditators

119
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:54,620
each of them is part of this category of all beings

120
00:28:54,779 --> 00:29:01,320
so I end this meditation with a wish that each of you be well and

121
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:08,279
happy may all of you be happy

122
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:17,539
may all of you be safe may all of you be peaceful

123
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,640
and may all of you be free

124
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:36,390
[Music]

125
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:42,139
thank you

126
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:58,799
so hello everyone and coming to the

127
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:04,440
fifth of these five talks for those of you who looked for them in

128
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:10,200
the recordings that there this week the talks are called hindrances and

129
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:16,980
assistances and the things that hinder us the things that assist us in this life

130
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:24,480
and I'm looking at these things that um categories of ways of being which can

131
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:31,440
either go in a hindering way or a assisting way a positive way so desires

132
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:37,320
can hinder and desires can help free us and move us

133
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:43,260
in good directions averting can take the form of hostility

134
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:51,620
and aversion but averting can also be turning away in a healthy way an appropriate way stepping away

135
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:57,380
that um being

136
00:30:59,179 --> 00:31:05,360
freezing and sloth torpor and going numb

137
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:12,720
is a version of being still but the hindering one is also the the

138
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:18,779
Stillness which is clarifying creates Clarity and presence

139
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:24,179
there is uh being animated the energies of our life

140
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:29,460
that can lead to restlessness then preoccupation and thoughts and regrets

141
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:35,700
and there's also a way of being animated that comes from a deeper place that suffuses us with a sense of wonderful

142
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:41,700
vitality and today the hindrance

143
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:49,200
well maybe the kind of category is not knowing and not knowing can take the form of

144
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:55,380
confusion doubt indecisiveness and uncertainty

145
00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:00,779
and people get caught up in these and make all kinds of bad decisions

146
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:06,480
because of their doubt or they make no decision at all because of the indecisiveness and they're kind of

147
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,820
caught but the positive side of this is

148
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:18,140
um is a certain confidence

149
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:24,960
decisiveness that doesn't have to know anything

150
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:32,760
it can be a I like to sometimes we don't know and they're not knowing leads to doubt

151
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:40,919
or the not knowing can be held in confidence one could know clearly I don't know

152
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:48,000
but we say that not collapsing and not getting agitated not feeling ashamed

153
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,720
but rather we take a posture of confidence if you're standing to stand with both feet firmly on the ground

154
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:00,179
Standing Tall and and just kind of as if it's

155
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:07,500
completely fine not to know and just announce even to the whole world I don't know

156
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:14,519
and uh almost as if uh people will be inspired that it's

157
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:20,039
possible to be alive and confident in breathing and not to know

158
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:25,260
so a person is has no doubts that

159
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:30,360
they're con that they don't know they know they don't know not confused about it

160
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:36,539
they're not uncertain about it and they're not there's no lack of confidence in not

161
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:43,440
knowing there's a confidence in not knowing def definitively I don't know

162
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:50,039
and there's some real value in that kind of clarity because then we don't give up our

163
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:55,320
confidence we can stay in our place of strength in a sense We Stand Tall

164
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:00,500
and then we can look around from that place and see much better

165
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:09,658
we can understand and start understanding what is happening in small degrees but if we succumb to doubt and confusion

166
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:15,419
and decisiveness and and um and kind of adapt so some kind of

167
00:34:15,419 --> 00:34:21,358
doubt is cynicism and skepticism that keeps us swirling in thoughts keeps us

168
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:26,658
from showing up in a confident way

169
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:32,838
and I'd like to suggest that confidence doesn't require us to understand

170
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:40,919
or to make a decision we can stand and confident and relaxed

171
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:47,658
in whatever way we are in life there's no reason not to

172
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:53,460
and so there's a kind of healthy not knowing

173
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:59,580
the not knowing that maybe opens the possibilities where we're more available to the World to See Clearly

174
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:05,580
and there's a kind of not knowing that leads to doubt and uncertainty and confusion and kind of spiraling out and

175
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:10,920
feeling we have to know and certainly there are times we have to

176
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:19,020
make decisions in life and um so there's being caught in indecisiveness is not so healthy

177
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:28,020
but to confidently assert confidently recognize that

178
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:33,480
I I don't know what to do now I'm being indecisive I'm not making a decision

179
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:38,820
just that confidence in making that statement Standing Tall and confident

180
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:46,560
my to just might give you access to something some other way of knowing some other way

181
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:52,920
of of deciding than if we get caught in the Trap Of Us

182
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:58,880
of hindering doubt the doubt that we kind of just

183
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:06,660
agitatedly uncertain agitatively feeling lost and confused and and uncertain what

184
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:14,160
to do the body being confident the heart being confident even if the mind doesn't know

185
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:21,780
what to do can be a guide and a support for finding someplace inside that knows wisely what

186
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:27,560
to do so um

187
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:35,220
so look for opportunities when you don't know or you're not sure

188
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:43,079
and to study yourself and see and you're not sureness you're not knowing do you somehow are

189
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:50,400
get influenced that in a certain way by that that is depleting lowers your energy lowers your confidence it's a

190
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:57,359
little bit of a downer or can you step into not knowing

191
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:04,560
as if it's almost like a I don't know like a room that you're stepping into

192
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:11,760
and yes I'm in this room of not knowing but to stand they are confident

193
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:17,700
and this has a lot to do with where we identify ourselves

194
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:23,339
if we identify ourselves as the one who's confused who doesn't know who is uncertain

195
00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:30,060
then we might not be able to find a way out to use a lame but if we don't know and if we're not

196
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:35,460
certain but we think of it just a room we're in or a situation we're in

197
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:41,640
and we identify if we're going to identify with anything and to identify the one that who can who can do this

198
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:47,460
postural confidence who can stand clearly definitively I am here

199
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:54,660
I am present no doubt about it and do that with strength and confidence

200
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:59,940
then the uh then then the not knowing that maybe even the confusion of what to

201
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:05,940
do is not going to debilitate us the same way as if we identify with it

202
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:11,960
if we see it as a personal uh kind of fault or failure that we're that way

203
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:20,520
so what are the great possibilities of meditation is that to sit with some modicum of

204
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:27,500
relaxed confidence in the midst of whatever storm is going on

205
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:35,280
and whatever confusion is going on so I offered this week

206
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:41,640
as the kind of the background for this week or assumption

207
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:48,119
is that when we feel challenges in our life

208
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:54,260
it's very easy to be swept up in the drama and their concerns and they're trying to figure out and

209
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:59,760
and the difficulty of it and sometimes whether it's conscious or

210
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:06,420
semi-conscious unconscious or semi-conscious or scheming conscious we can have strategies of trying to cope

211
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:11,880
with it which are not helpful and those are the five hindrances

212
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:17,880
and sometimes the five hindrances are used to try to escape so we don't have to face the challenge

213
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:23,940
even restlessness and agitation and doubt sometimes is a running away and

214
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:31,140
sometimes it's safer to be caught in those than to feel like you're addressing it directly what's going on

215
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:37,800
but to to but to take the time to pause to step back and ask the question

216
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:43,440
what is my strategy with this challenge how am I responding to it

217
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:49,020
what's my relationship to it what am I trying to do

218
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:55,200
in relationship to it what desires are part of it when motivations are

219
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:00,660
coming up simply to ask that question

220
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:06,780
begins to create some space begins to create some Independence creates it's got a little different ecology

221
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:12,420
than if we're caught up in the challenge and if we've learned something about

222
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:18,780
being confident in some simple way then that stepping away to ask this

223
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:24,240
question what is going on here for me what am I doing how am I responding

224
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:30,839
to ask that question from that place of confidence makes also it changes the ecology in

225
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:37,200
which we're working with it's not easy to remember to be confident because the habit of

226
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:42,380
succumbing the habit of criticism or feeling kind of somehow

227
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:47,880
identifying ourselves with all this is hard but to switch this

228
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:56,000
where we get caught by just simply asking questions pausing stepping back what's going on here

229
00:40:56,099 --> 00:41:01,980
and then if they are the hindrances that are operating remember that they if you don't don't

230
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:07,520
necessarily throw away the baby with the bathwater maybe the hindrances

231
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:13,920
are connected have a relationship to the other side to a positive side

232
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:20,040
and see if you can swing the pendulum to the other side or evoke the other

233
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:25,500
so if there's a lot of sensual desire for Addictive Behavior for

234
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:33,839
for getting lost in comfort food or whatever can you swing over and and evoke your

235
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:39,000
capacity for aspiration your capacity for inspired desire for

236
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,220
the good if you're caught up in hostility and aversion

237
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:49,500
can you swing the other side and say you know this is a difficult situation is

238
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:56,820
there some way that I could step away now pause either from the situation or from my own

239
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:03,000
aversion maybe that's what I should step away from avert myself so I can see more

240
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:10,619
clearly so so and these positive aspiration

241
00:42:10,619 --> 00:42:18,680
stepping away being still for the sake of clarity

242
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:24,240
finding a place to be animated that from within that has a pleasure to it that

243
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:29,520
feels Pleasant and not harmful and the way that agitation and

244
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:35,640
restlessness can be harmful and to find a conflict in a place of not

245
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:41,160
knowing if that's what's going on all these positive ways assist us they

246
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:47,160
work together they support us and to have these is almost as checklists

247
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:52,200
that we go through can support this ability to step away

248
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:57,260
from being mired in the challenge

249
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:02,839
to do this in the small challenges of life

250
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:08,400
so they become kind of easier and easier more familiar practices to do

251
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:14,339
then at some point you come to a big practice Big Challenge and you might have some healthy

252
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:22,279
beneficial capacity to go through this and in a more a clearer way

253
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:32,339
so now I have some announcements so the two of them one is that um

254
00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:38,160
for the next few weeks we have guests coming for the Monday this YouTube

255
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:45,060
teachings in the morning here I'm going to be away I'm going to teach a retreat and have a vacation with my

256
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:50,819
wife and then um I come when I come back from that I go immediately to do another

257
00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:57,000
retreat at our Retreat Center so I think it's about a month before I come back to be here

258
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:03,000
and with you all and I've invited the wonderful teachers to teach in my place

259
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:09,900
and um and some of them you know I think they've all they've all been here before

260
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:17,700
and um and I'm delighted that they can come and if and in this way Mutual wonderful way

261
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:22,740
of mutual support if you want to support them and their efforts they get up in

262
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:28,859
the morning while they're here that would be kind of inspiring for everyone

263
00:44:28,859 --> 00:44:35,460
and um and so I'll continue when I come back with a series on challenges I hope you

264
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:41,040
find it useful and and um and uh

265
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:48,540
and then the last uh announcement is that uh the way that we post

266
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:54,599
uh you know broadcast these these on YouTube is that um

267
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:59,640
when I'm not here it's it's people usually do it from their homes and to do

268
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:07,319
that they have to uh we have to create a zoom a room and then through Zoom there's a way of of uh transferring this

269
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:14,160
the the broadcast over to YouTube so you can see it here but we don't not all the some teachers

270
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:19,920
know how to do it for themselves but some don't and so we have some dedicated volunteers

271
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:26,040
here who've been helping with this uh setting up the room with the zoom room for the teachers and supporting them too

272
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:32,420
so they can teach this way but we need more and so if any of you would be interested in volunteering

273
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:39,119
learning what it would take to um to do this task I mean it's a lot of these

274
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:46,800
technology tasks are difficult until you learn them and then they're easy so to get a hang of it and if you're

275
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:53,900
interested in helping with that to be from anywhere in the world you can email contact at Insight

276
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:59,720
meditationcenter.org or you used to go on the Gen on the website and find the general kind of information

277
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:05,760
email and that'll be forwarded to Kevin and Kevin will contact you and and

278

happily to the chance to come back here in a month and then we'll do our we'll

281
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:33,240
make some words at some point when I come back it's close to the time of um or finishing our third year of doing

282
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:39,240
this on YouTube and and for me that's quite a wonderful anniversary and

283
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:43,880
as we start our fourth year thank you
