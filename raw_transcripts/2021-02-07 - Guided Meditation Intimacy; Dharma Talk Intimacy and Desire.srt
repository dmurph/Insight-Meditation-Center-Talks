1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:10,719
so my friends welcome to the our meditation time together and i offer

2
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:17,359
my warm greetings for this opportunity to be with you even in this format here

3
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,439
so thank you for being here

4
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:32,560
and there is a um

5
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:41,360
i think many of you know that one of the characteristics or hallmarks of buddhism supposedly is the

6
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:49,680
emphasis on wisdom and and one of the one of those little

7
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,920
kind of phrase that captures an important aspect of wisdom is that

8
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,320
if you want to be wise be intimate if you want to be wise

9
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:09,119
be intimate and so here sitting in this meditation what does it mean what would it mean to

10
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,240
sit here intimate and one of the meanings of

11
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,720
intimate is innermost to sit here with what's innermost

12
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:28,960
not to reject everything else but to have that what's innermost be the seat of awareness be the

13
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,560
way in which everything is known innermost i associated with a place of

14
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,400
quiet and calm and stillness if there if it is associated with

15
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:48,240
thoughts there are the quiet thoughts that clearly arise out of that quiet or that

16
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,280
stillness or that peace peace clearly arise out of what is not

17
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,600
thinking so this intimate intimacy with what's innermost

18
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:06,718
this is maybe a way to discover wisdom so to

19
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,959
is assume a meditation posture

20
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,160
and gently closing your eyes

21
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:28,239
and begin with gentling yourself taking a gentle

22
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:37,840
approach to settling into your body

23
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:48,840
the first dictionary definition of intimate is pertaining to

24
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:56,160
friendship so to become your own

25
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:05,840
intimate to be intimate with yourself to be friendly here

26
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:20,400
and then to maybe gently or calmly taking a few long slow deep

27
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:27,360
breaths long and slow that's comfortable for you

28
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:35,519
that has a good feeling like almost like a relief to exhale long and as if there's an

29
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:43,360
ah as you exhale and a deep in-breath

30
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:51,840
that really is almost like a recharging a filling a relief to take in

31
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,879
all this oxygen

32
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:05,599
and on that exhale long exhale to settle in more into your body

33
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,959
maybe by relaxing the shoulders

34
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,840
the belly

35
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:33,440
relaxing the hands the arms the elbows

36
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:43,840
so they're not locked or held tight

37
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,319
relaxing the legs the knees

38
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:57,840
softening in the buttocks and the hip joint

39
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,400
releasing yourself to the pull of

40
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,840
gravity

41
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,840
and then to soften the face

42
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,680
maybe as you bring your breathing back to normal

43
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:39,520
so you also as you exhale in normal exhale

44
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:47,039
releasing the holding of the face which is a doing an

45
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:53,840
activity for the existing expressions of the face

46
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:00,639
so the cheeks relax the eyes relax the jaws

47
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,840
letting the face rest

48
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:21,840
and also on the exhale to relax the brain the mind

49
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:30,720
there too the mind can be ever busy ever churning away its thoughts its concerns

50
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:37,039
its anxieties for these few minutes

51
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:46,840
to give your mind a little vacation to break your thinking mind and allow it give it

52
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,479
permission to relax to soften

53
00:06:52,639 --> 00:07:03,360
to ease up

54
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:11,919
and then to find within some place with deep inside that

55
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:19,280
feels you're in like your innermost approximately your innermost

56
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:31,199
place of being

57
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:38,240
from the inside out to become intimate with yourself intimate with

58
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,000
what is on the inside and in doing

59
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,919
so can you find a place that's

60
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,840
deeper central core

61
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:07,840
where there's not so much thinking the surface thoughts of our lives

62
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,280
are more like the waves on top of the sea

63
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:20,400
and as we go innermost it's like being under the water where it can be quieter

64
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:27,840
and stiller and expansive and open

65
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,839
and then from some innermost place

66
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,680
from there to be aware of breathing

67
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,919
from their sensing and feeling

68
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:55,839
breathing the body breathing

69
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:04,080
and what would it be like for you to be intimate from the inside out

70
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,839
to the experience of the body breathing

71
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:24,399
and whenever you need to to quiet the thinking mind soften your

72
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,839
thoughts and switch from thinking about thoughts

73
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:35,040
that are distracting to thoughts that are intimately involved

74
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,959
with the experience of breathing

75
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:48,399
that are connecting supporting you to be riding

76
00:09:48,800 --> 00:10:05,839
the experience of breathing in and breathing out

77
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,840
so

78
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,840
um

79
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,799
and then as we come to the end of this

80
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,518
sitting imagine

81
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:43,200
that you are centered in the place that's most innermost place

82
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:50,640
within an intimacy with yourself that was deeper than your appearance

83
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:57,440
deeper than your history your background deeper than the things you do during the

84
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:04,879
day or say your mannerisms deeper than your beliefs

85
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:13,600
someplace deep down inside that's core maybe is associated with a

86
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:22,320
tenderness or vulnerability a place that from which

87
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:29,039
love and compassion can come or a place that we can offer love and

88
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,799
compassion that needs it

89
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:39,679
and imagine now that you can look on others

90
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,880
and only see what's innermost in them

91
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:51,600
that which is deeper than their appearance their background their history their

92
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:58,399
beliefs their mannerisms that all you could see

93
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:02,559
was something that's inner innermost

94
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:09,840
and you saw them from what's most intimate and innermost in yourself

95
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:21,599
and all the associations you have with appearances and mannerisms beliefs

96
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:29,118
have been put aside as you're in what's deep in you

97
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:35,838
somehow tunes into what's deep in others

98
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:44,560
and perhaps in this way maybe the only thing to do

99
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:51,760
is to love the other is to have good will

100
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:59,359
a generosity of spirit a care a

101
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:03,838
shared tenderness

102
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:12,000
and may it be that what we learn from being intimate with ourselves

103
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,040
gives us new eyes in which to see others

104
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:28,640
and so we see them as being much more than what meets the physical eye

105
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,320
and what you hear as they speak

106
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:39,838
maybe it gives you a sense of something that's deeper inside

107
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:47,200
it allows you to have a different kind of respect and love and good will

108
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:56,240
so that when you offer your good will you're speaking to this part of others

109
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,760
and may it be as we come out of this meditation

110
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:09,200
that we dedicate the meditation practice the sitting

111
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:18,560
to a willingness and interest engaging gazing upon others

112
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:27,838
aware that they have an innermost life innermost tenderness

113
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:37,760
and may we then be interested in their welfare and their

114
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:41,839
happiness

115
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:55,838
may all beings that we gaze upon all beings that we know and don't know

116
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:04,560
may they be happy may they be safe

117
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:14,400
may they be peaceful and may they be free

118
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:26,799
and may we respect others in such a way

119
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:35,599
to support their happiness and well-being

120
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:51,839
may all beings be happy

121
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:26,800
so what i'd like to consider and explore

122
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:35,280
for this talk is some aspects of desire

123
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:43,599
as i've said before i think that the more proper term for

124
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:50,079
human beings would be human desirings because their

125
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:56,880
desire is part and parcel and intimately connected to human life and there's no life human life without

126
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:04,800
desire that we're going to supposed to get rid of desire have no desires is unrealistic

127
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:11,839
but to become wise about desire is one of the tasks of buddhism and to

128
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:17,359
learn how to be free of desires free from the desires not that they're gone

129
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:23,440
but we're not caught in them and we have freedom in relationship to them

130
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,599
and so the um

131
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:41,839
so in order to become wise about desire it helps to become intimate with desire

132
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:48,880
and as i said a little while ago that if you want wisdom cultivate intimacy and there's some

133
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:55,359
something some aspect of intimacy some way of being intimate that touches in and brings us to the

134
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:00,480
place where wisdom has a chance to operate and so if you want to be wise about

135
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:07,040
desire be intimate with desire and to explore this topic i want to talk

136
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:17,599
about a subclass of mental movements in the family of desire

137
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,640
and that and start talking about the outermost

138
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:28,079
the most abstract abstract in a sense to that which gets closer and closer to

139
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:33,200
something that's more and more intimate inside and so perhaps this talk it would be a

140
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:39,119
little bit of a journey from uh outward to inward to what's innermost

141
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:45,280
so maybe he'll follow along and maybe you can imagine or feel what i'm talking about

142
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:51,200
and how it works for you giving me a little bit of the maybe the benefit of the doubt or

143
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:57,760
a little bit of the focusing on what i say that might be

144
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:03,839
relevant for you or what you can identify with or recognizing yourself and certainly some of the things i say

145
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:09,920
you might have aspects of it that you disagree with but on this journey it might be

146
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:18,319
better for now to just kind of find recognizing yourself oh yeah i know that this way

147
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:26,160
so uh this journey into exploring desire uh has to do with three parts

148
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:35,040
it has to do with uh what we desire why and why we desire

149
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:43,440
and how we desire so what what why and how

150
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:49,440
and and so the aspect of this is to have a goal

151
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,960
desires usually have a goal something we want something we want to accomplish something we want to

152
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:00,880
do and and goal having a goal is an important part of life

153
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:08,640
and people have all kinds of goals that they want to accomplish but a goal in my vocabulary

154
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,680
is a what it's the the purpose of the desire it's the what

155
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:21,599
what we want to get what we want to see happen we use the word what to describe what is the goal

156
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:27,359
you might ask them and what is what is the purpose or what's the goal

157
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:33,920
and so for example um as i did this morning

158
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:40,400
you might go shopping for a relative for food and um and the goal was to go

159
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:46,240
shopping and um so you know what are you up to i'm going shopping i'm going to the

160
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:54,560
store and in fact i was able to go to the store and buy what i needed to do and so i accomplished the goal

161
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,560
and um but you know that's the it's the talking about that way it's somewhat

162
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:08,240
removed for me it's somewhat abstract it's outside of me shopping is outside of me in a sense uh

163
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:14,800
the goal buying something from my my relative is a you know it's a worthy goal but it's kind of you don't

164
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:20,559
really learn anything about myself except that i was going to do this task

165
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:29,440
and so we can also ask um why am i doing it and so uh the why has to do with a

166
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:35,520
purpose and when we start talking about purpose we're talking about something that's maybe a little bit closer in more

167
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:40,560
intimate more integral to who we are than just the goal

168
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:47,920
and and so the purpose maybe for going shopping was uh

169
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:53,040
my relative is sick and i needed to i wanted to get i was asked to get something to support

170
00:43:53,040 --> 00:44:00,800
her in her time of illness and so the purpose was to support and offer aid

171
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:08,400
to a relative who is ill and so so you would if i just said it my

172
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:14,400
you know purpose was to go by x y and z you wouldn't uh you know that's the goal

173
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:20,400
you wouldn't really understand the purpose but you're getting the purpose oh now we're understanding something about maybe what

174
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:27,440
is motivating gil and what's happening here and and then you could ask deeper but why

175
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:33,839
are you doing that and you keep asking the question why and in a certain kind of way that goes

176
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:40,240
through layers and layers inside you can ask well why are you doing that oh because i care for my relative i love

177
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:45,520
my relative and and so it's out of my care

178
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:51,280
that's that's why i'm doing it and so now you know something a little deeper about me or you're kind of going

179
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:56,960
in closer and closer in and so you could ask um what's the

180
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:04,960
purpose and it's really useful not to answer it with just one answer

181
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:11,040
if you have a desire to ask what is the purpose of why i want to say what i'm going to say

182
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:16,640
why i want to say what i want to say or what's the purpose of this activity i'm doing what's the purpose of

183
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:24,079
this way of thinking how often do you ask yourself why am i thinking this way what purpose

184
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:29,599
does it fulfill and then even if you get an answer one answer

185
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:37,200
ask again ask again because there might be multiple reasons uh multiple motivations inside purposes

186
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:42,720
we're trying to accomplish and um and then or you might ask more of

187
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:48,880
a secondary one you might have one answer i'm you know why why are you shopping

188
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:54,480
because i'm shopping in order to support a relative but why you want to support a relative

189
00:45:54,480 --> 00:46:00,960
because i care for the relative the relative is sick and and you know and why do you care for a relative and why do you want

190
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:08,000
to support a relative because it just it's the kind of heartfelt wish of course i would do that

191
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:14,400
and uh and so you keep asking and you can get deeper and deeper questions it takes you on a journey can take your

192
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,760
journey to be something more intimate and deeper and just have the logical answers being

193
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:26,400
the only answer the first answer only one it might miss something

194
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:33,440
of the bigger picture or the intimate picture or something of what's going on

195
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:42,560
so that there's the purpose and then deeper than the purpose there is um the how are we how are we

196
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:49,359
when we're doing something and the question how implies i think always brings us into

197
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:57,760
the at least my vocabulary in this question always brings us into the the activity itself the not ex

198
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:05,119
you know kind of like into the present moment the action how we're doing it is how we embody it how we go forth with

199
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:11,599
it and where its purpose is little bits you know abstract a little bit removed from you know can

200
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:17,440
be a little bit removed from something it's inner but when you talked about how it it kind

201
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,800
of really comes closer and um and so

202
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:29,680
how am i doing it am i doing it in a hurry am i doing it slowly am i doing it uh with resentment am i

203
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:37,280
doing it with delight and joy with generosity how are we doing it and um

204
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:42,640
and um are you doing it in uh you know trying to do the minimum you can or

205
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:48,079
you're trying to do more than you can so there's all these questions about how

206
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:53,359
and uh and so how do i go to the store in the morning to go shopping

207
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:59,520
uh so part of it is with care part of it with certain delight it was early in the morning and

208
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:07,040
and it was kind of quiet and calm time to be going and it was also um i was going with

209
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:12,720
with the feeling of you know a certain kind of good feeling about knowing that i could

210
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:18,319
do something for my relative and was happy to do so so and then um

211
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:23,760
and then being in the store and uh there are a few other shoppers there there was the clerk there

212
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:29,599
early enough there was just one and um and uh and how i was there

213
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:36,480
i was not being there with you know you know trying to be have a human connection with the person at the counter in spite

214
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:42,960
of the masks that we were wearing and and um and uh

215
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:49,040
you know so how was you know trying to be friendly trying to have good will trying to be connected

216
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:57,040
to the whole situation that was in and so how but how goes deeper and deeper you know so

217
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:03,839
really how were you this way how are you that way and and now we come what's deeper in uh

218
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:11,359
maybe than uh the question you know related to how is the attitudes that we have so

219
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:18,319
you know i could have done something how i could have done fast or slow but then how i did it the what attitude

220
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:26,240
went with going fast maybe it was the attitude of being fast was that i was impatient maybe the attitude of was i was overly

221
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:32,559
eager i really wanted to do something so i'm really rushing because of my strong desire maybe even greed

222
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:38,480
or maybe i'm slow because i just really enjoy it i like being present and being

223
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:45,280
in the experience fully or maybe i'm slow because i resent doing it and uh and now you hesitate and i'm not

224
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:50,640
really putting myself into it i'm dragging my feet so there's attitudes that

225
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:56,960
now attitudes were coming in more intimate more closer down deeper down what are the attitudes we

226
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:03,119
carry what is the mood of the mind what's the attitude that the heart has the mind has

227
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:09,839
and are those attitudes attitudes of the moment or are they part of our

228
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:17,040
character part of how we've cultivated and how we live the the patterns of mind and

229
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:22,640
thought and beliefs and emotions that characterize how we've chosen to

230
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:28,559
live our life and uh and now different from personality

231
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:34,480
which maybe we don't have much choice about that but character we have some choice and it's been shaped

232
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:40,079
by either by society and events and experiences of our life but also it's been shaped by that all

233
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:46,720
that small and big choices we've made about what kind of thoughts to emphasize what kind of desires to emphasize what

234
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:53,680
kind of ill will to emphasize what the habits are that we're building up of behavior and ways of being

235
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:59,838
and these all contribute to ongoing

236
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:05,920
attitudes that we carry with us and so now we're talking about something

237
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:13,119
that can be really deep and these attitudes sometimes can be subliminal or not obvious to us all the time they can

238
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:21,040
start becoming invisible to us because we carry them with them all the time but to sit in meditation and get quiet

239
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:26,960
and start seeing when i get quiet and intimate with myself what in some deeper way are the

240
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:32,559
underlying deeper attitudes that are operating for me and how might

241
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:39,839
those attitudes relate to the desires i have and how i pursue those desires

242
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:45,280
and the deeper deeper we go in buddhism and you might not agree with this but in

243
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:50,400
buddhism it's considered to be three fundamental unhelpful

244
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:57,040
unwholesome roots for our attitudes and three wholesome ones and all

245
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:04,160
wholesome beneficial impulses come out of these three roots the wholesome roots and all the things

246
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:11,280
which are unhelpful harmful that we do for others or things that are unhealthy

247
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:17,920
derived from these three unwholesome roots the unwholesome roots is usually

248
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:24,720
translated in english as either craving or greed some occasionally

249
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:32,240
it's a strong another word in pali that maybe is closer to lust but the strong desire com

250
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:38,880
you know that somehow there's a contraction there's a loss of freedom in the movement it's

251
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:44,880
kind of unwholesome there's some kind of maybe selfishness involved connected to it maybe there's um

252
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:51,359
an overriding of wisdom that goes into it with greed and so the other

253
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:58,480
unwholesome root is ill will and often in english we say the

254
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:06,480
word aversion for this but it could also be more dramatic it could be hostility so it's very mild or can be very strong

255
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:12,800
and but there can be an underlying momentum movement attitude mood of aversion of hostility

256
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:18,000
of pushing away not wanting that if that's the seed the root for

257
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:25,119
behavior it tends to be a behavior which expresses that it will in in forms of hostility and and causes all

258
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:30,880
kinds of difficulty and that can be towards oneself or towards others

259
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:38,720
and the third unwholesome attitude is um root attitude is delusion confusion

260
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:46,480
where we're just confused in a sea of not knowing and doubt and uncertainty and and not making sense of things and

261
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:54,240
jumping around in different ideas and not settling on anything and when there's confusion and delusion

262
00:53:54,240 --> 00:54:01,040
then it's easier for greed we're not connected to wisdom there's no

263
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:06,079
wisdom in that no clarity and so that tends to then

264
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:13,760
support more greed and more ill will the healthy attitudes and

265
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:21,119
our generosity good will and wisdom and so

266
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:27,440
generosity is this a feeling that that openness and availability and

267
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:34,240
open-handedness open-heartedness that's a spirit of kind of being both open to the world around us

268
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:39,920
but also um i want to use the word manifest

269
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:45,760
manifesting actualizing for them something for the world it's a movement which is connected to

270
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:50,799
wisdom and makes room for wisdom a closed hand

271
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:56,799
is not open to experience something in the palm of the hand but if we open the pan then we can

272
00:54:56,799 --> 00:55:01,839
experience something in the palm now it can be stroked by someone for example

273
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:08,319
we can clean the palm we can't clean it if it's closed so same thing with the heart or the mind

274
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:14,799
with greed something closes down with generosity something opens and it's available for wisdom

275
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:21,920
available to be cleaned and then um good will

276
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:26,960
instead of ill will is uh also this opening movement something

277
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:33,599
that liberates us it frees something inside it frees us from the contraction the closeness

278
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:37,839
of of um

279
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:45,280
of uh what goes on for us so uh i got distracted because i saw

280
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:50,559
this somewhere with no bell i guess i didn't bring the belt and the sitting did i

281
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:58,559
so maybe no bell no end and uh so

282
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:04,480
so ill so good will and then wisdom and wisdom also itself is an opening

283
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:10,319
movement because one of the primary forms of wisdom is not

284
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:19,040
the wisdom of not clinging the wisdom of not suffering then wisdom of non-harming

285
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:27,359
so these are think of these as attitudes then do we go about with an attitude of

286
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:35,040
generosity an attitude of will an attitude of wisdom attitude of discernment of

287
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:43,599
seeing clearly or do we have an attitude that somehow closes wisdom limits wisdom and so is it greed

288
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:48,640
is it ill will is it delusion and

289
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:53,680
and so or is it fear that somehow is connected to those three

290
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:58,960
it's fascinating that fear that's unhealthy has is considered because has to be

291
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:04,640
rooted in either greed ill will or delusion so how does that work and is there a

292
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:12,480
different kind of fear that's rooted in generosity and good will or love and wisdom i think there is

293
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:17,839
that's why fear doesn't fit in either it doesn't it's not placed in just one or the other

294
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:24,799
it's just the unwholesome or just a wholesome but it depends on the roots that support the fear

295
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:33,520
so attitude so so attitude is more intimate than the goal

296
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:40,400
attitude brings us into something close in to what's innermost and what makes us tick and what influences us and

297
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:46,799
influences how we see the world and how we see ourselves and to sit in meditation or other ways

298
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:52,720
of beginning to find no deep you know being defined

299
00:57:52,720 --> 00:58:01,119
the underlying attitudes dispositions in which we operate in and to learn how to not be caught by

300
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:06,240
them not becau not be limited by them not be closed by the unhealthy ones

301
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:13,359
beginning to open and open and open and my sense is that the unwholesome

302
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:20,880
roots of greed hate and delusion they themselves are not what's most innermost they

303
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:27,119
themselves are a little bit more surfacy and as those fall away and as we keep

304
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:32,640
opening generosity love good will

305
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:39,280
and wisdom they belong to uh that which is most innermost

306
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:46,000
most sensitive maybe most shy at times most tender most uh maybe most

307
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:52,240
quiet and so it's only by getting quiet or settled or intimate and willing to have a

308
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:57,440
certain tenderness that these generosity and ill and good will

309
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:02,720
and wisdom really can shine and be part of our life

310
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:08,000
so certainly we can have goals we can have purposes

311
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:14,799
we can focus on how we are but don't get don't be too caught up in

312
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:19,839
the goal don't be too caught up in the purposes

313
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:26,240
pay attention to how you do things it's a huge key and important part of mindfulness practice

314
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:33,839
and as you pay attention to the how at some point come in and really begin discerning what are the underlying

315
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:42,640
the deeper attitudes which are fueling or influencing

316
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:49,359
how we're going about our life and there in those attitudes is where

317
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:55,920
you can start discovering freedom it's when the attitudes become free then the

318
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:02,720
desires that flow for them are free as all as well and we become free

319
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:11,119
so that when we have desires of generosity of goodwill and wisdom

320
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:17,599
then hopefully then we have a sense of how to remain free with those

321
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:24,720
for our attitudes to contain freedom so our desires

322
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:31,040
can be free so that our purposes can have qualities of freedom and the

323
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:37,839
goals can be intimately involved with freedom as well

324
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:43,599
so i hope that this has given you something to think about and explore on

325
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:51,760
yourself and some questions to ask yourself as you go about questions about why

326
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:58,640
what of why and how and take the how question and go as deep

327
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:06,720
in as you can you come to your you can see if you can find the underlying deeper attitudes dispositions that um

328
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:11,838
animate your life and see if you can

329
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,760
switch to be more and more have those attitudes be the wholesome

330
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:23,839
roots may that journey of exploration

331
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:34,079
be empowering and freeing for you thank you
