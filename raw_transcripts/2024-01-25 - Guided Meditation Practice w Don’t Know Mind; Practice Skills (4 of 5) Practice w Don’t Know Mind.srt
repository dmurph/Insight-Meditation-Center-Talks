1
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:24,840
good morning everyone and good day uh this morning's weing

2
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:31,960
um exploring some different practices skills

3
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:37,520
um we started the week with learning to

4
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,600
align our intentions uh using this arriving

5
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,879
sequence a way of practicing and then we expanded to

6
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:56,719
include pausing and then um with a little

7
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,239
emphasis on feeling and sensing of our

8
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:09,840
experience and today we'll expand a little more you kind of all have already

9
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:19,799
been doing it but this um um practicing with the don't know

10
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:27,560
mind and so all of this are something that um were very meaningful for me when

11
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:34,560
I first learned this um from a wonderful Dharma teacher and practitioner Philip

12
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:43,119
Moet and so let's begin begin from the side of the

13
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,078
meditation maybe taking a few long deep breaths as we

14
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:01,840
begin this may be a way of a

15
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:12,479
pausing pausing to interrupt the flow of thinking

16
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:25,840
doing pausing to allow mindfulness to come to the

17
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:35,599
foreground and ini initially mindfulness may feel

18
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,160
flickering in and

19
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:53,159
out allow yourself to Simply Be with that that's part of

20
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:57,879
arriving arriving Here and

21
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,760
Now

22
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,750
arriving with the [Music]

23
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,319
sound arriving with a

24
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,239
breath arriving with a felt sense in the

25
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,680
body

26
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,760
arriving

27
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,680
arriving

28
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:12,079
arriving at the Temple of this body mind and

29
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:24,160
heart with a sense of

30
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:35,000
irreverence maybe a Little

31
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:50,840
Tenderness maybe a little sense of a gratitude that we can come

32
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:58,240
here and now in the temple of this body mind and

33
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,560
heart

34
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:34,879
staying with the felt sense of this arriving

35
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:51,960
process allow mindfulness to get become more

36
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,199
continuous not perfectly

37
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:08,240
continuous but slightly more as we stay with the present

38
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:31,400
experience becoming available to what's here

39
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:54,800
sense contacts Sensations in the

40
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,400
body the felt sense of

41
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,039
emotions waving

42
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:20,919
through feeling and sensing being

43
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:28,240
available with the body through the

44
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
body

45
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:52,120
let the feeling and sensing come from within the

46
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
body

47
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,440
you can include the felt sense of the heart

48
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
space

49
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,120
being available feels like

50
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:04,680
this or maybe a global sense of a

51
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,760
softening Global sense of easing

52
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,800
up a heart space may feel more

53
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,839
open however you may

54
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,640
feel is just

55
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,240
right a felt sense doesn't

56
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:01,120
need cognition to justify what it

57
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:24,600
is being available can feel

58
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:33,200
tender and sometimes even a little

59
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:47,480
vulnerable and so it's necessary for us to invite

60
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:58,040
aligning aligning this being with our deepest

61
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
intentions

62
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,920
the aspirations that uplift our

63
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:18,360
being so ground our heart and

64
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:31,440
mind so being available is is

65
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,120
protected by this

66
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,279
alignment feeling and

67
00:11:53,120 --> 00:12:00,959
sensing aligning

68
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,319
aligning with the Buddha Dharma and the

69
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:24,000
S aligning with a

70
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
kindness

71
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:41,160
aligning with something that your heart knows and your body

72
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,279
[Music]

73
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
knows

74
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,440
there is no rush in this

75
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:35,920
process let the body and heart guide the

76
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
way

77
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:10,600
sometimes an image may come forth to

78
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,319
express the feeling of being

79
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:24,959
aligned for me it's like a sitting

80
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,790
upright the whole long streams of

81
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,940
[Music]

82
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,680
practitioners you may feel

83
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
connected

84
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:12,480
rooted grounded supported by the Earth

85
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:35,399
underneath there maybe a inner

86
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,480
quiet in your

87
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:48,920
steadiness or maybe just a hint of

88
00:15:52,959 --> 00:16:00,600
it or a sense of a possibility

89
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:41,319
being aligned and available feels like

90
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:48,600
this but a wholesome field the wholesome

91
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
ground

92
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:18,839
from this a wholesome field we open to the felt

93
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:23,839
sense in this fathom long

94
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
body

95
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:51,559
May sense a feel into the heaviness of this body resting on

96
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
Earth

97
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,679
sitting like a tall

98
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:34,640
mountain study

99
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
quiet

100
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:27,159
letting go of anticipations

101
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
Cl

102
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:39,679
resting

103
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,240
here resting in the

104
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
body

105
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:38,960
the movements of the breath can naturally reveal

106
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:56,840
itself the dancing Sensations vibrations in the

107
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,720
body natur natur

108
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:30,039
surface the feeling and sensing happens naturally

109
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:47,880
when the clouds of thinking and planning and wanting Fades

110
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
away

111
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:12,240
feel and sense a life

112
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,039
breath soften into the

113
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
breath

114
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:41,919
releasing into the aliveness in this

115
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
body

116
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:20,919
as if we're holding a newborn feeling the

117
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:24,320
aliveness of the

118
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
newborn

119
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:46,880
touching life that's already happening right

120
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:04,440
here a shift and changes of

121
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,080
temperature tingling

122
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,360
Sensations a flow of

123
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
breath

124
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:47,000
when we open to our life this

125
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,880
way there may be a kind of a

126
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
tenderness

127
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:16,039
there maybe a kind of a joy theight that's

128
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:24,000
independent of whether the experience is a pleasant or

129
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
unpleasant

130
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:46,999
[Music]

131
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:12,600
may feel the Stillness all

132
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:28,480
around Stillness that can hold

133
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:34,520
the movements movements of the

134
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,760
body movements of the

135
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:46,799
emotions fleeting

136
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,600
thoughts

137
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:07,130
sometimes the Mind wants to comment how what we're

138
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:10,189
[Music]

139
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:20,640
experiencing know that it's okay to

140
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:24,960
experience without

141
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,320
commentaries

142
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:20,679
returning to feel and sense as a

143
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:26,000
body connecting with the Earth

144
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,240
underneath

145
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,799
maybe the body feels different right

146
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:56,880
[Music] now and resting on the ground of being

147
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:06,399
alive mind and available what's the Fel sense

148
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:32,679
now knowing that you always have a

149
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,519
choice to return to this

150
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:43,799
ground as you go about the

151
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,000
day you may not feel the same

152
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:59,158
way and they don't need to feel the same way

153
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,799
that our heart and mind and body can

154
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,960
know that we're living this

155
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:30,398
life we have a choice to align with the our deepest

156
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:59,039
intentions

157
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:14,399
[Music] I feel so good

158
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:19,799
um I was a little reluctant to

159
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:30,039
speak but I did bring a topic today so I will

160
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:38,159
talk and so as U I spoke a little bit at the beginning of our meditation that

161
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:44,720
uh and this week uh I've been channeling a whole set of the teachings that came

162
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:51,639
from Philip Moet uh who had offered a lot of this

163
00:33:51,639 --> 00:33:58,799
um withy short teachings that uh was very meaningful for for me and for many

164
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:06,279
people and so today I brought this uh particular uh practice skill called

165
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:15,280
practicing with the don't know mind well this is sound a little

166
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:24,000
counterintuitive because so much of um our um Dharma cultivation has to do with

167
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:31,599
cultivating a Clarity of knowing uh or cultivating clear knowing so what

168
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:38,919
does it mean by practicing with the don't know mind and so I wanted to elaborate on

169
00:34:38,919 --> 00:34:45,158
this a bit and so the first aspect of a

170
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:50,919
practicing with the don't know mind um is that the don't know mind has the

171
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:57,560
quality of The Beginner's mind we probably all have heard this phrase

172
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:03,119
of a beginner's mind and so The Beginner's mind has

173
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:10,520
different qualities in it for example if you're learning a new skill or you have

174
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:15,800
a new interest in I don't know playing a new music

175
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:21,839
instrument and uh there is a lot to learn and you're very engaged with it

176
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:27,599
and uh you're eager to practice and you're open curious

177
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:35,960
you're very receptive in this kind of beginner's mind and uh as we engage with it we kind

178
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:43,800
of get energized by it and there is a kind of refreshing um momentum that can

179
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:49,599
come forth and so the quality of a beginner's

180
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:55,520
mind um there's a very wholesome

181
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:02,640
feeling uh um and we all know how it is when we

182
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:09,000
lose The Beginner's mind uh we can believe somehow at some point we got it

183
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,760
you know we know it and we can lose the sense of the Curiosity and

184
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:21,280
interest and maybe our engagement is very uh

185
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:27,200
superficial but in this practice of um

186
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:34,280
um being present with our lived experience Here and Now each moment of

187
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:42,200
Our Lives that is unfolding has never happened

188
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:49,880
before um it's always new but we can have a belief that well

189
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:56,119
this is the same old stuff that we've experienced before again and again so we

190
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:03,319
can get bored we can get check out we can get disconnected with the life that is

191
00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:09,880
unfolding here and now so The Beginner's mind uh invite us

192
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:15,800
to renew this sense of curiosity an

193
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:25,599
interest and maybe letting go of the belief that I knew it I I already know

194
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:31,880
this um a recent Retreat and that uh G taught

195
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:39,079
uh it's it was an experienced practitioner Retreat and he said this that stayed

196
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:46,480
with me he said that it's not so important to become experienced

197
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:54,319
practitioners instead it's more important to learn to be experienced

198
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:59,599
beginners I love that I love that that there is just that kind

199
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:07,280
of innocence and aess that gets pointed out and at the same time there is also a

200
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,920
sense of a humility and so that's one aspect of uh

201
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:19,720
practicing with a don't know mind is to have this kind of a beginner's

202
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:27,800
mind and the other aspect of practicing with the don't know mind is to stay open

203
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:34,599
and [Music] unassuming I was once uh in a practice

204
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:41,119
discussion uh with um a teacher and I was sharing an

205
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:49,200
experience and I made a connection an association and that this experienced um

206
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:54,480
and this experience must have something to do with something that happened a

207
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:00,240
while ago and I was very definitive you know I

208
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:06,079
thought I knew this you know that was because XYZ so I was experiencing

209
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:14,079
this and the teacher just looked at me and he smiled and he said well that's

210
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:21,599
one way to understand it that was a real teaching moment for

211
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:30,200
me I realized that I was fixated on the vi feel that a happened because of a

212
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:35,280
b that was just a guess I actually don't

213
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:42,880
know with all the myriads of conditions that we situations we're living

214
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:50,200
in we can only say that um with some measure some degrees

215
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:55,400
of knowing but I actually don't really know

216
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:02,480
if that Association was so and so that was very freeing for me

217
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:09,000
and once I realized oh there were actually many other

218
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:15,160
possibilities I don't have to know this only in this

219
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:21,480
way and so um assumptions

220
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:27,359
conclusions particularly the grand conclusions like what I had in that practice

221
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:35,200
discussion tend to connect with fixed views fixed ideas

222
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:42,160
beliefs and so the don't know mind invite us to stay open in the face of a

223
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:48,079
situation and make space for the situation to unfold and

224
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:55,680
evolve and so we can allow different possibilities to emerge as we stay open

225
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:00,480
and available available two different

226
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:08,560
possibilities and there was a famous uh Chinese Fable some of you may know this

227
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:14,760
called Saima it spoke about this old man who

228
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:21,720
lives in the countryside who raises uh horses for a living for a

229
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:30,400
living and one day um um he lost one of the one of his

230
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:38,440
horses and um after hearing his Misfortune uh his neighbors all came and

231
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:45,160
felt sorry for him wanted to comfort him um but aai Wong simply

232
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:50,680
asked how would we know that this is not a good thing for

233
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:56,319
me and after a while um this lost horse

234
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:02,160
came back with a beautiful uh new

235
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:10,560
horse and um and the neighbors all came and congratulated saong and said wow

236
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:18,400
what a good luck you had and then saong said how could we know that it's not um

237
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:24,520
a bad thing for me and so the time went on and uh one

238
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:32,559
day hisan went to to ride this new horse um roaming around and he fell off the

239
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:38,079
horse and broke his leg and the neighbors came again and

240
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:45,280
kind of shared their condolences to um saong and seone said how do we know that

241
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:53,960
it's not a good thing for me and then a year later and the Empire sent uh was in

242
00:42:53,960 --> 00:43:00,200
a war with a neighboring country and uh the Army came to the Village to

243
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:08,119
recruit the able-bodied man to fight in the war and because of the

244
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:13,240
injury saon son uh could not get off

245
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:21,599
could not could not be drafted to go in the war so he was spared from the death

246
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:28,680
very certain death in the war and so we don't know so we don't

247
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:34,880
always know are we able to or dare to allow

248
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:43,160
ourselves to open to different possibilities I wanted to maybe End by

249
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:52,880
saying that the don't know mind is not a blinded mind or a kind of shut down or

250
00:43:52,880 --> 00:44:01,119
disengagement kind of a mind rather the don't know mind empowers us to loose

251
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:07,480
loosen the grip on the fixed views fixed

252
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:15,400
beliefs it's not to shut down or simply claim somehow that we don't know and

253
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:24,440
that's kind of better or something but rather it owers us because it create a

254
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:33,079
space where wisdom and compassion can arise when we're not F not so fixed

255
00:44:33,079 --> 00:44:41,400
up a certain orientation or certain kind of a direction that we set in our

256
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:48,200
mind there is a deeper kind of a knowing that I've been speaking about this week

257
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:54,200
that is a kind of a capacity that's within us when it's not dictated when

258
00:44:54,200 --> 00:45:00,800
we're not dictated by the fixations and this kind of knowing it's

259
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:07,359
much more direct intuitive and they can manifest in many

260
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:17,200
ways that maybe are surprising to us and it can also um reveal itself

261
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:22,400
gradually as the Things become more and more

262
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:29,079
clear and so do we allow this kind of a

263
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:39,359
possibility by staying open and un assuming do we dare to allow this deeper

264
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:47,319
and more intuitive direct form of wisdom and compassion to

265
00:45:47,319 --> 00:45:57,200
arise and so that's an inquiry for today so um May our practice and may our

266
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:06,640
inquiry Reflections benefit ourselves and may it benefit all beings

267
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:13,640
everywhere thank you friends I'll see you

268
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,680
tomorrow
