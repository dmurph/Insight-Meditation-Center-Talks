1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:06,040
so hello and welcome to this Monday meditation

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,759
session and uh it's very nice to have all of you

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,960
along and all of you who are doing greetings thank you and I know so many

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:23,279
of your names either from other occasions or from seeing them here on

5
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:30,080
YouTube chat and for all of you who are not chatting welcome wholeheartedly

6
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:36,960
and uh I probably if I was in attending this kinds of session I probably would

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:45,160
not be chatting and saying hello just sometimes I tend to be a little

8
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,680
bit believe it or not maybe a little bit shy or

9
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:56,160
something so um one of the interesting

10
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,879
very interesting phenomenas about human life

11
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:07,520
is the way that uh or say it differently that there are two words that I like a

12
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:14,240
lot for meditation little AIDS supports for meditation and they are the words

13
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:22,000
yes and no and a very interesting aspect of human life is the way that functionally

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,479
there are times when how we behave what we do might be exactly the same whether

15
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:35,240
we say yes or we say no if uh you find that your hands are

16
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:42,840
dirty as mine were yesterday working in the garden um I might say no to keeping my

17
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:50,960
hands dirty before I go into the house to make dinner and uh or I might say yes to

18
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:57,240
having the the hands clean so I can make dinner but the no and the yes both have

19
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,759
the same function I clean my hands if

20
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:08,840
um um my mind is caught in obsessions of

21
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:17,599
some kind I could say no to those obsessions or I could say yes to the

22
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:25,239
awareness or the mind that's free of obsessions and sometimes it seems really

23
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:31,360
good and for me to say just say yes I like that a lot and uh yes to being

24
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,319
aware yes to being aware of this it brings me a smile sometimes when I just

25
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:43,560
say yes to being aware of obsessions aware of thinking because in the yes

26
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,920
awareness is stepping away is becoming free and then I have to have something

27
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:56,560
to be aware of it just Delights me that I can be aware of something which is maybe difficult or ways I'm caught up

28
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,280
while I'm be becoming free or I could say no to the

29
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:08,040
obsessions I can say no don't want to do that no thank you in

30
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:16,200
a way that leaves me being aware so uh for today I would I like to

31
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:23,280
suggest in the most loving way that you can most generous

32
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:30,400
kind supportive way you can maybe introduce the word no there's something

33
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:37,439
very strong in self kind of claiming our Our Place claiming our independence

34
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:44,840
claiming ourselves here free of being caught in Things That No

35
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,959
indicates so no just gently no to keep

36
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:59,840
thinking about this no to keep pushing something away no to wanting something

37
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,480
expecting something no it's not a no that pushes anything

38
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:12,879
away not a no that rejects anything it's a very particular no that says no to

39
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:19,199
being involved with it to picking it up no to perpetuating it no to being

40
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,400
involved being caught so it's not a rejecting of anything it's not a pushing

41
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,280
anything away it's just like no I'm not going to do this I'm not going to continue doing this

42
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:39,320
the mind the heart might have their own ideas and things continue but you just gently say no stepping away no or it's

43
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,479
kind of like releasing from your hands uh something that's very

44
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:54,840
unpleasant to hold no no and see if that loving no can help

45
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,280
you stay aware stay connected to the present moment say the no so that you're

46
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:06,199
more here with this whatever it is

47
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:09,880
here so

48
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,360
to assume a meditation

49
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:25,319
posture and to gently lower your gaze or close your

50
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:28,319
eyes

51
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,199
and without doing anything else appreciating what it's like for you

52
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:45,639
at this moment to be aware are you sleepy are you

53
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:52,199
eager is there Clarity is there dullness is your awareness being pulled

54
00:05:52,199 --> 00:06:00,000
into your thoughts and preoccupations what is it like to be aware

55
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:09,400
and if you are aware to take a few moments to be aware

56
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:15,319
of how you are consciously

57
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:22,599
intentionally feeling noticing recognizing how you are in your

58
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:30,199
meditation posture as if you have permission to be

59
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:36,800
this way but rather than being lost in it

60
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,960
you're knowing it recognizing

61
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:52,840
it and then taking a few long slow deep

62
00:06:54,599 --> 00:07:01,520
breaths as you exhale relaxing softening in the body

63
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:21,879
maybe on the deeper inhale feeling this different parts of your body that you can relax as you exhale

64
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,560
and then letting your breathing return to normal and for a little while the same

65
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:54,759
exercise with a more or less normal breath to feel some part of your body on

66
00:07:54,759 --> 00:08:00,159
the inhale where there might be tension or holding

67
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:06,120
and then soften relax that holding that

68
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,240
tightness as you exhale

69
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:50,120
and then as you inhale to feel the thinking mind any tension or

70
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:57,720
pressure contraction and as you

71
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:04,839
exhale soften in the thinking mind maybe

72
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:11,800
relaxing micro muscles maybe in the area of your brain

73
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:17,399
your head your forehead your face that somehow are

74
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:21,160
connected to thinking

75
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,920
and then settling

76
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,040
in to the body's experience of

77
00:09:53,120 --> 00:10:01,320
breathing perhaps centering yourself on the body sensation of breathing

78
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,399
and if you find yourself involved in thinking

79
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:48,920
gently say no to being

80
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:58,800
involved if the thoughts are in the background and you're not particularly involved in them let them be in the

81
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,519
background but if there's a more involvement you're lost in them

82
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:11,920
or reacting to them picking them up

83
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,760
participating a gentle no to doing all those

84
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:26,200
things and know to step away into being more aware of what's

85
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,200
Happening

86
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:05,880
and if there are ways that you're concerned about things almost

87
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,440
nonverbally that you find your attention is locked into some feeling emotion

88
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:17,760
sensation in the body not to say no to any of the

89
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:27,199
feelings or Sensations but to in a kind way no say

90
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,440
no to being in involved with it reacting to

91
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:40,920
it where the know is so gentle and

92
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:50,480
light that it itself is part of being free

93
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:08,480
and if you're not caught in anything with a light

94
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:14,639
touch ride the inhales and

95
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
exhales

96
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

97
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

98
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
e

99
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
for

100
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

101
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

102
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

103
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
for

104
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,840
e for

105
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,799
when you find yourself caught in thoughts or

106
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:49,520
feelings saying no to being caught saying no to being invested

107
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:55,600
or holding on

108
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:01,240
participating say gently no and you you might need to say it a few

109
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:09,400
times thinking that it's an experiment in learning how to say

110
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:16,280
no so there's a wonderful feeling of freeing stepping

111
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:23,440
away making room breathing

112
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:30,720
room for awareness

113
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
for

114
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

115
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

116
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

117
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

118
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

119
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

120
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

121
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440

122
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

123
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
for

124
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,320
e e

125
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:23,520
and then as we come to the end of this sitting to take a few

126
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:31,080
moments to recognize feel how you are right

127
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:43,320
now how are you now compared to how you were at the beginning of the

128
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:01,039
meditation and how is it to be aware how how is it to be

129
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:15,559
mindful is there an appreciation for awareness

130
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:22,278
itself appreciation for attention and to the present

131
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:29,399
moment appreciation for mindfulness Maybe it

132
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:35,799
Simplicity as you sit here still in the meditation posture

133
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:04,640
and might there be a healthy wonderful supportive way of

134
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:11,799
saying no lovingly no to

135
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:19,039
yourself when greed arises

136
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:26,559
no makes room maybe for generosity when hostility or resentment

137
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:34,720
arises no making room for respect and care and

138
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:41,840
love no to when all kinds of crazy thinking

139
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:48,159
delusive thinking spins around

140
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:56,720
no so there's a better chance for what wisdom Clarity awareness

141
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:07,080
is there a way of saying no to being shut off or pulled away or

142
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:12,080
being aggressive in relationship to other

143
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:21,840
people the know that allows you to be there all of you all of you present

[Music]

154
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,320
world thank

155
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:00,960
you e

156
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:42,360
hello and welcome to this Monday when we start a new five-part

157
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:51,080
series and um for this week I'd like to um introduce you some of the main themes

158
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:58,000
of ancient Buddhist teaching that I translated uh for about 20 years or so I

159
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,880
studied a particular Buddhist text that uh became kind of foundational

160
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:11,039
for my orientation or supporting my orientation in Buddhist practice some of you know that some

161
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:16,799
months ago I talked about core Buddhist teachings for how I teach and that it's

162
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:22,519
a kind of a naturalistic form of Buddhism and um and a lot of this comes

163
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:28,320
from or supported by or inspired by a particular text that um then I

164
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:37,200
translated and published as a book called the Buddha before Buddhism and uh and the idea of calling

165
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:44,120
it the Buddha before Buddhism is um uh uh it's more something

166
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:53,159
like the Buddha's teaching before Buddhism uh or the Buddha's teaching

167
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:58,840
before it became Buddhist so with the idea that over time

168
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:04,279
maybe even his own lifetime but over time the teachings got more organized

169
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:11,760
more systematized more developed more expanded and and the core Simplicity of

170
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:21,120
them sometimes got lost and um and uh the um but the the earliest

171
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,360
version of these teachings were really radical in many ways in going back just

172
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:32,279
to the central core of practice so uh the name of the text that I translated

173
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:37,519
the literal meaning in in English is the book of eights which is a very

174
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:43,200
uninspiring title and so I titled the my translation and commentary on this

175
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,279
ancient text um the Buddha before Buddhism so people would ask a question

176
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:54,679
for themselves what might have been the earliest teachings of the Buddha before it became a

177
00:33:54,679 --> 00:34:02,600
religion and um and there Scholars who uh believe that uh this text is a uh

178
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:08,280
maybe the earliest oldest um Buddhist teachings that we have that maybe they

179
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:13,760
were given you know in the first years of the Buddhist teaching or well before

180
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:21,158
the the layers that got added to it those teachings in the in the generations right after the

181
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:29,679
Buddha and um so I would like to read um um couple of paragraph or short

182
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:35,358
paragraph or two from the introduction what may be perplexing to

183
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:43,000
many is that the book of eights does not espouse a religious doctrine that exists

184
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,560
in opposition to other doctrines nor does it put forth a teaching that is

185
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:54,358
meant to be seen as Superior to other teachings in a manner that challenges

186
00:34:54,359 --> 00:35:01,599
the religious beliefs of many people including many Buddhists the text explicitly denies the

187
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:09,560
role of ultimate religious truths and religious knowledge in

188
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:15,200
attaining personal peace instead the text points to a

189
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:21,960
direct and simple approach for attaining peace without requiring an an adherence

190
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:27,000
to any specific ideology the possibility of this piece

191
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,119
is what God the teachings and practices in the text the value of these teachings

192
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:37,640
is not the profundity of their philosophy or their Authority as

193
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:42,680
scripture rather they are valuable for the results they bring to those who live

194
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:49,920
by them instead of doctrines to be believed the book of eight describes means or

195
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:57,160
practices for realizing peace so it's almost as if it's pulling

196
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:04,040
the rug from underneath many of the usual ways in which people relate to religious teachings they people often

197
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:09,119
involved in religion want to have their religion be ultimate be the most amazing

198
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:14,760
the most wonderful the most true and we have this big orientation towards having

199
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:21,440
truth and sometimes that gets in the way sometimes that leads to um religious

200
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:27,880
wars that I have the truth and you don't and um and and rather than kind of

201
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:35,839
lobbing onto the truth and knowing the certainty and this assurance that you have what's the most real the most true

202
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:41,520
uh the whole orientation of this early text was to look in a different

203
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:48,040
direction to be concerned not with truth and ultimate truth but be concerned with

204
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:54,440
um Peace and um so here the the goal put

205
00:36:54,440 --> 00:37:02,079
forth in the book of eights is describe both in terms of states of mind to be attained and the mental activities to be

206
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:07,560
abandoned peace and equinity are the most common descriptions of what is

207
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:14,599
attained and clinging craving being entrenched and quarreling are activities

208
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:21,560
most frequently said to be abandoned there is a clear relationship between the states to be attained and the

209
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:27,560
activities to let go in that to experience peace for oneself when most

210
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,839
release one's

211
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,880
clingingsmith poems that make up this text and

212
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,960
um and uh some of these poems have um

213
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:12,800
eight verses and that's maybe why it's called the book of eights having

214
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:19,880
views about what is Ultimate a person makes these the best in the world and

215
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:25,119
and calls other views inferior as such they have not gone

216
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:32,119
beyond quaring seeing benefit in things seen heard and

217
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:38,839
thought or in precepts and religious practices and then grasping at this a

218
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:44,640
person then sees all else as inferior what one relies on in order to

219
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:52,119
see all else as inferior is an entanglement say those who are

220
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:58,480
skilled one should therefore not depend on things seen heard or thought out or

221
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,760
on virtue and religious observances pretty ra

222
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:09,480
radical nor should one they nor should they make up views of the World by means

223
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:14,880
of knowledge precepts and religious observances nor would they think of

224
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:20,400
themselves inferior or Superior to others and they shouldn't uh take

225
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:27,440
themselves as equal so neither better or worse than others and also not equal um

226
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:33,599
um so you know what's left what's left is letting go of what

227
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:40,640
is taken up the person free of grasping does not depend on knowledge or take

228
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:50,359
sides with factions when take sides when factions disagree or or fall back on any kind of

229
00:39:50,359 --> 00:39:57,000
view one not inclined to either side to becoming or non- becoming to

230
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:03,480
hear here or the next World there exists nothing to get entrenched in when

231
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:10,000
considering the doctrines others grasp here one does not conceive

232
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,640
of here one does not conceive the slightest Concept in regard to what is

233
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:24,000
seen heard or thought how in this world could one Recon recognize a Brahman who does not

234
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,880
take hold of views one does not consider struct prefer to take up any

235
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:38,359
Doctrine a a Brahman a kind of a wise person not led by precepts and religious

236
00:40:38,359 --> 00:40:43,800
practices who has gone beyond does not fall back on

237
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:51,599
belief that person is one who is thus this wonderful expression that um rather

238
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:59,160
than being better than others worse than others inferior Superior rather than having ultimate teachings and seeing

239
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:05,319
other teachings as being poor or bad One lets go of all clinging including to all

240
00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:10,599
stories and ideas of who one is and in

241
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:16,520
this wonderful expression one who does thus is one who is

242
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:25,839
thus and I think it's a wonderfully generous thing to say thus who are you thus without

243
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:32,480
definition thus that includes all of who we are no part left out but it doesn't

244
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:37,680
need need to be named it doesn't need to be constricted or Limited in any way and

245
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:44,119
the most unlimited way of saying who are you is saying I am thus like this and

246
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:50,400
open our arms and just say whatever you see whatever is here with this why do I

247
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:59,560
have to Define it any more than that and um so um it's a um very radical

248
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:07,480
text and um over next four days I'll go through four of the major themes in the text and uh and hopefully you'll

249
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:13,640
appreciate uh a text that's been very important for me and inspiring for me

250
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:20,480
and um and maybe you'll find this useful I'll end with one more um part of a poem

251
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:27,319
from it this is one of the most touching poems in the book I feel maybe in all the Buddhism because the Buddha is is

252
00:42:27,319 --> 00:42:32,359
talking about himself in a very touching way about how he was before he was

253
00:42:32,359 --> 00:42:39,640
enlightened the process of coming to become enlightened and he talks about his own kind of

254
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:48,040
Anguish he he says violence gives birth to fear just look at people and their

255
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:54,720
quarrels I will speak of my dismay and the way that I was shaken we

256
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:59,839
often don't hear the Buddha talking about himself that way this is before he was

257
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:05,960
enlightened seeing people thrashing about like fish in little water and

258
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:11,000
seeing them feuding with each other I became

259
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:17,680
afraid many people are afraid these days the world is completely without a

260
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:24,680
core everywhere things are changing wanting a place of my own I saw

261
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:32,160
nothing not already taken I felt discontent on seeing only conflict to

262
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:39,359
the very end then I saw an arrow

263
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:47,720
here hard to see embedded in the heart pierced by this Arrow people Dash

264
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:56,680
about in all directions when the arrows pulled out people do not run and they do not

265
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:04,160
sing so pulling out the arrow is the core

266
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:09,480
teachings of this text that pulling out does not require

267
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:15,599
ideology does not require Buddhist abstract teachings and

268
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:22,520
philosophies it's a very simple direct message in that Buddhism began with this

269
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:29,720
message and then there were maybe layers and layers of complications that got added over time and I find it very

270
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:34,760
refreshing to go back to the Simplicity of this text and reminded of the

271
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:41,760
Simplicity of uh the path the way to a profound form of

272
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:47,680
Peace so that's the task for the next uh four days and to go through this little

273
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:54,240
more and I hope you do find it interesting thank you
