00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:06,160
hello everyone and

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,759
welcome so the topic of today is this week is

3
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:20,080
different ways of experiencing our body and one of the purposes of this teaching

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,680
is to encourage you encourage your mind

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,679
to be less interested in its thinking

6
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,920
while meditating so be less interested in thinking about

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:45,039
anything else but just really what's happening here in the present moment in your meditation and then one of the

8
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:50,640
things to be focused on is the body

9
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,079
and some of what we'll become aware of is the karmic body the body of our

10
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:02,079
has a lot to do with our holding patterns our tensions that we

11
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,280
carry with us and um learning how to relax those and

12
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:15,119
release those and and if we can't relax and release them to learn a wise equanimity

13
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:21,360
a wise non-reactivity in relationship to our physical discomfort

14
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,400
not all our discomfort physical discomfort is karmic some of it is just

15
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:33,680
you know raw pain but we can develop a lot of karmic tension around the raw pain

16
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,759
so learning to be wise and work with this karmic body is part of practice

17
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:46,079
but one of the ways to go to support us to find this non-reactivity

18
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,399
to find equanimity to find a different way of being is to start becoming attuned

19
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,399
to the pleasures of the body the subtle ways in which

20
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,600
there's feelings of relief and well-being and

21
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,160
pleasure as we meditate dharmic pleasure so one of those pleasures is

22
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,239
the pleasure of relaxing the body the subtle subtle

23
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:24,000
sense of relief or freshness or openness that happens lightness that happens when we relax

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,800
and it's a kind of a release of energy it's kind of a release of potential to do that that's all bottled up in our

25
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:37,519
attention and there starts to be a kind of a little bit more of a flow a little bit more of an opening or a

26
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:44,720
glow or a warmth through the body that begins to knit the body together

27
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,959
tension holding in the body tends to divide the body and the release

28
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:57,519
of that tension tends to kind of unify begin unifying the body and the same thing happens if as we

29
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,640
learn to let go of our

30
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:10,319
undermining thoughts many of our thinking can be depressing can be discouraging

31
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:16,400
can reinforce the kind of tension in the body can reinforce a kind of

32
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:23,840
orientation to life into our body that doesn't make room for

33
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,200
the emergence the emergence of a sense of well-being and health and

34
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:35,200
healing through our body so for this meditation

35
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:41,440
i would like to direct your attention as much as it's available to you

36
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,480
to the feelings of well-being in the body feelings of pleasure in the body

37
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,400
not a discount or or pretend that there isn't discomfort

38
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,519
but maybe to bring our attention into a kind of balance

39
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,599
where uh we're not only focusing on our discomfort or only focusing on

40
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,879
the thoughts that about life about the world that are difficult

41
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:16,400
but we begin finding a refreshment through mindfulness of the body

42
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,079
so begin by assuming a posture

43
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:29,120
that is both alert but also gives you a little bit of

44
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,960
feelings of good energy or

45
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:41,159
vitality or even a sense of

46
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,440
appreciation to assume this posture

47
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:58,240
may be sitting a little straighter maybe relaxing in some way

48
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:13,360
and then lowering your gaze looking down at 45 degrees

49
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:21,840
so your eyes begin to rest not looking on anything in particular

50
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:31,440
and then gently let your eyelids close

51
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,520
and gently in a way that's nice for you

52
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,840
take a deeper inhale slow long deep

53
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:58,240
and maybe almost as if in your mind's eye you say ah exhale as you

54
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,198
relax the body and the exhale

55
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,840
and letting your breathing return to normal

56
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:41,199
and maybe as you inhale see if you can find a place in your body

57
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,120
where there's any tension

58
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:53,599
and as you exhale begin the process of relaxing the tension

59
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,280
releasing it softening

60
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:11,280
and feel if there is any pleasure or goodness rightness

61
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,680
in the relaxation

62
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:35,280
as you relax on the exhale maybe also

63
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:41,919
calming the exhale itself the calming of the body and the calming

64
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,240
of an exhale

65
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,560
softening the belly

66
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:25,440
as the body relaxes when the body is tense the tension

67
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:32,320
kind of defines the body contributes to boundaries

68
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,719
in the body in meditation is to re-relax

69
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,760
the edges of the body begin to relax as well

70
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,399
as you exhale you might soften the edges of your body

71
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,839
the way you experience them

72
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:22,880
and perhaps feeling whatever vitality well-being

73
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,600
that might be present for you in your body

74
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,839
breathing with it breathing with that well-being

75
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,240
relaxing with it

76
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:04,320
another way that we diminish the free movement of our vital vitality

77
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:11,200
is with a lot of thinking reacting judging wanting

78
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:22,000
as you exhale if possible relax the thinking mind

79
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,079
calm the thinking mind

80
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:50,120
feeling whatever pleasure there is with the calming of the thinking mind

81
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:19,600
thinking also defines our body the boundaries of the body

82
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,560
thinking also divides the body

83
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:32,000
to relax into the body without thinking

84
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,200
quiet mind and feeling the pleasures however small

85
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:47,880
and minute they might be that exists in your body sitting here

86
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:42,160
whatever sense of well-being there is whatever feelings of pleasure there are

87
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:53,839
breathe with it maybe expanding it as you inhale

88
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,720
relaxing into it as you exhale

89
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,880
um

90
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,440
so

91
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:26,639
if there is pain discomfort emotional distress

92
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,399
it's okay allow it to be there

93
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:38,079
but see if you cannot be preoccupied with it

94
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,839
defined by it

95
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:50,000
be occupied with whatever sense of

96
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:57,600
well-being pleasure happiness joy

97
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:07,160
is found in your breathing is found in the humming of your body

98
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:44,240
on the inhale expanding spreading the pleasure the well-being

99
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,959
on the exhale relaxing into it

100
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,600
on the exhale letting go of your thinking so there's more room

101
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:05,720
to feel the well-being of the body

102
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,919
remember to feel the pleasure and well-being in the body

103
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,519
let it spread as you inhale

104
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:08,880
let yourself settle into it on the exhale

105
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,520
and might help to make a very small little

106
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,200
smile with the corner of your lips

107
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:12,559
see if you can move out of your thoughts into the

108
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:21,360
pleasure of your body the joy of your body the humming well-being

109
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,799
of a relaxed soft open body

110
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:39,480
where there might not part of the body where there's a glow in here

111
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:59,679
where there's an appreciation being alive in this body

112
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:07,559
and the mind is quiet and peaceful feeling that joy

113
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,960
when we are centered

114
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,960
a joyful body

115
00:27:53,600 --> 00:28:02,039
body with well-being there can be kind of a glow

116
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,760
that spreads outwards from us

117
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:17,840
that's both kind of a protection a little bit like a force field

118
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:24,960
and also a channel for

119
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:33,120
our good will the more the well-being in the body

120
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:39,279
the more it's natural to feel kindness love

121
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:45,639
care friendliness for others

122
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,480
imagine what it'd be like to meet someone in the state that you're

123
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:59,520
in now to meet someone where nothing is needed nothing needs to be said

124
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,679
it's okay just to sit together like you're sitting on a park bench

125
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:14,360
companions companions and goodwill

126
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:31,600
and then saying these words to yourself in your mind

127
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:39,679
but as if they're messages that can float outward on your good will out into

128
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:45,600
the world may all beings

129
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,398
be happy

130
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,559
may all beings be safe

131
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:05,120
may all beings be peaceful

132
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,760
may all beings be free

133

[Music]

135
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:44,840
so continuing the theme of this week the different ways we can experience our

136
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:51,840
body and because they're so can be so dramatically different depending on the circumstance the state

137
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:56,559
of the mind the

138
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:05,120
we can almost refer to them as different bodies refer to them as so yesterday there's the karmic body

139
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:11,039
and i think that's where most people live most of the time if they're paying attention to their bodies they're

140
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:16,640
experiencing the body that's much under the influence under the

141
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,559
impact of our thinking or wanting or not wanting or

142
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:27,440
fear all this kind of volitional

143
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:32,640
force that that is um

144
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:39,919
operating and that if used chronically irregularly builds up a very strong feelings of the

145
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:46,240
body sense of what the body is about meditation begins to quiet down two

146
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:52,559
things it quiets down the ongoing karmic formation the ongoing karmic

147
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:57,679
force that is shaping our experience of our life but especially experiencing of our

148
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:03,039
body and it begins to we begin to recover

149
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:09,360
from the legacy of that karmic shaping of what's going on and very simply

150
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:16,640
you know if you spend your days with your shoulders up to your ears because you're tense or afraid

151
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:23,279
there's a continuous continuous fear that's the karmic force

152
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:30,159
and then as we stop the fear the shoulders can relax but they might be so chronic that it doesn't relax all the way

153
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:37,120
and so then sitting and meditating slowly slowly the shoulders might find a way to relax more and more

154
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:44,159
and so the legacy of that karmic uh anxiety or fear begins to abate

155
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:50,480
that gets replaced with with time not automatically with a sense of

156
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,840
of pleasure or well-being or ease or lightness

157
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:01,519
openness softness in the very same shoulders and

158
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:07,120
it's easy then to go on to the next concern and not linger and pay attention to the

159
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:14,320
shoulders but it's possible also to feel how there's kind of release of energy there's a kind of a

160
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,839
way in which the tightness and definition of the shoulders softens and the

161
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:26,960
shoulders become kind of more porous or softer or more more kind of in in flow with the

162
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:33,760
rest of the body there's a release of energy and it might not be noticed at release

163
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:39,679
because you know it's not maybe not much but the opposite to stay chronically

164
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:45,679
tense is exhausting and and can you know really create a lot of

165
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:51,679
tiredness through the day exhaustion and weariness and without that tension our energy is

166
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:56,800
more available in a cleaner easier way doesn't get so tired

167
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:03,200
as we sit in meditation that uh and relaxing the body

168
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,480
relaxing the karmic body that there starts to be

169
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,920
available to us not only a nicer flow or glow or vitality of energy

170
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:21,040
but also with as we start getting settled in more and more um there can be uh uh pleasures that

171
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:27,920
begin appearing pleasant experiences that begin to show themselves they might be very subtle

172
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:33,920
but starting to pay attention to them and notice them uh allows them to grow allows them to

173
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:39,200
have a different influence on us than if we continuously continually take

174
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,720
in the the karmic body take in the karmic pain and the karmic thoughts and

175
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:51,119
the all the ideas of what's all wrong about the world or ourselves or our situation

176
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:58,800
these thoughts have a huge impact on us and if those negative thoughts are chronic they can have the karmic

177
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:06,000
repercussions on ourselves are huge it's not cost-free to spend a lot of time with angry

178
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,960
thoughts or or depressing thoughts or undermining thoughts

179
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,000
and so part of what meditation can begin doing is to quiet down

180
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,800
those all those thinking and thoughts and then if we pay attention to the subtle pleasure subtle well-being

181
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,000
it begins showing us a different orientation it shows us there's more going on

182
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,680
there's more to the story of our life than our challenges part of the story of our life is our

183
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:41,760
capacity for well-being for feeling of a healthy body a flow of a body

184
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:48,720
and even if there's illness even if there's injury and pain in the body it's possible that the container that

185
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:54,720
the overall atmosphere of the body that holds that pain

186
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:02,079
um is one that's soft and pleasant with pleasure and joy

187
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:07,680
and this sense of pleasure and joy that can be there it makes it much more interesting for

188
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:13,920
the mind to want to be present here and now and and it supports the mind to want to be

189
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:19,280
here in the present moment with the body with the breathing and so there's it starts to be this

190
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:25,839
unification process of gathering together process and maybe around the breathing around the

191
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:31,440
mindfulness practice the mind is less scattered less interested in other things it's kind of

192
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:37,838
our interest becomes more and more centered here and there starts to happen

193
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:46,320
and it creates a kind of breathing room creates space for something to begin to emerge

194
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:52,160
the karmic mind is a reactive mind and the karmic mind a reactive mind

195
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,200
doesn't make room for the well springs within to flow

196
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:04,560
freely and emerge the emergent quality of of healthy emotions and one of the

197
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:10,960
emerging qualities that begins to arise in meditation is a feeling of joy

198
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:19,760
uh a feeling of delight the feeling of kind of uh i i liken it to that of um

199
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,800
of a child letting go

200
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:30,880
sliding down the slide and uh and is squealing and so happy now

201
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:37,680
they we're squealing in meditation but letting go into breathing into our experience here

202
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:44,240
at some point there does feel like there's a little bit of momentum and joy and and kind of pleasure from that letting

203
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:49,680
go that's a little bit like the letting go into

204
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,720
this sense of well-being that can be here and

205
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,720
there's also some there's also some way in which mysterious way maybe not so mysterious of people who

206
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:07,839
know the neurochemistry of the brain that as we begin to

207
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:14,560
get concentrated and settled and focused here there's there starts to emerge

208
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:20,400
as a wellspring from within more and more joy more and more happiness

209
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:26,400
and over time and might be years for some of us this happiness and joy and meditation

210
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:33,520
begins to suffuse the body begins to spread and until at some point

211
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:40,000
it it kind of dominates over or

212
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,839
my experience is that somehow it lifts me out of the karmic body

213
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:52,960
and then when the concentration is no longer there i come back into the karmic body and there's as it lifts out there's a

214
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:59,280
pervasive feeling of well-being a glow a warmth a joy a lightness

215
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,560
that can have all kinds of different intensities from a mild pleasant intensity to

216
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:11,839
sometimes quite strong but the um but we start feeling a whole different

217
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:20,720
feeling of what the what the body is and this sometimes is called the joy body or the bliss body

218
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:28,240
and it's the emergent experience of the body that is a paradigm shift for the mind

219
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:34,800
it's kind of like wow is this possible is this my body um it involves almost a shift of identity

220
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:42,480
where the boundaries of the body are not so strong where there's a sense of safety and confidence where there is

221
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:48,800
a sense of safety openness

222
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:55,280
joy um and we start experiencing ourselves in a

223
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:00,720
very different way than the karmic body will ever let us know later

224
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:05,760
and if we only have the karmic body as a reference for how the body is to be experienced

225
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:13,680
we think the karmic body is their real body remember these are the bodies that we experience they're not the corporal body

226
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:21,040
the physical body their body that's being experienced in all experience of the body is mediated through the

227
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:26,560
activity states of the mind and as those states of mind shift

228
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:33,920
the experience of the body shift and one of the ways it shifts is into the karmic body that's just one

229
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:40,400
more way in which the mind manufactures or predisposes us to experience the body

230
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:47,520
it's not any more real than the joy body the bliss body

231
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:55,680
and um they both have their place they both have their value and um and so to begin settling into and

232
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:00,720
relaxing into the sense of pleasure sense of joy sense

233
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,839
of happiness that uh maybe at first there's only hints

234
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:13,680
only we have little traces of these going on but these are things to relax into

235
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:18,800
to open into to allow form to have as a

236
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:24,000
supports as a toehold in the present moment

237
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,079
and so that toll can grow and grow inevitably people who experience this

238
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:35,200
something like this this joy and delight pleasure in the body

239
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:42,240
that inevitably people will become attached to it prioritize it try to make it happen

240
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:50,480
again and try too hard and of course there's no crime in doing this

241
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:56,960
maybe it's a developmental stage to do this and maybe most people have to go through this

242
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:04,560
and i went through that and uh until i realized it wasn't working

243
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:09,680
and so uh and so we have developmental stage to go through the attachment clinging the

244
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:15,280
wanting trying to make it happen with too much force too much expectation and

245
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:20,960
attachment and and then we start seeing that then we can begin working with that and

246
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:27,119
letting go of that and because if we don't if we stay with the attachment

247
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:33,040
and the expectations and the demands it should be a certain way we're just contributing to more of the

248
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:38,839
karmic stream and where the karmic body gets gets reinforced

249
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:44,880
so chances are if you start opening up and experiencing in meditation this joy

250
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:51,280
body you will get attached you've been warned so that now you can be mindful of that

251
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:58,160
and not be so caught in it and hold it lightly and find your way through it

252
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:05,040
so i certainly understand that

253
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:10,160
this teaching on the joy body might be very distant from some of you it's no

254
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:16,079
idea what i'm talking about and it feels maybe even a betrayal or as a

255
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:22,720
as a offense to the challenge difficulties you have with

256
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:29,760
your body and however

257
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:36,480
there might be something here for you even so and maybe through the day today

258
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:42,000
give yourself extra time give yourself pauses through the day maybe put yours

259
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:48,079
your smartphone on a timer or something and every 30 minutes every hour or something

260
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:54,720
have a real you know extended pause

261
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:00,240
the only purpose of which is to feel embodied physical pleasure

262
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:07,520
and joy go for a walk sit and have some tea look out the window and relax and see if you

263
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:13,599
can touch it as a touch to have a joy or delight or pleasure in your body

264
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:20,240
be a touchstone for a few moments and and see what happens through the day

265
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:28,079
touch tones um check-ins to your body's capacity for pleasure joy

266
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:35,119
and happiness may you have greater well-being today

267
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:40,599
than you would have otherwise thank you
