1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:07,600
so uh so welcome folks

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:19,320
um yeah good to um good to be with you um yeah thinking of the La Sa and uh

3
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:27,119
others um have very uh visceral impact on me been not that it did anybody any

4
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,558
good but uh been up since 2 am just couldn't go back to bed there something

5
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:39,640
about the the images that stayed with me and

6
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:52,000
um and um and we practice we do other things but we

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,120
practice and practice um

8
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,159
the the invitation practices this very deep surrender

9
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:11,479
to in a sense to put down the world and that feels like some kind of

10
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:20,200
Abandonment and maybe it is maybe it is a certain way of like really radically

11
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:26,200
putting down the world but we come back to it we come

12
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:35,640
back to it with a fuller heart and um more effective action more

13
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,520
clarity but it's almost like we have to abandon the world to regain

14
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,119
it and and so

15
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:58,320
um yeah we'll practice just um just resting in this radical way of not

16
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,640
transacting anything not uh

17
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,920
trading this moment for anything you know there are outcomes there

18
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:19,840
are there is progress there is development cultivation goodness fruit fruit of

19
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:27,280
practice but um we arrive at the fruit of practice

20
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,599
by not Trading you know not trying to trade this moment

21
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:39,040
for anything so

22
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,599
um yeah I invite you to uh find your your

23
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:04,799
posture uh settle in just some sense of um

24
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,840
alertness kind of

25
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:16,480
brightness a

26
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,760
non-tension e

27
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:10,560
the invitation is to put down greed and distress with

28
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,280
respect to the

29
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:27,240
world and it feels like no no no

30
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:31,720
no I can't put the world down

31
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,879
can't abandon

32
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,840
it but to some extent it's uh a

33
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:54,960
delusion that we're propping up the world with our care and worry

34
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,080
and it's delusion to think

35
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:12,000
that if we put down our care for a

36
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,600
moment it won't be

37
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,840
stronger in the next

38
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,680
moment e

39
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,960
oh the these ideas Notions

40
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,400
of my

41
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,960
life the density of our

42
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:57,160
autobiography the density of time

43
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,960
compulsivity of our

44
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,080
care we actually put all this down in order

45
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:25,319
to discover a deeper

46
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,520
love but don't don't fixate on

47
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:54,840
love just enter the

48
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,440
territory of your mind

49
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:15,720
mind Simplicity of how experience constellates right

50
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:29,159
now the sound sensation this breath

51
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,440
let the breath breathe

52
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
itself

53
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
e

54
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320

55
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

56
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,279
e e

57
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,639
all thoughts of getting somewhere making something of

58
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,800
yourself or kind of buffer

59
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:13,920
disrupting the uh intimacy the experience of being alive

60
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
breathing

61
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
e

62
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,120
for e

63
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:28,040
you're not bartering with time

64
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:39,800
trading in this moment of mindfulness for something else in the

65
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,880
future practice um falling into the

66
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
present

67
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

68
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920

e e

79
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:16,760
the more completely we lay down the world lay

80
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:22,440
down greed and distress with respect to the

81
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:30,519
world the more full our love becomes

82
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:44,480
the less tenable hate

83
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,480
becomes e

84
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:37,159
the experience of no world

85
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:43,240
deepens the poignancy of the world

86
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:19,279
we just uh perhaps find our [Music]

87
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:27,360
own simple little ways of helping out here or

88
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
there

89
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

90
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

91
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

92
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

93
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,240
e e

94
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:32,789
[Music]

95
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,080
e

96
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:11,279
okay as a child

97
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:19,120
um uh I would I would get so um enraged by

98
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:25,960
hypocrisy not not um not annoyed but really deeply

99
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:32,240
affected and uh usually mobilized a lot of a lot of anger in

100
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:37,919
me and it wasn't that

101
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:44,840
I thought I knew the ultimate truth but it wasn't hard to spot

102
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:51,840
lies and when I would see a society say one

103
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:59,159
thing and do another or I would sense someone living deceptively using

104
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:06,559
words to hide the truth or when I would see something but

105
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:14,399
nobody would acknowledge it or talk about it uh pretended it wasn't even

106
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:20,360
there um it's hard and that that was sort of how I

107
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:26,360
felt about dukka you know suffering like nobody's talking about this all

108
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:36,039
pervasive force that keep bumping into and as children we

109
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:42,559
um we learn and understand by interactions with others often not

110
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:47,600
always apparent uh we sort of arrive at a sense

111
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,880
of consensual reality through

112
00:30:53,799 --> 00:31:00,960
interaction and so okay what you're experiencing is is coldness here's some

113
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:07,200
warm clothes you don't feel good because you're hungry here's some

114
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,880
food you're worthy of Love here is my

115
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:19,080
love and this is really the basis for empathic connection for ma making sense

116
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:26,039
of the world together and in

117
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:33,039
um in grad school School my uh the the research I was I was working on focused

118
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:41,679
on risk and resilience in um maltreated kids abuse

119
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:48,799
neglect and um and when many of those kids faced um

120
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:54,000
trauma part of what was so destructive and

121
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,360
disoriented or disorienting was um they they didn't even really know what was

122
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:09,080
real you know often they didn't have anyone to help them realize like

123
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:15,360
yes this is true this is real I'm

124
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:22,840
sorry and in this way honesty feels like a kind of moral

125
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:28,240
debt and it's owed to others so that they can

126
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:34,679
make sense of their lives there's a um

127
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:40,840
tadan uh commentary um said something like all

128
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:48,799
all evil States converge upon the transgression of

129
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:54,639
Truth and to deceive another is to um

130
00:32:54,639 --> 00:33:03,279
you know is to induce uh induce a measure of delusion in them what we

131
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:09,120
are attempting to uproot we induce that in them and

132
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:19,360
deceiving and the Buddha said one who feels no shame in telling a deliberate LIE there's there's no harm they won't

133
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:29,679
perpetrate and then there's a related issue not quite a lie but um but

134
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:36,440
 and uh almost 40 years ago philosopher Harry Frankfurt wrote this

135
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:43,840
this essay a philosophical Journal like Co titled on you know defining it

136
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:49,679
distinguishing it from lying and uh he wrote um one of the most

137
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:56,799
Salient features of our culture is that there's so much  everyone knows this each of us

138
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:03,240
contributes our sh but we tend to take this situation for granted most people are rather confident

139
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:10,520
of their ability to recognize and to avoid being taken in by it so the phenomena has not

140
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:17,638
aroused much deliberate concern or attracted much sustained inquiry in consequence we have no clear

141
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:24,760
understanding of what is why there is so much of it or what function it serves in other words we have no

142
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:31,878
Theory I propose to begin the development of a theoretical understanding of

143
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:39,520
the bullshitter cannot be regarded as lying for they do not presume that they know the truth their statement is

144
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:46,040
grounded neither in a belief that it is true nor as a lie must be in a belief

145
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:53,118
that is not true it's just this lack of connection to a concern with

146
00:34:53,119 --> 00:35:00,560
truth this indifference to how things really are that I regard as the essence

147
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,800
of

148
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:12,920
 as Dharma practitioners if we take a stand against anything it's

149
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:19,240
against that in our own lives with our

150
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:28,359
people this is um Thomas metzinger this scientific very so sober

151
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:36,640
rigorous approach to reality and life and the spiritual approach to reality and life stem from the same values the

152
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:44,560
same normative core has something to do with truthfulness I guess the English word is

153
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:52,040
veracity the will the pure will to Absolute veracity and to accept the

154
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:59,040
obligation of veracity toward oneself

155
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:09,640
at various times in um in my practice I felt such

156
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:15,440
a such a deep longing just like let me

157
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:23,920
understand I don't care at all if the truth makes me happier just let me

158
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:32,440
understand and so in this um political moment in the United

159
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:41,640
States when there's H so much deception and such pervasive

160
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:47,920
BS such a fundamental indifference to how things really

161
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:55,119
are I I find myself returned to my adolescent

162
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:04,920
rage and this anger motivates a kind of deep wish to

163
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:11,319
show no you're wrong there's this kind of hunger to

164
00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:18,920
prove for the final piece of evidence to be revealed to finally agree on the

165
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:27,640
epistemological terms you know uh of of the moment to to show no

166
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:35,640
this was always a con and it feels like okay I'm trying to

167
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:43,319
maintain my sanity as a citizen I'm trying to maintain some you know sense

168
00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:49,319
of consensual reality but marshalling evidence doesn't

169
00:37:49,319 --> 00:37:54,720
matter at all in the face of indifference to

170
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:00,079
truth and so this sends me into a kind of

171
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:09,839
self-righteous spiral where I need to find others who agree with me

172
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:19,640
totally and there's a kind of bond in the outrage finding consensual reality

173
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:28,400
together and I get why I have these feelings

174
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,760
but it's not a healthy

175
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:41,119
cycle and there I there's there's I feel like there's got to be a better

176
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:50,920
way now you say yes Matthew there's a better way let me tell

177
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:56,559
you there is a better way

178
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:07,000
probably many things to do but um a few came to

179
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:14,960
mind in the first being just simply may may I treasure may I treasure the

180
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:21,599
truth speak the truth as best I can discern it it's the part of me

181
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:27,920
Saka truthfulness and I try to do that in my own way you know

182
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:34,200
here certain Wednesdays the rest of my

183
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:41,720
life may I um May I give up on some

184
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:47,480
sorrow this realm give up yeah meaning I

185
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:57,079
cannot make my sanity dependent on the world honoring the parmy of truthfulness

186
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:05,640
and in a way to enter the debate is to lose to enter it

187
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:12,760
is to lose now I understand the incentives to

188
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:20,359
deceive the incentives of BS I'm even sympathetic actually to some of the

189
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:30,480
incentives may I be relentless relent ESS in perceiving

190
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:37,560
self-deception it's sort of like at the heart of this path you know when we dimly sense that

191
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:42,760
we're pulling a kind of fast one on

192
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:50,640
ourselves we we need others we NE can never have 360 degree

193
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:57,720
Vision but we can make a kind of commitment to veracity may I not live

194
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:02,960
cocooned in the Mythic story that is

195
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:08,519
ego may I be willing to see that

196
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:18,240
burn Tanya broso um I think social psychologist she

197
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:24,400
said that people tend to think of themselves as scientists seeking evidence to arrive at the truth or

198
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:32,119
something but we actually think more like Tri lawyers where we've predetermined what our case is what's

199
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:38,880
true and then we make the case for that more like trial attorneys rather than

200
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:44,440
openly Gathering evidence to determine what

201
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:50,680
so n said um

202
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:59,040
uh truth is apportioned according to one's strength

203
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:07,280
okay may I become strong enough to tolerate more

204
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:16,200
truth and then there is SAA not that we

205
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:21,280
believe all the same things or have the exact same political

206
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:28,119
ideology or anything like that but it is a place where we don't have to pretend

207
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:32,960
what's in front of our eyes is not

208
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:37,920
there and there's healing just in

209
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:50,880
that nature bats last anyway which is to say anicha bats

210
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:59,119
last so let us know how to let go

211
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:05,760
before the illusion of holding on is

212
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:14,359
shattered okay offer this for your

213
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:22,880
consideration and uh I appreciate being uh with you uh

214
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:28,480
this evening May uh may you all be well
