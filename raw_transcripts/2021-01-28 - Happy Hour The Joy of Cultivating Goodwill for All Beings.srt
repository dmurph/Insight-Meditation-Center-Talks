um meta cultivating kindness love and kindness and

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:27,199
and systematically going through the categories uh one by one lingering in each one

5
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:33,198
spending a little more time and um

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,719
we spend some time with the category of uh the being we're having challenges

7
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,840
with there are small challenges big challenges ourselves as our

8
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:54,000
beloved challenging being we spend time doing that on monday so i like

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,640
us i like to invite us to to gently move to the next category

10
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,680
which by the way includes all the previous categories surprise

11
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:13,040
the next category being all beings everywhere all beings all human beings all

12
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,560
animals all everything all senti it's all sentient beings actually in

13
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:27,280
buddhist practice uh maybe later we'll practice with being all beings plants and earth and all that

14
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:34,479
too but for now maybe we'll just deal with sentient beings for for for this uh session so

15
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:41,200
so this category yes of course it includes all includes our

16
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:48,640
dear being our benefactor our good friend includes us includes the neutral being

17
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,759
that we practice with who is the stand-in for all of humanity it includes our challenging beings

18
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:02,479
it just includes everyone includes everyone so it's um yeah

19
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:08,319
it's it practicing with this category which is all beings allows our heart to really

20
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:13,360
shine to really shine its good will

21
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,040
its kindness unto the entire world

22
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:26,239
and again there's so many different ways to do these practices doing them without metaphrases with

23
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,480
metaphases and the next few days we'll explore the different different ways

24
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:39,840
so for for today what i wanted to invite us as always we'll start with

25
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,360
just settling with the breath with the body and i'll include a lot more silence at

26
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,879
the beginning just so that we settle uh and and get in touch with them

27
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:59,120
with our bodies and breath and then as we turn to all beings um

28
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,519
i wanted to share i wanted to bring in uh the karaniya meta sutta

29
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:12,000
um that has um oops i had it open

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,519
where was yes here excuse me that has a some different categories in

31
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,879
here and i like these different different categories here i wanted to name them

32
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:33,599
um wishing and gladness and in safety may all beings be at ease whatever

33
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:42,239
living beings there may be whether they are weak or strong omitting none the great or the mighty

34
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:49,440
medium short or small the scene and the unseen those living

35
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:58,720
near and far away those born and to be born may all beings be at ease

36
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:06,799
i love the poetry of the carnea metacitta those seen in the unseen born

37
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:15,439
and yet to be born oh how sweet so i'll evoke some of these categories

38
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:22,320
along with a whole bunch of other categories and i'll invite you to be as creative as you wish

39
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:29,840
in the way that you would divide beings into different categories

40
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:37,280
i've shared before at some point that there is there is some prayer in my culture i was

41
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,800
born in iran in the persian culture and the azeri azerbaijan

42
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:50,160
which my grandma and mom were from anyway there was this um my grandma used to say all those who

43
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,600
were born on a saturday on a sun on a monday tuesday so

44
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,919
that's another way to divide because if you go through the whole week all beings who are born on these

45
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:07,759
different days of course you'll catch everyone so in the same with the carnival mentos a medium

46
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:14,000
short small big all sizes you'll include everyone so there's so many different ways to cut the pie that's

47
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,320
that's what i'm trying to communicate and it's it's totally fun to be creative with this particular

48
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:28,400
practice and have fun with all the beings who who um are two-legged or who slither

49
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:34,240
who hop who this who's that so anyway let's just have some fun with expanding

50
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,440
our heart wishing good will for all beings it's supposed to be fun

51
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:46,960
yes and and of course yeah it's it's important it's our hearts

52
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,199
dedication it's heart our hearts growing and growing in love and care and it's not supposed to be

53
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,800
grim duty so whatever you love you have fun with you want to do more of so let's have fun

54
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,720
with this practice this beautiful practice of cultivated goodwill so

55
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,000
so with all that let's start

56
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:18,840
so i invite you to get into your meditation posture you need to shift and move to be more

57
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:34,639
comfortable landing landing in this body

58
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,360
landing

59
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:49,199
ah this body as the earth element

60
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,880
like earth it's heavy

61
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:03,840
there's a sense of solidity that we feel we experience with the body

62
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:23,520
letting the earthiness of this body be supported by gravity by mother earth

63
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,840
ah letting go relaxing

64
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:57,919
appreciating each part of the body in our own time doing a little body scan in our own time

65
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:04,080
connecting with the earthiness relaxing letting go each part of the body

66
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:13,840
unto mother earth

67
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
so

68
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,720
and whenever you are done in your own

69
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:28,320
time the body scan supporting letting go relaxing each part

70
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:36,640
of the body connecting with the breath

71
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,959
letting the air element of the breath

72
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:54,160
intermingle with the earth element

73
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:00,000
bringing more vitality life

74
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,839
awakens

75
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:19,839

192
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:06,000
doing and um it's sometimes hard and but um

193
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:15,520
yeah i i guess i'm just sort of like going to the gym um mental spiritual gymnastics for me

194
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:21,359
yeah yeah yeah thank you for naming that it's not always easy sometimes it is

195
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:27,680
sometimes it isn't and some categories some practices might be easier than others and some days

196
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:34,400
the same thing might come more easily than another day and it's all okay that's why it is a practice right it is

197
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:40,800
a practice if if you're all good at it then we wouldn't be engaging in this way so

198
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:46,480
so yes it is a practice thank you for highlighting what you meant by that yeah

199
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:52,160
other reflections how did you find it

200
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:58,079
yeah reflection coming rather than struggling with the flowing mind having

201
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:04,160
fun in the way the river of our mind drifts playing and resting in the water creates

202
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:09,520
a harmony of feeling into where it is yeah yeah i appreciate that

203
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:15,599
reflection and by the way i've started this thing of if you send it to me directly i won't

204
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:21,520
say your name out loud and if you say to send it to everyone i'll say your name just

205
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:26,720
in case you want to have privacy with share reflection but you know your name so i appreciate this reflection that

206
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:31,760
that came came okay either way works thank you now for the reflection

207
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:37,280
uh yeah it's and part of this part of this practice really is

208
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:43,599
um not struggling exactly not struggling with with with the mind it's a practice of

209
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:51,119
meta we are trying to cultivate kindness and good will towards ourselves so um having fun

210
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:57,280
exactly having fun and and this this practice in particular when we're imagining all these categories

211
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:04,160
slithering and flying and swimming and born and yet to be born it just feels like a party we're inviting

212
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:10,480
everyone we we know we're inviting everyone to to wish them

213
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:18,640
well so so i invite you with this practice really um treated with that sense of fun

214
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:24,000
and i appreciate enough talking about you know not struggling having fun with the mind drift to these categories and

215
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,800
have have a party and like oh you may you be well oh yeah you're inviting more you know no no kangaroos that are

216
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:38,640
hopping are now in your party oh yeah you may you be well too right you just keep wishing well extending your heart

217
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:45,760
um yeah turn says all beings in the six realms absolutely

218
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:53,040
all the uh realms and and buddhism there there the heavenly realms all the the the

219
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:59,119
happy realms that the gods were having a great time um joyfully in all

220
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:05,200
the pizza realms all the realms that are those who are suffering and the animals and we're kind of in the middle all the

221
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:11,040
human realm so yes there's so many different ways to to cut the pie so i appreciate that bill

222
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:18,160
asks how do you know if you're doing it right um you um

223
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:27,359
you know doing it right that's a good that's a doubt question that can come up as long as your uh wishing well you know

224
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:33,280
categories come up and you're wishing them well may you be well you're doing it right that's it it's not

225
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:39,920
that complicated don't make it complicated it's just wishing well cultivating kindness and

226
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:46,560
after we keep doing this at some point it becomes both easier and and our heart starts to kind of

227
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:51,839
glow and shine and feel like oh yeah you two you be well oh yeah you youtube you will too i

228
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:57,680
wish you well also it just comes it becomes the the wheels get more more oiled

229
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:03,440
so yeah as long as there's a sense of good will coming up you're doing it right and if the opposite comes up and as long

230
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:08,880
as you have good will for that you're doing it right it's all about

231
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:15,200
cultivating kindness so wherever you bring kindness in you're gentle with yourself for

232
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:23,359
example as as nav was saying earlier not struggling not struggling and just just having the

233
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:29,680
sense of harmony oh yeah the mind is drifting it's okay do your mind it's okay with kindness

234
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:35,280
with kindness meeting the mind then yeah you're doing the practice right even if you're not thinking about

235
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:40,880
slithering and flying you know as long as you're bringing in kindness at any point

236
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:48,319
you're doing it right so yeah so dear ones let's uh let's

237
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:55,599
practice in in community so the invitation for small groups

238
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:02,000
is you know you're all in some ways all beings to each other

239
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:09,280
right you're both connected and disconnected one one one uh

240
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:16,079
you know one degree of separation many degrees of separation so um first of all

241
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:23,040
actually here's the invitation when you come to practice meetings today in small groups my invitation is

242
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:28,240
first don't start talking just yet actually take 10

243
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:35,520
15 seconds 30 seconds in silence and just do meta for each other

244
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:41,440
for the other person or two in your small group then just do meta just good will for

245
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:47,359
this other human being and then after that then you can see

246
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:53,119
you know there's a timer so you can see whenever say 50 let's say 20 seconds do 20 seconds of

247
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:59,599
silent meta for each other and then whoever is moved can start sharing and holding each other

248
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:07,040
yeah let's try that so and if you need to leave understandable but don't hop off out of fear this is a

249
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:15,160
really nice community so okay so i'm going to create the breakout

267
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,078

and you can raise your uh hand by going to reactions raise hand great

269
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:32,079
emily here you go hi um one question that comes up for me

270
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:38,319
this practice tends to be pretty difficult for me and i've heard some people say you know

271
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:44,480
just keep doing it and then something shifts and i i feel like i've heard other people say try to do it in a way

272
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:50,480
like shift what you're practicing so you're actually feeling the feeling maybe get a little more creative with it

273
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:55,599
do you have any thoughts on kind of like i don't want to feel like i'm banging my head against the wall like

274
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:01,839
torturing myself but i also want to kind of have faith in the process that it could change

275
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:09,040
yeah yeah yeah i appreciate that so both are true both are true one is that

276
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:16,160
you know it's okay to try please be creative and start to do what it's easy what what what you

277
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:21,440
connect with please do that and yet do don't don't necessarily think that

278
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:26,880
that's the only way because even if it feels like it's not working right you're just

279
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:31,920
saying may you be well but there's not a sense of cosmic love you just say oh may you

280
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:38,079
be well trust trusted you're planting seeds of kindness it's working in ways that

281
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:43,520
you can't quite understand in your conscious minds i i've seen this with so many

282
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:48,800
practitioners i've seen it over and over so please please take this

283
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:55,040
as a borrowed trust borrowed faith from what i'm saying that even it feels like nothing is happening

284
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:00,559
it is happening you get you you change you shift in ways that you'll surprise yourself

285
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:06,319
so um so don't think that that's banging your head against the wall you're just doing the practice

286
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:13,040
you're just planting seeds and it's also wise too now you know to be creative it's like oh

287
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:19,680
yeah i like fish so i'm just gonna wish fish well right or whatever or for they get all all the doggies and

288
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:26,640
cats come to my mind and that's okay too it's it's uh skillful means cultivation great thank

289
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:32,400

292
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:50,559
because that's another way we can practice by by by celebrating other people's practice

293
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:56,079
uh as a way to actually practice for ourselves and jaime says each of us in my group

294
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:01,680

299
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:35,440
to practice and support each other in this cultivation it's harder to do it alone it's it's

300
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:42,480
much easier to to do it in community so let's dedicate the merit of our practice may all beings

everywhere be safe happy healthy and have ease

us included may all beings be free and know their own goodness

303
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:05,440
thank you all
