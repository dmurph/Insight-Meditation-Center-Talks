15
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,740
together

16
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,979
letting there be a sense of uprightness in the body

17
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:58,640

20
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,760
answer that for yourself

21
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,540
and after connecting with your intention spending your intention

22
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,840
toward this period of practice with kindness

23
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:47,780
directing turning your awareness inward the body

24
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:58,459
sensations of the feet and the Earth stabilizing grounding

25
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:18,180
sensations of your sit bones your bottom on the

26
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:24,180
cushion the chair your hands on your lap

27
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,379
these touch points

28
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,319
help them ground you

29
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:28,560
connecting with the breath and the abdomen the lower part of the

30
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,320
body so that there's a sense of grounding settling

31
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,880
connecting becoming aware

32
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:45,120
aware of the sensations of the breath

33
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:53,160
in the body calm and settle

34
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,638
and then when thoughts arise the inner speech arises

35
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:10,080
let us know not to be entangled with or absorbed

36
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,400
with but just to know

37
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:26,720
is this inner speech beneficial is it connected with the goal of the path

38
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:35,419
it's connected with my intention In This Moment is it beneficial to me beneficially find in that way

39
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:42,020
is beneficial connected to the goal of the path in this moment

40
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,160
or is it idle chatter

41
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:57,360
simply getting to know and if you decide it's idle chatter can you be kind and

42
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,180
maybe smilingly smilingly let go

43
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:17,280
and also noticing the tone of this inner speech is it kind

44
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:23,099
is it spoken with a mind of loving kindness

45
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:31,620
towards yourself towards others shining the light of awareness

46
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:36,680
of mindfulness on our inner speech

47
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:48,959
and then when you've seen when the heart has known as seen

48
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:54,560
with mindfulness and release let go

49
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:00,300
let the breath the sensations of the breath and the body be primary settling

50
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:06,800
calming centering

51
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,639

the landscape of the Mind the heart

54
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,740
seeing it with kindness not deluding ourselves

55
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,200
and Gathering collecting with the breath

56
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,380
of the sensations of the breath

57

foreign

59
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,679
and we just utter and listen to Silence with it

60
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:33,200
which is what's most beneficial In This Moment

61
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,500

uh greetings everyone I'm delighted to be

83
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,740
continuing to share these important teachings

84
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:18,980
on why speech part of the Eightfold Path

85
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:27,679
the third path Factor so

86
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:34,919
why speech appropriate speech not only important in the way that we impact the

87
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:40,980
world not just with our speech but with our writing our text our tweets

88
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:48,000
with their phenomenal speed and and reach but also how it shapes and forms

89
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:55,799
who we are so taking it on not just as a set of moral rules that I should not lie

90
00:32:55,799 --> 00:33:03,659
I should not um speak what's not beneficial but really as an internal scaffold of who we

91
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:09,179
are to form our own Karma the person we are the person we are becoming is is

92
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:14,279
Sublime training and

93
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:19,320
um one way that

94
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:24,740
um an author James clear the author of the book Atomic habits a great book

95
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:31,320
puts it in a secular way but really it's about how we build our Karma uh is about

96
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:37,740
our actions and note that in Buddhism actions aren't just physical actions

97
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:45,080
they are um mental actions when you think that's considered a mental action uh Speech

98
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:50,279
action of of speaking and of course physical actions so actions really takes

99
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:55,559
everything um into consideration so with with this quote

100
00:33:55,559 --> 00:34:02,039
um consider action in in all these ways including speech so

101
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:07,200
so from James Clear every action you take is a vote for the type of person

102
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:13,858
you wish to become no single instance will transform your beliefs but as the

103
00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:19,700
votes build up so does the evidence of your new identity

104
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:27,118
so if if you so I love the way they think about every action as a vote for

105
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:33,960
the type of person you wish to become so I want to be more ethical I want to

106
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:41,118
to not speak idly and just blah blah blah blah blah

107
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:49,320
so with this now um we uh this being the fourth day we've

108
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:56,040
been covering we've been discussing this I want to remind us of what we've discussed so far so the first was is it

109
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:01,500
true what what I'm about to say is it true and factual

110
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:08,820
um there's some nuances of factual it's not just our perception our our imagine our our perceptions or our emotions but

111
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:16,339
also is it factual supported by facts so is it true and factual was the first one I discussed on Monday

112
00:35:16,339 --> 00:35:21,960
and uh and then the second day we discussed is it

113
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,780
divisive is it divisive or does it create Harmony

114
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:34,260
then we added some Nuance to both of those and then yesterday we discussed is it harsh and abusive or is it gentle is

115
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:39,660
my speech uttered in anger or both internally and externally of course or

116
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:45,300
is it gentle soothing to the ear agreeable as the Buddha directs us to

117
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:51,060
speak thank you So today we're going to add two more and

118
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:56,220
tomorrow the last one um so is it idle chatter or is it

119
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:02,160
beneficial so these are from two different teachings as I mentioned the first day but just to remind you the

120
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:09,660
Buddha gives uh in one list there are four um definitions of um of what is why

121
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:15,960
speech and in another uh uh uh teaching he gives another five and they kind of

122
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:21,359
map but not quite and if you put them together you end up getting six so so

123
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:26,880
um in fact let me be more specific so the um

124
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:33,300
uh so the um so maybe I'll share that that on the

125
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:38,940
last day I'll just given their remaining time I'll talk about these two okay I'm just gonna move on

126
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:44,460
um so so is it is it idle chatter so

127
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:51,540
idle chatter um is considered unwise speech or wrong speech inappropriate speech and idle

128
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:57,780
chatter um any talk that's not associated with

129
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:04,079
with Liberation and freedom and and the Dharma for monks is considered Idol

130
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:11,160
chatter and the word actually idle chatter in Pali is an onomatopoeia

131
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:16,260
um is a word that sounds like what it is it's some papalapa some Papa Palapa and

132
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:24,079
the first P has an h i after it so some papalapa is like some papalapa you know just the sense of some papalapas

133
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:30,119
right it's you get the sense so so any speech that's not associated with The

134
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:35,160
Liberation for monks so so they have a higher standard it's considered some

135
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:42,119
Papa we're lay people we have a different standard we do engage with with others

136
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:47,640
in a social way with our co-workers with our friends family speech has a way to

137
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:52,800
Bond as a way to to make relationships and not every

138
00:37:52,800 --> 00:38:00,180
um conversation will be about Liberation and yet to consider is it is it idle

139
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:05,579
chatter are we just opening our mouths to just fill the space blah blah blah

140
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:11,400
blah are we feeling uncomfortable with with silence and just rushing to fill it

141
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:16,800
in um how are we feeling how how are we

142
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,960
feeding our mind with what we say and also what we consume are we consuming

143
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:28,140
some Papa lapa just blah blah blah blah blah blah just like idle chatter social

144
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:34,619
media Island Shadow yeah Somebody went on vacation okay great I'm happy for them but some people is it all some

145
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:40,920
Popple up um what are we consuming what are we um what are we putting and how are we

146
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:46,079
engaging are we indulging uh because we are

147
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:51,720
trying to get the self our self-sense or are we getting riled up so so all of

148
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:57,540
these all of these questions about why am I speaking in fact there is the great

149
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:04,579
acronym from the teacher Jonathan uh Faust and the acronym is weight w-a-i-t

150
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:12,720
and it stands for why am I talking I love that why am I talking so

151
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:18,320
internally why am I talking why am I talking in this moment why am I talking

152
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:24,119
and having a little bit of humor with that can be helpful why am I talking

153
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:30,060
um is it um yeah why am I talking what is my intention right now why is what is my

154
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:37,740
intention and again it goes back to the intention why am I talking am I just feeling space or is it beneficial is it

155
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:43,140
beneficial for my own benefit for others benefit and benefit not you know greed

156
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:48,599
hate or delusion but is it connected benefit is defined as the goal of the

157
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:53,700
path so whatever is connected to the goal of the path is is considered

158
00:39:53,700 --> 00:40:02,599
beneficial for for my benefit other people's well-being benefit in this way why am I talking why am I talking

159
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:08,660
so the Buddha instructs us to abandon

160
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:14,520
abandoning Idol chatter one abstains from Idol chatter one speaks in season

161
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:19,680
speaks what is factual what is in accordance with the goal the dhamma and

162
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:27,839
the vinaya vinaya is the rules for the monks so this part it was for the monks and then one speaks I love this one speaks

163
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:36,140
words worth treasuring one speaks words worth treasuring

164
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:42,900
seasonable reasonable circumscribed connected with the goal words worth

165
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:49,380
treasuring so that is one question to ask ourselves

166
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:54,480
is it idle chatter what I'm engaging with or is it beneficial so bringing

167
00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:02,880
those together and then the other question the other um uh directive but Buddha gives us I want

168
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:10,740
to cover that in the time remaining is um am I speaking with a mind of loving

169
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:18,060
kindness am I speaking with a mind of love and kindness and in shorthand

170
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:24,900
um this guideline is often expressed as is it kind what am I what I'm saying is it kind and

171
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:30,000
I like the the shorthand um is it kind because it's short and yet

172
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,820
I don't love the shorthand and I'll tell you why because is it kind is is kind of

173
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:41,579
is cutting um is cutting ourselves short of the goal of how actually Buddha

174
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:46,859
speaks it you know the directive in the suit is given Ally speaking with a mind

175
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:53,099
of loving kindness yes it's a mouthful it's long but it's different from just being kind you can say something that's

176
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:59,820
kind but may not be completely spoken with it mind of love and kindness right you can just be try to be kind yeah

177
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:07,380
great it's a great start please say things that are kind wonderful it's a great start but imbuing speaking with a

178
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:14,339
mind of the heart of love and kindness is is the more wholesome the more complete uh aspiration for training

179
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:19,980
ourselves am I speaking with a mind of loving kindness and yes of course

180
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:25,140
whatever comes from that mind of loving kindness spoken with that then it is

181
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:32,960
spoken with with kindness it is going to be kind but um that is the invitation and um

182
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:41,760
imbuing our hearts with a mind of good will for ourselves for others 360 degrees so not just speaking for their

183
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:49,320
benefit and to our own detriment or other way around with really kindness 360 degrees and in fact another teaching

184
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:54,540
uh Buddha says that one doesn't say something that's to one's own detriment

185
00:42:54,540 --> 00:43:00,540
so this mind of loving kindness covers covers it all

186
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:07,560
it's not just other focused it's it's really internal and externally focused because you are part of the all beings

187
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:14,339
this being is part of the all-being so for benefit of all beings no one left out

188
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:21,060
and and um imbuing our hearts our minds with loving kindness before we speak can

189
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:27,540
support us uh to minimize the agitation of remorse and regret later

190
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:32,700
so a lot of uh

191
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:39,480
