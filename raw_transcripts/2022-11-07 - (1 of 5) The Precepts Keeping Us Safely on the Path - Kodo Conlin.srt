Gail very kindly introduced

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,080

16
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,340

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,579
training I'm a teacher training

19
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,800

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,960
people

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,539
and in addition

22
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,399
live and

23
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,579
work can serve as a priest at San

24
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,440
Francisco's and Center

25
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,878
so the Dharma is all around

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,560
so the theme for this week

27
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,500
uh comes from a

28
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,220
well it is inspired by a custom

29
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,100
of this group going back I understand to

30
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,240
the time of

31
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,280
Palo Alto sitting group

32
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,400
that gill would teach

33
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,700
the introduction to meditation class

34
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,799
once heard twice a year

35
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,540
and

36
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,240
immediately before that he would teach

37
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,520
the precepts

38
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,100
the ethical Foundation

39
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,780
of of our practice

40
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,040
so the theme from so the the plan for

41
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,200
these next two weeks will be this week

42
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,079
to discuss the five precepts

43
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,880
and then next week

44
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,399
May Elliott will teach the introduction

45
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,340
to mindfulness meditation

46
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,840
of course and about

47
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,939
12 minutes we won't be able to cover all

48
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:01,860
of the subtleties of

49
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,899
precept so uh

50
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,680
um I hope we can we can say enough

51
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,380
to encourage a reflection

52
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,780
uh to touch something in you

53
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,420
to consider

54
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,720
how it is that the ethical practice of

55
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,840
the precepts encourages

56
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,640
your sitting practice and your growth in

57
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,120
the Dharma

58
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,379
so

59
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,440
first uh to locate the five precepts

60
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,440
within the tradition

61
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,200
closest analog we can really find

62
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,739
to the to the five precepts which are

63
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:48,739
the the

64
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:51,480
precepts of training for Lay followers

65
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,840
for Lay practitioners closest analog we

66
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,840
can find in the early teachings is the

67
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,120
10 skillful actions

68
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,319
discussed a lot in the on gutura nikaya

69
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,300
and then also there are some there are

70
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,500
some

71
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,239
sprinklings

72
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:10,739
I say sprinklings but it's really

73
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:12,300
everywhere this distinction between

74
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,659
wholesome and unwholesome action

75
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:20,120
skillful and unskillful action

76
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,959
and I'd like to talk about the precepts

77
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:23,819
over these next five days

78
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:26,040
in terms of a slogan

79
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,640
and that is keeping us safely on the

80
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,800
path

81
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,599
keeping us safely on the path

82
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,659
um

83
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,000
as well as we might sometimes hear if we

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,340
go to a retreat at IRC

85
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,159
at Insight Retreat Center within the

86
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:49,560
context of the Dharma there's no Us in

87
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,180
them

88
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,000
there's just us

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,519
so keeping us safely on the path means

90
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:59,940
there's no one and nothing

91
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:04,220
outside of our Circle of Care

92
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:06,480
no one and nothing outside of our Circle

93
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,900
of Care

94
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,159
and keeping us safely on the path

95
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,320
when the Buddha was teaching about

96
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,780
precepts it was often teaching to

97
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,759
monastics

98
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,979
but still I take some inspiration about

99
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:28,820
how it was done

100
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:33,419
one important teaching that inspires my

101
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:36,000
own reflection is that there's a list of

102
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,240
reasons in the vinya that the Buddha

103
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,160
um

104
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,620
lays down a training rule

105
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,680
why the Buddha puts forth a precept for

106
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,120
practice

107
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,460
and three of them I'd like to select and

108
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,880
talk about are the fact that uh he lays

109
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,740
down to training world one for the

110
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,600
comfort and ease

111
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,180
I love this of well behaved monastics

112
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,160
the comfort and ease of well-behaved

113
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,660
monastics

114
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,139
the second is that

115
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,900
um behaving in line with this training

116
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,000
rule

117
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,979
inspires faith

118
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:20,220
it inspires faith in those who don't

119
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,220
have faith in the Dharma the Buddha the

120
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,960
Sangha and it inspires faith and um

121
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,539
and those who already have faith in the

122
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,000
Buddha Dharma and Sangha

123
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
and then the third reason that I want to

124
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,580
highlight is that they support

125
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,740
the ending

126
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,639
of greed hatred and delusion

127
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,440
they support liberation

128
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,240
letting go

129
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,520
and in our colloquial terms they support

130
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,320
happiness

131
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,840
so ease and comfort faith

132
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,600
and Liberation as reasons that the

133
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,600
Buddha may put forth a precept for a

134
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,320
training put forth a standard of conduct

135
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,620
by which we walk the path and keep

136
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,080
ourselves safely

137
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,978
on the path

138
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,340
so in this in this insect tradition

139
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,960
one of the places we most commonly

140
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,520
encounter the precepts is at the

141
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,759
beginning of a retreat

142
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,280
there could actually be some long while

143
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,960
that someone's been meditating before

144
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,940
they ever hear anything about the

145
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,340
precepts

146
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,539
but if they make their way to a retreat

147
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:35,400
of course

148
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,400
um

149
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,479
on the opening night

150
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:41,460
as we settle in have the first formal

151
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,740
session

152
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,100
in this in this Opening space

153
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,900
where the Stillness is beginning to fall

154
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,780
the tone has begun to shift the concerns

155
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,840
of our everyday are starting to

156
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,400
starting to subside some little bit

157
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,180
and we undergo a short ceremony where we

158
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,180
take refuge in the Buddha and then we

159
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:11,060
commit ourselves to these five precepts

160
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,479
um

161
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,100
and more or less they're said in this

162
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,280
way

163
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,979
for the sake of our training together

164
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:24,780
I undertake

165
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,639
the precept

166
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,160
to refrain from harming

167
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,000
living beings

168
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,280
second for the sake

169
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,280
of our training together

170
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,900
I undertake the precept

171
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,639
not to take what is not given

172
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:51,360
third for the sake of our training

173
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,620
together

174
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,860
I undertake the precept to abstain from

175
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,660
sexual misconduct

176
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,340
and in the context of a retreat that

177
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,039
means celibacy

178
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:04,080
fourth for the sake of our training

179
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,520
together

180
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,280
I undertake the precept to abstain from

181
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,520
false speech

182
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,639
and fifth for the sake of our training

183
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,660
together

184
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,639
I undertake the precept

185
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,699
to abstain from intoxicants that are a

186
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:24,020
cause for heedlessness

187
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,479
five seemingly simple in some ways maybe

188
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,880
maybe obvious

189
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,099
but powerful ways to keep ourselves

190
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:36,959
safely on the path

191
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,200
and keep others safely on the path

192
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,659
you know something I've noticed when

193
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,760
whenever I make these commitments or

194
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,100
renew these commitments

195
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,740
I actually feel a palpable settling in

196
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,480
the body

197
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,760
it's like um

198
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,339
oh what is it it's touching in or it's

199
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:59,399
it's being reoriented to

200
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,920
the these parameters of the path

201
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,399
reminders saying oh yes this is how

202
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:08,640
safety is Manifest in my conduct

203
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,620
this is such a simple way that I can

204
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,080
benefit myself in a simple way that I

205
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,100
can benefit other beings

206
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,860
a simple way I can keep us safely on the

207
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,120
path

208
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,680
and there's a principle behind the

209
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,820
precepts

210
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,000
and one of the most one of the most uh

211
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,680
common and basic that I mentioned

212
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,300
already

213
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,399
is this action wholesome is it

214
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,019
unwholesome

215
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:38,100
is it skillful is it unskillful

216
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,899
I appreciate the word wholesomeness

217
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:42,779
because it it points to

218
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:47,279
it points for me first internally

219
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,640
how we're nourished we're nourished by

220
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,740
our conduct

221
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,540
when it's in line with the precepts when

222
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,459
it's ethical

223
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:59,100
and how we may be denourished or

224
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,260
depleted when our conduct is not in line

225
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,779
with the precepts

226
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:06,480
so wholesome to me points inward

227
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,880
and then the word skillfulness

228
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,860
points to the interpersonal aspect of

229
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,660
the precepts

230
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,940
is my conduct skillful in such a way

231
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,200
that it's supporting me and it's

232
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,060
supporting someone else

233
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,700
is it skillful skillful for our

234
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,339
Liberation for our comfort

235
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:26,959
and for the faith of others

236
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:32,459
one of my very favorite teachings

237
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:34,620
associated with all this is from the

238
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,279
maju malikaya 61. I have a I have a

239
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,320
special fondness for them

240
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,240
those sets of teachings when the Buddha

241
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,140
is teaching his son

242
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:48,360
of a venerable after he ordained as a

243
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,980
monastic

244
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,360
foreign

245
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,899
and in this uh in this scenario

246
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:57,120
venerable rahula has already committed

247
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,040
to the parimoka he's already committed

248
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,560
to the monastic precepts which are many

249
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,399
more than these five

250
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,459
and so he has that as a background of

251
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,940
restraint for this conversation

252
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,420
and Buddha gives this beautiful teaching

253
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,839
he holds up a mirror and he says

254
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,680
what is a mirror for

255
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:26,459
reflection Dante reflection sir

256
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:29,760
just so says the Buddha to his son

257
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,120
we should act with our body with our

258
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,420
speech and with our mind

259
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,720
with our body our speech in our mind

260
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,860
only with repeated reflection

261
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,200
and he goes on to explain that he means

262
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,899
before we do an action

263
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:53,279
think reflect is this action

264
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,380
going to cause harm going to cause

265
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,959
Affliction and I might say all the

266
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,000
discomforts of agitation

267
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,459
that come along with harm

268
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:05,640
is it going to cause this if so don't do

269
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,820
it

270
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,800
but if you reflect and you discern this

271
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,440
action that I'm about to do

272
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,600
it won't cause Affliction but it will

273
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,399
cause well-being

274
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:20,899
support calm goodness

275
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:23,519
non-affliction non-harming

276
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,339
then go ahead

277
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:28,140
while you're doing the action reflect

278
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,360
again is this action causing harm

279
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,339
affliction

280
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:34,560
disease discomfort

281
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,180
if not

282
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,700
continue and then after the action

283
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,579
reflect again did this action cause harm

284
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:44,519
was it unskillful was it unwholesome

285
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,779
or did this action cause

286
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,880
skillful results Pleasant results

287
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,899
supports for the path

288
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,519
it's a comprehensive

289
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:59,100
high standard for the examination of

290
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,000
conduct

291
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,519
I think one that inspires me

292
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,200
and I think when we look at the content

293
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,839
of these five precepts

294
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:08,820
we can see or we can reflect for

295
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,019
ourselves

296
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:12,079
in what ways do they cause agitation

297
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,120
Affliction and harm for others and what

298
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,420
ways do they cause harm agitation or in

299
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,639
what ways do they not cause

300
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,639
harm agitation Affliction what ways do

301
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,500
they cause well-being

302
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,899
in what ways do they keep us safely on

303
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:30,200
the path

304
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,279
foreign

305
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,120
so I would like to propose

306
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,980
that uh when we finish each of these

307
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,320
sessions for the next five days anyone

308
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,200
who would like to can take up this

309
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,700
practice with me of reciting the five

310
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,980
presets

311
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,820
um

312
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,899
and

313
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:51,000
perhaps thinking of them

314
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,639
thinking of them as

315
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:54,860
um

316
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,639
guideposts or

317
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,820
um and encouragements of the Buddha in

318
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,920
wholesome conduct

319
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,839
noticing they're not copying very well

320
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:08,940
I'll do this after we close and anyone

321
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,620
who like would like to stay on we can do

322
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,740
that

323
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,260
keeping us safely on the path

324
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,779
[Music]

325
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:21,540
I hope that it can be that

326
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,180
many of us who gather here for these

327
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,040
for these morning meetings can in

328
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,880
whatever small way

329
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,040
help keep each other safely on the path

330
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,839
with our conduct with our sitting with

331
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,380
our encouragement

332
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,899
wishing you a fruitful week of practice

333
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:41,279
until tomorrow

334
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,120
please take care
