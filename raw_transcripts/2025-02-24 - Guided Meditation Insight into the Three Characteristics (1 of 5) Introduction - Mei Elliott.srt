1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:07,399
so we'll go ahead and get started all right welcome my name is May Elliot good morning good afternoon good

2
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:14,599
evening wherever you are in whatever time zone uh my name is May uh and today

3
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:19,840
we'll start with a simple meditation on the breath uh the idea is that we're

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,760
doing a practice that helps to settle and collect and stabilize the mind and

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,000
this this practice of settling and collecting the mind by focusing on a

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,320
simple object like the breath um it's a supportive condition for insight and

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:43,079
insight will be the focus of the teachings this week so uh go ahead and find a

8
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:50,198
comfortable posture I'll offer a very light instruction

9
00:00:51,640 --> 00:01:01,920
today so maybe finding a position that is um both uh upright and relaxed

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,798
maybe connecting with three deep breaths

11
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:43,430
taking a moment to relax just soften the forehead and the

12
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:51,520
[Music] temples release the

13
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,078
jaw relaxing the shoulders

14
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:07,600
softening the

15
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:15,760
belly and allowing any extra tension to flow on out through the legs and the

16
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,760
feet

17
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:50,959
for the rest of the meditation I'll offer a guidance on following the breath if you know that the breath doesn't work

18
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:58,920
for you if there's a better Anchor for you maybe the soundscape or a global sense of the body

19
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:04,519
sitting uh feel free to do that instead and you can translate the instructions

20
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:06,720
for

21
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,319
yourself for those connecting to the

22
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,920
breath finding your home

23
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:34,599
base connecting with the breath where you feel it most easily most

24
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:44,159
predominantly maybe in the nose or the rise and fall of the

25
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,959
chest maybe in the belly

26
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,280
receiving the sensations of breathing

27
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:51,160
putting aside thoughts of the past or the future putting aside any judgments or

28
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,320
interpretations of what's Happening

29
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:02,479
Now and instead dropping into the felt sense of what's

30
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,000
Happening Now

31
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:42,639
and you feel the full length of an inhale and a full length of an

32
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,639
exhale

33
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
e

34
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,560
e e

35
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:56,589
settling and stabilizing [Music]

36
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:07,240
electing the mind which is so often

37
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,440
fragmented reecting and

38
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
settling

39
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
e

40
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,360
e e

41
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:05,360
you allow the breath to be in the foreground and anything that arises that

42
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:11,560
isn't the breath maybe a sound an

43
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:19,279
emotion a thought can you allow these to be in the background

44
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,079
keeping the breath in the

45
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
foreground

46
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
e

47
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
e

48
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
e

49
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
e

50
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
e

51
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,079
e e

52
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,320
receiving each breath remembering that each is [Music]

53
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:49,759
unique that this breath has never come before and won't come again

54
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,320
feeling the breaths from inside the

55
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
body

56
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

57
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,920
e e

58
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:07,520
though our primary focus is on the breathing here and there you might check

59
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,678
the attitude how are you relating to the

60
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:19,520
breath is there straining or striving

61
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,520
boredom

62
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,880
judgment if so can you invite kindness

63
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,400
and

64
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:45,559
curiosity can you invite an attitude of okayness with whatever is arising

65
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,240
remembering that we're not trying to make anything happen here just training in how to meet our

66
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:25,280
life more fully how to be more free in our

67
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,720
life this Begins by training the mind

68
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,039
training and being

69
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
here

70
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

71
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

72
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

73
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

74
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

75
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

76
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

77
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

78
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

79
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

80
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360

81
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320

82
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,320
e e

83
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:33,360
and for these last minutes seeing if you can maintain some continuity with the

84
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:39,720
breath almost like you're polishing the breath with your attention maintaining

85
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,039
contact with the

86
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
breath

87
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
e

88
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,158
e e

89
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:49,320
welcome again my name is May Elliot for those who are just

90
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:56,360
arriving and this series is coming to you from Insight Meditation Center uh if

91
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:01,640
you're someone who Tunes in fre L you probably know by now that what we're

92
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:10,120
doing here is often called Insight Meditation or vasana and the word vasana is a poly

93
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:15,480
word poly being the uh the original language the Buddha's teachings were

94
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,960
recorded in uh and the theana in vasana means to

95
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:29,799
see the V is an amplifier so Vasa could be translated as uh like really seeing

96
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:36,880
um but more commonly it's translated as clear seeing theana is translated as

97
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:44,960
clear seeing uh so this of course leads to a question what are we clearly seeing now

98
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,000
if this is called Insight Meditation what exactly are we having

99
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:57,600
insight into so this week uh we'll be answering these questions uh and more uh but by

100
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:03,880
discussing The Three core insights of the Buddha also known as the three

101
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:09,480
characteristics uh or the three marks uh and these three core insights they

102
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:14,799
include uh impermanence also known as

103
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:23,080
inconstancy uh suffering or unsatisfactoriness and lastly not self

104
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:29,720
so this week we'll spend a day exploring each of these um and we'll also talk about why

105
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:36,240
these insights are significant for our practice you why why do they matter um

106
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:43,120
and namely um they're important because they facilitate letting go um and this

107
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:48,679
Letting Go it releases craving and it frees us of the causes of suffering so

108
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:54,519
it's insight into the three characteristics that facilitates the end of suffering the end of

109
00:30:54,519 --> 00:31:01,559
duka um and what we're letting go of by the way uh is our greed hatred and

110
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:08,679
delusion um when these these sources of suffering are released um then beautiful

111
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:14,639
qualities of mind can come forth um you qualities like kindness

112
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:22,000
compassion uh joy happiness patience equinity these sorts of states can arise

113
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,399
uh more easily so the Buddha said that um this freedom is available for all of

114
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:34,080
us um and he gave us practices to realize this possibility for

115
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:42,440
ourselves so this week we'll talk about um one of the practices for how to get there um and one of the ways we can put

116
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:48,639
uh conditions in place that support Insight that support Awakening so we'll talk about the ways that

117
00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:56,519
samadi collected and stable mind can support Insight um and I just want to um rewind

118
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:02,679
for a second there because mentioned um putting supportive conditions in place

119
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:08,760
and this uh this point is of particular interest to me um because many of us

120
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:14,000
don't realize that our daily meditation practice is a condition for awakening as

121
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:21,120
a supportive condition for awakening um many of us have received meditation instruction um maybe to pay

122
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:29,000
attention to the breath how we did in our meditation today um but not everyone has an understanding of how uh how that

123
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,279
simple practice can lead to Insight uh it's not always clear how following the

124
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:42,200
breath can result in a heart and mind that's uh completely free from stress and discontent so during this series

125
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:47,320
we'll explore how uh this very simple practice of collecting and stabilizing

126
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:52,559
the Mind by following the breath provides an important condition for

127
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:58,440
insight um and in doing so my hope is to provide you with a like a mini Arc of

128
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:03,480
practice showing how our basic daily meditation practice when done more

129
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:10,320
intensively can open um can open into insight into the three characteristics

130
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:17,000
and how this Insight can facilitate Freedom um so I'd like to begin uh by

131
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:25,039
discussing what Insight is and how it functions um so to begin uh an Insight

132
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:30,919
is a non-conceptual experience of you're seeing uh sometimes people think about

133
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:37,039
an insight as being sort of an aha moment an aha moment um where it's like

134
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:42,320
oh like I'm really seeing the true nature of things like I'm I'm seeing the

135
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:48,320
way things really are um and this clear seeeing provides growth in

136
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:54,320
wisdom so many people associate Insight with like a flash of clarity almost like

137
00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:00,559
a strike of lightning or something like that um and sure Insight can definitely

138
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:08,919
um come about as a distinct profound Moment of clarity um but it took quite a

139
00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:15,398
while for me to learn that our insights into the three characteristics don't always happen like

140
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:22,040
that um and because most people associate Insight with a distinctive aha

141
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:28,079
moment um I'd like to offer another way that Insight can show up and this other

142
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:33,599
way it's a little quieter um a little less dramatic a little less obvious so

143
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:41,560
this less obvious form of insight uh comes simply through the way we're seeing the world Once the mind has

144
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:47,358
stabilized um Once the mind is more still and settled and collected so once

145
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:53,878
there's some concentration in the mind when some is present um so when uh the

146
00:34:53,879 --> 00:35:00,040
mind is still uh for example uh it's easier to see arising and

147
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:07,040
passing um to see things coming and going so when the mind is stable we might just be able to see impermanence

148
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:13,960
um things are rising and passing over and over and over again so we might see you sights and sounds and smells and

149
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:20,440
tastes and emotions thoughts Etc all arising and passing arising and passing

150
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:27,359
um it's kind of like when we're wearing the lens of impermanence uh we begin to see the changing nature of everything

151
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:32,400
kind of like if we put on rose-colored glasses we'd start seeing everything

152
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:39,320
with a rose toonee um so if we see impermanence for long enough from the vantage point of a very steady stable

153
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:46,839
mind we begin to understand per impermanence much more deeply and it might not seem like a big aha moment um

154
00:35:46,839 --> 00:35:53,400
we're just seeing things coming and going um but this begins to shift our understanding we're shifting from

155
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:58,960
perceiving phenomena as permanence permanent and fixed and changing to

156
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:05,119
being in flux uh and when we have the wisdom that everything changes we're

157
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:10,160
much less likely to cling to it we're much less likely to take refuge in it uh

158
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,440
we're much less likely to relate to it as uh I me or

159
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:22,680
M all to say um an Insight can be very obvious and traumatic but it doesn't

160
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:29,599
have to be it can be very uh subtle um it and it can R uh gradually

161
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:34,720
just simply through our way of seeing when uh the mind is

162
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:40,440
collected uh there's a quote from Suzuki roshi where he's he's talking about

163
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:47,720
progress in practice um he's not talking about Insight per se um but I think the

164
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:52,839
quote actually applies nicely to how Insight functions so uh he's talking about

165
00:36:52,839 --> 00:37:00,280
progress on the path and he says um it's not like progress on the path it's not like going out in a shower as in like a

166
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:06,760
rain shower uh in which you know when you get wet in a fog you do not know

167
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:13,799
when you're getting wet but as you keep walking you get wet little by

168
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:20,560
little so sometimes um an Insight is like stepping out in a downpour and we

169
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:27,599
do have a dramatic experience of being soaked by insight and we very much know it when it happens but sometimes our

170
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:33,119
sites are a little more like walking in the Mist like walking in the fog um much

171
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:40,680
more subtle we're just seeing a rising and passing doesn't seem particularly special but over time it shifts our

172
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:46,680
understanding it doesn't feel like it's raining out um we don't know we're getting wet but if we're walking in the

173
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:51,839
Mist little by little the mind's being transformed um and over time if we walk

174
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:57,240
in the Mist long enough we're drenched so insights can happen in both ways um

175
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:03,359
both in more obvious ways and in more subtle ways where we might not even realize we're being

176
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:10,839
transformed so as we Embark in a few days of talking about these core insights of the Buddha um you don't need

177
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:16,680
to strain or strive to make something special happen um some people think if

178
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:22,119
they strive hard enough and insight will pop out or something like that so um uh

179
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:28,480
so don't do that to yourself um really efforting to make something happen

180
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,680
uh more often than not it can be aggravate aggravating and um and

181
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:40,000
disappointing and I don't want you to fall victim to this uh so I'd like to offer something that can help temper the

182
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,119
tendency to turn your meditation into a project sometimes when people learn about the three characteristics um their

183
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:52,240
meditation becomes a project and that's not so useful um so uh I'd like to say

184
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:58,079
something about conditionality um our our practice it has a lot to do with

185
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,720
putting certain conditions in place when the conditions are there then the path

186
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:09,240
of practice unfolds so the primary insights of Insight Meditation are

187
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:15,359
revealed when we put the appropriate conditions in place um and there are many conditions

188
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:21,200
that are supportive and I EMP emphasize this so it's clear that we can't force

189
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:26,760
Insight with our will uh we can't command it we can't muscle it to be here

190
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:32,000
um we're we're in a process with our practice we're in a process of allowing

191
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,480
the Dharma to grow in our heart um if we're growing a plant for example we

192
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:44,040
can't pull on the stem to make it grow faster instead what we can do is provide

193
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:51,280
supportive conditions for a plant to grow so if we're growing a plant supportive conditions are things like um

194
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:58,000
Sunshine water good soil and likewise in our meditation practice uh we can

195
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:05,760
provide supportive conditions like uh Faith uh contentment uh somat or

196
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:11,520
stability um and we can supply these conditions but we don't control when our

197
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:18,200
seeds germinate in the same way we don't control when Insight arises so Insight

198
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:27,680
it happens naturally on its own time uh when we put the appropriate conditions in place so tomorrow uh I'll be talking

199
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:34,359
about one of the primary conditions for insight uh the condition of stability or

200
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:39,880
somat and I'll also be talking about conditions that support somebody uh

201
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:45,839
itself uh so in addition to kind of exploring how to cultivate sombody or

202
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:50,960
concentration um we'll talk about how it functions to support clear seeing how it

203
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:57,560
how it functions to support Insight um so I hope this has given you a lay of

204
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:03,319
the land uh for what's to come and provided you with an introdu an

205
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:10,160
introduction to the topic of insight um I look forward to seeing you tomorrow

206
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:15,520
for an exploration of samadi have a wonderful day thank you for prioritizing

207
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:20,839
your practice and being here take care
