1
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,440
so my friends

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,240
we continue with this anapanasati

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,560
and the topic is the

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,960
14th step one trains oneself

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,320
breathing breathing in observing

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,840
fading away or a different translation

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,280
is

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,760
one trains breathing in observing

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,200
fading away observing

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,000
dispassion

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,559
and in this word translated as

12
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,239
dispassion

13
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:58,719
uh the word is v raga v-i-r-a-g-a

14
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,199
uh you know it doesn't quite work for

15
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,559
some english speakers

16
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,400
because over time the word passion has

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,520
acquired many positive associations and

18
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,280
connotations definitions

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,159
in english in some circles and the

20
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,159
original i think the original meaning of

21
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,320
it that the passion of christ

22
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,640
where it meant suffering is kind of lost

23
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,320
but i think still there's remnants in

24
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,000
english that the passion

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,840
can have negative connotations you know

26
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,720
it's a is a source of suffering so

27
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,479
uh you know someone say someone has a

28
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,079
passion for power or

29
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,040
passion for sex or a passion for

30
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,240
you know something you know that it's an

31
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,759
intense engagement

32
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,280
in something and intense engagement

33
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,159
can be um very painful

34
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,000
so the um so i want to talk a little bit

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,960
about this uh

36
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,040
dispassion this uh b raga

37
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,680
uh maybe in with a indirect way

38
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,160
so buddhism is often considered a

39
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,000
religion

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,920
and once it's called a religion it's

41
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,200
reasonable for people to

42
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,360
try to understand what are the

43
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,640
fundamental tenets

44
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,760
and beliefs of this religion and in

45
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,319
doing that

46
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,440
it's kind of looking at the

47
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,440
generalizations just being universal

48
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,760
statements about things

49
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,520
and and so one of the universal

50
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,480
statements

51
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,480
is that buddhism emphasizes that

52
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,599
everything is

53
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,319
impermanent or inconstant usually people

54
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,640
say everything's impermanent

55
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,000
and then we have this universal

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,480
statement and then we're contending with

57
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,160
this universal statement like is this

58
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,040
really true

59
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,160
and this is always the case and and this

60
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,040
seems like you know

61
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,360
maybe rather depressing way of seeing

62
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,040
everything or all kinds of reactions to

63
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,840
this

64
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,519
almost like a philosophical statement

65
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,440
general statement

66
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,360
as if it's you know some universal truth

67
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,599
that buddhism teaches

68
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,280
and so looking at this using a universal

69
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,959
statement says

70
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,560
yes you know they understand buddhism is

71
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,239
one approach

72
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,519
i think the the practice approach to

73
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,200
understanding buddhism

74
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,040
is not to understand buddhism in the

75
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,319
abstract

76
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,680
but not begin there but to begin with

77
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,879
oneself

78
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,879
and one's own experience and

79
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,239
and so to the degree to which buddhism

80
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,560
emphasizes the possibility of being free

81
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,239
from suffering

82
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,959
then we begin with ourselves and look

83
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:37,519
what is

84
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,640
um the suffering

85
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,200
here that i have what's my pain

86
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,640
emotional pain

87
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,280
what's happening here and they say it's

88
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,959
possibly free of it

89
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,599
well how could i become free of it what

90
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,920
does it take

91
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,599
and um and in and in this very personal

92
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,560
kind of

93
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,840
exploration and feeling and being here

94
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,920
then buddhism says well if you really

95
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,959
look carefully at your experience

96
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,200
you'll see that there's a very close

97
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,480
connection

98
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,040
to the experience of

99
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,919
inconstancy change transiency

100
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,160
impermanence

101
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,440
and our ability to ease up from

102
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,040
our suffering to soften it to

103
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,320
calm it down even to have it fade away

104
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:30,560
and

105
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,919
disappear and so we see then

106
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,120
in this kind of going from this

107
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,120
direction where personally

108
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,960
the purpose of seeing and constancy

109
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,360
is not to have some universal theory and

110
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,600
belief and philosophy about

111
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,720
life but rather it's a pragmatic

112
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,919
practical idea that

113
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,440
that in the observation of change and

114
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,800
inconstancy

115
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,160
this is an antidote this is a medicine

116
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,080
for what buddhism calls suffering

117
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,560
and there's something that eases up when

118
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,000
we can really kind of

119
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,080
feel the flow and be in the current of

120
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,360
change

121
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,479
and whether impermanence and constancy

122
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,639
is a universal philosophical universal

123
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,000
metaphysical

124
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,720
concept or other is really besides the

125
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,720
point

126
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,919
it's the point is that we're pointing to

127
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,160
in constancy and permanence because of

128
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,120
its value

129
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,560
and helping us loosen up lighten up

130
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,639
free up the places we get caught

131
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,400
and uh and that's enough we don't have

132
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,680
to then make it a big

133
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,320
leap of philosophy to make a universe

134
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,919
versatile claim about

135
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,800
now i know something about you know the

136
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,880
fundamental nature of the universe the

137
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,840
physics of

138
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,440
physics of the universe that everything

139
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,240
is impermanent and changing all the time

140
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,720
it's an interesting idea but that idea

141
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,160
is not really what

142
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,759
you know buddhist practice is about

143
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,360
so so but as we see things

144
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,520
shifting and changing and transitory

145
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,440
nature of phenomenon

146
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,600
and we get more interested in the

147
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,440
process of change

148
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,560
the process of inconstancy than we are

149
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,360
with the

150
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,639
content of our thoughts content of our

151
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,919
feelings

152
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,080
many times we're focused on the meaning

153
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,440
of things or

154
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,560
the content the purpose the what's

155
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,680
really you know the

156
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,080
ideas and the particularity of what is

157
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,240
going on

158
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,120
but in a sense at this point in

159
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,600
anapanasati

160
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,960
we're stepping back and in particular

161
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,319
what we're thinking is not that

162
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,720
important just to see the thinking

163
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,600
itself

164
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,840
is an inconstant phenomena it comes and

165
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,120
goes

166
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,319
probably you've had some of your

167
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,000
thoughts repeatedly they've come and

168
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,599
gone for

169
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,599
days and weeks months years and they

170
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,199
just come and they go and after a while

171
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,280
if you see how much they come in to go

172
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,800
maybe you ease up about it

173
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,120
and so then um

174
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,080
so then uh

175
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,560
and also with our emotions sometimes the

176
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,479
meaning of the emotions the story around

177
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:15,280
them

178
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,360
even the emotion itself what emotion it

179
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,560
is and what it means to have that

180
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,919
emotion and how it

181
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,000
reflects back on ourselves as a human

182
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,400
being comes into play

183
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,440
and but at some point meditation we

184
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,240
shift from

185
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,080
all that complication to not even

186
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,120
caring whether it's sadness or joy

187
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,080
but rather tuning into how the process

188
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,120
of how it

189
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,759
it is a shifting and changing and

190
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,280
morphing and

191
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,400
and moving and

192
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,039
coming in and out of existence and all

193
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,280
the how attention awareness picks it up

194
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,199
and puts it down gets distracted by the

195
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,639
train whistle

196
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,639
and for a moment is not sad because it's

197
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,160
just a train whistle

198
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,759
and then we pick up then we're aware of

199
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,400
sadness again it's that is arisen

200
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,879
and then we hear more more whistles and

201
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,639
you know it's all this kind of going and

202
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,400
coming and going

203
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,879
and it's that coming and going that

204
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,720
begins to loosen up

205
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,360
it's like it's like a lubricant that

206
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,319
begins

207
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,440
unsticking the ways in which

208
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,520
we are kind of uncontrollably

209
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,120
caught in our emotions

210
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,240
or in our activity and our motivations

211
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,159
so and one of those is raga and raga

212
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,518
can be translated as passion or lust

213
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,200
but it's translated as lust some people

214
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,360
feel like it limits it too much to

215
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,560
sexual

216
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,760
passion and um but one way of it's

217
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,880
uncontrollable

218
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,959
the one definition in the poly tech

219
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,560
society dictionary

220
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,160
is uncontrolled excitement

221
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,519
so there's something about i like to

222
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,279
think of it as driveness when there's a

223
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,880
driveness

224
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,640
to our uh draw you know to our drives a

225
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,800
driveness we're driven

226
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,480
by lust driven by greed

227
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,399
driven by hatred and ill will

228
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,080
and there's some way in which something

229
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,240
has taken over control and we're not in

230
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,519
control anymore

231
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,839
this power of that level of passion and

232
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,160
um

233
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,320
describing the way i the way i do it

234
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,000
seems kind of dramatic

235
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,760
but in all kinds as we get quieter and

236
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,200
quieter in the mind

237
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,360
we see the subtler and subtler ways in

238
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,800
which we're caught in the grip

239
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,560
of certain driveness anybody who's been

240
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,560
to meditates tend to see that

241
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,640
you know that how it's surprisingly how

242
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,720
much we get swept away in our thoughts

243
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,279
or

244
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,040
pulled into our thoughts caught in our

245
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,680
thoughts that represents a little bit of

246
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,120
a kind of uncontrolled excitement or

247
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,760
interest or engagement

248
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,519
as we settle back into

249
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,519
into just observing we can see

250
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,640
that this doesn't serve us to be

251
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,120
involved in this uncontrolled drivenness

252
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,640
and caughtness and

253
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,160
preoccupation and so there starts to be

254
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,839
coming this process

255
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,399
of disinterest losing interest and

256
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,320
continuous doing that i've had the same

257
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,079
thoughts for months now

258
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,560
i'm not interested in doing it anymore i

259
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,320
have the same preoccupation with certain

260
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,920
emotions and feeling as if they're the

261
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,600
most important thing

262
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,079
and i'm not so interested in anymore and

263
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,519
i don't want to give much more attention

264
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,320
to these things

265
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,320
i've given so much attention to them

266
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,839
i've been kind of driven to pay

267
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:36,800
attention to my

268
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,600
anxiety and i think it's okay to put the

269
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,360
anxiety to the side and

270
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,440
i know i'm anxious but i don't have to

271
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,360
be so driven by it and

272
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,760
i can ease up i can just observe it i

273
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,120
cannot be so

274
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,480
involved or entangled with it

275
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,320
and so the movement to being non-driven

276
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,040
movement being no the dropping of

277
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,959
compulsion

278
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,240
is this uh thing called v raga this

279
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,680
fading away this dispassion and

280
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,920
it's very closely connected to freedom

281
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,920
it is a kind of freedom

282
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,720
and after a while we begin appreciating

283
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,200
that

284
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,200
freedom is sweet

285
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,360
freedom is a breath of fresh air freedom

286
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,839
is uh a kind of joy and delight and

287
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,360
vitality and

288
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,800
a kind of health a healthiness

289
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,399
and so to begin to feel that be have a

290
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,880
feeling for a sense of freedom

291
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,760
as we observe there's freedom in the

292
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,000
observing

293
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,320
and that freedom the observing is a

294
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,240
guide a support

295
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,760
to lose interest or lose our

296
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,880
preoccupation with our drivenness with

297
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,440
the things that we're caught in

298
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,160
and so there's this fading away of

299
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,680
compulsion

300
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,079
of a a um

301
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,200
that a process that some translators

302
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,440
will translate as dispassion

303
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,440
a movement towards this passion towards

304
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,720
freedom

305
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,600
the word viraga is a celebrated term in

306
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,560
india

307
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,880
more often than not it's a kind of a

308
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,000
kind it's

309
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,279
in in to liberation itself

310
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,480
the freedom itself and um

311
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,920
the end of raga the end of compulsion

312
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,279
drivenness lust in

313
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,760
all its forms passion and all its

314
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,079
negative forms

315
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,360
and and it comes when a peaceful it can

316
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,880
come with a peaceful way

317
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,519
i like to think of this whole process as

318
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,720
a process of

319
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,959
settling into an ease easing up

320
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,560
relaxing softening fading away

321
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,240
into not not into nothing so much

322
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,279
but fading into a peaceful happy

323
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,760
healthy liberated way of being

324
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,880
so breathing in

325
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,639
observing fading away breathing out

326
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,839
observing this passion as it comes along

327
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,320
here

328
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,160
so um thank you

329
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,760
and we'll continue with this and

330
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,000
i i believe i

331
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,680
apologize i didn't check my calendar but

332
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,440
i believe that on friday

333
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,959
we could do another session where

334
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,639
afterwards if you want to stay and ask

335
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,760
some questions

336
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,199
that was very nice last friday and and

337
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,279
as we're doing the santa panasati maybe

338
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,320
it's nice to

339
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,920
for you having more questions about this

340
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:56,240
so thank you all very much
