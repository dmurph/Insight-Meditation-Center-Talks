1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,800
you know there's that that saying uh if you think you're Enlighten you

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,880
know go home spend some time with family for the weekend or something right but

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:21,359
the original saying is if you think you're enlightened leave 2 hours early for a 30

4
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,039
minute commute be styed by an entire closure of

5
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:34,600
Market Street sit in a basically a traffic

6
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,760
parking lot for 90 minutes while people dressed as Ken and Barbie

7
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:46,039
and Super Mario Kart just lap you you

8
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:51,520
know and and remember that the last time you

9
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,320
were supposed to be here you didn't put it in your calendar and completely

10
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:04,080
forgot it and come from a lineage of guilt prone

11
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,080
people

12
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:19,640
and I did okay maybe equinom like C see miness maybe

13
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,439
um but I'm uh happy to be here now

14
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,439
so um

15
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:41,720
okay so the uh the the but

16
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:50,119
uh placed uh an N anich at the center of

17
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:57,000
experience and um we said the world trembles in all

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,920
directions anicha is um is usually rendered as impermanence

19
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:11,840
and connotes two things in that way the the impermanence of people places things

20
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,959
that were all ruled by finitude and all it's

21
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,640
all breaking apart and um and so on the one hand

22
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:32,200
there's the this this level of anich the the dying is in the being

23
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:38,319
born and then there's another level of anich which is kind of like the micro

24
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:45,599
micro experience of of change of change being a kind of

25
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:53,440
Gateway for for understanding for certain kind of insight Pathways anich

26
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:00,920
figures prominently where we're no longer focused on people places things

27
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:10,319
the anich of all of this but um focused on the the changing of all of all

28
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:19,599
phenomena and in the arising the passing and so this is the n rendered as

29
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,920
impermanent but also sometimes rendered as uh as un

30
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:32,519
uncertainty uncertainty and it strikes me kind of a

31
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:39,680
testament to the the the sort of Genius of the tradition that uncertainty was

32
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:46,159
was placed at the heart of all things and now Millennia

33
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:54,519
later in you know in philosophy and science math statistics it's like

34
00:03:54,519 --> 00:04:02,040
uncertainty is uh Central in you know know in epistemology

35
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:08,040
the philosophy of knowledge how we know uncertainty is there in all of our

36
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:15,280
statistical understanding uncertainty is there in in the understanding of our

37
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,680
brain our brain basically coping with uncertainty Moment by moment doing what

38
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:28,000
it can to uh reduce uncertainty to not be

39
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,840
startled and so this kind of desperate tussle with what the Buddha

40
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:44,520
highlighted in moral philosophy um we we all have our views about what's

41
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:51,840
what's right we may not adhere to them all the time but we have our views about what's right we have to have our views

42
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:58,880
about what's right and yet how do we essentially hedge against moral

43
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:05,800
uncertainty how do we hedge against the permanent possibility of being

44
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:12,680
wrong not merely about uh this or that but about goodness

45
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:19,039
itself about what goodness entails so this is Toby or his

46
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:26,199
colleagues will M CasCal um every in a in a book on moral

47
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:34,639
uncertainty every generation in the past has committed TR tremendous moral wrongs on the basis of false moral views moral

48
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,400
atrocities were of course driven in part by the self-interest of those in power

49
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:47,600
but they were also enabled and strengthened by the common sense moral views of society at at the time about

50
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,880
which what groups were worthy of moral concern given this dismal track record

51
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,360
it would be extremely surprising if we were the first generation in human

52
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,960
history to to have even broadly the correct moral world view it's a

53
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:09,479
Paramount importance therefore to figure out which action Society takes as common

54
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:16,720
sensical permissible today we should really think of as barbaric we think and they go on to

55
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,400
conclude we think therefore that considerations of moral uncertainty the value of moral

56
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,160
information should lead us to conclude that further research is one of the most

57
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,440
important moral priorities of our time ideally one day we will have resolved

58
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:41,080
the Deep moral questions that we face and we'll feel confident that we have found moral truth in the meantime

59
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:47,198
however we need to do the best we can given our

60
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:57,800
uncertainty so what what what's a kind of wise relationship to this what's a

61
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,759
wise relationship to uncertainty

62
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,800
um beron Russell said the whole problem of the world is that fools and Fanatics

63
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:17,599
are always so certain of themselves but wiser people are so full of

64
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:23,759
doubts the Buddha said that um one of the Wellsprings

65
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:30,039
of of uh of our suffering is attachment to

66
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:38,840
views which is attachment to views and it strikes me that uh in some

67
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:44,720
way our our attachment to views are a kind of defense against

68
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:51,199
anicha defense against uncertainty and

69
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,879
nuance and the safety of the known the safety of our categories our moral

70
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,800
certainties and self-righteousness so all aided and EDD by a kind of

71
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,879
clinging to view and this plays out in small

72
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:13,479
personal ways and in global ways in our politics in

73
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:20,120
our Judicial System the Supreme Court of just starting with a conclusion and then

74
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,199
rationalizing your way to it seeking confirmatory

75
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,840
evidence uh after the conclusions reached

76
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,399
and certainty is um it's a very dangerous kind of state it it's

77
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:43,080
certainty is a kind of it's almost like a gateway drug for the other kesas for

78
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:49,360
the other forces of uh suffering greed hate

79
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,880
delusion and so much of the harm we we do so much

80
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:01,680
of the harm we cause to ourselves and to others a function of of a certain kind

81
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:08,160
of um certainty certainty we we don't tend to cause so

82
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:14,800
much harm from the perspective of um of

83
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:21,360
nuance and so all of this clinging is very uh kind of understandable because

84
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:28,760
as an animal anicha feels like Risk anich sense of not knowing it feels

85
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:34,680
exactly like like Risk and information is sometimes

86
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:40,920
described defined as kind of like the reduction of uncertainty information is

87
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:47,800
the reduction of uncertainty I hear a sound I don't know

88
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:54,600
what it is I look over to see oh it's a a person or an animal or whatever right

89
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:00,720
there's information there's a reduction of uncertainty

90
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,760
and there's a you know a kind of prominent model of our brain where our

91
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:14,600
brain is is our brain function revolves around kind of desperate e efforts to

92
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:21,200
reduce uncertainty Moment by moment the kind of brain is an

93
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,480
uncertainty management machine or the brain is a prediction machine trying to

94
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:34,640
guess where what the tra trajectory of this moment is if I can discern that I

95
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,760
don't have I can navigate I can I don't have to be surprised startled by the

96
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:46,200
next moment so I keep compulsive sense of orientation what is this where does it

97
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:52,519
Point what's the vector of this moment

98
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:58,399
and often clinging to view is is a is um

99
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:06,040
is a way we try to navigate uncertainty uh so we sort of Are We rely

100
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:11,720
we could say on the past on Karma as a way of understanding what's

101
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:17,240
next but that is not the way of Dharma

102
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:23,519
exactly secret of life Oscar wild says is to appreciate the pleasure of being

103
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,920
terribly terribly deceived yeah the pleasure of being

104
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:37,160
terribly deceived and on the Dharma path

105
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:43,000
we we um we come to love our mistakes not

106
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:51,240
merely to be unashamed by them but actually to Delight to Revel in them our

107
00:11:51,240 --> 00:12:00,120
mistakes and it is if you can kind of get over the egoic blow you know and

108
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:08,959
the the defensiveness of it it is exhilarating in the way that wild

109
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:16,120
suggests to discover one's wrongness to find out that we've been

110
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:22,720
deceived to step out of self-deception the lot of the Dharma path is the path

111
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:29,839
of stepping out of self-deception the kind of moral pities and self serving

112
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:36,560
autobiographical tales with which we've kind of uh hummed oursel to sleep

113
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:46,240
forever you know and um the traffic's still in me a little

114
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:58,880
bit so when you when you come to uh come to

115
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:06,519
love love love yourself like really deeply really deeply not loving yourself

116
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:13,639
for some reason just loving yourself um

117
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:19,560
are are the mechanisms of self-deception

118
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:28,079
um uh it's no longer a cause for shame but actual kind of exhilaration

119
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,360
so delusion is described in different ways here I'm kind of talking about it

120
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,560
as clinging attachment to view or uh delusion as being a function of clinging

121
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:47,240
to view the clinging like seals in some

122
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:52,800
delusion um some teachers talk about delusion as merely just being lost in

123
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,040
thought you know the the kind of um the

124
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:05,920
moment when the the bubble of discursive thinking collapses and you realize you've been

125
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:14,360
you know in a different world not at IMC not and um and and it was deluded to be

126
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:22,920
focused on some to be living in the world defined by your thought but it's it's non- delusion to

127
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:33,240
wake up to okay this moment just being here and um and so uh that's one way

128
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,279
delusion is described another is there's the kind of diluted type you know the

129
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:44,920
greed hate and delusion types um some researchers say even at

130
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:50,040
the level of a single celled organism Behavior must necessarily fall into one

131
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:56,199
of three possible categories move towards approach move away withdraw or

132
00:14:56,199 --> 00:15:01,639
neither no response these three basic options cannot be

133
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:07,519
reduced further and therefore would seem to represent the most parsimonious

134
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:14,199
description of Behavioral Tendencies approach withdraw no response

135
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:22,720
greed is approach aversion withdrawal delusion no response right and so from

136
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,240
this perspective Avers greed and aversion or hatred are very strong

137
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,959
motivational States you know strong motivational States we know exactly what

138
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:41,120
we want we know exactly what we want to go away delusion is characterized by the

139
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:49,240
absence of a strong motivational stance and the kind of lack of awareness

140
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:56,000
of pleasant unpleasant neutral um in some ways is a blessing but also it

141
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,560
because it actually is it's sort of like some kind of relative of equinity where

142
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:09,639
we feel less compelled by a you know a sense of urgency Moment by

143
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:14,880
moment but it's also associated with um

144
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:21,480
troublemaking decisions uh kind of manifest as indecisiveness we don't know

145
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:30,440
what to listen to inside of ourselves it's kind of all noise no signal

146
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:39,040
another kind of way of understanding delusion is that um there's a kind of

147
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:45,959
more pervasive sense of it which is something closer to ignorance

148
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:52,920
of and ignorance is generally said to be about not understanding the four noble

149
00:16:52,920 --> 00:17:00,839
truths that there is suffering that there is a cause that there is an end that there is a path

150
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,558
um but I would say more generally ignorance I associate with ignorance of

151
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:15,199
like just losing the plot losing the plot very easy to lose the plot in a

152
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:21,480
human life very easy as maybe our default position is we're losing the

153
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,798
plot we've we've taken our eyes off what

154
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:35,919
actually matters so um here a delusion is a kind of basic

155
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:45,080
state of confusion of bewilderment and

156
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:52,440
um and so greed greed feels like kind of bottomless hunger the the hole in the

157
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,919
heart that one's desperately trying to fill and aversion is the heart's just

158
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:06,919
unfire you know it's liken to cauldron you know water boiling over

159
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:12,960
right um grade the whole aversion the fire and delusion what does that feel

160
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:19,559
like the delusion feels exactly like the truth you know we don't differentiate

161
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:26,039
our delusion from our wisdom they're if we knew if we could do that we would no

162
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:32,280
longer be diluted we would put it down right but we live in this kind of

163
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:38,240
strange way basically in a kind of Katherine Schultz says we live in almost

164
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:44,600
a state of assuming omniscience you know of kind of

165
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:50,120
pervasive all knowing because we we just

166
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:56,080
don't we don't know what we don't know and um the Dharma paath is very much

167
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:04,760
about unknown unknowns know unknown unknowns not known unknowns unknown

168
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:10,880
unknowns and so um we we talk a lot

169
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:18,240
about uh the kind of uh epidemic of self-doubt um

170
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:25,480
but from a psychological perspective um overconfidence is a far

171
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:33,720
more pernicious actor on This Global stage it's one researcher called it the

172
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:39,600
mother of all psychological biases over confidence you

173
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:47,120
know and so how do we live with the permanent possibility of being

174
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:52,919
wrong uh this entails a kind of um a

175
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:59,919
commitment to live life on a as a kind of continuous feedback loop where we we

176
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:08,039
we are taking in we are relying on uh relying on the kind of the the

177
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:14,200
things and the people and the the problems we run into in our life as a

178
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:21,720
way of Illuminating that which we do not understand yet and sometimes it's only

179
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:30,159
in the collisions that happen you know with with others uh that we can begin to

180
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:36,360
understand the ways in which the provincial qualities of our view the

181
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:42,960
places where our delusion lurks you know because it's it's so unnoticed in our

182
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:49,840
life and yet it will have impacts on others it will we will misconstrue

183
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:57,039
others we will fail to understand to anticipate to predict and we will cause

184
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:02,640
problems and so we stay open to um

185
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:09,720
to uh the kind of surprises and the ways in which um our delusion manifests we

186
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:16,919
stay open with humility to this kind of feedback loop that is Life Giving

187
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:23,400
receiving growing

188
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:31,600
and there are there are limits to our knowing there will always be more to

189
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:37,440
know and as a kind of image of this I I saw this

190
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:45,000
astronomical thing where it's like they're right but it's a good metaphor it's like we con currently see a sphere

191
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,000
around us extending 46 billion light years in all directions it's known as

192
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:59,200
the observable universe light from galaxies beyond the sphere hasn't yet had time to reach us

193
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,240
on our leading cosmological theory the rate at which new galaxies will become

194
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:10,559
visible will Decline and those currently more than 63 billion light years away

195
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:16,760
will never become visible from Earth we could call this region the region within

196
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:23,880
this distance as the eventually observable universe accelerating expansion also

197
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:29,640
puts a limit on what we can ever affect if today you shine a a ray of light into

198
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:35,360
space it could reach any Galaxy that's currently less than 16 B billion year

199
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:43,400
light years away but galaxies further than this are being pulled away so quickly that neither light nor anything

200
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:50,880
else we might send could ever affect them I found that kind of uh beautiful

201
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:58,600
that like the eventually observable universe and then there's something beyond that you know that's like will

202
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:06,600
forever be out of our reach and that is a little how delusion feels to me you

203
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:13,720
know so there's a a kind of classic experiment where people were given

204
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:21,200
identical pairs of this is many years ago you know given identical pairs of clothing and asked to pick out their

205
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:27,440
favorite and people would do it they would say well this one is you know I like this one better the Fabric's softer

206
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:34,120
or whatever and um and sometimes there's kind of a

207
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:39,880
model of confabulation confabulation usually in the context of

208
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:45,240
neurological disease but where um we

209
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:52,799
give rationals and reasons for having done something but they're completely untethered to the actual causes of why

210
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:59,600
we did what we did and yet we believe it we're not lying we're not lying Ing and saying

211
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:05,400
like oh well I just put that there because I thought it would you know need it for later no no no it's like you

212
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:13,039
whatever you um we just make it make it up we it's confabulated right and and

213
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:19,760
sometimes it's called on honest lying you know there's no intentional sense of

214
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:28,559
deception or anything but and yet um we we concoct fabricate rationals for why

215
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:36,919
we did what we did why we believe what we believe and from a Buddhist perspective confabulation is not merely

216
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:46,520
confined to neurodegenerative disease it is our way of life in a deep sense

217
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:56,480
confabulating you know and a lot of what we are doing is uh essentially kind of

218
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:03,880
rationalizing or defilements The KES say making them look

219
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:09,960
dignified and our mind is um is very

220
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:16,559
very uh slippery and many of our you know it's like many of our habits and

221
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:22,360
the the reasons we give for our lives are often fundamentally different from

222
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:29,559
the causes and reasons are the best we can do we can't perceive cause ity exactly

223
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:35,080
in this way we just do our best to narrate it to understand

224
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:42,000
it um and all we have at some level is what is conscious even though there's a

225
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,240
a billion things happening beneath the radar of Consciousness

226
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:54,880
right and so in a way we we've become too satisfied with the stories we tell

227
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:01,600
about ourselves the wise of our life why I did this why I believe that why I want

228
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,799
this why we feel the way we do and so

229
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:12,960
part of delusion is about becoming more and more sensitive more and more

230
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:19,960
sensitive to the ways in which we confabulate and we pull a kind of fast

231
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:29,760
one on ourselves yeah the ways in which we lull ourself into our kind of um

232
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:35,279
you know Pious certainties and so

233
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:41,960
we we have to um we develop some measure of Courage for that because it's

234
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:49,080
actually kind of humiliating to see how easy it is to pull a fast one on

235
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:56,720
ourselves how easy it is and so we're getting very sensitive

236
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:02,600
to the kind of subtle movements of our mind how do we begin to perceive that

237
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:08,640
which we do not yet perceive and

238
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:15,399
so part of how we begin to uproot delusion is we become uh radically

239
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:21,240
accepting at the cognitive level we befriend all of the dooka in us we

240
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:27,760
befriend all of the kind of our quirkiness and defilements we actually

241
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:35,080
know longer try to sanitize them as something else it's not morally it's not

242
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:41,880
blaming ourselves morally for it you know it's not it's not this kind of you

243
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:47,640
know um yeah this moralism about our inner life there's a kind of Innocence

244
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:53,480
that animates even our greed hate and delusion we want to really actually feel

245
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:59,919
our way into that otherwise it becomes a kind of object of shame it becomes a

246
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:07,440
something like a testament about some defect at the core of our being and that

247
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:13,480
is will lead to many distortions of you

248
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:19,320
requires us to rationalize in order to keep a sense

249
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:27,120
of dignity but the invitation is actually to befriend all of the kind

250
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:34,480
of you know um all of the all of the grizzled bits

251
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:41,880
in our kind of heart you know otherwise we we um we become ashamed and when

252
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:49,039
we're ashamed we hide we want to get sensitive to our

253
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:57,080
body when we kind of lose our bodily awareness and become embedded in

254
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:03,360
narrative when our words our thoughts our language

255
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:12,519
when that starts to get kind of like a more and more remote from our ex embodied

256
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:19,240
experience you know this is a sign and so we we start to get more and

257
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:26,559
more sensitive how do I stay how do I speak and live in an experience near way

258
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:33,919
rather than being as Gil describes like in those concentric circles of our being

259
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:39,600
and the outermost you know circle is very

260
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:46,360
elaborate mental proliferation and Frameworks we start to like okay I can

261
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:52,600
feel there's some alienation in those words I can't it's almost like I can't

262
00:29:52,600 --> 00:30:00,440
Channel my body into those words they're just they're out in some other

263
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:06,399
orbit and once we get out into that orbit we lose contact with this kind of

264
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:14,120
like basic embodied experience and we can tell ourselves

265
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:19,519
anything when we get out to that orbit and we'll believe

266
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:27,399
anything so we have to actually have come back a lot to to V to to to feeling

267
00:30:27,399 --> 00:30:37,799
feeling as the kind of engine of uh the engine of uh so many of our

268
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:45,240
stories and philosophies and political orientations can be just the exhaust

269
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:53,000
coming off of an unconscious relationship to affect you know I don't like how this

270
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,760
feels you know uh and we miss that

271
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:06,639
and then but out of that friction arises a million things and you can just live

272
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:13,279
in a kind of prison of One's Own delusion as

273
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:20,200
if that's what matters to begin to actually clarify delusion we want to

274
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:28,440
come closer back to the body to the kind of urgency of affect of VNA as it

275
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:34,039
manifests in the circuits of our body and

276
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:43,360
so um equinity in other words with greed and aversion actually reduces the need

277
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:51,039
for delusion to sanitize the first two yeah and so sometimes I say like you

278
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:58,120
know um uh delusion launders our greed and our hatred

279
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:04,278
the way that delusion functions is to dignify the other

280
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:09,399
kesas and so to launder something is to take what

281
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:15,320
is you know take dirty money and make it clean we do that with our greed and our

282
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:22,039
hatred make it look like um something

283
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:28,399
dignified and so if we can have equinity with the kind of effec of current of

284
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:35,279
greed of hate uh we don't have to kind of build and

285
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:41,320
fabricate proliferate so um so

286
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:48,039
egregiously and um and so we come to uh trust the V and

287
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:57,519
are careful not to rationalize the clinging if we're going to cling okay fair enough but we don't we don't um we

288
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:04,960
don't uh pull a fast one on ourselves by calling it by another

289
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:17,000
name so this is on my mind in part because um you know just my own my my

290
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:24,880
own grappling you know with uh the world and um The Suffering of the world and

291
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:31,279
what feels very close to uh to my heart in various

292
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:36,519
ways and and the recognition that that

293
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:41,840
views are are channels into which our

294
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:47,960
greed and hatred flow our views and the the the the

295
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:55,360
questions and the issues and the pain points that are most uh ignite us are of

296
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:02,000
course what we care about but there are also those questions in that make the

297
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,760
the most frictionless channel into which our greed and hatred

298
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:14,200
flows that's what we tend to notice we notice that into which our greed and

299
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:19,760
hatred can flow and we ignore other forms of

300
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:26,358
dukka and so King uh said Justice is love in

301
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:33,520
calculation love in calculation but

302
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:39,158
um it's it's um very easy very easy to

303
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:44,720
ignore Dr King

304
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:53,919
and in those issues where there's uh no one no one to hate there's no way for us

305
00:34:53,919 --> 00:35:00,880
to channel some of our defilements um even if those issues are actually of

306
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:06,440
profound moral concern we tend to just ignore those tend to ignore those and

307
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:12,960
there are many and so the things that um we care

308
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,480
about most on the one hand we want to protect that care but the care becomes

309
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:27,079
ens snared with clinging and certainty and delusion and attachment to views and

310
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:34,680
it becom a kind of channel for our greed and our hatred and greed and hatred will

311
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:40,319
not resolve anything in a durable

312
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,040
way and

313
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:58,160
so all of this is um it's on my mind in part um

314
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:03,480
uh in a in a certain way it kind of culminates in

315
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:10,880
um some some lines from uh the uh always reliable Zade Smith writing about Israel

316
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:16,240
and Palestine last last couple weeks ago in New

317
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:23,880
Yorker she says um at the end we've arrived at the point at which I must

318
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:30,359
clearly state where I stand quote where I stand stand on the issue that is which

319
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:36,319
particular political settlement should in my own personal view occur on the

320
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:42,319
other side of a ceasefire this is the point wherein by

321
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:49,040
my stating of a position you are at once liberated into the simple pleasure of

322
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:56,119
placing me firmly on one side or another putting me over there with those who

323
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:01,560
lisp or those who don't with the ephraimites or with the people of

324
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:07,839
Gilead yes this is the point at which I stake my rhetorical flag in the

325
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:14,800
Fantastical linguistical conceptual unreal Place built with words where

326
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:21,960
rapes are minimized as needs be and the definition of genocide quied over where

327
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:28,960
the killing of babies is denied and the Precision of drones glow glorified where

328
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:35,560
histories are reconsidered or Rewritten or analogized or simply ignored and Jew

329
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:42,240
and colonialist are synonymous and Palestinian and terrorist are synonymous

330
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:50,640
and language is your accomplice an alibi in all of it language euphemized and

331
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:58,200
instrumentalized and abused put to work for your cause and only for your cause

332

naive novelist useful idiot apologist denier Ally contrarian collaborator

335
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,560
traitor inexcusable coward it is my view

336
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:33,280

337
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:40,680
