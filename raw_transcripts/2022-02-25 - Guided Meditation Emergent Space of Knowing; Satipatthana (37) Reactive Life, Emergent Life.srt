1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:09,680
so hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:20,640
so in the journey through the sati patana sutta through the buddha's teachings on

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,680
developing a heightened awareness in our lives

4
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:33,840
we're now in the second foundation and from here on out the second third and fourth

5
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,079
the practice that's emphasized is knowing

6
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,840
is to know what's happening in the earlier exercise there were other things that for the

7
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,160
first foundation there was knowing there was experiencing there was relaxing the body

8
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,520
there was clear comprehension there was a the use of the imagination

9
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:04,080
or reflection in order to connect to the part different aspects of the body

10
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,159
and but here on it just to understand or to know kavodi

11
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:16,479
translates it understands i like to translate it as to know one knows

12
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,759
and and knowing is really kind of at the heart of

13
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,880
sati of mindfulness and when we know we emphasize the

14
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,920
knowing uh sometimes it's easy to get lost or

15
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,400
focused too much on the thing that we're getting to know as if that is uh

16
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,479
the important thing and it is important and i don't want to diminish its value of really seeing clearly

17
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:50,720
but there's another side to knowing and that is that

18
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:57,920
knowing does not interfere with what is known knowing is a very simple

19
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:04,079
practice they're just knowing without judgment without a value without

20
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:11,200
criticism or without desires or aversions just know and but that that and one of the reasons

21
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:19,920
that's important is that knowing makes room in the mind for something new to arise

22
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,520
and i'll explain it this way that most much of the days that we're living

23
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:32,879
we're acting in reaction or directly in

24
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:39,920
the input the data the senses the experience that's coming we're reacting to it without a lot of

25
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:46,879
forethought or without a lot of reflection or so for example if i'm

26
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:53,680
if you're sitting or sitting uncomfortably in a chair many people will adjust themselves without thinking about they feel the discomfort and then

27
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:00,480
there's kind of an automatic to adjust themselves or we hear a sound and automatically turn towards it

28
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,599
without any kind of even awareness that we're we're thinking about it or

29
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:12,560
choosing to turn towards it or we have a pain some place in the body

30
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:19,680
and there's immediately with the in the in the wake of that pain there's aversion

31
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:26,640
we have pleasure in the body and then there's an automatic response of ah this is great i want more of this

32
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:33,840
so reactions are the actions that come kind of almost

33
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,280
automatic almost like they're triggered by the experience

34
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,360
and this can happen in the mind as well we have a particular thought

35
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,440
and certain thoughts produce a reaction and

36
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:59,200
so we have another thought another thought and much of our thinking is in some ways reactive it's it's uh it's

37
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:05,519
prompted it's catalyzed by the thought before or there's feelings internal emotions

38
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,599
and feelings we have so for example anger anger is a reactive emotion it's

39
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:17,440
it's it's an activity of response to uh something's been some things

40
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:24,320
happened that triggers it and uh so i think about something that uh someone was unkind to me

41
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:31,280
and i have a thought about it and just a thought itself it's a trigger for a reaction of i'm angry or indignant

42
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,560
or something and in that when that reactivity the

43
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,800
reaction the response is kind of immediate catalyzed by the input that comes in

44
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,240
there's no room for some deeper wellspring deeper flow

45
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,800
of our life the the free flow of our inner life flowing out

46
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:02,000
like a wellspring fountain kind of water flowing out from deep inside the earth into the into the

47
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,400
fountain into the spring and and so the knowing

48
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,440
helps us to know what's happening we see what's happening helps us to know our reactivity

49
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:21,039
but the knowing in its simplicity is making starting to make room for some wellspring something different

50
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:26,320
something to emerge from within that is not reactive

51
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:33,120
that's radically different it's almost like a pair a parrot a paradigm shift

52
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,800
in how we live our lives from being reactive responsive to the input that comes in all in all kinds of

53
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:46,160
ways including from the mind and emotions and rather than responding to input

54
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,280
we're we're allowing something to emerge

55
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,759
rather than being customers of life we're being producers of life

56
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,680
that and that's independent or free from the input that's coming all the time

57
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,600
so knowing allows for space for the emergence

58
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,520
of something inside which we don't make or create

59
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,199
that is not a catalyzed by the input that comes in from anywhere

60
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:30,800
but rather exists in a certain way independent of our judgments or ideas or theories or

61
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:40,160
memories all kinds of things so taking a comfortable alert posture

62
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,000
a posture in which we practice

63
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:53,120
knowing perhaps a knowing that's not only cognitive

64
00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:01,800
but also experiential the the way the body knows

65
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,440
gently closing the eyes

66
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,639
and without any special breathing familiarize yourself with how you're

67
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,360
breathing right now

68
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:45,680
at the end of the exhale let there be a ever so small pause in the exhale

69
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,840
so you can feel the emergence of the inhale

70
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:58,680
that's what the body does it breathes in

71
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:06,879
if you pause at the top of the inhale you'll feel the body's desire

72
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,639
to exhale the exhale emerges

73
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:31,680
and perhaps if you feel your body you feel where the body

74
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:39,719
has a almost like an urge to soften and relax

75
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,839
in the face shoulders the belly

76
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:37,720
and then centering yourself on the body's experience of breathing

77
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:44,560
seeing how you could no breathing no inhale no exhale

78
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:51,160
so you know the breathing itself you experience it you feel it

79
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:58,320
and in the knowing there's lots of room and there's

80
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:05,839
room for a kind of allowance allowing the breath to breathe itself

81
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,519
if there is attitudes connected to knowing agendas

82
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,240
see if you can relax the thinking mind

83
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,040
relax

84
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:46,040
kind of like clearing a windshield a window so you can see clearly

85
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,639
clearing the window of knowing

86
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,920
so there's only knowing of what is here

87
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,920
knowing of in-breath knowing of out-breath

88
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,760
and then as you're sitting here

89
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:32,480
what might be if you're aware of yourself globally

90
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:40,399
is your global experience of being here more on the pleasant side of things or

91
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,279
the unpleasant

92
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:58,800
in whichever it is take some moments to know it simply

93
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,800
know how you are pleasant or unpleasant or neither

94
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,639
as if it's you have permission to be this way

95
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,720
there's no need to be any different just feel how you are and recognizes it

96
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,439
generally pleasant or generally unpleasant here

97
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,360
and whichever it is do you react to it

98
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,760
do you have thoughts ideas judgments concerns

99
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:57,839
if you do you're making less room for something deeper to emerge

100
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,720
in this space that knowing creates

101
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,760
the space that awareness provides

102
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:43,000
can you find a way of being that is not reactive to anything

103
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:54,600
that allows whatever is just to be in the space of awareness

104
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,880
um

105
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:57,440
and if you look around your body and mind can you find some place

106
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,320
where there is pleasantness or pleasure

107
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:11,040
goodness that might be emergent

108
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:17,440
that arises as they're independent of

109
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:26,399
whatever you're experiencing not a reaction to anything

110
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:36,519
is there a place within of quiet of calm

111
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,720
some degree of peace

112
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,839
some kind of pleasure

113
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:06,079
that's not part of the world of reactivity of thoughts and stories and

114
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,839
what's happened to us or will happen

115
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:17,438
the place where there's feeling at home

116
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:25,280
here and now a place of pleasantness pleasure

117
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,839
however small

118
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:57,120
maybe if there is such a place you can gently breathe through it breathe with

119
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:03,760
it knowing it as you breathe

120
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:13,640
just knowing with the knowing that gives room in space

121
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,320
for the emergence

122
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:29,320
of what flows from inside the wellspring

123
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,320
letting the thinking mind become quieter

124
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:52,720
the quieter the mind becomes the more space there is

125
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,080
for this deeper emergence

126
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:11,840
of what exists free of reactivity not dependent on the inputs that come in

127
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,799
is there within you some place of

128
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:34,559
comfort or peace or warmth calmness

129
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:44,158
that seems to be independent of the world around you

130
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:53,200
maybe even independent of your ordinary feelings and thoughts

131
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,240
is there a pleasure within

132
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:11,360
that's not dependent on your ordinary sensations of the body

133
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:21,559
if you're quiet it's a pleasure that can be there even when the body is uncomfortable

134
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:50,559
a quiet pleasure that's in some ways more satisfying

135
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:55,240
than ordinary sensual pleasure

136
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:27,760
a pleasure that's better known or easier known

137
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:37,480
when there's some degree of calm and subtleness maybe near the end of a meditation

138
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,720
hmm

139
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,799
and as we come to the end of this setting

140
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:34,960
appreciating that certain emotional states

141
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,480
have its origins in the deeper wellsprings within

142
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,720
love generosity

143
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:54,880
kindness a love of honesty

144
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,960
that's easier easily eclipsed

145
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:08,960
by the reactive emotions and feelings fear and anger

146
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,440
greed

147
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:23,360
perhaps we can celebrate treasure

148
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:32,320
the emergence of the goodness within when we're quiet and peaceful

149
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:42,240
and may in this relaxed place of pleasure within the emergent

150
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:50,320
may we turn our gaze outwards

151
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,520
out into the world with its suffering and challenges

152
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,039
war and poverty

153
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:07,679
and not lose this place of love or care

154
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:13,120
generosity gaze upon the world

155
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:19,039
with love and kindness generosity

156
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,720
not eclipsed by fear and anger distress

157
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,080
maybe look upon the world with kind eyes

158
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:40,158
concerned with the welfare and happiness of others

159
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:48,640
may we in our each individual ways contribute to the welfare and happiness of this world

160
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,960
may all beings be happy

161
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,240
may all beings be safe

162
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,919
may all beings be peaceful

163
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,200
may all beings everywhere be free

164
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,389
[Music]

165
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:42,880
so continuing with the topic of the second foundation of mindfulness

166
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,840
and repeating a little bit what i said in the meditation

167
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:56,960
so the the four foundations of mindfulness

168
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,480
when you get to when we get to the second foundation the practice the activity that this

169
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:09,600
being instructed is that of knowing paganity

170
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:16,240
and uh and uh and it's and the way it's described how to know

171
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:22,240
is to just know the simplicity of the experience itself so if if there's pleasure

172
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:29,440
know it as pleasure if there's pain unpleasantness know it as unpleasantness

173
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:35,120
if there's neither know it that way and we'll see as we go to the other foundations it's that simple just know

174
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:42,960
whatever is arising know what's there and know it for itself without adding anything to it and so the

175
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,320
judgments we might have the preferences we might have just to know

176
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:54,159
and this knowing is a very significant act

177
00:32:54,159 --> 00:33:01,279
just to know and different people know different different ways some people are more cognitive some people are more somatic

178
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:07,120
knowing kind of experiencing it but whatever way you have of knowing that knows it

179
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:13,440
allows each thing to be itself without the agendas and the preferences and the

180
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,559
commentary just to know as if

181
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:25,440
as if you're allowing a flower in your garden to just grow and be there

182
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,880
or you allow a tree to just be there and just look at the tree you enjoy it you appreciate it

183
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:37,519
but it you don't say well that branch is too crooked or too many and you know something or other just a

184
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:43,039
tree and allow it to be the tree so the same thing with the natural these

185
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:50,240
are all kind of natural phenomena whatever happens to us inside and just see it as that of the moment

186
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:56,880
but the knowing is not only the purposes of knowing something

187
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:04,320
the knowing the purpose is also to discover this place in the mind that can be that simple

188
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:09,358
that that sometimes we're very accustomed almost habitually

189
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:16,320
to be reactive to the inputs to the thoughts whatever's going on being for and against searching how to be safe in

190
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:22,638
every situation searching what can we get here and how can it benefit me or how does this relate to me myself and

191
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:28,158
mine and my self-concept and there's a constant searching wanting getting

192
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:33,679
making planning reviewing that goes on that's a part of

193
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:41,118
this reactive mind that we live in and um and so this part of this wonderfulness of this

194
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:48,878
knowing is that uh we're putting to rest that that way of being we're emphasizing

195
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:55,040
we're inhabiting a different way of being in the world which is just to know

196
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,960
and that can create a tremendous amount of calm and peace because we're putting energy into the

197
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:08,480
knowing not energy into the reactivity this knowing has also the quality

198
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,680
of uh kind because of this allowing just letting things be

199
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:20,880
the knowing then begins to have feel qualities of spaciousness or peacefulness or stillness or

200
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:27,760
or acceptance or some kind of nice qualities that i like to think of as begins making

201
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,839
room for things and makes rooms for that which inside of us which is shy

202
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:40,240
or that which is easily eclipsed the by what is loud

203
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:45,920
so what is loud oftentimes is is desires greeds fears

204
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:53,440
aversions resentments envies we have all these afflictive emotions

205
00:35:53,440 --> 00:36:01,040
which i think of as being surface phenomena and surface because they're reactive to the input that we get the

206
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:07,839
input from outside but also input provided by the mind the mind has imaginations and thoughts and memories

207
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:13,280
that it drums up and then there's the reactions to those and because it has to

208
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:19,760
do with the reaction to input it's more surfacy

209
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,800
but it's louder maybe on the surface it covers over the hindrances are things that cover

210
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:32,800
over their wisdom that's inside and and so what's quieter maybe shyer in a

211
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:39,280
sense is that which gets eclipsed by the surface emotions the reactivity

212
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,400
and it's that which is not reactive is that which exists for us

213
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:50,160
that is independent of reactivity of the input coming in

214
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,839
and so imagine for example that you um you

215
00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:01,760
cut yourself somehow maybe your finger gets cut and maybe you're gardening and you're

216
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:10,400
putting manure in the garden and somehow you get cut then there's dirt and manure on your finger and all that and

217
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,839
but then you just keep on working and working and then you go into the compost pile and you go in the outhouse to clean

218
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:21,280
that out and you don't take care of your your cut and so it's faster as it gets infected

219
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:28,400
and gets worse and worse but if you can stop all the doing

220
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:36,240
and clean it well and maybe cover it and protect it then something emerges from the whole

221
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:42,880
physiological system we have to heal the cut and it's a lots of things get marshalled together

222
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:49,359
inside of us in order to heal a cut and it's not a simple phenomenon this is

223
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:56,160
amazing how complicated it is so in the same way if we can

224
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:02,240
not keep adding input from the outside all the time but clean

225
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:08,400
ourselves clear out uh the all the reactivity and

226
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:14,320
this junk the gunk that's there and keep it clean that allows a

227
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:20,079
huge beautiful complex inner world to emerge and take care of things

228
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:26,880
it's not like nothing's in there within us we have as a rich inner heart we have a rich inner life

229
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:33,359
that give it a chance will bubble up and begin to do with the work it does

230
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:39,760
it's healing and liberating and all kinds of things and so in this second foundation of

231
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:46,560
mindfulness the buddha goes first he says first if i'm i'm interpreting now uh well

232
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:51,680
first it says no what's pleasant as pleasant know what's unpleasant is

233
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:57,920
unpleasant know what's unpleasant neither pleasant nor unpleasant just learn to make those distinctions learn

234
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:04,079
to recognize that once you've learned to recognize that that allows you to and if you get more

235
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:11,200
settled to know that which is uh pleasant because it belongs to the reactive world

236
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,240
and that which is pleasant because it belongs to this pla this other place that's the non-reactive it's the

237
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:22,320
emergent word world from deep inside and

238
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:29,040
and so as many people are so oriented when they sit down and focus on their body and their breathing

239
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:37,040
on the sensual world and the central world is always the uh the world that responds to input

240
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:42,880
the temperature the comfort the physical sensations that go on and

241
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:48,720
it can be wonderful and profound to do that but there's another world within

242
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:54,079
which is not it doesn't require input in fact it's almost like the less input

243
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:59,359
we have or the more the ground is cleared the more

244
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:04,640
something can grow there and so farmer clears the field so the

245
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:11,599
plants can grow so what is it that can grow within us when we don't have input

246
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:18,240
and that comes when we're quiet and focused and calm it's primarily in buddhism associated

247
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:23,680
with meditation practice doesn't have to be only there maybe because of the strong meditation

248
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:30,079
tradition that as we begin meditating and get calmer more settled more concentrated

249
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:35,760
that which is uh more quieter that which is not reactive within us but that which is

250
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:42,240
emergent can begin to flow can move through us and so at some point we want to be able

251
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:48,480
to recognize that that's happening and so for the buddha this was called

252
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:55,200
what is that the the pleasure which is not of the flesh

253
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:02,240
and the unpleasantness that is not of the flesh and i kind of like to translate it as

254
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:08,960
worldly and spiritual though us some people can say physical or

255
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:15,359
spiritual or one translator has worldly and unworldly

256
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:21,760
which reminds me of some other location that's not even here the astral field or something

257
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:27,359
but they call it unworldly but it has to do with something that

258
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:33,040
is really valuable

259
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:40,960
as we move along the path of insight path of mindfulness that something we begin to be attuned to

260
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:46,800
is something that's usually eclipsed and hidden in our reactive preoccupied mind

261
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:53,599
and so if we're always trying to navigate negotiate the reactive mind the mind that's all about input and

262
00:41:53,599 --> 00:42:00,079
rearranging the deck chairs on the titanic you know everything's being has to be right and fixed and made just right in

263
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:06,160
the world and then we're missing the opportunity

264
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:12,240
to become aware of some deep these deeper wellsprings and these deeper wellsprings then become

265
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:18,560
the reference point for um for this path of liberation that's being

266
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:23,839
described in the four foundations of mindfulness uh these deeper wellsprings of the

267
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:29,280
emergent of the not the spiritual of the non-uh

268
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:36,319
sensual uh in the said non-sensual in that sense so it's impacted by

269
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:42,400
the sense stores are impacted by input from the outside um

270
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,520
there's this then it creates a a reference point a foundation for the

271
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:53,280
last two foundations of mindfulness so we have this switch now

272
00:42:53,280 --> 00:43:00,880
in the four foundations of mindfulness and the pivot from the mindfulness of the body

273
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:08,079
mindfulness of the sensual body which has a lot to do with input like even if you you know dance which is beautiful

274
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:13,119
sensual thing to do the dancing is providing the input and

275
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:19,200
so i don't want to you know say that the sensual is somehow less than or something but it's

276
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:26,240
different than this deeper more spiritual place or so here we're having a switch in

277
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:31,359
from that which is of the body that which is the physical sense sensuality

278
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:36,800
to now focusing on um something that some people might call the mind if the

279
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:44,000
mind the cheetah which is you know the whole inner landscape but something deeper and more intimate

280
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,280
and and

281
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:57,040
that is helpful for appreciating the path to freedom from suffering

282
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:02,960
so i hope that this discussion about this distinction

283
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:10,640
between of the flesh and not of the flesh is uh uh gives you enough ideas

284
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:16,720
uh so you can kind of search on yourself maybe for your own terminology or this distinction between these two

285
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:21,920
um and your own way of finding uh something inside that

286
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:28,560
is not dependent on the conditions of the world or the including the conditions of your ordinary body

287
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:33,599
but belongs to some the heart the spirit spiritual center it belongs to

288
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:39,440
the cheetah the mind belongs to some the well springs within where the

289
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:45,680
deep reservoirs of peace and happiness can be found

290
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:53,440
so um thank you and uh so next week i won't be here i'm going

291
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:59,839
off on retreat at irc and um very happy to have nikki mergaforee

292
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:05,760
coming back and she's done this a few times now and i think people have really appreciated her and

293
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:11,440
i appreciate your your welcome receptive perception of her for your appreciation of her that i've

294
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:18,640
heard from many people and so i'll be back on the 7th of march

295
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:24,400
and then we'll do start with the third foundation

296
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:30,240
these uh chitta this mind states or this inner life that

297
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:36,599
we're now beginning to point to so thank you
