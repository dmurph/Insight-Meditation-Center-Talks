5
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,990
so for our practice together i wanted to invite us to consider um

6
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:38,399
[Music] maybe the the phrase that comes to my

7
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:46,399
mind and captures the invitation for the way um to to relate to meta to

8
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:53,039
kindness to care um tonight for ourselves and for others

9
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,280
is by the phrase you matter you matter

10
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,680
you matter ah just feeling the power of the strength

11
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,680
of that and maybe sometimes it's easier to see yourselves

12
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:18,080
say that to others either literally or through our actions people

13
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,840
who really matter for us in our lives they matter we're grateful that they're

14
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,360
in our lives they're alive um either human beings or

15
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,720
or or pets children well children are human beings too but pets

16
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:41,920
you matter you matter there's a sense of of course you matter of course you matter and can we have that

17
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,600
same sense of yes i matter the same way that

18
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,200
other people other beings are instrumental i feel they're instrumental

19
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,799
in my happiness in my in in the the difference that they make

20
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,159
for me their existence in the world they it they have and they continue to be

21
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,599
that i matter too i matter so taking shifting perspectives

22
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:15,920
and and and extending the same care the same importance the same acceptance the

23
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:22,239
same love same meta to ourselves so that's the invitation instead of

24
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:28,560
invitations i will make tonight to work with this this idea this this

25
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:36,400
way of relating to others and ourselves um is it different it's it's a um

26
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,680
different way of of thinking about meta of care

27
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,720
of um [Music] of warm-heartedness of friendliness

28
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,000

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:19,919
continuing to appreciate to enjoy the parade taking it in as much as

168
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:25,120
possible the appreciative eyes

169
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:31,679
the hugs the gifts maybe even the tears of appreciation you

170
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:37,000
matter you matter

171
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,320
you have been a source of joy for so many people without perhaps even

172
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:26,240
knowing a source of support comfort

173
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:33,399
inspiration by just being

174
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,398
you matter

175
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,840
seeing the appreciative eyes

176
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:16,398
a felt sense of this journey that is yours only you

177
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:23,200
and you can take the world would have been so different

178
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:28,078
for these beings without you

179
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,800

180
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:01,800

other people's reflections opening up experience even if it's like

207

this didn't work for me or was confusing whatever it's all okay it's all okay everything is welcome

lisa please hi nikki hi

211
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:48,720
um yeah this was not the not the easiest um

212
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:54,560
guidance for me but i found that the way in for me was like

213
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:00,960
connecting with uh visual imagery of communities that i'm in and also just

214
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:07,119
imagining like a comforting touch like a hand on the shoulder

215
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:13,760
or like on the back and kind of imagining that

216
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:19,040
sensation uh with the other like images really helped

217
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:24,240
me to um to experience that so thank you very much

218
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:30,880
beautiful don't don't unmute don't mute just yet lisa this is beautiful lisa this is fantastic thank you for sharing

219
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:37,680
how these different modalities of touch actually i primarily was bringing the visual and

220
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:43,040
and how the sensory really the sense of support and touch work for you beautiful

221
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:49,520
beautiful and of course there could be the sound through the um so there could be

222
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:56,320
um you know there's so many different ways and and one question i wanted to ask you was as you were saying was uh

223
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:02,160
challenging to get in was it more to to see it for others the they matter or

224
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:09,200
when you turn to yourself for myself for yourself yeah when when it took that turn it was like

225
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:14,720
oh resist yeah it was like oh i can't and then it was oh resistance

226
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:20,079
you know and then it was um the tools that have helped me in the

227
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:27,760
past with the gut the visual imagery like guidance and that it's okay to be imaginative and

228
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:33,359
then also with doing um a lot of like self compassion recently

229
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:40,880
with uh touch yeah like just learning more about that and um then that kind of came

230
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:47,280
in and i could kind of imagine imagine that other people would just like a hand on them oh yeah other people

231
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:53,680
would touch the human hole and support you physically oh beautiful that's lovely that's great that was just

232
00:40:53,680 --> 00:41:00,400
like okay i got it yeah oh yay yeah yeah that makes me very great this

233
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:07,599
is just these are paths that you've explored and know in this way like oh yeah this is hard to turn this around but oh wait these paths i know work for

234
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:13,200
me the sense of touching and holding and other people beautiful thank you lisa that's lovely

235
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:20,000
yeah maybe maybe your reflection also support others who might have trouble with turning it around and maybe a sense of

236
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,920
touch can be supportive for them great thank you um

237
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:31,440
nicolas says the thought of a parade for me was somewhat difficult i cried a little

238
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:37,440
as i needed oh beautiful yeah thank you for sharing that nicholas um

239
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,480
yeah it it um as as i turned it around i have to

240
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:48,400
say i had the same feeling it was very touching to imagine oh my goodness there's a parade for me like all the

241
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:56,560
people in my life who who know i matter to them and yet to actually bring that into into awareness or i was quite teary

242
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:03,359
myself sense of oh this connection this different way of seeing them and it was easy to have a parade for the people i

243
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:09,599
cared about and to really celebrate them yay very joyous and then um

244
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:15,839
turning it around was very touching and and also soothing and calm it's needed it's

245
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:23,040
needed for us to be seen in the way that other people see us we don't see that

246
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:29,280
it's there's resistance there's challenges one private

247
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:34,800
reflection i had difficulty reconciling knowing everything everything passes away with knowing

248
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,560
everything matters i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about this yes yes that's great

249
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:48,240
so glad you brought that in um so yes you know it's teaching of of

250
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:53,839
emptiness emptiness and impermanence those teachings are related so let's just talk

251
00:42:53,839 --> 00:43:00,480
about impermanence which you've brought it in but it's also a bigger teaching of emptiness it doesn't impermanence doesn't mean that things

252
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:06,960
don't matter in fact things matter even more similar to how when people know they're

253
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:13,839
dying say the last year of their life if people have terminal illness they become kinder they appreciate people in their

254
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:18,880
lives more they appreciate every moment of life force things become more

255
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:24,000
important more so so impermanence or even emptiness

256
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,880
doesn't mean that things are just blah and they don't matter in fact there is a beauty there is a goodness that comes

257
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:36,319
because things are impermanent says you know this cup that i drink out

258
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:42,560
of to me it's already broken knowing that it's already broken hence impermanence knowing that it's already

259
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:47,599
broken i actually appreciate it even more knowing that's already broken so i

260
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:52,640
offer that to the person who asked that question please sit with it and but there's a lot more this can be an

261
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:57,839
hour-long dharma talk but i'm just giving it a little

262
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:03,680
little part um another reflection private i had zero equanimity the first person

263
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:09,440
uh let's see the first person was a blast so much fun the second person was where

264
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:16,079
it where it became emotional yeah it's okay it's this one was actually was supposed to be very joyous it's okay not

265
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:22,480
to have much equanimity um you know you know the first one was a blast great it's more of a joyous it's

266
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:27,760
more of a like joy great have fun this is yes let your heart sing with

267
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:35,359
appreciation for others and the second person became emotional that's okay too it opens up the channels

268
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:40,400
of appreciation bittersweetness it's it's it's okay

269
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:46,480
it's okay we don't always have to just be completely quantum yes i appreciate you

270
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:52,319
you matter like it's okay let yourself have the range of emotions

271
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:58,880
oh gosh there are many more reflections that i can get to now uh and also some sadness with the loss of

272
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:04,960
others yes and that's okay too that's all right there's a much longer one that i can't quite get through right now i'm

273
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:10,240
going to read it later this is a private one i'll get to that uh

274
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:18,240
and also more reflections on youtube okay so tell you what let's it's it's uh 10 minutes to the hour so let's turn

275
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:24,079
our attention at this time to practicing in small groups otherwise we won't have time for that and that's very

276
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:30,160
important part of happier and then at the end we'll come back

277
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:38,079
for for the reflection so dear ones the invitation for for practicing together in small groups

278
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:44,400
speaking from your own experience only not managing not facilitating the group just

279
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:50,319
offering what you like to offer and if you want to offer silence meta just holding the space that's okay

280
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:56,960
too each person will say one nugget and they'll come back to you another nugget you'll go round and round maybe a couple

281
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:03,760
of times two or three times depending on how much time there might be and i'm going to create the breakout

282
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:10,000
rooms right now take care of yourselves take care of each other remember kindness kindness kindness

closed welcome back everyone we have just about a minute

285
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:27,760
gosh and there are lots of reflections i'll say something very quick about them

286
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:33,599
folks had appreciated also the invitation that each breath matters every cell

287
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:39,920
and um uh lynnea had wrought about wrote about that to everyone that um

288
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:48,079
there's a sense of really appreciating every every moment every breath of reaction and how we how we manifest how

289
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:53,680
we show up in every moment that's something i wanted to bring up and they're also story beautiful from berlin

290
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:59,440
on youtube um how he had showed up to a volunteering father's day event today

291
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:05,200
and uh today with this practice thinking that his presence had uplifted

292
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:10,400
others just felt made him feel really emotional and he was grateful for that it's really oh a

293
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:17,119
touching beautiful story so jerry i see your hand please

294
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:22,800
uh very quickly thank you i don't know for the first time i experienced more bitter sweetness than

295
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:29,760
i've ever felt but it was saying to the group it just came from that it was offset by

296
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:36,800
at least the existential loneliness that we all felt by being with this small group it was like an anecdote but the

297
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:42,559
the the meditation seemed to highlight the fleetingness as well as the benefit

298
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:48,000
of being connected but then you were left oh it it will come as fast as it

299
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:54,880
goes and vice versa so uh the small group was an antidote to that so yeah

300
00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:00,160
yeah yeah i'm glad that that connecting the antidote was i mean with the small

301
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:06,720
groups felt like an antidote and also someone else very quickly had mentioned a private comment that that some bitter

302
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:13,520
sweetness some sadness came up for them because of the pandemic feeling that they're connected and appreciated but fewer

303
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:20,880
people than they were before and it's okay to have compassion for oneself and the circumstances of life and to also

304
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:27,040
still appreciate that wow we have matter to people and we still matter to people so there's so many ways we can play

305
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:32,160
around with with the with the griefs that also come up not to dismiss them

306
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:38,240
but to appreciate them but also see the the the the golden light or the the

307
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:45,599
um they pray the the gifts within within the things that we grieve there are gifts within them

308
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:51,040
also so so we're a couple of minutes over time so i'm going to bring to a close i'll stay a couple of minutes i'll

309
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:58,800
see another question i want to address um so but i'll stay over time uh to address that so but let's bring it to a

310
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:05,119
close and thank you all for your practice thank you for cultivating

311
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:12,480
