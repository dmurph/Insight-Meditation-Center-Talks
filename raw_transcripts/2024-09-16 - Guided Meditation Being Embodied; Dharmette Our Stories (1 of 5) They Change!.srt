00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:06,319
greetings greetings hello hello good morning good afternoon good

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,880
evening even greetings to those of you in the future who are watching this or

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:18,400
listening to this so a warm welcome a warm welcome as some of you as many of you

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,599
can see from the title of the YouTube video that I got posted here I'm going

5
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:30,000
to do a story on I'm a series on stories I could also do a story about series but

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,920
today will be uh this week will be a focus on stories and of course as you know that

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,879
stories are mental events things that we uh construct in the mind and if we're

8
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:48,239
not in stories like maybe we might say the opposite is to be

9
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:55,840
embodied be you know here in our physical experience and I'd like to start with

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:03,400
this guided meditation this morning about focusing on body like being

11
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:09,759
embodied and you could say as a contrast of being lost in

12
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:16,479
stories so and take a meditation

13
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,439
posture maybe a few long slow deep

14
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:31,010
exhales [Music]

15
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:38,680
as a way to maybe release any obvious

16
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:47,680
tension and signal that we're going to orient towards meditation

17
00:01:53,320 --> 00:02:00,399
now allowing the breath to return to normal recognizing that the body

18
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,799
knows how to breathe we don't need to do anything in

19
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:08,640
particular with the

20
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:20,519
breath and then resting our attention on the experience of

21
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:29,480
sitting if you're sitting in a chair or a couch feeling the pressure against the

22
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:36,160
body that you might feel along the

23
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:54,319
back of course if you're lying down you'd feel that pressure against the back

24
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,120
also then all of us no matter what we're sitting on

25
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,840
feel that pressure against the back side or

26
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:12,680
bum feeling connected to our sitting

27
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:27,120
surface pressure against the back of the legs

28
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:46,080
and our feet whatever they're

29
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,000
touching feeling that place of

30
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,920
connection with our sitting

31
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:04,560
surface feeling grounded connected using this as a

32
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,159
foundation upon which we're sitting

33
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:45,759
connecting with other areas of the body places where we might hold

34
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:52,000
tension around the eyes or the jaw

35
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:25,639
Bing into the shoulders moving them away from the

36
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:31,639
ears letting the shoulder blades slide down the

37
00:05:49,560 --> 00:06:00,600
back tuning into the experience of having a back upper back the lower back

38
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,520
the chest is there a way that the chest can

39
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:30,479
be just a tiny bit more open moving the shoulders back just a

40
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,840
tiny

41
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:52,960
bit and relaxing the belly letting the belly be soft

42
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,360
feeling embodied like

43
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:25,199
inhabiting the body we're

44
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:31,160
here now in this experience of the body at

45
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:39,360
this moment however it

46
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:49,479
is if you have some tension or some

47
00:07:51,879 --> 00:08:01,120
discomfort can you be in a body that has some tension or discomfort

48
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:31,520
and setting the sense of direction the orientation of this meditation period is

49
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:39,120
one of kindness warm-heartedness towards ourself towards

50
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,440
our experience

51
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:10,040
and then resting our attention on the sensations of

52
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:18,920
breathing feeling this stretch with the inhale

53
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,560
and the release of the stretch with the

54
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:58,680
exhale breathing at your own pace

55
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:04,399
in a natural way with a natural

56
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:15,079
Rhythm we're just tuning into different

57
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:19,320
aspects of breathing

58
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:39,160
and then noticing the transitions between inhales and

59
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:46,959
exhales how does that feel we don't need

60
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,880
words we're just

61
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,279
experiencing e

62
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:53,040
tuning into and sensitive to our experience of

63
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,720
breathing in this moment

64
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,440
whether we experience it in the chest or the

65
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:16,360
belly for some of you feeling the air going in and out of the

66
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,160
nose e

67
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:22,600
it's lost in thought lost in

68
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:30,040
stories doesn't have to be a problem we just very simply

69
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:39,040
gently begin again without adding any extra stories

70
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:47,279
about what it means as for us as meditators we just begin again with the

71
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,120
sensations of

72
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
breathing

73
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040

76
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:17,399
right now there's nothing else to

77
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:24,440
do nowhere else to be we're just

78
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:30,920
here with this experience of breathing

[Music]

107
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,679
good morning or good day or I'm always saying

108
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:32,760
good morning for me it's morning here but uh whatever time it is and wherever you are

109
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:40,159
warm welcome it's uh such a delight to uh to practice together to know be part

110
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:46,000
of community for those of you who don't know me I'm Diana clerk if you're

111
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,519
watching this on YouTube you might know that I'm on YouTube uh on Monday nights as part of IMC

112
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:58,919
and oh maybe you've uh seen me before on your screen

113
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:05,360
and I'm going to I want to introduce this idea of the uh a series this week

114
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:13,320
about stories and like our stories the stories that we tell in some ways we might say

115
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:20,000
that uh humans are storytelling creatures that we use language and

116
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,919
narratives to make sense of our experiences you know to like have them

117
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:33,639
uh to organize them in a way way that makes sense to us and you might even say that telling stories is just a

118
00:31:33,639 --> 00:31:38,919
fundamental activity that people in all cultures you know maybe All Through Time

119
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:45,320
have been doing as long as there's been language there's been storytelling but you don't need mean to tell you this of

120
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:52,639
course right anybody who has sat down to meditate just like we did might notice how the mind is like getting caught up

121
00:31:52,639 --> 00:31:59,000
and telling stories or these entertaining thoughts or fantasies or maybe the stories are about planning

122
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,080
okay I'm going to do this and then this other thing is going to happen because that other thing is going to happen I'm

123
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:09,240
going to feel more safe or whatever it might be whatever it might be it's a lot

124
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:14,399
of Storytelling is happening and uh I like to look at this uh this week

125
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:22,279
different aspects of it as well as including different stories so I'd like to start us off with

126
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:28,240
this uh a teaching story that is from Jack cornfields book uh path with heart

127
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:35,440
you know I I say this I'm pretty sure it's a path with heart um I do know it's one of Jack cornfields

128
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:42,279
books and uh he tells this story about a poison tree a tree that

129
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:48,320
has a poisonous fruit and he tells this story that uh

130
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:54,760
when uh first discovering this tree that has this poison fruit people often are

131
00:32:54,760 --> 00:33:02,200
like afraid and they want to avoid this tree and or maybe they even try to convince themselves oh no it isn't there

132
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:10,799
this tree like like this one here it's not there it doesn't exist or maybe if we

133
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:16,840
discover that there's a poison tree maybe we become angry and we start

134
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:24,399
blaming others and that this tree is here and if only the neighbors hadn't done this or those crazy scientists

135
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:32,760
hadn't done that or something you know we have these ideas of you know why this uh tree is there and we start demanding

136
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:40,440
like okay something needs to be done about this poison tree some ways their reactions might be

137
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:45,679
let's cut this down let's get rid of it this is you know we don't want this to

138
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:52,240
be here and before I get hurt otherwise I might get hurt or we might uh let's cut down this poison tree before anyone

139
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:59,840
else gets hurt and eats this poisoned fruit and so we might recognize that

140
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:05,480
what I'm describing here is what Jack is describing in his book that this

141
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:11,000
resembles often our initial response when we discover some difficulties that

142
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,118
are arising in our life when we encounter aggression or we see in

143
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:22,679
ourselves this maybe some compulsion or some fear or some greed or maybe when we

144
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:29,919
just have some stress or have loss or conflict or depression or sorrow in

145
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:35,000
ourselves or into others there's this way our initial

146
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:41,358
response can be this way that you know this poison quote unquote is afflictive

147
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:49,320
and let's uh uproot it let's get rid of it let's cut it down let's make it go away and we do that by avoiding it or

148
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:54,560
pretending it's not being there or distracting ourselves or something like

149
00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:00,560
that but the story continues so Jack says in his book that you know

150
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:06,240
other people who have journeyed further along this spiritual path they see the

151
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:12,160
same poison tree and they don't meet it with a virgin they aren't trying to get

152
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:19,320
rid of it or instead they have maybe um realized that in order to open to life

153
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:27,119
open to this present moment Experience open to how our life is unfolding this

154
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:33,200
requires some compassion some heartfelt compassion for ourselves and for others and for

155
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,359
everything that's around us and maybe they recognize oh yeah this poison tree

156
00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:43,560
is actually a part of me and so let's not cut it down let's

157
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:49,119
not get rid of it but instead let's have compassion for the

158
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:57,880
tree so out of kindness out of care they build a fence around the tree so to

159
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:05,040
protect others so they may not be poisoned by it and recognize okay so the tree so that it can be still still be

160
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:12,760
alive so the second way of the same facts are happening there's this encounter with a poison tree but there's

161
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:18,400
a different way of relating to it just going to build a fence around we're not going to cut it down we're just going to

162
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,880
build a fence around it and allow it to uh be there and to

163
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:29,760
continue and then the story continues it's third uh type of person

164
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:38,480
maybe somebody who's traveled even further along the spiritual path uh sees the same tree and says oh a poison tree

165
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,880
perfect just what I was looking for and this person like picks the fruit and

166
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:52,119
looks at it and investigates its properties mixes it with some other ingredients and uses this poison to make

167
00:36:52,119 --> 00:37:00,359
a great medicine that maybe heals the sick and transforms the ills of the world and

168
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:05,520
this way through respect and understanding this person sees a way

169
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:12,119
different than a lot of other people and finds value and what might some people

170
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:17,800
might say difficult circumstances of poison so there's a number of ways that

171
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:24,960
we can interpret this story that I just uh told and there's a way that um one is

172
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,480
that experiences that are difficult qu quot unquote we and tree might actually

173
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:37,920
be beneficial um just because we label something a difficult doesn't mean that we have to avoid it or get rid of it but

174
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:44,359
instead it might actually become a great asset for us and I want to use this

175
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:49,400
story to say something about the nature of

176
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:55,960
stories that is there's more than one way there's more than one story that is

177
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:03,119
possible with maybe a given set of facts quotee unquote in the same way that different

178
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:08,640
people have different perceptions about something we can have

179
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:16,240
different perceptions about an experience about some facts and but the narratives we create

180
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:22,319
the stories we create and believe they actually deeply influence us and

181
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:27,560
influence how we perceive the world and how we experience the world

182
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:35,640
and David ly who is a zen teacher he writes one meaning of freedom is the

183
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:43,240
opportunity to act out the story I identify with one meaning of freedom is the

184
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:50,359
opportunity to act out the story I identify with another

185
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:57,480
freedom is the ability to change stories and my role within them in this way

186
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:02,680
person can move from a scripted character to the co-author of their

187
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:10,040
life so another freedom is the ability to change stories and change the

188
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:17,920
roles and then a third type of Freedom results from understanding how

189
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:25,318
stories construct and constrict our

190
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:31,960
possibilities recognizing how stories construct and constrict our

191
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:37,280
possibilities so the the way that we um work with stories the way that we hold

192
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,920
stories has such a big impact on our lives and I'd like to use a specific

193
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:50,800
example of this comes from Kim Hamlin har she gives an example of how um using

194
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:56,040
like one I'll just use this word facts uh and then just there's so many

195
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:03,400
different interpretations of and the different interpretations really can have an impact on our lives the amount of

196
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:12,319
Freedom we have in our lives so Kim Hamlin Hart um she uh tells a story as

197
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:18,440
this assumption that her mother was distant and unhappy and then she had some different

198
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:23,839
stories about it and here are some of the ones that she said again this is Kim hinhard I don't want people to think I'm

199
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:29,760
saying this about my own mother but this is somebody else saying my mother was

200
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:36,560
distant and unhappy she didn't love me and because she didn't love me I am

201
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:42,520
unlovable that's one story my mother was distant and

202
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:48,160
unhappy she was broken and incapable of giving much love and I didn't get the

203
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:55,280
love the type of love I craved but I am worthy of love and belonging regardless

204
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:01,000
of my mother's inability to love the way that I need it that's a second

205
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,319
story here's a third story my mother was distant and unhappy it was because of

206
00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:13,640
something I did and I am responsible for her unhappy life and I need to do

207
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:21,359
everything I can to make her and those around me happy very different third story here's

208
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:28,079
a fourth story my mother was distant and unhappy and I didn't get the love I

209
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:36,079
needed she ruined my life I can never be a whole or happy because of the love I

210
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:42,280
was denied as a child ouch right such a different fourth

211
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:47,760
story here's a fifth Story my mother was distant and

212
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:55,000
unhappy because I didn't have a model of how to interact emotionally I can't get in touch with my emotions and express

213
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:02,680
them in a healthy way and I cannot sh change that's a fifth Story and here's a

214
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:09,599
sixth story my mother was distant and unhappy because I didn't have a model of

215
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:17,240
how to interact emotionally I struggle with my own emotions however I can learn and grow

216
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:24,359
and figure out a way to get in touch with my emotions and express them in a healthy

217
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:29,599
way so you can see how there's so many different meanings can be created around

218
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:35,359
the same facts quote unquote and this one is about a mother being distant and

219
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:41,400
unhappy but how we interpret them and we could say which stories we apply to them

220
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:48,079
have such a big impact on our life and I want to be clear there's not like one

221
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:53,200
right story here or one wrong story here some of the powers actually to recognize

222
00:42:53,200 --> 00:43:00,640
that there can be more than one story and that they can change maybe early in our life we have this story about

223
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:06,200
something that happened uh ear when in our childhood for example and then as we

224
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:11,520
grow as we mature in our um spiritual life and then just in our adult life

225
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:16,720
then the stories can change so it's not that there's no right or wrong story

226
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:23,520
here but maybe part of the freedom is to recognize that whichever story We

227
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:30,160
believe um it like affects us it has an impact on us it becomes like the frame

228
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:35,400
of reference and it can uh affect the way that we interact with the world and

229
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:42,920
the views that we have about ourself and our possibilities or our

230
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:50,640
capabilities so small shifts in thinking we might say can lead to significant

231
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:55,880
changes and these significant changes can change can influence you know our

232
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:02,440
behavior and our behavior and of course it impacts how our life

233
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:07,880
unfolds so rewriting we might say our personal

234
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:14,400
narratives isn't about changing facts it's more about changing our

235
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:20,839
interpretation of them changing our stories recognizing that as humans we

236
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:28,800
make stories we need we want to interpret and have meaning for our experiences so we great

237
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:34,839
narratives but these narratives are fluid and dynamic and can

238
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:41,200
change and part of our spiritual life is maybe to see the

239
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:47,640
stories and then uphold stories Loosely to recognize that they

240
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:53,079
change and to be able to find the freedom there so I hope you'll join me for the

241
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:59,680
rest of this week as we continue this exploration of stories and how we create

242
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:06,760
them how they change and the impact that they have in our

243
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:13,119
lives thank you thank you very much and see you tomorrow
