greetings

17
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:16,000
so good morning good day hello

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,369
everyone [Music]

19
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:30,959
and one of the radical acts in any human life given the state of the world

20
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:37,120
is to be friends with everyone maybe it's a tall

21
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:44,519
order but to be friends with the people that we encounter I like to believe that a lot

22
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:50,360
of what Buddhism Buddhist practice entails is in spite of us being here on

23
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:56,360
YouTube today that a lot of it is personal a person-to-person

24
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:02,400
meetings and in those meetings may we be friends with people we encounter we

25
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,159
might not agree with them but we can be friendly and so one of

26
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:14,959
the people to be friendly with with and towards and is

27
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:24,560
ourselves and meditation can be understood as a as a deep practice

28
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:33,200
of friendship towards yourself a continual Act of

29
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,159
friendliness and if that's too high a bar

30
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:48,920
or at least be safe for oneself at least not be the opposite of a friend and so

31
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:54,439
what would it be to be a friend with all the complexity of our who we are in our

32
00:03:54,439 --> 00:04:00,319
inner life and our life experiences and our reactions to the world

33
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:07,640
what is it to cast a wide gaze

34
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:13,159
upon ourselves such a wide gaze that we can take the whole

35
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:18,759
in and view the all of it the whole in a friendly

36
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:25,360
way and one of the purposes of this many purposes is that the attitudes with

37
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,600
which we move through the world

38
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:39,759
affects our breathing and um that's just a moment affects our

39
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:46,680
breathing and so to breathe with ease to

40
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:53,600
breathe in a relaxed gentle way to breathe peacefully

41
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:01,199
is one of the great experiences of life and to and our attitude affect our

42
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,639
breathing anxiety affects it anger affects it desire affects

43
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,400
it but to be to meet ourselves with friendliness and

44
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:19,440
safety creates a more relaxed breathing and the easeful

45
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,319
breath in turn nourishes and nurtures

46
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:31,240
us has a profound impact on ourselves

47
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:40,400
and perhaps then supports our ability to meet others in a friendly way kind

48
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,479
way so assuming a meditation

49
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:53,960
posture and giving some care to adjust the

50
00:05:53,960 --> 00:06:00,680
Torso so that there is some space in the chest and the rib cage

51
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:06,599
around the diaphragm for the breathing to be

52
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:13,280
unencumbered so sometimes sitting in such a way that the

53
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:19,319
or laying if you're laying down such a way that the

54
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:24,919
spine uh is a little bit more

55
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,400
erect especially the upper spine in such a way that the chest

56
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,240
curves outward a little

57
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:50,440
bit assuming a posture in such a way that the belly is not

58
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:57,440
scrunched the belly is not restricted

59
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,759
by being curved over into it but kind of an opening up in the air

60
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:11,680
of the belly concave belly so the belly hangs

61
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,639
forward and has a chance to

62
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:25,680
relax and maybe also it's possible to roll the shoulders back a little

63
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:32,319
bit and maybe adjust in the head and the

64
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:45,720
neck so the back of the neck is maybe a little bit longer than

65
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:58,319
usual lowering your gaze maybe closing your

66
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
eyes

67
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:14,520
and with as much calm as you can find a calm attitude a calm

68
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:23,000
approach let your attention roam around your body just taking it in as it

69
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,800
is beginning to having this broad gaze taking in all of who you are in

70
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:37,279
this body with a calm

71
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,919
attention slowly moving around the

72
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:55,080
body and then taking a few long slow deep

73
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:02,360
breaths and as you exhale to

74
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,560
relax the

75
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,920
body letting the breathing return to normal

76
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:39,680
and calmly and slowly move from the top of your body down through the face shoulders belly

77
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:46,240
hands legs calmly and slowly move

78
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,720
through relaxing each area as you

79
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
exhale

80
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
e

81
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
for

82
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:38,120
then calmly and gently bring your attention to your back

83
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:46,720
rib cage and feel the movements there of

84
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,880
breathing movements of the spine the rib cage the

85
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,959
ribs maybe a subtle lifting or

86
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:13,720
expanding or if not there maybe the lifting of the shoulders as you

87
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
breathe

88
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:43,519
maybe noticing if there's any movement in the collar bones as you

89
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:59,920
breathe and how's that movement in the collar bones different when you breathe

90
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,040
in and when you breathe

91
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:24,560
out and what's the experience of breathing just on the front front rib

92
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,760
cage high up just below the collar bones

93
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:37,920
maybe an area where there are no muscles that are doing the

94
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:46,240
breathing the high rib cage just gently moves with breathing in and breathing

95
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:05,360
out some parts of the body just passively follow

96
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,759
along with the

97
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,920
breathing and then calmly slowly becoming aware of where the

98
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:42,160
experience of breathing feels most comfortable to feel

99
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:50,040
in the body maybe movement of the

100
00:14:53,360 --> 00:15:00,680
belly maybe in the area around the diaphragm or solar

101
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:13,399
plexus the chest the sensations of the air going in

102
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:18,720
and out through the nostrils wherever it's most

103
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,560
comfortable maybe even

104
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:30,360
easeful take in the comfort take in the ease

105
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:37,399
even if it's quite modest let

106
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:41,639
yourself feel whatever

107
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:50,279
pleasure however minor there might be as you breathe in and breathe

108
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
out

109
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:33,360
here if there's any tension or pressure in the thinking

110
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:42,160
mind each time you exhale let that tension melt

111
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:50,440
soften settle ever so slightly with each

112
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
exhale

113
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
for

114
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
for

115
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
for

116
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
for

117
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
e

118
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
for

119
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
for

120
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
for

121
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
for

122
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
for

123
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
e

124
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
for

125
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
for

126
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,679
e

127
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,600
for

128
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,600
for

129
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,520
for

130
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:04,130
for [Music]

131
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,440
for

132
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,399
and then as we come to the end of this

133
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:01,480
sitting to to see if you can have a bird's eye view of

134
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:08,279
yourself and gaze upon it all calmly

135
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:20,000
peacefully or perhaps a global feeling of the sensations of your

136
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,480
body feeling all of Who You

137
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,320
Are

138
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:44,840
maybe in the way that you would take in all of a stranger who seemed friendly and safe

139
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:50,480
and may be in need of

140
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,320
hospitality and so to be your own

141
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,720
host l allowing yourself to be as you

142
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:14,880
are in a friendly hospitable

143
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,600
way letting yourself to be just who you are as you

144
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,240
are

145
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:41,200
and now to expand your horizons to the people that you'll be

146
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,960
encountering

147
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:52,240
today nearby and maybe currently not so close

148
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:59,000
by and to imagine yourself being a host for them

149
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,760
that your very presence is a presence of hospitality

150
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:29,158
friendliness and with uh

151
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:39,000
and as expression of friendship friendliness Wishing Well a

152
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:44,200
well-wishing a generalized Good

153
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:52,000
Will May all people that you encounter today that you think about

154
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,720
today may they be happy

155
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:05,840
may they be safe may they be

156
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,039
peaceful may they breathe

157
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:20,600
easily May their minds and hearts be calm safe

158
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:29,080
settled contented may they be free

159
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:37,600
and may our contact with them support this

160
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:45,559
possibility may we encounter all beings in a friendly

161
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:54,299
[Music]

162
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:59,039
way

163
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,559
thank

164
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,960
you

165
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:58,200
so hello on this Monday

166
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:05,080
and I'm sitting here in Redwood City the Insight Meditation Center and delighted

167
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:15,440
to be in this kind of time

168
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,599
together so for the I I thought over the weekend about

169
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:28,200
different themes to do for this week uh for this 7 a.m. YouTube

170
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:34,158
tube and we've been doing this now for a long time many we can say years now

171
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:40,040
since the beginning of the pandemic and I've done many themes and

172
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:47,000
uh this weekend and thinking about what to do I couldn't um I thought about different things but

173
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,079
none of them really had a spark for me none of them really were something that I could feel felt like I could come here

174
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:58,879
and embody or feel a deep heart connection to

175
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:07,160
so um I think what I'd like to do is to fall back on a certain default that I

176
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:12,240
that might be interesting for for you since some of you have been listening to me here for a long

177
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:17,839
time and um do something maybe uncharacteristic and and that is to talk

178
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:25,160
a little bit about myself maybe some of you'd like to know more about me mostly here in the the 7 a.m.

179
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:32,800
sittings I talk about the Dharma occasionally I'll mention something autobiographical but um maybe some of

180
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:40,119
you don't know much about me and might be interesting to hear a little bit and to make it um interesting for

181
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:45,200
me um I think that uh maybe talk a little bit about the

182
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:51,160
background uh of my life in a way that brought me to practice and and and

183
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:57,920
brought me here to IMC and even here now teaching with all of you so I hope that

184
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:05,920
that's interesting enough to hear this and and feel a little bit apologetic that it's not giving you some specific

185
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:12,000
Dharma topic to chew on and and uh maybe that'll come out of as I talk to you a

186
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:19,680
little bit about my life so

187
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:31,800
um so I came to the Dharma first time

188
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:38,079
probably first contact with it was when I was probably 11 years

189
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:44,920
old and um my family my my mother and the father and myself uh my father was

190
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:50,000
working in Italy at that time and otherwise we had a home in Los

191
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,200
Angeles and uh and we had the summer my father apparently had the summer free

192
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:03,839
from work and so the decision was to return to Los Angeles um I think with a ticket that

193
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:12,119
was paid for by his work uh by going uh traveling uh to uh the East and along

194
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:19,880
the way there we stopped in Thailand and well first we stopped in

195
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:25,359
India and in the way in India my father um read I was reading a book I think it

196
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:32,240
was called The Wonder of India and he commented to me that one of the characteristics of Indian religions was

197
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:37,359
to be very um inclusive that uh somehow all religions

198
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:45,800
can all the different forms of religion in in India could somehow be held together and seen as you know one big

199
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:52,599
maybe uh harmonious religious family and

200
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:59,000
um and I was really inspired by that I but I I I grew up in a non-religious

201
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:05,359
household um my parents were atheists but they were disinterested atheists it

202
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:12,440
wasn't like a big deal for them it just um you know it's like a if um you know I

203
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:18,760
was originally born in Norway and you know they have a Pantheon of Nordic gods

204
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:25,720
you know like that from a thousand years ago they God Thor and Udin and uh those

205
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:31,920
never came up in family discussions there were I don't think my family believed in Thor or Udin but it was

206
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:38,400
never a topic of Interest it just didn't occur to them so in the same way being an atheist was in that kind of way just

207
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:45,839
didn't occur to talk about something like religion or gods or things like that but uh hearing the statement about

208
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:51,079
how ecumenical things were inclusive they were in India I was kind of inspired by that Harmony that that

209
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:56,119
seemed to imply and then we uh went to Thailand

210
00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:03,400
and there I remember seeing the in Bangkok there's a big statue of the reclining Buddha it's gold I don't know

211
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:11,040
how long it is but it's probably 40t long at least and uh and I remember seeing the

212
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:18,359
Buddha he's laying it's not just looks like a sleeping Buddha but it's a Buddha uh in the posture in which he died he's

213
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:25,760
laying down he's laying down on his right side and and the usual statues he's he has one hand underneath his uh

214
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:32,079
cheek and he's kind of resting on it and um and uh I was inspired by that

215
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:37,119
statue uh but not religiously I thought oh that's the ideal way of sleeping

216
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:43,359
sleeping on your right side and so I think that quite a bit then I would that's how I slept kind of inspired by

217
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:51,599
what I saw in that statue and um when I was 14 the my mother brought a

218
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:57,599
copy for herself of Herman hess's sidartha I read it and was inspired by

219
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:07,240
it by the what I felt was the Simplicity and the peace and the non-c contentiousness of uh that life that uh

220
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:13,560
the Buddha was represented to live in that novel so these things didn't make a big

221
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:19,640
impression on me um but uh then I think the next big impression was that when I

222
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:26,760
was 18 I was traveling around Europe by myself and um except for people I would

223
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:33,160
travel a little bit with a few days and I came to this uh great Cathedral

224
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:39,319
Monastery called the Mon Mon San Michelle it's on the the uh coast of

225
00:40:39,319 --> 00:40:46,760
Normandy or Britany and it has architecturally it looks a little bit like a Disneyland Palace uh castle

226
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:53,760
that's rising up on this from this Hilltop at this little island and Rises up with spires up into the

227
00:40:53,760 --> 00:41:01,800
sky and um and I went went through it uh on a tour that they gave and um and we

228
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:08,400
came to the oldest uh and the whole the whole time there I was spent the night there in the little Island at a Pax

229
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:15,359
Christie hostel that had a feeling there was like little I'm not like exactly like a cave

230
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:22,040
but a little ancient feeling kind of stone building where there was a wood table

231
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:27,480
and wood chairs and we were served bread in the morning like we were you know at

232
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:33,800
the Last Supper or something and there was a priest there who was very friendly and talked to us and it just felt like

233
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:38,960
we'd I stepped into it kind of Timeless almost like I was in the monastery

234
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:46,200
already and then the next morning I went into the tour of the monastery and the monastery had been built around a very

235
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:52,480
simple one room Stone maybe Cottage or stone Stone Chapel at the very top of

236
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:58,000
the hill and slowly over the centuries there was added to but as we to took us

237
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,520
through that original Chapel as soon as we stepped into its a cool quiet

238
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:11,000
peaceful space something in my body shifted and everything got really peaceful and quiet and i' never

239
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,640
experienced this deep peace and quiet and even though the tour kept going I try to linger as long as I could in that

240
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:23,680
Chapel to feel that that experience and that made a huge

241
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:29,359
impression on me and maybe that's when uh uh I don't remember that time when I

242
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:35,359
was a teenager but maybe it was after that that I spent time wondering if um I

243
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:41,920
could join a Catholic Monastery and become a monk uh even though I was an atheist there was something about the

244
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:49,480
atmosphere of that life and getting up early and walking around the kind of what I imagined was architecture

245
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:54,520
peaceful uh place that kind of represented that experience and it was

246
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:59,680
like that experience I had in the chap app and uh I wanted to have my life kind

247
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:05,400
of dedicated devoted not to God not to religion but that to that experience of

248
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:11,319
peace that experience of a deep sense of calm that I had that it felt so healthy

249
00:43:11,319 --> 00:43:16,359
it felt so holistic it felt like this is like some you know I couldn't imagine

250
00:43:16,359 --> 00:43:24,240
anything better than this but I didn't do that I went to college and I went to college during the

251
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:33,640
Vietnam war and uh I was draftable and uh during that time in the

252
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:39,800
dorms the first year there was intense debates about war and the Vietnam War

253
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:47,319
and I was always the extreme pacifist in the discussions and I don't know where my pacifism came from but it was really

254
00:43:47,319 --> 00:43:55,000
clear that I would not fight that that was impossible for me it wasn't like I I could give a good originally I couldn't

255
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,680
give a good philosophical political religious reason for why I would not

256
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:06,920
fight pick up a gun it just was kind of by disposition impossible for me to do

257
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:13,720
something like that but then I defended my my um my my

258
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:21,760
pacifist stance with my friends and um and I uh found myself uh

259
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:26,880
disturbed by what I discovered about myself and that is that I had the strong

260
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:35,079
position that involved if necessary to be involved in Civil Disobedience um passive Disobedience to

261
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:41,200
stand up and protest and and interfere the harm being caused in society and the

262
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:46,359
world and um and so uh but what I discovered was

263
00:44:46,359 --> 00:44:51,800
that I was afraid to die and I thought that if I take my belief seriously uh I

264
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:58,520
have to have the same courage as a military soldier who goes into battle I had to be able to put myself In Harm's

265
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:07,839
Way in order to uh be involved in in protesting or working for a nonviolent

266
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:13,200
change and um and I I was afraid to die and the

267
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:20,480
dissonance between what my beliefs were and what I was capable really Disturbed me a lot and that became where I started

268
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:26,160
to search for some approach some way of living something that would help me deal

269
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:33,040
with this fear of death so I can live with my ideals and that was when I first kind of

270
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:38,440
somehow thought about Buddhism that Buddhism had an answer at the same time

271
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:44,960
I was at U was going to college at University of California of Santa Barbara which is right on the coast and

272
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:52,079
you can see from the coastline of the University you can look out and see um oil platforms and just before I got

273
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:58,240
there there was a massive o oil spill on the Santa Barbara beach so that was kind of current and I was

274
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:04,880
began got interested in um Environmental Studies and I actually became an Environmental Studies major for a

275
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:10,960
while and uh and first I was going to studying the science of it all and I

276
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:18,920
felt science uh is not going to solve this problems it's a political issue so I started studying political science and

277
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:24,960
U that was interesting but uh that uh I thought that's not going to be enough just politics is not going to change

278
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:31,520
this and in the language of 1973 or so it was a um what needed happen was a

279
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:38,280
change of Consciousness and that's where I started looking well who where what what what orientation what teachings

280
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:43,640
what way of life uh can really help us change our Consciousness so that we can

281
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:49,319
have the change that would really help this world of ours and so then I started

282
00:46:49,319 --> 00:46:56,920
looking around and U and the things that spoke to me the most was Daoism and Buddhism

283
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:04,440
that seemed to speak to a ra you know radical different way of living in harmony with the world rather than um a

284
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:12,160
disharmony that over consumes over destroys over um you know

285
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:19,599
um abuses the world in order to support our lifestyles and um and so that was my

286
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:27,800
beginning so this thing about uh looking for a solution to the fear of death looking for a solution to social World

287
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:34,000
ecological issues I began being oriented towards Buddhism and Eastern

288
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:41,960
religion and um and then I dropped out of college and I'll pick up that story

289
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:48,720
uh tomorrow so hopefully this is interesting for you and and if it is I'm

290
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:53,680
very happy to continue telling it thank

291
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,920
you
