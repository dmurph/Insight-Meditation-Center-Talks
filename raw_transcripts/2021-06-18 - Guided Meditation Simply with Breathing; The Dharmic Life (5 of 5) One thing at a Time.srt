1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:10,320
so good day everyone and welcome

2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:21,119
and it said that vipassana practice is simple

3
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:28,000
it's easy what's difficult is remembering to do it

4
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,440
and so here at uh during a meditation period

5
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:42,960
we are remembering to do it over and over again and to help this

6
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,079
idea it might be significant to

7
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,760
separate out remember and to remember

8
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,800
to bring the members back together into the field of awareness so that all

9
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,240
of us is included all of us as here and i know of no other way that all of

10
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,280
us can be in some way complete or have a feeling

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:18,159
of wholeness or complete completeness that all things are kind of feel like they're included and they're

12
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:25,960
all that we are and or at least we know that we are the wholeness of us without this

13
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:33,360
remembering without being aware so we we remember to be aware we remember to

14
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,840
be present and we train that remembering

15
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:48,240
with the breathing there could be other focuses for mindfulness practice but a classic one is to not just simply

16
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,280
stay with the breath and be with the breath but rather the breath is the vehicle for

17
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,040
this remembering this awakening awakening of an awareness

18
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,200
that brings us into the present moment that a practice that keeps us in the present

19
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:13,599
in a full and way and what's uh remarkable about

20
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:20,080
this is we're not asked to do things that are very complicated we're asked to to really kind of stay

21
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:28,400
and do just one thing at a time or just be with what's predominant here and now and so

22
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,800
we choose if the breathing works for you as a meditation objects this is the one thing that we give

23
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:41,720
ourselves over to the one place where we keep remembering

24
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,800
remembering to come back to be here to be present

25
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,640
and uh and you don't have to doesn't have to be sophisticated there's not a lot you have to figure out or

26
00:02:52,640 --> 00:03:00,400
analyze or uh if you're able to just kind of follow through see it through just breathing trust your

27
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,560
breathing more than anything else if a simple way of developing

28
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:13,040
meditation i think would be to really trust your breathing more than

29
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,879
anything else or almost anything else keep it really simple

30
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:26,720
let all everything else kind of fall away for these minutes and remember yourself remember

31
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:33,840
your experience and awareness here over and over again

32
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:43,200
so stepping into a meditation posture

33
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,400
and and if it's comfortable for you to close

34
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,959
your eyes

35
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,879
and as a way of remembering that the breathing is the center of

36
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:10,239
focus take a few long slow deep breaths

37
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:16,239
really to feel those breaths to feel the body move and expand and contract as you breathe

38
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:23,440
deeply and to feel all the different places in your

39
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:30,400
body that move as you breathe in deeply as you exhale fully

40
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,160
all the places that move and when you breathe these are the places

41
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:48,720
to remember these are the places where we wake up the place of awareness

42
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:56,000
places for awareness to be aware and

43
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,840
then letting your breathing return to

44
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,918
normal and

45
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,520
and perhaps as you relax your body further there's a way of relaxing into the body

46
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:35,680
breathing maybe relaxing the belly

47
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:43,520
so there's more room and space to feel and sense the breathing body

48
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:52,000
so there's less restrictions

49
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,680
holding of the breathing

50
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:06,000
relaxing the belly

51
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,120
and perhaps there can be a relaxing of the chest

52
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:21,840
relaxing around the diaphragms

53
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,280
maybe as you

54
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:38,319
exhale maybe as you inhale at the top of the inhale

55
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,918
relaxing softening so the inhale can be fuller

56
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,720
not forcefully but naturally

57
00:06:53,919 --> 00:07:03,840
at the end of the exhale let there be a relaxation so the exhale continues a bit

58
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,560
here and now breathing

59
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:23,280
and allowing yourself to be simple

60
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:30,400
simply with the breathing

61
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,240
for these minutes trusting

62
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:44,080
attention to your breathing as the one thing that you give yourself

63
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:51,440
over to relaxed in full

64
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:59,840
attention on breathing in and breathing out

65
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:26,720
remembering to be mindful of your breathing

66
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:35,440
and remembering that it's not just about breathing it's also about the awareness of

67
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:41,440
breathing the awareness that receives and all

68
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,480
contains breathing

69
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,240
the awareness that arises out of

70
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,839
breathing

71
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,840
so

72
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,840
so

73
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,840
so

74
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,840
so

75
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:21,840
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

76
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:32,000
to let go of focusing on the breathing and remember the world

77
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:40,720
remember others in your life in your communities

78
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,520
even those in the news and those you read about

79
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:52,080
and people you don't know far flung around the globe

80
00:27:53,039 --> 00:28:02,159
remember that we share this planet with others who also want to be happy

81
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:10,158
and safe and peaceful others who have beating hearts and

82
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,720
minds with dreams and wishes and

83
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,240
memories of life

84
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,919
and may we open our hearts to them

85
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:33,600
may we remember them as part of our human family

86
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:44,320
with all its diversity and may we wish

87
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:52,000
that our practice and our dedication to a mindful life a liberated life

88
00:28:52,000 --> 00:29:00,000
maybe wish that it supports them in some way or other so that they can be happy

89
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:09,440
so that they can be safe and peaceful so they can be free

90
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:16,320
may through the strength and the goodness of this practice we've done

91
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:22,960
help us to contribute to creating a better world

92
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,480
contribute to supporting others to feel happy and

93
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,799
and well may all beings

94
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:41,840
be happy

95
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:55,840
and then i don't have my bell here so we can my bow can be the end of the

96
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,760
the sitting thank you

97
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,320
so here

98
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:15,440
maybe the last talk in this five-part series on the dharma life though perhaps

99
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:21,039
all um talks are about the dharma life

100
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:26,640
i like the idea that a spiritual life

101
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:34,720
is also a life a spiritual life is a lived life

102
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:43,679
but a live life that's infused with dharma terms infused with

103
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:57,279
mindfulness awareness intentionality a certain kind of sense of purpose um

104
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:03,120
an orientation towards in radical non-harming of oneself and

105
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:09,600
others but it's something we bring to all our life and to

106
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:16,240
have the opportunity to live a dharmic life a contemplative life where we infuse our life with our

107
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:22,559
spiritual life or a spiritual practice it's such a wonderful privilege it's a wonderful honor

108
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:28,960
to be able to do this in this human life that we have and it's easy to want maybe to want to

109
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:37,519
do this but that um it's remembering to do it which is hard

110
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:45,760
and rather than having some high standard like now you're supposed to be mindful aware throughout the whole day non-stop

111
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:52,559
i think for most of us if we just increase the percentage of our presence our attention to life

112
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:58,960
and we'll get tremendous amount of benefit i suspect that if ten percent of the day

113
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:06,398
you were really mindful of what you're doing that they would transform your life in big ways

114
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,200
and so

115
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:18,640
um the

116
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:26,640
so i want to offer another practice today that you could do or another approach

117
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:35,200
you can do it to infuse your life your daily life with a sense of practice living a dharmic life and that is

118
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:43,120
uh when you do something just do that one thing to practice doing one thing at a time

119
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:50,080
and in a world where now a common expression is multitasking

120
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:59,600
single tasking is not maybe even it as much but to really be present for one when

121
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,720
you're doing something really be there for it and why is this useful

122
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:11,440
this is what we're trying to do when we meditate we're trying to really be present for what's happening in the moment

123
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:18,799
and just one thing at a time just really there for it it might switch and be aware of something else a moment later but

124
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:25,519
whatever is happening that he has to be there for it in the process of doing that we learn

125
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:32,720
how easily we're distracted and we learn how easily we're bored or cotton desires or caught in aversions to

126
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:39,679
what's happening and cotton preferences and fantasies and we have to learn to

127
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:47,600
work with this mind that gets all entangled in these things and begin to uh learn to shed them not to

128
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:54,000
have them get in the way and uh to somehow the meditation to learn to be simpler and in that

129
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,799
simplicity to relax deeply and get in touch with ourselves in a much deeper way than we can

130
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:10,480
when we're spinning around in preferences desires aversions distractions and so this remembering

131
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:17,040
is to come home to ourselves to really be here in a deep intimate connected way that comes from

132
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,398
having a somewhat simple mind not a simplistic mind but a mind that is

133
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:27,599
not caught up in many many things and so to the benefits of in meditation

134
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:35,200
of feeling that simplicity of mind and non-destructibility of the mind just being here for this moment

135
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:40,800
we learn so much about ourselves in that process we learn to let we learn what makes us tick we learn to

136
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:48,720
let go of we learn what it's like to connect to ourselves in a peaceful way in a wonderful way so we can do the same

137
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:55,520
thing in daily life no matter in most things if that are simple enough that allows us to do that

138
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:01,200
one thing and and have it be the same way as with meditation

139
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:06,800
if you're washing the dishes just wash the dishes don't have the news on at the same time

140
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:13,119
because you know you want to be efficient and and do more than one thing at the same time and hear the news might as well

141
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:18,800
hear them while you're washing dishes dishes are kind of mindless and have no important

142
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:27,200
great value so might as well listen to the news or the soap opera or whatever but

143
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,240
if you infuse washing dishes dishes with the same kind of attention and

144
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:40,160
purpose and practice as you do in meditation just do the dishes and you get bored

145
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:46,720
learn to content work with that and let go of it or sometimes boredom just means that you're holding yourself apart from the

146
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:53,599
experience and so can you give yourself more to the experience just the washing the dishes

147
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:58,960
just you and the dishes and then wash with both hands while wash their

148
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:05,680
whole body present there and then that kind of focus and attention will certainly reveal

149
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:12,160
all the ways the mind wants to escape and do something else but in the process you also learned how

150
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:18,400
to quiet the mind or let go of these preoccupations and you learn how to simplify the mind

151
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:24,240
and to experience the benefits and the intimacy and the coming at home this with ourselves

152
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,599
of just being there for that one thing and that can be for all kinds of things

153
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:35,838
we do it can be cooking cleaning driving

154
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:42,320
just drive you know driving maybe involves many different senses and many different considerations you know your mind's

155
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:49,920
moving around rear view mirror side view mirror front looking just do what driving requires of you

156
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:56,400
don't have the radio on don't be talking on the phone just do this if you want to get the benefits of this

157
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,839
really being having the practice grow in your daily life

158
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:08,960
and some people will say complain and say well i have a lot to do and i need to multitask maybe that's so

159
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:14,720
so maybe please do it if that's necessary but sometimes things are done more

160
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,839
efficiently if you just do one thing at a time you do it properly the first time it

161
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:26,079
doesn't have to be done again you do it fully and so you don't have to come back to it later

162
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:33,440
and you understand it fully just this just this and

163
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:40,560
so what's one of the advantages of monastic life the monastic life that i led lived is that

164
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:47,440
you're given different tasks through the day where really what's called on is just do one thing at a time

165
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:54,400
um uh raking the uh temple grounds just rake uh you know washing dishes

166
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:00,320
i was a dishwasher in the monastery my first summer there and and uh so i spent this it was just me in

167
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,599
the dishwashing machine and so rather than washing of the sink i had this wonderful dance

168
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:13,040
of um completely being in the dishwashing shack and and um it was it was vigorous and active

169
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:19,440
work it wasn't like calm and relaxed but it was just beautiful and for me it was kind of dance of

170
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:25,200
putting dishes in and away and washing and and just gave myself over to what was

171
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:31,280
needed then doing one thing at a time does not mean that we do everything slowly

172
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,640
though sometimes it's delicious to do with that and very helpful we do it at a pace that's useful

173
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:42,400
sometimes doing one thing fully means we give ourselves over fully in a very full and active way

174
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:48,560
i worked at a after i was in the monastery i worked at a as a at a restaurant kind of as a little bit

175
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:54,400
of a fest you know as well as a line cook on a restaurant very busy restaurant

176
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:59,760
and and i was doing a lot of different things in a sense i was multitasking different

177
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:05,280
cooking different dishes at the same time tracking them but that's all i did i was completely absorbed in this

178
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,640
activity and this concentration absorption and what i was doing was you know i

179
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:17,280
would leave that leave work feeling more relaxed than when i came in because of giving myself over to really do this one

180
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:23,680
activity and so if you're if you're protesting a little bit that you can't do one thing

181
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,800
at a time you might experiment with it and find out if it doesn't actually

182
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:35,359
give you more ease in your life give you more relaxation maybe you don't have to spend time

183
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:40,800
afterwards relaxing as much relaxing is a wonderful thing but if you don't need to relax

184
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:46,560
and you can continue living your life in a nice nice way and there's a doing one thing

185
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:51,760
at a time and then sustaining it and really

186
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:57,760
following through on it to the end many years ago i discovered that when um

187
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:05,839
when i was i left the monastery i was living in a in a house that um how easy it was to go

188
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:11,280
one end of the house to the other to get the laundry out of the washing machine to the dryer and get

189
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:18,079
distracted by things little tasks that we do here and there and stop and it took a while to get to the laundry

190
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:23,520
area and and so sometimes i felt just nice to if i

191
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:29,920
the purpose is to go to the laundry area just go there so they get the the body and the mind

192
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:35,040
gets the sense of what it's like to kind of just do one thing and

193
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:40,880
not bounce around and not be busy or grabbing at everything that

194
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:48,400
comes up and um and uh so sustain follow through if you really

195
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:55,280
set yourself to do something with that you know unless something important comes up of course follow through as long as it's kind of

196
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:01,440
so you can just give yourself the pleasure the joy just doing one thing and for practitioners it's more than the

197
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:08,319
pleasure and the joy it's so that we're doing the same exploration of our inner life as we do in meditation

198
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:13,920
we're learning to let go of what doesn't serve us what's unhealthy we're learning to wake up

199
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:19,200
to the what's the present moment and we're learning to have some continuity with doing that

200
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,960
and that continuity is so beneficial continuity is what allows something to

201
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:31,680
dharma life to unfold and deepen so i end this five part series with

202
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:37,359
something which i think is quite simple in principle yesterday was more complicated

203
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:42,560
with the idea of intention and commitment and sense of purpose why we do things

204
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:48,160
and now today i'm bringing it back to the value of just something that's

205
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:53,520
ordinary simple i i hope almost anyone can do it doesn't take a lot of intelligence it doesn't

206
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,720
take a lot of sophistication and that is when you're doing something

207
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:06,960
just do it do it fully so i'll end the story with a story of two zen students

208
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:12,079
that's how that's how the story was told to me two zen students were

209
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:18,240
praising their own teachers and one of them says oh my teacher is so wonderful

210
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:25,520
has all these psychic powers can fly through the air and walk on water and and such so forth

211
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:33,599
and the other student said oh my teacher is really great too because my teacher

212
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:39,280
when she walks she just walks when she sits she just sits when she works it

213
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,480
just works and the first student said oh your teacher is really great

214
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:52,079
now that is wonderful so walk when you walk sit when you sit

215
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:59,839
clean when you're clean talk with friends as you when you talk um this is a great power

216
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:05,680
and uh and it's a gift to the world that we give ourselves to each thing

217
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:12,078
that we do carefully so thank you
