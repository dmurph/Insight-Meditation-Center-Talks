1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:05,600
well good evening everyone welcome

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,480
last week diana asked me if i would give a talk this evening since both

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,880
she and gil are teaching a a week-long retreat at irc

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,279
and it's been several years since i've given a talk so

5
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,920
a little rusty so hopefully you'll um

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,399
so hopefully you'll bear with me

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,680
uh i thought tonight i would talk a little bit about

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,960
what brought me to practice what what brought me to

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:02,000
imc and also what keeps me practicing what supports the continual practice

10
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:10,960
so i'll start with a little bit of history i came to imc in

11
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:17,520
january of 1998 when we were meeting in palo alto

12
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,079
and the reason i came was because i

13
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:32,880
there was an inescapable unsatisfactoriness in my life

14
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,799
i had good friends i had a good job good health

15
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,920
and yet there was something that just seemed uh off

16
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:52,880
you know i couldn't put my finger on it um i couldn't quite get any of the usual

17
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,159
remedies for dissatisfaction or unhappiness

18
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:04,960
that are offered by our culture to really work as well as i'd like it to

19
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:14,480
and so a friend of mine had told me about spirit rock a meditation center up in marin county

20
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,760
and i looked at their website and one of their links was to this place in palo

21
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,200
alto insight meditation center which was only about

22
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,840
10 minutes from where i lived so i went there

23
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,959
and on the very first night gill was just finishing

24
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,319
the last of a four-week series on the fornible truths

25
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:49,040
and in i'll summarize those rather briefly

26
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,840
he was talking about how there's this thing called dukkha

27
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,680
sometimes you're translated as suffering or stress

28
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,440
or dissatisfaction one teacher

29
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:14,080
translates it as a bummer-ness the bummer-ness of a life

30
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:20,400
so it can come in all sorts of forms and intensities but basically this

31
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,560
this dissatisfaction which i was feeling

32
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,879
and the teaching around that calling it a noble truth was

33
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,799
that rather than trying to push it aside or coveter it over or replace it with

34
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,000
something else the instruction was to really pay

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,920
attention to it that there was some value something important

36
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,439
about investigating this unsatisfactoriness this

37
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:02,640
this dukkha as he called it so it was both the first noble truth was

38
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,720
both both a description but also an encouragement

39
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:16,079
for action to really recognize it when it was operating

40
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:24,079
it required some action on my part on the part of a meditator

41
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,639
the second noble truth was that there's a cause for this

42
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:37,280
and the cause is clinging trying to hold on

43
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,199
if it's a pleasant experience trying to hold on to the pleasantness hold on to

44
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,800
something or if it's unpleasant experience trying

45
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,720
to hold on to the absence of this experience

46
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:02,080
and of course the problem with that is that the things that one often tries to cling to are

47
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,320
uncling-able if that's a word that they're you you that there are things that you just

48
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,919
can't cling cling to because they're going to change

49
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,199
they come about by conditions and they disappear when

50
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,639
conditions change and so it's not that we can make

51
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:31,680
our experience just the way we want it but it's how we're relating to this

52
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,600
this experience this this taking this attitude that we're going to try to hold on

53
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,880
for dear life to something that can't be held onto

54
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:53,280
and the action associated with that is to release the clinging somehow to

55
00:05:53,280 --> 00:06:01,680
release the third noble truth has to do with

56
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:10,240
experiencing the ending of dukkha the ending of suffering

57
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:17,199
and that's something to be realized and this might not even be

58
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:24,720
like a once and you're done experience it might be that the clinging ends

59
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,080
and the suffering ends for a second

60
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:37,199
for a minute for an hour however long undoubtedly you'll start clinging again

61
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:43,520
but you know just having that recognizing that experience of

62
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,520
at least temporarily being free of the dukkha

63
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,199
is something to be experienced

64
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:01,440
and then finally the fourth noble truth was that there's a path

65
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:08,960
to be developed so that this this recognition this release and this

66
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:15,800
experience of freedom can come more often

67
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,639
and when i heard that talk i knew

68
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,960
this is the place for me to be you know gil was talking about exactly what i was

69
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:37,759
experiencing and offering a certain i'll say a certain hope

70
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:44,800
that through practice through actions of my my own

71
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,199
i could lead a life with less dissatisfaction or maybe more

72
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,199
satisfaction more happiness

73
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:03,520
and that was just transformational for me to hear that talk

74
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:12,319
um and so i found him inspiring

75
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,360
now at that point i didn't know i had heard about this mindfulness meditation but i had

76
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,440
really never learned how to do it or what it was that first night i had

77
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:30,560
i had over the previous uh six or seven years i had learned transcendental meditation so

78
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,880
i did that the first night and then fortunately the the very next monday

79
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,560
there was an introduction introductory course to mindfulness meditation

80
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:49,760
45 minute course and it was taught by this woman margaret

81
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:56,480
and she explained to us about paying attention to the the

82
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,880
the very simple experiences that of life you know of the breath of

83
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:11,040
bodily sensations of of emotions of thoughts

84
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,880
and the thing that struck me was just her presence

85
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:23,519
she had she was kind she was thoughtful

86
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,800
there's a serenity about her and i remember after the end of the

87
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:35,839
first class that i took with her thinking that if she's the product of this

88
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:42,800
practice this is what i want to be doing i want the qualities that she's

89
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,880
expressing and even though i had taken the course the

90
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,560
next month i took it again just to have more of that same experience of

91
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,360
of being in her presence

92
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:08,399
um so uh the inspiration from gil and the uh

93
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,120
the clarity and the the uh

94
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:21,440
cognitive experience of hearing his his dharma talk and the following week having this

95
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,440
experience of the presence that margaret displayed

96
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,680
really let me know that i was on i was where i wanted to be or at least

97
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,079
starting a path starting a practice

98
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:46,560
and in the coming months about half the time gil would have a guest speaker

99
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,880
often people from spirit rock or from san francisco zen center

100
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,839
some various monastics and some people that came from i don't know

101
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:03,760
where but they were all inspiring

102
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,800
and one of the things that i also liked about imc in that in those first

103
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,320
weeks and months that i was there was that

104
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:24,480
people are just left you alone it was fine to just come in

105
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,680
sit listen to the talk and then

106
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,519
just walk out into the night you know luxuriating in what i had just heard you

107
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:42,560
know just reflecting on it thinking about it feeling what it felt like to

108
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:50,160
have heard these teachings that i had never heard before

109
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:56,399
and i didn't have to stop and chit chat i didn't have to put on a social persona

110
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:02,639
or explain explain why i was there and i

111
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:10,160
didn't have to explain myself i could just i could just come and go and people left me alone

112
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,200
and i really valued that for uh

113
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:21,240
a number of months i i don't know exactly how long

114
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,600
and i really saw it as a solitary practice like this is something that i'm

115
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,519
doing for me it's my happiness

116
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,480
my tranquility my peace of mind

117
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:48,560
and in some ways that's true i mean nobody nobody can meditate for you

118
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,720
nobody can listen to talks for you nobody can have the insights that come

119
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,320
from this practice you can't job it out it's it requires

120
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:08,160
your own inspiration motivation determination

121
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,760
uh you know you've you've there there's some part of it

122
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:19,760
that really takes your commitment and your time and your

123
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:25,040
energy to do the practice

124
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,760
over time i don't know maybe that within four to eight months roughly although

125
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,120
it's it's it's a little hard for me to remember back then

126
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:46,160
i noticed that i wanted to talk to people about the practice i wanted to talk to someone

127
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:53,040
and i found that my non-practicing friends although they would be patient with me they'd listen

128
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,639
they just couldn't figure out what i was talking about or why

129
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:04,959
you know why would you pay attention to dissatisfaction why would you pay attention to suffering it just didn't

130
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:10,320
didn't make sense to them and i was

131
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:18,959
knew enough that i i couldn't really put this in words that that maybe made

132
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:24,800
sense for example like when i talked about doing

133
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,959
meta loving-kindness practice where you wish well

134
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:36,000
for someone even though they they're not wishing

135
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,839
well back for you you know this sort of unilateral well-wishing for other

136
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:49,120
people um you know wasn't the usual transactional

137
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:55,600
well-wishing that people were used to you know they said well if they if the person doesn't wish

138
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:02,959
you well back i mean how long is that going to last you're going to give up pretty quickly so that was just one example of the kind of

139
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:08,480
thing that i was learning about that just didn't connect

140
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:15,519
and so about the time that i was wanting to talk to other people

141
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,519
a couple of people that were also monday night regulars started coming up to me and saying well

142
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:28,720
how'd you like to have coffee you know like how about if we meet for a meal before the monday nights sit

143
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:35,120
and let's let's talk about this and so i formed a few uh informal

144
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:41,839
uh friendships that way and you know started to have a few discussions

145
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,639
and i also thought well if i want to talk about this

146
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,759
what i really need to do is talk with a master

147
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:02,800
the maestro like gil so i went to him and you know i i think i asked him if he would meet with me

148
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,399
once a week to have a discussion and you know he was like well he you

149
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:14,720
know he wouldn't do that but uh i could schedule interviews with him and so for a time i

150
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:21,360
met with him about once a month um

151
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:28,000
and those were useful for me uh although i did find that

152
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:35,120
maybe not consciously or not subconsciously i really wanted

153
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,800
i wanted to look good in his eyes i wanted to be a good buddhist

154
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:47,040
and at some point he related to me this story that when he was

155
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:54,720
a young zen practitioner at san francisco zen center that one of his teachers

156
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,000
told him that much of what he was going to learn about

157
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:08,079
buddhism he was going to learn from his peers and when he told me that i

158
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:14,160
sort of thought that it was a polite brush off i didn't you know thought he

159
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:20,240
was like yeah you know talk to some of these other people

160
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:27,280
but i took him at his word and i found that that actually was true that i that

161
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:33,120
there was a way that um having these discussions

162
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,559
about the things that i didn't understand i'm not sure that i believed or

163
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:44,400
had experienced with other people really helped the practice that it that

164
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,919
it wasn't just about learning facts or learning

165
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:56,400
from somebody that had already experienced things but it was the talking to other people about it

166
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:02,400
um a questioning that really

167
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,360
helped clarify things for me

168
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:16,880
and so the next year i did a a 10-day retreat with gil and two of his friends

169
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,320
john and mary and on that retreat i learned several

170
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:29,039
things those teachers started to say

171
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:35,360
more than once that we don't do this practice for ourselves alone

172
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:42,559
now i kind of thought that i was doing this for myself alone you know i didn't

173
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:50,000
it was fine with me if other people benefited from it but i didn't that wasn't my motivation to uh

174
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:57,080
to support other people or to to to benefit them in some way

175
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,880
but on that retreat i noticed what support i was getting from the other

176
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:10,000
yogis we weren't talking to each other but just the fact that other people were

177
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,640
showing up and sitting you know session after session

178
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:23,120
was inspiring and helped me keep sitting even though it was a

179
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,720
you know periods of of of pain you know to to just sit for 45

180
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:35,919
minutes at a time one person in particular who was um

181
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:41,840
inspiring to me was there was a woman that was sitting there retreat who was i think

182
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,600
eight months pregnant now from what i understand

183
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:53,360
at that point in pregnancy you're probably uncomfortable all the time

184
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,400
the body's just and yet she was just sitting there so

185
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:04,159
still with a serene look on her face and i just thought wow

186
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:10,720
that is that was inspiring to me you know and that she was doing it not

187
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:17,039
only for herself but i imagined doing it also for this soon-to-be-born

188
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:22,559
uh child and so there was a way in which my heart

189
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:27,840
opened um by being around

190
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,440
the other practitioners

191
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,320
and after that retreat i i found myself

192
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,919
making friends with some of the other yogi's on that retreat andrea fellow was

193
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:52,480
on that retreat jen lemus and

194
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,200
some other other people who are now teachers

195
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:06,640
and so i did start to get that sense of oh yeah maybe maybe there is something that

196
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:15,960
is going on beyond this particular body this particular heart and mind

197
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:24,640
and then less than a year later that the following spring i did a 14-day retreat with gil

198
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,720
and because so many people had cancelled it turned out it was just gill and 12

199
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,640
yogis at this little zendo uh

200
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,679
jikoji up on skyline and

201
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:52,559
there was such an intimacy to it it rained the first 12 of the 14 days

202
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:57,600
it was cold we just had a couple little uh wood

203
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:03,440
stoves to keep us warm in which you know one person this guy peter would just

204
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:09,760
like every between every sitting he'd put more wood in the fire he kept us warm he

205
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:16,559
took care of us the water system broke so we had no running water we had to

206
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:24,639
bathe in the pond and carry water from the creek for other dishwashing and

207
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:32,400
the local fire department brought in drinking water for us each day but there was something up

208
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,240
about about that particular retreat that made

209
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,159
me feel so close to these other people i mean these other 11 people well 12

210
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,799
including gil

211
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:59,600
yeah that it it's a retreat i'll never forget i mean it was it was on the antithesis of some of

212
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:05,840
these uh golden palace type retreat centers where it's you know it's warm and it's

213
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:13,280
comfortable and every you know the lights go on and off on their own this was really just

214
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,200
pretty primitive but um

215
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,559
but because there were so few people gill would give us interviews every single day

216
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:31,600
and at the end of that retreat i was invited

217
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,440
by a couple that was on it to join what they call the kaliana mita group

218
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:45,519
sometimes it's translated as spiritual friends or beautiful friends

219
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:56,080
people that wanted to talk about the dharma and about their experiences

220
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:01,600
and create a sense of community

221
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:08,480
and so i didn't know what this what this was but since they invited me

222
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:15,440
i thought well at least go a couple of times and see see what's what's up with it

223
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:22,960
um and

224
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,880
you know we would always start we'd always sit together for 45 minutes we'd have a meal together so there was that

225
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,320
sense of community from sharing a meal and then we did this thing called a

226
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,919
listening circle where we'd set a timer

227
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:46,240
and each person had something like about maybe four to six

228
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,440
minutes to say whatever it was they wanted to say

229
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,880
and everyone else just listened there was no

230
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:03,279
questions or comments or advice or

231
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,200
clarifications one person just said whatever it was

232
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,480
that wanted to be said including nothing at all and everyone

233
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,400
else just was as present as they could be just listened

234
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,840
um and at first you know i would sort of

235
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:32,320
plan well what am i going to say and what's you know what i need to i need to get this i need to

236
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:38,159
rehearse what i'm going to say but over time i came to trust

237
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:45,200
that what wanted to be heard from me would emerge i didn't need to plan it i didn't need

238
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:52,159
to you know somehow have some agenda

239
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:59,440
that as we trusted each other and the and the listening

240
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:06,559
deepened uh that i learned to trust myself i learned to trust that what wanted to be

241
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,840
seen would emerge

242
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:18,559
i also learned that four or five minutes can go by pretty fast

243
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:23,600
and so that it was important to really

244
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:30,640
in some ways get to the point you know to

245
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:39,039
to not waste time on things that weren't so important but really kind of

246
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:45,679
you know what what's really going on you know some deep honesty

247
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:53,679
and so that was very helpful for me you know particularly talking about

248
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:59,919
um what was working for me in practice and

249
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:06,200
also what wasn't what you know where where was i stuck

250
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,760
that group lasted about uh two years roughly

251
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:17,039
and then the couple moved away and then i was invited into another

252
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:23,840
group and that group i still meet with we've been meeting now

253
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,039
for about 20 years

254
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:35,760
and then over time there were some neighborhood groups that i was in

255
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:41,440
there's one that i'm in right now in mountain view

256
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:50,559
each group has a somewhat different structure way of doing things

257
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:57,200
but the commonality is that willingness to listen to each other

258
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,480
and trust that

259
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,600
we can talk about what what's going on in

260
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,039
practice for us

261
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:22,799
one of the things i like to say is it's a great pro it's a great place to talk about how you fail as a buddhist

262
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:28,720
you know there's a lot of times when you you know you you like to think of yourself as this

263
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,320
swell well-practiced buddhist person um

264
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:40,320
and there's a value in that but there's also value in seeing you know talking about what

265
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:47,919
you know kind of what um what things aren't working what you know

266
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,080
what it what have you done that you regretted

267
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:59,120
um and that's for me that's really been a way to grow

268
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,480
in a way that i don't think i could do just on my own if i was just sitting at

269
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:10,639
home meditating and listening to talks and reading books

270
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:17,039
um for a while it was in a group that was

271
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:24,960
supporting somebody that was dying somebody that had cancer and we thought it was only going to last a few weeks

272
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,600
and he ended up lasting a couple years

273
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:38,000
i started another group thinking about peers since i'm a

274
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:44,640
senior age male i started a group of other senior age males

275
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:50,480
and so we could talk about uh

276
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:56,320
you know what it's like to have a body that's breaking down you know that's

277
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:03,679
that's starting to starting to fail and and how what do we still aspire to what keeps us

278
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:09,279
practicing how to how to become

279
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,520
uh

280
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:22,679
not resigned to but in accord with our mortality

281
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:29,360
so those those are some of the things that came out of that group

282
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:36,399
i was also in the social group called the dharma friends where we would go and see movies or go

283
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:41,440
for hikes there's a book group

284
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:49,000
that's started back in the 90s that's still meeting here once a month

285
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:56,159
so i'm telling you all of this because uh my belief

286
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:02,320
is that that it's there's a real value

287
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:09,760
in connecting with others in this practice there's a saying that i've heard

288
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:15,039
over a number of times about how one of the buddha's disciples

289
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:20,559
had one time told somebody that noble friends and noble

290
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:25,919
conversations are half of the holy life

291
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:34,480
and the buddha corrected him and he said no it's not half of the holy life it's it's all of the holy life

292
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,919
so our the way we

293
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:49,840
respond to support or in community with others

294
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:57,840
is integral to this process of becoming free

295
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:05,360
i don't really know if it's possible to become free on your own

296
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:12,399
um so i'd like to encourage people

297
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:18,559
to start well so first of all i want to say i know the value of solitude and and

298
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:24,880
that was really important to me being able to practice without being

299
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:33,120
um involved in a social interaction that was

300
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:39,440
unwelcome and i'd also like to encourage people

301
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,960
that feel like they're at a point where they want to be able to connect with other people

302
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,640
to look for ways to connect i know it's been difficult over the last

303
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:57,120
couple years with the pandemic you know at one point we used to have like

304
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:04,080
60 or 80 people in this room on a monday night you know now we've got a handful

305
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:09,440
um but there are

306
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,720
there are um virtual ways of meeting uh sunday mornings

307
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:21,120
there's a a zoom after the sunday talk people are starting to meet out in the

308
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,880
parking lot outside of imc on on monday sunday mornings

309
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:32,960
uh there's a lot of small group discussion that goes on through the

310
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:40,799
um what is it oh the the happy hour groups monday through friday

311
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:46,720
there's the way of meeting people through either day long

312
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:54,480
classes or there are some even like eight to 12 month classes that are being

313
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,679
offered now by imc and other places

314
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:07,760
just this afternoon i was in the dharma mentor training program where we we meet once a month

315
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:13,280
and split split off into small groups to talk

316
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,560
i think gil and diana are offering some courses on

317
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:27,040
ethics as enlightenment and to others that that they rotate through so

318
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:33,679
i can't give you an exhaustive list of how you might make the kind of

319
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:40,720
connections to support practice through

320
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:46,960
dialogue but if you i'm sure if you start looking around

321
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,878
you'll you'll find ways so

322
00:34:54,399 --> 00:35:00,560
so i appreciate your tuning in tonight to this talk

323
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:06,720
and i'll be available for questions or comments

324
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:13,440
for the next couple minutes either from those of you who are here at imc in person or

325
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,480
um nancy will monitor the chat on youtube

326
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,520
if you want to offer a question that way so

327
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,760
thank you

328
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,599
jim um this is nancy um

329
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:55,200
can you say more about the groups that you are part of um are those ones the

330
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:01,839
neighborhood groups that you can sign up through the website or did you

331
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:08,079
create a group on your own uh yeah that's a that's a good question this was i think the first group was

332
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:14,960
maybe 10 or 15 years ago and about every three years imc would

333
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,079
put out a call for if people were interested in joining a group

334
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:25,280
that they could send in their

335
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,400
contact information and their zip code and they would be matched with other

336
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:38,400
people and usually those groups started out with a kind of a fixed

337
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:45,040
agenda you know readings and things like that and then might over time

338
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:50,240
uh deepen um i don't know whether they're doing

339
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:55,520
that right now but if you're interested i'm sure that if you send an email to the

340
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:01,920
main imc email site

341
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:08,480
that they could let you know what's available some of the groups the first group that

342
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,160
i was in lasted for maybe four years and then disbanded

343
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,200
another one that was an existing group that had was already

344
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:26,000
ongoing invited me to join them and that that one i imagine going for

345
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,200
some time so i think if you contact imc they could

346
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:37,640
let you know what uh what groups are available

347
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:45,839
i know that there are links on imc website for

348
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:52,720
individual practice discussion with a teacher and then group practice discussions

349
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:59,200
and i believe that you need to email to get hooked up with a neighborhood

350
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:04,560
sangha that meets regularly i think that's right

351
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:10,720
um and the sati center also is

352
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:19,119
teaching a number of classes that gil and a number of other teachers

353
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:26,000
have small groups great thank you thank you nancy

354
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:32,960
yeah oh well not one other um

355
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,960
program that imc has is this eightfold path program it's

356
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:44,800
i think the eightfold path is a nine month series and

357
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:50,560
that has small group interactions every month for each of the

358
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:57,200
elements and if you want you can sign up to get a mentor so you can

359
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:02,480
have somebody to talk to once a month that can

360
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:08,400
offer encouragement and sound you out that way so that

361
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:15,200
the current cycle i think is just coming to an end right now but it usually starts again in the fall maybe

362
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,838
september

363
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:27,440
jim one other thing is that there is a new

364
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:33,119
beginner meditation program that's starting in august

365
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:38,720
that we'll be meeting in person at imc okay

366
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:44,640
it's supposed to be on the calendar already okay so that what you said that was in august

367
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,880
yeah so there's also an introductory meditation course in-person course that's starting in august so that's

368
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:57,800
another way to make connection

369
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,200
do you see anything on the

370
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:27,040
thank you very much i appreciate what you had to share uh definitely

371
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,230
identify with that dissatisfaction and bummer-ness so

372
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:37,119
[Music] i guess i'm in the right place too

373
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,480
yeah it's about it's about finding your own path and i'm

374
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:48,720
trying to figure out how to how to do that so all of these suggestions are of

375
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:54,160
lots of different things different ways to start down a path is is

376
00:40:54,160 --> 00:41:01,599
a little overwhelming but also very helpful so thank you on that and then

377
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:08,880
um i hear a lot of from people that

378
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:14,960
practice about you know letting go

379
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:21,040
and i imagine that's letting go of the suffering or

380
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:28,400
i i don't know what that means when people say oh you know it's all the first step is letting it letting go okay

381
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,520
let i i get the concept of clinging but if i'm

382
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:40,160
already just kind of softening yeah then what what does it

383
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:45,599
mean to let go yeah well that's an excellent question i mean

384
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:52,880
you know i'd start with just saying that that's like what does it mean to let go um

385
00:41:53,359 --> 00:42:01,319
i'm trying to remember there was one of the one of the monastics said that um

386
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:10,360
something like 80 percent of the time they're sitting in meditation [Music]

387
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:17,920
knowing they need to let go and can't so i don't think that it's strictly

388
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:25,280
something that the ego or the intellect can do i think it's

389
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:31,280
to a certain extent it's seeing the suffering

390
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:38,079
and seeing what is it that what is it that we're just not

391
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:44,480
um you know if you can see the connection between what you're clinging to and the

392
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:50,000
suffering then the clinging may

393
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:56,560
dissolve on its own but you i don't i i believe you can't make

394
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:04,400
it happen and you can't definitely make it happen on your time schedule you know it's it's kind of it's kind of

395
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:11,359
like sitting with it until so don't just knock three times and turn around yeah

396
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:17,680
okay yeah so thank you

397
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:29,200
okay okay well it's um one minute to nine so

398
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:34,000
thank you all for your attention and

399
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:41,800
if this has been helpful then

400
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:48,160
stay with it and if it's not helpful just let it go

401
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,720
thank you
