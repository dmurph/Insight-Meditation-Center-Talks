39
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:10,639
and for today's practice together um i'd like to offer a practice

40
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:17,039
of um conti as we continue exploring and practice the formal practice of

41
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:24,880
opeca opeca equanimity cultivating equanimity

42
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:31,600
and the category we'll work with today is the benefactor

43
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,479
and benefactor is someone who's supported us who's been there for us in

44
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:45,280
some way and maybe not in every aspect of our

45
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:51,520
lives but they've supported us and it could be a friend who's been for us in challenging times could

46
00:05:51,520 --> 00:06:00,160
be a parent could be a [Music] relative it could be a coach a teacher

47
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,440
someone whom we feel this relationship oh there are there are benefactors we've benefited

48
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:12,400
from their goodwill from their support in some way in our life again it doesn't have to be continuous

49
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:19,199
and all the time but maybe at some point either right now or at some point in our lives this benefactor has been of

50
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:26,560
support to us and regarding the practice of opica

51
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:34,240
practice of equanimity as as a cultivation practice since it is

52
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:41,199
the fourth brahmavihara up the word itself in pali

53
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:49,199
relates to meaning having it a wider perspective having a say bird's eye view

54
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:56,319
having seeing more fully having perspective so the idea of

55
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:04,400
cultivating equanimity is when you have a wider perspective instead of having a narrow perspective of

56
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,840
oh this is awful this is terrible they will never change or it's all my fault or their fault you

57
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,199
know the the or the rumination that our our human minds tend to do the loops we

58
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:22,080
tend to fall into if we make our perspective if we intentionally make our perspective

59
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,599
wider to look more more

60
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:35,280
fully as if you were sitting on top of a mountain and saying everything that's going on is happening

61
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:43,440
everything that has happened in the past will happen in the future right now for all beings this sense of

62
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:50,160
large perspective ah the heart relaxes the heart relaxes

63
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:56,960
when you see the perspective of what has been what may become the impermanence

64
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:05,759
all the causes and conditions the heart can relax with the space of equanimity equipoise

65
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,919
so we'll as always we'll start with

66
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:21,599
settling in with our breath our bodies

67
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:29,280
for the beginning of the practice for the first part roughly the first 10 minutes and then

68
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:37,279
we'll turn our attention to as i will guide us into cultivating

69
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:45,600
equanimity turning our hearts our minds towards equanimity for the life of the benefactor

70

218
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:10,560
for the benefit of the sangha so many different aspects and elements

219
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:18,480
to this nicholas please um an image that

220
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:25,280
was helpful or kind of resonated for me is i sit with my my one palm in the other palm

221
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:30,480
and the image was kind of you know the person is walking on the

222
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:36,000
earth and the earth is kind of this vast thing supporting them right and there's a care and the earth

223
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,920
meeting your feet like every step you take there this meeting gets so there's a care but it's very vast right it's not like

224
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:47,359
the earth is fixated on each little step that you take and i kind of just felt like

225
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:54,960
the there was a kind of vastness in my palms like my palms could kind of hold the person and kind of meet

226
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:01,839
with the same spaciousness that their feet meet the earth that helped me find kind of a lot of big

227
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:06,240
space to hold them and still care for them

228
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:14,000
beautiful thanks for sharing that nicholas i love i'm feeling into what you just

229
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,440
described this palm holding the other palm this physicality

230
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:25,040
of you actually feeling this ah the sense of support and then that connecting that

231
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:30,319
physicality that embodiment which i keep saying i sound like a broken record

232
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:38,319
this embodiment that you experience then bringing up the sense of ah stepping or being each step on this

233
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:47,440
earth being supported uh and this vastness is so much space um

234
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:54,400
you know the spaciousness of earth in a way which as i say that i think of there is a suta where um the

235
00:45:54,400 --> 00:46:02,000
the four elements so the the air element the spaciousness of how air space is is

236
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:09,920
so supportive and then the earth the expansiveness of earth uh being so supportive so the earth

237
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,960
element in this case that you brought into your practice so beautiful thank you for sharing that

238
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:28,400
that's lovely thanks nicholas

239
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:34,160

240
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:41,359
share how the weather was in bangkok it came in later when we had started the practice smoggy and humid here today but

241
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:48,800
there's blue in the sky that's almost like equanimity practice yeah smoggy and human but blue in the

242
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:54,839
sky can all be held in the expansiveness of the sky

243
00:46:54,839 --> 00:47:00,400
so other reflections other questions what did you notice what

244
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:06,720

245
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:11,838
all welcome

246
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:20,720
nancy says embracing the individual choices others make even though they may differ

247
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:28,079
from what we would do yes yeah yeah and for the heart to be

248
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:33,920
at peace with with those choices and with the unfolding that each being has

249
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:40,480
their own their own journey as we wish them well so

250
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:47,040
continuing to have the sense of care for them but this sense of spaciousness of space

251
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:52,559
earth etc so yeah i appreciate that

252
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:59,200
yeah any other reflections

253
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:07,839
questions comments complaints what did you observe

254
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:15,839
susan says i know that i need to hear about embodiment a trillion more times

255
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:23,119
thanks susan i will say it a trillion more more times every practice session

256
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:28,160
can't it's so important in practice i can't emphasize it enough

257
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:33,760
i think in my practice also when i discovered how important embodiment

258
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:40,319
and one reflection coming in i had a repetitive aloof voice that kept

259
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:47,359
repeating not my problem not my problem not my problem every time i tried to picture another

260
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:53,359
person's troubles okay great so glad you shared this this is fantastic

261
00:48:53,359 --> 00:49:01,599
so this will come up of course this will come up as i've mentioned near and far enemies so this

262
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:06,800
near enemy is uh it's kind of like not my problem kind of like aloofness not my

263
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:13,520
problem not my problem so so the invitation here if that comes up for you and for for others because it

264
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:22,559
will come up in this practice someone when you're practicing is to to first really connect

265
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:27,680
take a step back and go back into the sense of connection with the person

266
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:34,480
your care for the benefactor that you really care this person for having been there for you and being here

267
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:41,280
for you and really connecting with their humanity when that's really really established then

268
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:46,880
that might be a good time to then slowly bringing in the problem they're facing and then see

269
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,920
if that might be a gentler way to connect in this way so

270
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:58,720
that's an invitation there i hope that's helpful so

271
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:05,359
and kim says a thought of problems came into my head and i slid into practicing

272
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:10,720
equanimity with the issue and found spaciousness and peace ah nice

273
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:16,800
nice so the the practice of equanimity in this case turned to the

274
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:23,520
problems that came into your own head um and problem solving and ah economity

275
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:29,760
equanimity lovely great and that's perfectly fine too turning the practice where it's

276
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:35,950
appropriate where it's needed lovely so

277
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:44,160
[Music] dear ones ah with equanimity and spaciousness of

278
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:49,640
heart let's turn our hearts to supporting and practicing

279
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:54,800
spaciously with each other

280
00:50:54,800 --> 00:51:02,240
so the invitation now for the small groups is will

281
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:08,800
spend 30 seconds first with silent meta just wishing the others

282
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:14,400
well 30 seconds of silent meta connecting with their humanity

283
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:22,240
knowing that they're wishing us well in the same 30 silent seconds and then opening up to whatever you like

284
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:28,720
to share and i see a question that just came in i'll address this after we come back from small groups

285
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:34,079
so um yeah and see if you can have equanimity

286
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:41,839
and spaciousness either with a sense of space or sense of embodiment physicality the earth element

287
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:47,599
supporting yourself and inviting others to feel supported in your heart

288
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:55,200
in this way so let's see here

289
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:06,559
almost that you can practice continue to practice equanimity while i make the groups

290
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:15,200
here we go okay they are open now here we go

291
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:19,839
enjoy

292
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:33,920
you

293
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:39,839
uh

294
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:35,839
uh

295
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:45,839
okay

296
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:09,839
ugh

297
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:03,599
have a nice evening

298
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,119
okay welcome back everyone

299
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:26,880
welcome back so we have a couple minutes for reflections

300
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:32,079
oh actually i'll address the the question that came in just before we went into groups and

301
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:37,280
um and then i see marie christine's hand is up so so the question that came through was

302
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:44,319
how to help someone who's suffering and at the same time let them let them and understand that they have their own

303
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:51,440
journey that's a great question it's it's the both end right it's the both end of caring for

304
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:56,880
someone supporting them compassionately not saying oh you have your own journey you're suffering it's okay

305
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:02,960
you have your own journey we're not saying oh you know it's my i need to fix this for

306
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:10,400
you it's both it's it's really finding the balance and that's what makes being

307
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:16,240
human and having relationships and having a a compassionate heart makes it

308
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:23,599
interesting because you want to care of course and support for others but but realize that yes they

309
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:30,160
have their own journey so it's it's both and and um yeah there might be more to your

310
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:36,400
question might be more interactive but but i think at this point i'll leave at that and if there is more you can raise your

311
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:41,760
hand and can discuss but um marie christine please

312
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:48,079
i was explaining to the group that you know whilst we might be saying in equanimity um you

313
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:53,839
know i care for you i wish you well but i'm not responsible for your happiness or your sadness i kind of

314
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:59,040
think but we're not islands and what about the responsibility that perhaps i should take

315
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:05,119
if maybe my actions of the wrong speech have actually caused unhappiness i know it's quite common now to get to say oh you know you

316
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:11,440
can make choices and your study are responsible for how you feel but we're all interdependent and what

317
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:16,880
happens to that part where i have to take responsibility because maybe i put my foot in it and i've actually upset someone

318
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:22,000
yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly yeah so so this uh you know there are so many

319
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,200
different practices and there's the right practice at the right time and and having equine

320
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:35,280
