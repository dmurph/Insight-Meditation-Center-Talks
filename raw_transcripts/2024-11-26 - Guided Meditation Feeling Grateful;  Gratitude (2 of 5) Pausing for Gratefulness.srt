1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:09,759
so hello everyone and welcome and happy to be here with you

2
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:19,039
and so the topic this week is

3
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:25,920
gratitude and gratitude uh can be considered a

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,200
feeling first and foremost ideally there's a feeling a sense an

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:39,000
inner emotional quality of inspiration of a certain

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,960
kind that uh is the Awakening of gratitude within us it's possible to

7
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:52,280
calculate to understand that someone is doing something for us and to thank

8
00:00:52,280 --> 00:01:00,640
them and uh and offer the words and it can be sincerely offered

9
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,960
but for some reason what the per person has done has not really enter deeply

10
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:12,479
into our body into our hearts uh to uh

11
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:20,680
evoke an emotion of gratitude an emotion of appreciation an em an emotion of uh

12
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:30,520
inspiration that would like to acknowledge what's happened with the words thank you or a bow that's of in

13
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:36,798
often can be an expression of gratitude and

14
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,119
um they um and so to feel

15
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:47,399
grateful and I don't think it's something that we want to make ourselves

16
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:55,280
feel but we create the conditions for it the conditions for for gratitude to

17
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:02,039
arise when something what beneficial for us

18
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:07,759
arises and in meditation uh the Ben benefits can arise

19
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:15,239
that are from the meditation itself we can feel calmer we can

20
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:21,120
feel more peaceful we could feel more settled we could feel more connected to

21
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,640
ourselves we more at home there's all these kinds of uh benefits that can come

22
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:33,360
and many others we I could list and and but they kind of arise they emerge they

23
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:41,000
slowly kind of settle in and it can feel like a gift and I think of meditation as we

24
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:49,480
practice it that it gives a rise to lots of gifts the gifts of a of uh a quieter

25
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:55,159
mind the gift of concentration the gift of clarity the

26
00:02:55,159 --> 00:03:01,000
gift of understanding the gift of uh of loving

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,400
kindness or compassion all these things can arise and then when they arise and we feel

28
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:15,959
that benefit what are the conditions that allow us to feel grateful and one of those conditions is

29
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:21,680
feeling safe feeling that we're not contending with some threat feeling like

30
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:28,360
we're not feeling safe enough to allow something to relax the sense of caution

31
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:37,840
the sense of being on the defense the sense of uh IM imminent

32
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:45,080
danger maybe anxiety relaxes maybe fear

33
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,720
settles so to sit in a field of safety

34
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:57,159
is one of the functions of meditation and so today perhaps you can

35
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:04,200
call on that there might be dangers beyond the walls of your home or

36
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:09,920
place where you are there might be dangers lurking in the future and today where you're going

37
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,560
to go but to live with your

38
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,759
body caught in that danger is to

39
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:27,360
limit the intelligence the warmth the freedom the peacefulness to limit our

40
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,840
capacity to tap into deeper support for moving through our

41
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:41,720
day and so to sit appreciating whatever degree of

42
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:48,880
safety that's here and now at this very moment in this very place in the real

43
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:57,479
estate that you're sitting on that's all and if there is fear in

44
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:04,440
you there might also be over easily overlooked small places

45
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:10,800
within where it feels safe maybe your little finger feel safe

46
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,800
there's no threats to your little finger maybe your

47
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:27,400
earlobes maybe the back of your elbow maybe some part of breathing

48
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:37,360
and so to begin Gathering Together how you're safe in this

49
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,680
moment so that when the gifts

50
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,319
come something inside responds with

51
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:56,840
gratitude with acknowledgement that's deep enough that

52
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:05,120
something emotional is touched Within so to assume a meditation

53
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,039
posture and close the

54
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:22,240
eyes and even if you're feeling anxious even if you're feeling

55
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,960
tense to search through your body your mind your

56
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:34,000
heart for the little places the little moments of

57
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,960
safety the absence of fear the absence of feeling a

58
00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:01,160
threat and if there are small Pockets here and there throughout your body

59
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,479
your

60
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:17,960
mind taking a few deeper breaths that connects all those

61
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:25,879
places almost as if breathing in deeply allows something inside to

62
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:31,080
touch all the places of safety

63
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:40,840
and as you exhale a settling

64
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:47,479
relaxing if it helps you can even say gently the word

65
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,479
safe for

66
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:41,440
breathing normally and seeing if any part of the

67
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,560
cycle of breathing has a feeling of safety in

68
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:53,920
it or touches some place of safety Within

69
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:06,720
and as if breathing is a needle sewing safety

70
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,519
together so peace safety as you

71
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
breathe

72
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
for

73
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

74
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
for

75
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
for

76

for for

84
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:06,839
perhaps saying safe as you

85
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:14,560
exhale and in the wake of safe the wake of

86
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:23,399
exhale open up to feel more deeply the depths of

87
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:28,240
yourself open up to allow

88
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:38,680
the deeper feelings Sensations to have

89
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
time

90
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840

for for

96
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,840
the thinking mind will quickly go on to the next

97
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:08,799
issue the next preoccupation and not allow you time to

98
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:14,720
pause to feel and sense deeply into your

99
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:22,519
body maybe following the sensations of breathing deep in your

100
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,799
torso to feel and sense

101
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:33,639
maybe even an emotional Source

102
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
Within

103
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,520
for for

104
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,000
and feeling sensing inside

105
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:37,080
how you have benefited from this meditation the

106
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:43,919
goodness the pleasure of the meditation however

107
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:51,159
small are you a little more settled little more

108
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:55,159
relaxed calm

109
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,440
something eased up in

110
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:17,200
you do you feel more connected to

111
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:30,360
yourself allow yourself to feel these as gifts

112
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:34,960
gifts for the depths of your

113
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:49,840
being appreciating acknowledging those gifts

114
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:11,200
and if that appreciation comes out of the source of

115
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:20,919
your emotions might there be gratitude as

116
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320

118
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:56,120
and as we come to the end of the sitting

119
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:07,799
to make room for gratitude make room in your

120
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:13,679
heart make room in your torso your

121
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,120

awareness aware in a grateful way grateful to be

124
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:51,279
aware a gratitude that has a quality of tenderness in

125
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:59,080
it gratitude that maybe has a desire to say thanks

126
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:11,679
gratitude that might contain seeds of of Love

127
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:27,320
kindness and to end this meditation with an this expression of gratitude

128
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:40,559
I thank all that supports my life the animate and inanimate support

129
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:45,600
for how I live I thank the generations of

130
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:52,919
ancestors and Elders whose labor and Care made my life

131
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:02,799
possible I am thankful I give thanks for the safety and resources I have in a

132
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:06,840
world where many people don't have

133
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,240
this I am grateful for the goodness which has fed my

134
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:25,200
heart I am grateful for whatever health I

135

have I am grateful for the people in my

life and may I find gratitude in the ordinary events of the

137
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:53,200
day may it be that simple gratitude sprinkled

138
00:29:53,200 --> 00:30:00,039
through the day gratitude at the ordinary events of life

139
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:08,880
leads us to a greater appreciation and care for the people we will

140
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:17,559
encounter may all beings be happy may all beings be

141

safe may all beings be peaceful and may all beings be free

142
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:38,480
[Music]

143
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:48,158
[Music] thank

144
00:30:56,919 --> 00:30:59,919
you

145
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:30,919
e e

146
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:09,799
so hello and welcome to this second talk on gratitude

147
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:16,120
thankfulness and uh today I want to talk

148
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:22,399
about gratefulness as a emotion or a feeling

149
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:28,240
that we have inside that uh it's certainly possible

150
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:34,399
to be grateful uh on principle or on an intellectual understanding that someone

151
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:39,559
has done us a favor it could be that's a habit that someone does a small favor

152
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:45,760
does something nice that we say thank you uh someone opens the door thank you

153
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:52,600
and um someone hands us something thank you uh someone helps us in a store thank

154
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:58,519
you and um it's an acknowledgement and of what they've done it's kind of like

155
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:04,720
saying hello and acknowledging that someone is there they're seeing and um acknowled you know it's

156
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:10,120
kind of a clear acknowledgement but there's a difference

157
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:18,000
between doing it as a habit or doing it as intellectual acknowledgement of something and just and the feelings that

158
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,159
can arise to be really touched some people are moved to tears in in

159
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:28,480
gratefulness so moved by uh benefits someone has provided

160
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,960
I sometimes I've been deeply moved almost as tears uh watching or seeing or

161
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:39,639
knowing what someone has done for someone else and uh and it's so so

162
00:33:39,639 --> 00:33:44,760
moving for me and it's not exactly that I have get gratitude but it touches that

163
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:50,639
space inside where gratitude is born and so gratefulness to be a feeling a sense

164
00:33:50,639 --> 00:33:58,080
something goes deeper than just the mind it's not a calculation it's not a habit it's not merely an acknowledgement

165
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:06,039
and um maybe it's not even a acknowledgement it does appreciate what goes on but it's allowing the experience

166
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:12,158
we've had the gift we've been given to be

167
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:21,118
absorbed some people will very quickly uh try to respond to something has done for us

168
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:26,960
in a way that kind of little bit stops it from really sinking in maybe out of

169
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:33,638
embarrassment maybe out of out of um feeling of obligation or feeling even to

170
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:41,320
avoid a sense of obligation or something and one version of that is uh is to say

171
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:50,320
uh you know someone opens a door and say sorry sorry that I had to you had to open the door for me um and that uh that

172
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,638
sorry is taking in a very different feeling inside a very different sense of

173
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:01,359
who we are and how we are and what we deserve or something then I

174
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:06,800
thank you a Sor is not quite a gift a Sor is a

175
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:16,599
somehow a diminishing of ourselves lessening of ourselves so as not to bother someone else but um uh but uh to

176
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:23,920
say thank you thank you for opening the door thank you for what you've done uh

177
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:32,599
not sorry for the trouble that I caused you the um um because a sorry does

178
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:40,240
not um um create a it does not ignite something

179
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:46,160
good in the person it's a little bit like a praise it's a little bit like acknowledgement you've done something

180
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:52,040
good and that's you you know it's a wonderful thing you've done it's almost like taking the gift that someone has

181
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:57,440
done and building on it and letting it have a have a the goodness of it have an

182
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:04,119
honor ongoing life when we say sorry we it it stops there it blocks it

183
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:09,839
it the cycles of uh giving and receiving the cycles of how goodness can travel

184
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:16,640
and move back and forth through our society kind of comes to a screeching halt in ourselves with the

185
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:24,000
Sor and um and the gift stops there and so gratitude is a way for the

186
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,400
gift to keep giving and so we but we have to first be able to take it in the

187
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:36,319
goodness feel it in our in the chest in the heart in the belly wherever it is we

188
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:43,960
feel same place we feel love we can feel grateful and but that requires something

189
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:51,960
of us and uh and to live a life of gratitude is is to be concerned and

190
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:58,119
caring about the preparation the for it for gratitude or

191
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:03,880
being in a good state for gratitude um and it turns out that

192
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:10,680
preparing ourselves being ready being uh open to gratitude is the same state that

193
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:18,359
needs that's needed for mindfulness for awareness for love for a lot of different things so it's almost like

194
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:24,079
very state of pausing being receptive allowing ourselves take time to feel

195
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:29,160
what's happening wow so not not rushing to thank you but

196
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:34,960
like almost like wow and take it in and then thank

197
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:41,440
you if you do that the thank you has more power it's more embodied it's

198
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,960
Fuller the person can sense that you have really taken it in you understand

199
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:53,200
you've been changed wow thank you for that as opposed to thank you being a

200
00:37:53,200 --> 00:38:01,520
habit just a custom that we do so to take in to feel to allow it to be here

201
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:06,599
and one of the qualities I think it's worth mentioning that supports allowing

202
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:13,200
ourselves to feel and take in the goodness of the gifts whether it's from a person or from the meditation or from

203
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:18,680
just the air we breathe life itself one of those things that gives us a chance

204
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:26,280
to take it in is if we can live in safety live in

205
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:33,440
Beauty and and um and uh some people don't have much

206
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,920
safety in their lives and so it's very hard and I've met known people who have

207
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:46,319
come to a Buddhist Retreat and said it was the first time in their life they ever felt safe they grew up in fear grew

208
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:52,720
up in with danger and it kind of can kind of settled in really deep wherever they go they they never felt they

209
00:38:52,720 --> 00:39:00,119
belonged or never felt that they were not under threat so it's quite deep that this was on but it's possible also to

210
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:07,160
shift this and be heal this or settle that fear and to begin to feel safe in a

211
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:15,119
significant way but one way that uh I'd like to suggest that I was very moved some years

212
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:22,119
ago when um I was part of a workshop and the guest presenter

213
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:27,920
came and asked everyone to I think maybe to write down on a piece of paper uh

214
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,040
what they needed to feel safe in the group and people immediately got many

215
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:38,800
people got very busy and some people kind of wrote a lot of things on their on their sheet of paper the things they

216
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:47,240
needed to feel safe and um and it was kind of fun to watch how absorb people were some people sincere they seem to be

217
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:53,520
and really taking that homework that little assignment um to heart and writing What it Took what how they would

218
00:39:53,520 --> 00:40:02,400
might feel safe what the conditions were and and so uh then we stopped and uh the

219
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:08,599
facilitator kind of appreciated people's work and what they had done and said yes safety is very

220
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:13,960
important and then she said and this is I think was the what surprised everyone

221
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:20,599
and jolted everyone there she said um for all those things you wrote that you

222
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:29,119
need to be safe you bring it with you so I think the expectation was if we

223
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:35,400
had became clear about what we needed to be safe we'd be telling it to the group and the group make group agreements and

224
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:43,200
the whole group would help support everyone to support everyone else to be safe by how they behaved and spoke and

225
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:48,720
uh the facilitator then turned it around and said you bring it you show up

226
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:55,520
carrying that with you so you feel safe you bring your safety with you and um now this is not this doesn't

227
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,560
always work of course but um uh in the situation that we were in was a very

228
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:06,480
safe place people who were very well-meaning and had a lot of practice

229
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:11,920
had a lot of sincerity and integrity in them and it kind of turned the table

230
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:18,000
turned some hearts inside out when they heard that they said oh I'm responsible

231
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:24,599
for this rather than expecting it from others I have to find how to hold safety

232
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:31,520
here for myself and this is the profound thing about Dharma practice is that we learn

233
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:37,440
how to create safety here in a sense from

234
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:43,200
ourselves from how we take in what other people say how we take in what happens

235
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:48,839
to us so that it doesn't really get picked up it doesn't really get react to

236
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:59,480
it it doesn't touch places inside that um that uh uh uh you know we keep safe

237
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:05,200
by how open we are how relaxed we are how uh unthreatening we are to

238
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:12,160
ourselves non-reactivity so safety is needed for

239
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:18,040
gratitude safety is needed for love safety is needed for deep

240
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:24,400
relaxation can you evoke that sense of safety can you

241
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:32,200
evoke a safety where you're protected from someone who then insult you because

242
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:39,160
it doesn't touch anything it doesn't reach anything inside you don't pick it up you don't push it away you just let

243
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:44,400
it kind of float and disappear in the air where all words

244
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:50,160
disappear as opposed to taking it on and and uh reacting to it or thinking about

245
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,160
it or just letting it

246
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:02,599
go and maybe this is one way that you can allow yourself to kind of feel more

247
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:07,760
grateful some people like to write gratitude list at the end of the day

248
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:14,839
maybe three things you've been grateful for so you might try that as well but to

249
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:22,240
um but not just to write it feel it take it in what's the emotional

250
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:27,480
feeling of gratitude for you and you might begin also the end of

251
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:34,200
that little exercise write down uh the best you can of what gratitude feels

252
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:40,800
like for you and do that over a few days because it might take a while to pick up

253
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:46,280
all the nuances of how it actually feels in the body and the heart and the mind

254
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:52,440
um how it feels physically how it feels emotionally how it feels mentally how it

255
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:58,640
feels uh motivationally how it feels

256
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:03,800
um uh how it comes what other emotions it comes along

257
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:10,960
with so to be safe take time to pause take time to be safe for a few

258
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:17,920
moments so that the gifts of Life can touch something deep inside and you can

259
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:23,359
feel the Gratitude and wait to say thank

260
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:30,680
you wait before you bow until until you've received the

261
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:36,599
gift thanks works much better if you first

262
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:44,079
receive and then give back so may

263
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:51,079
today's Reflections and Explorations you do on gratitude support you and the

264
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:57,599
people around you may we continue the cycles of giving

265
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:07,440
and generosity in this world through the generosity of saying thank you thank you
