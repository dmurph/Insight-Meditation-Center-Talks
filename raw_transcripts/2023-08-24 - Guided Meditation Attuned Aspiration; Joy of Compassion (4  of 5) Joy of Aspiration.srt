1
00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:06,980
so good morning good day welcome to this

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:15,420
new day even if even if some of you who are

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:22,320
on evening and time zone the idea that every day is new we wake

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,480
up to discover what's new overnight it's a

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,660
kind of ancient tradition that we wake up Anew to something

6
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:39,239
a new world and uh

7
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:49,200
today the topic is aspiration and it belongs to a family of

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:56,239
mental activities that can go on one end can be planning or expecting

9
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:02,399
to ins what we're inspired for inspired to work for

10
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:09,900
somewhere in the middle of that may be intention is the midpoint of that family if it's if it's a kind of a range

11
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,979
Spectrum and but intention can lend itself to

12
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:22,460
expectation to trying hard to trying to get something to intend to do something

13
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:28,020
doesn't have to there can be intention for how we want to be right now in this

14
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:34,740
moment we would like to be kind that's the intention and then it's

15
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:40,680
immediate as opposed to a plan for the future but I like the word aspiration because

16
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,020
it's closely connected to the word inspiration intention can be dry

17
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:52,740
aspiration comes from some deeper place within as something that's maybe inspiring for

18
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:59,640
us or something which is in the inspiration in the aspiration something that feels nurturing or nourishing for

19
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:06,360
us there's a goodness to aspiration for me aspiration I don't know it works

20
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:13,800
for other people who speak English but for me aspiration always has an ethical quality wholesome quality

21
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:21,500
what do we Aspire for and um and here I want to offer you an analogy

22
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:27,780
for having an S nourishing aspiration for meditation

23
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:33,920
and that is the idea the image the sense that um

24
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,420
the way in which sunlight

25
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:46,440
enables a forest to grow in the springtime maybe a deciduous

26
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:55,260
forest and um and the the way the speed the

27
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:03,060
calm the patience the gentleness the maybe even for many many times

28
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:09,840
imperceptible changes of the way sunlight in the sunlight the forest grows

29
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,760
so in our aspiration

30
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:21,120
the Dharma can grow in US and it's not a Dharma that we

31
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,959
see Moment by moment is not a Dharma that we force or

32
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:36,239
our measuring Moment by moment am I there yet but rather we're allowing ourselves to

33
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,239
be take in the goodness of our aspiration desperation to be present

34
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:49,319
in a way that is free present in a way that is kind

35
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:55,260
appreciative present in a way that deeply attuned

36
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:02,700
to ourselves present in a way where there's a heightened awareness

37
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:09,140
that is like the sunlight growing a forest

38
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:15,019
so assuming a meditation posture

39
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:28,979
and becoming aware of yourself Here and Now

40
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:36,139
sitting in a particular place at this time

41
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:44,419
become aware of sitting here in this sort of meditating here in this body

42
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:54,800
in all its Dimensions all its Sensations

43
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:03,680
you if it's uh comfortable for you you can close your eyes

44
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:16,380
and maybe with a sense of invitation to invite your body to

45
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,540
breathe a bit deeper Fuller

46
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:31,939
to Exhale a bit longer relaxing as you exhale

47
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:55,620
and to let your breathing return to normal

48
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:02,400
but on the exhale letting your attention roam around your

49
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:09,680
body finding places to relax to soften in your body

50
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,199
and then letting your breathing return to normal

51
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:56,819
and consider an aspiration

52
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:03,080
for being here present in meditation mindful

53
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:11,360
that has an inspiration for you one that is not

54
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:18,560
doesn't excite you but when that enlivens you

55
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:26,660
it's inspires you with kind of calm

56
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:35,660
presence of sunlight on a forest

57
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,440
an aspiration for

58
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:54,000
an appreciative awareness

59
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,440
a forgiving awareness

60
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:14,240
maybe a kind or loving caring awareness

61
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:26,000
and aspiration to be present with freedom

62
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:32,700
that leaves everything alone whatever we're aware of we give it its

63
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:42,020
freedom freedom from our own clingings and aversions and judgments

64
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:48,980
aspiring to bring freedom to all things

65
00:08:53,519 --> 00:09:00,860
and if you can find an aspiration for being present that's inspiring

66
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:09,540
let that be a light

67
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:17,459
that shines upon your practice of mindfulness let it inform how you're present each

68
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:25,339
time you're here and now with your experience let it be informed

69
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:29,720
inspired by your aspiration

70
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,300
foreign

71
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:40,980
the word aspiration and inspiration

72
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:47,660
come from the Latin words for breathing like respiration

73
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:59,180
May every breath have in it come with an aspiration

74
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,320
that helps you to grow your practice

75
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:15,860
the way sunlight helps a forest to grow

76
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,840
and then as we come to the end of this meditation

77
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:19,500
to change your aspiration

78
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:26,480
to Aspire for the welfare and happiness of the world of others

79
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:34,460
to somehow turn yourself inside out so your care and your mindfulness

80
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:40,340
takes in the people the beings around you

81
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:48,440
and may there be a peaceful aspiration

82
00:26:53,159 --> 00:27:00,140
that's like sunlight an early morning light

83
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:07,100
sunlight at dawn

84
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:16,460
that awakens and spreads

85
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,940
goodness and Care into the world

86
00:27:23,659 --> 00:27:31,940
aspiring for the welfare and happiness of all may all beings

87
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:39,980
be happy may all beings be safe

88
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:45,419
may all beings be peaceful

89
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:50,659
may all beings be free

90
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:59,120
maybe we may we find ways today

91
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,220
to live this aspiration

92
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:14,778
may we benefit the world today even in the smallest ways

93
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:33,089
[Music]

94
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:45,559
thank you

95
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:42,419
so hello everyone and welcome to this fourth talk on the joy

96
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:48,720
of compassion and uh today's

97
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:55,919
aspect of compassion that can bring joy and is aspiration

98
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:02,960
so we've had awareness Attunement appreciation and today

99
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,100
aspiration and this is often closely tied to compassion

100
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:13,559
in that compassion includes a wish it's for the welfare and happiness of others

101
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:21,140
for people to to not suffer to have their suffering be lifted

102
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:28,559
and so there is a wish but to call that wish and aspiration has

103
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:34,980
a different connotations I wish it could be wishful thinking there can be a wish without anything

104
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:42,120
behind it or any depth it could be a wish because we're we're upset then we want things to be

105
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:48,419
different because we don't want to be upset the an aspiration comes from a deep

106
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:55,860
place within and um and it's more holistic part of who we

107
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:02,039
are and it it comes from some kind of depth Within

108
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:08,220
at least I associate the aspirationalism profound holistic organic sense of of

109
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:13,320
goodness that we something we want that's inspiring for us and maybe for

110
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:20,340
others and so in the inspiration of it there's a kind of pleasure there's a joy there's

111
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:25,679
a delight because it's something that we really feel good about we're delighted and

112
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:31,080
we're happy with it so to Aspire to meet suffering of the world

113
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:39,140
aspire to feel it and sense it not to be overwhelmed by it but to be a a

114
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:45,299
witness a supporting Witness not just a supporting witness but even

115
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:51,600
more so to be a a contributor to the welfare and happiness

116
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:59,159
to make a difference in this world of suffering to make a difference for the person we're with who's suffering

117
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:05,460
and and uh and that aspiration can take many forms it's contextual

118
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:13,080
they're rushed to be compassionate rush to compassionate action we often miss what's mostly needed for people

119
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:19,760
that sometimes if someone is starving you might think rush to get them food

120
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:27,080
but maybe deeper what they're starving for is human contact human respect

121
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:32,100
care and to stop and to be with a person and

122
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:38,940
offer friendship and understanding and companionship before providing the food or together

123
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:46,140
with fighting the food then we're really offering what the person needs and something that's deeper for them and in

124
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:52,700
so being this deeper Source from within ourselves that nurses ourselves at the same time

125
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:57,960
so that compassion is not all about taking care of the other

126
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:03,120
it's also in a certain kind of way caring for ourselves and the deeper our

127
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:09,480
aspiration can come in nourishing for ourselves the more we have to give others the more we can connect with them

128
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:17,940
and have a kind of presence that is its own food its own benefits for others where we offer

129
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:25,860
appreciation Attunement respect and so to take the time

130
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:32,580
to clarify what is our wish here what's Our intention what is our aspiration

131
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:39,240
in offering others uh Compassionate Care and is there an aspiration which

132
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:45,659
inspires us simply they wish to give people food might be good it might be a little bit

133
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:54,840
inspiring but it's kind of I think of it a little bit more closer to something like the surface of the situation and to

134
00:33:54,840 --> 00:34:01,260
offer some deep human connection where we feel safe where we feel inspired by

135
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:06,360
the connection that we can establish then we are nourished we are supported

136
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:12,980
by that connection as much as the person we're caring for and so it's a kind of mutuality

137
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:19,220
aspiration kind of from his deep Place brings an a mutuality of benefit

138
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:27,060
mutuality of of love or care or respect of benefit to

139
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:32,280
to everyone and so it's not so transactional it's not so I'm doing it

140
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:39,480
for you but maybe more we're doing it I'm doing it for all of us for both of us we're doing it together in a sense

141
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:45,720
and that's where the Attunement the deep attum and appreciation can support the

142
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:52,200
idea that we're not only doing compassion for others we're doing it also at the same time simultaneously

143
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:58,140
we're doing something that's really nourishing for ourselves beneficial for ourselves

144
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:06,119
that's the potential of compassion wholesome compassion that we benefit from it as well and one

145
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:12,000
of those benefits is a kind of Joy the kind of sweetness that kind of delight

146
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:19,140
the kind of sense of well-being or a sense of deeper intimacy or

147
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:24,720
connectivity the sense of being at home here in this

148
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,720
feeling of compassion at home and this feeling of being alive with someone else

149
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:37,320
so that what we're sharing is also by Maybe by osmosis a transmission that

150
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:45,780
that there is a way of being in this world that we're feel deeply at home we feel like here I am here I belong here

151
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:50,900
here I'm at ease here's my peace here I

152
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:58,160
meet you with with a kind of profound sense of

153
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:07,500
of [Music] belonging of freedom of Peace here and

154
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:14,160
now without any anxiety or without any needing things to be

155
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:19,980
needing it to be different of course with compassion we are trying to make things different the suffering

156
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:26,640
different but there's something different that happens if we don't need to make a difference but it right the desire to do

157
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:34,140
so arises not from need but from aspiration not from requirements and requirements

158
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:39,480
what we have to do but rather from our something that's more closer to generosity

159
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:44,579
closer to the heart's wish of course we do this

160
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:49,800
and so aspiration is a very important part of compassion

161
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:58,140
and and it's much more than just a desire and giving some care some attention to

162
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:03,780
our aspiration to Our intention so that we get the most benefit out of

163
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:11,420
it so for example if we simply want to

164
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:19,680
um I'll say it this way that an aspiration

165
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,720
is a check-in balance for how we behave in the world

166
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,320
that it's so easy to behave with for through our selfishness through our

167
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:35,820
desire our kind of clingings and cravings and attachments our aversions

168
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:42,060
and our fears it's so easy to have bias and stereotypes of the situation and

169
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:48,920
jump to assumptions about things and but if the aspiration is a beautiful

170
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:55,920
aspiration something that's Universal something we would offer equally to everyone

171
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:05,180
and then then we might notice more likely to notice that we're holding ourselves back or we're tight or we're

172
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:13,380
resisting or we're pushing away or we have judgments or we have negative views

173
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:20,940
of what's going on that that get in the way of a kind of in

174
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:27,900
uh unbiased flow of generosity in our compassion

175
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:32,359
where our compassion is not

176
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:39,300
unduly influenced by anything within us that

177
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:46,859
um interferes with its universality or cleanliness or or CL or you know

178
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:53,119
cleanliness in that it's free of Free of prejudice free of bias free of conceit

179
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:58,619
free of and the kind of tensions involved if

180
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:04,020
there's status involved or if there's control involved or if there's dominance

181
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:09,140
involved or if there's fear involved or there's a kind of

182
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:15,540
diminishing ourselves as we do it or a sense of excessive responsibility we get

183
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:21,900
kind of tight and forceful that if the an aspiration that's

184
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:27,960
Universal that inspires that allows something deep within us to relax

185
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:34,200
then that becomes a reference point for seeing how we're off with our compassion

186
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:39,300
and it certainly is easy to be slightly off or very much often so that the

187
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:45,020
compassion is kind of influenced by all kinds of

188
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:51,060
unfortunate ways in which we might relate to the world and may sometimes unconscious ways we might relate to the

189
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:56,940
world and so to stay in touch and this is where feeling

190
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:02,339
our body being embodied that's why I love the word aspiration because coming from

191
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:08,640
breathing it's kind of an embodied profundity within us that if we're in

192
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:14,099
touch with this body of ours the body will provide us with the clues that

193
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:21,240
we're tensing that we're resisting that we're closing down that we're being partial that we're being too assertive

194
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:28,320
to dominating the body is expressed in all these little micro muscles we have and to feel

195
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:36,180
and sense these operating becomes a check and balance becomes a protection of our compassion so it can remain

196
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:41,880
coming from aspiration as soon as it comes from Duty or

197
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:50,400
obligation as soon as it overrides the ways in which we're getting exhausted tired resistant the ways in which we

198
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:57,119
feel oppressed or troubled or stressed by it if we override that then compassion

199
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:02,520
becomes it's not sustainable it becomes

200
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:08,579
exhausting it becomes stressful it becomes kind of it can even become unhealthy for us

201
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:14,820
so some people have compassion fatigue some people who are wonderfully compassionate people

202
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:20,280
but they're going about their compassion in very difficult circumstances in life

203
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:25,740
that it has a long lasting Legacy of

204
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:31,380
stress or of anxiety fear of

205
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:36,960
of grief that kind of builds slowly

206
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,680
imperceptibly over time because of the tremendous challenge

207
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:48,000
to which the human challenges to which we're bringing are compassion people

208
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:55,740
suffer dramatically horrible things happen to people and to be a caretaker for that I could have a big toll on the

209
00:41:55,740 --> 00:42:02,640
caretaker if we don't find that place of aspiration where there's a joy or a lightness a

210
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:10,260
nourishment from which we can do the compassion and if the aspiration if is not

211
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:17,220
nourishing if the Joy or the lightness or the sweetness is not there that's an indication

212
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:24,540
that probably what we should do is to rest probably what you do is get a break to be renewed be refreshed

213
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:32,099
and the middle way is the way of Buddhism not too much and not too little not

214
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:40,680
forcing ourselves um so we end up being over over stressed and over activated

215
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:48,119
over kind of energized over and not uh so that we become slothful or

216
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:53,820
resistant or or sink back in ourselves we want to kind of maintain that middle

217
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:59,760
way and for that we aspiration

218
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,780
and rest aspiration and renewal aspiration and action in the world that

219
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:11,900
that we find the place that's sustainable over time

220
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:19,560
if the compassion is a little bit off or very much off it's not sustainable

221
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:25,760
so the suggestion is aspiration it can be the depth and the profundity of what

222
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:31,859
aspiration can be can be a source of joy and a source of protection of our

223
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:37,020
compassion so please spend time looking deeply at

224
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:42,599
your intention with the motivation the aspiration that

225
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:49,160
his part and parcel of compassion and to do so on the foundation of

226
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:56,760
awareness Attunement and appreciation helps that aspiration

227
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:03,119
um fulfill its potential so thank you

228
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:09,000
