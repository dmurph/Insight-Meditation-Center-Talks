1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:08,220
oh good morning everyone can you hear me all right is it loud enough for everyone

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:15,599
it is of course a strange question because if you don't hear I think

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,660
he won't answer it it's so I trust that it's loud enough

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:28,560
I'm happy to be here with you and I just come back from having

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:36,239
a Tata Retreat that's Spirit Rock which was still feels like it's part of me

6
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,280
and um before that had gone on a

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,320
kind of a three-day Retreat that we'll talk about in a few minutes

8
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:54,000
you turbo it's a little bit louder I think I think needs to be louder so let's see is it uh loud enough now is

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,879
it coming along there is our hearing system devices that some people use on just on the counter

10
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:06,600
and there's another room but it seems like is it allowed sorry should we do a little bit louder

11
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:13,580
though a little bit maybe just a little bit

12
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,820
foreign

13
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:30,180
Rock they did something which was unusual for me was they had the speaker systems on

14
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,579
really loud and um and it was kind of surprising

15
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:44,220
but um that's my my hearing is you know getting weaker and I've kind of discovered that

16
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,920
um I didn't realize how hard I was trying to listen whenever I hear he was going I thought

17
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,579
it was just normal or something and uh and now with hearing system devices and these loudspeakers at Spirit Rock I said

18
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:03,299
oh look at that gill you know this is more relaxed now even though it seems too loud

19
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:09,500
so anyway we're still it's always a work in progress figuring this out

20
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:15,920
so a story

21
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,459
there was a claim to Buddhist Monastery where many hundreds people came to be

22
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:31,319
monastics amongst the nuns and uh they're always you know

23
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:38,160
a group of new monastics that came every year and first year the monastery is often

24
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,459
challenging just getting used to the lifestyle getting used to the schedule getting up very early in the morning

25
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:49,800
a lot of a lot of meditation a lot of work a lot of being in community a lot

26
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,260
of Silence it's all the stuff that uh and if you're a new monastic you're kind

27
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:01,980
of like at the bottom of the totem pole of certain kind of seniority so sometimes some of the more challenging

28
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:10,680
jobs are given to you and so at some point during the year the

29
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:17,640
for the abyss invited all the new monastics to go into pilgrimage

30
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:24,180
and they were like so relieved what fantastic a pilgrimage and we were told we're going on the pilgrimage to the

31
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:31,260
sacred Buddhist sites wow yeah the Buddha talked about the value of going and visiting where the

32
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:37,739
Buddha was born where he was enlightened where he first taught and where he died they're

33
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:44,519
considered to be the four most sacred sites for at least our kind of Buddhism and so they oh that's baby we'll go on a

34
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:51,959
plane it will go off and it'll be great to go to pilgrimage to the holy sites

35
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:58,019
so uh they all got ready we're ready and they

36
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:03,299
and uh there was a big a couple of like fancy

37
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:09,420
tour buses that can't even pick them up but the monastery Gates and they didn't know where they were going

38
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:14,640
and they first went to a hospital and the Abbas led him through the halls

39
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:21,239
and the rooms of the hospital and through the emergency room and all the different places and they saw people at

40
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:27,600
all kinds of levels and kinds of sicknesses and illnesses and injuries and

41
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:35,960
and um so that was kind of some of them I never really been the hospital that much

42
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,780
and so um then they finished and they got back on their tour buses

43
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:48,360
and they went on to the next step of the pilgrimage and they went to um

44
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,660
a hospice and there they saw people

45
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:00,380
who were all kinds of stages of dying

46
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:09,180
from there they went to an old age home and they saw all the different stages of

47
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:15,540
getting old and what that means to the mind to the of

48
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,940
the heart sometimes to the body all kinds of wow there's a lot of ways of

49
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:27,900
being old and then they got back on their tour buses and the buses took them back to

50
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:33,780
the monastery and there they went to the hospice in

51
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:40,860
the monastery where there was an old Monk one of the oldest in the monastery

52
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,080
who was there in the hospice in his last days

53
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:53,639
and they went to see him and he didn't have much to say or anything to say but there was this wonderful Sparkle in

54
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:59,280
his eyes the light didn't seem like it depended on seeing

55
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,500
them his Sparkle just like he just had to Sparkle and he was very peaceful very

56
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:10,800
calm feeling of deep kind of Tranquility just

57
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:17,479
to be with him and then the abbess took them to

58
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:22,860
a meeting room in the monastery and she said now you've seen the four holy

59
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:30,319
sites of Buddhism sickness old age death

60
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:36,560
and a practitioner who's found deep abiding peace

61
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:43,800
so rather than being a place to go this holy sites were human conditions

62
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:50,460
and there's something about the encounter with human conditions in an honest direct way which does something

63
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:57,240
to Buddhists their holy sites how could that be How could a hospital be a holy site

64
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,699
hospice an old age home how could this be

65
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:07,919
and I think a little bit the answer is in that fourth fourth holy site

66
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:13,560
a practitioner who's found their piece a practitioner who's able to die with a

67
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,199
Sparkle with the Delight with joy and peace and all the conditions of Life have been

68
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:27,500
settled and um and to honestly and fully

69
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:33,360
encounter this human condition of ours not pretend it's differently not to run

70
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:42,180
away not kind of touch into some of these existential conditions that will visit all of us if we're lucky enough

71
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:48,479
that and kind of skirt around them and avoid them Buddha says stop

72
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,819
and take a good look stop and really be present practice with that

73
00:07:53,819 --> 00:08:00,360
let that be a mirror to see yourself to see your reactions your fears your

74
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,180
activities your distractions your preoccupations

75
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:12,479
because this because this Buddhist practice is here to meet

76
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:18,840
help us support us through the biggest deepest most challenging experiences any

77
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:25,440
person could have in their human life this is not a hobby what we do in

78
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:32,339
Buddhism it's not you know an Excursion on a tour bus to Disneyland

79
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:37,620
just to kind of having you know Wonderful Disneyland like spiritual

80
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:45,500
experiences the holy sites of Buddhism

81
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:54,240
a pilgrimage is a journey to a sacred place that's like if you go

82
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,459
to the dictionary that's one of the first meanings you have for it

83
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:05,399
the word pilgrim and pilgrimage turns out that it's closely related

84
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:11,820
etymologically from the same Source Latin source as the word Peregrine the

85
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:19,440
bird the peregrine falcon isn't that pretty cool

86
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:26,040
a peregrine falcon I just kind of you know when they're soaring

87
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:32,640
the high up in the sky traveling long distances there's this kind of Freedom there

88
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:40,019
in the Buddhism there's this idea that Birds when they fly through the sky leave no traces there's no

89
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:47,160
there are tracks left behind and that's held up as kind of an ideal that when you go through life like in

90
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:53,399
your backpacking this is the ideal leave no traces in Buddhism there's this ideal that go

91
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:59,160
through life and don't leave any traces and they don't mean like don't you know

92
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:06,060
don't don't go through your life so no one ever remembers you when you die or anything but don't leave anything

93
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:12,779
sticky don't leave anything undone or unresolved don't leave any

94
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:18,480
Karma behind don't leave any any disturbances behind don't leave the

95
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,760
world in their worst place than you found it leave it in a better place leave the

96
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,399
only traces that way so um

97
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:36,540
the um from the Latin root pilgrimage means to

98
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:43,500
go through the field apparently in Latin it kind of meant the field was abroad like somebody comes

99
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:49,019
from away or to going abroad or coming from abroad so it doesn't mean that much to

100
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:55,260
etymology but journeying to a holy place and I've known people who've gone on

101
00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:01,260
pilgrimages long pilgrimages I've met people on pilgrimage

102
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:07,200
and uh classically people do it for many reasons and sometimes they do it because their

103
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:13,260
life is falling apart I've known people who

104
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:18,420
um they've lost something very important about their life and they felt lost they

105
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:23,640
didn't know what to do and so it wasn't like they were going to a pilgrimage to a place a sacred place

106
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:29,940
to get to the place they were going because then it's needed to kind of

107
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:35,220
regroup or ReDiscover who they are question their life and reflect on what

108
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:42,420
their life is about and and then also to be open to new

109
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:47,820
experiences some of the great pilgrimage routes in the world there's a lot of pilgrims and

110
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,980
so you never know who you're going to meet on the route and what you're going to counter what are you going to

111
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:59,519
struggle with what you're dealing with classically a pilgrim travels with very

112
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:06,480
little is kind of a lives kind of a life that's close to poverty

113
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:13,800
um you know staying and hostels perhaps there's Pilgrim hospitals and some hostels in some places and

114
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:19,740
I stayed one and I've stayed in some and one of them I would suspect there were probably 200

115
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:25,019
people in the room men women and everything else

116
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:30,839
and um while sleeping under the same roof and you know the same kind of room there

117
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:37,920
were some dividing walk kind of partial walls so it wasn't like you saw everyone at the same time but you heard everyone

118
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:47,160
at the same time and it was phenomenal to hear the snoring at night

119
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:52,800
because I used to live near the ocean and it was wonderful to hear the waves

120
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:58,260
crashing at night you tend to hear them more at night than during the day and you hear the crashing waves and so it's

121
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:04,380
kind of comforting well when you have 200 people I don't know how many of them are snorers but

122
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:10,339
it was remarkable I don't know if this is a common phenomena that they were synchronized

123
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:16,860
at least in the hostel I was in and they were they'd come in waves like

124
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:21,899
you'd start they'd start up and they'd all kind of come to a crescendo together

125
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:27,540
and then they'd go down and get quiet get quiet for next hour or something and

126
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:33,540
then up again and it became like um like a phenomena

127
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:39,959
of nature it came like the waves at the beach I wasn't disturbed by it how could you be disturbed by waves at

128
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:46,200
the beach you mean like wow so it was like a natural phenomenon I said so if you ever have to have a

129
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:52,639
roommate in some place who snores going to pilgrimage first

130
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,660
and maybe it won't be disturbed by the snoring it's not just

131
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:02,820
anyway so you have to deal with all this stuff you know and what do you mean what about privacy and

132
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:09,779
whatever room with all these people and so um

133
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:16,560
and sometimes people go on meditation Retreats because it's kind of like a pilgrimage for them they don't know

134
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:23,339
they're going through some big crisis some big issue in their life that they don't know what else to do they're lost

135
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:29,160
they're suffering in some way and some people come they're not lost but this is what they want to do they want to go and

136
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:35,160
Retreat and develop their practice deepen their meditation but some people come because it's the only thing they

137
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:42,240
know what to do in a time of great crisis then this is what comes to mind as I

138
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,699
sitting here many years ago there was a woman who came to a retreat I was teaching it was in the Redwoods here

139
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:53,760
deep in the Redwoods so it took a while dirt road to get there and

140
00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:00,980
and she came to the retreat and so I asked her why are you here

141
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:07,920
my husband made me and why did your husband make you come

142
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,959
to the retreat because that's kind of to require someone to come to retrieve this kind of like unusual right it's probably

143
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:19,339
it's counter-indicated I had an affair

144
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:26,160
does that put the whole that put a different context on it so I don't know what the husband was thinking but that's

145
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,920
a different spousal response response to an affair than many other many of the responses you

146
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,980
read about novels maybe you wouldn't make a good novel if

147
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:45,420
you know just the marital crisis ended up in a retreat

148
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:52,079
but anyway that was kind of you know there goes some place where you kind of working through something and discovering something and confronting

149
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:58,380
something in your life in an important way and uh and pilgrimage is often done on

150
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:05,940
foot and I I've known people who also who don't go in a pilgrimage per se but do

151
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:12,600
these long through hikes they go for weeks and weeks sometimes for a hike and some of them do it because nothing else

152
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:19,440
makes sense anymore some people do it because they have to find some other thing to Value to do

153
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:26,160
some people do it to kind of reflect on their life I did it I didn't do a long hike but the

154
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:33,120
gift that my family gave me when I turned 50 was the gift to go up in this year is to do a solo hike

155
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:43,500
to spend a week up in the wilderness by myself up there and so I did and I used that occasion

156
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:49,079
walking up in the Sierras by myself it was early in the early in the spring was like beginning of May there was still

157
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:57,240
snow on the ground and as far as I could tell I was the first one in the backcountry and so it was pretty much alone I think

158
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:05,459
I saw one person in the far in the distance across the valley at one point and um and I reflected on now that I was

159
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:12,120
50. what do I want to do with the rest of my life what's important for me and that was an important reflection in

160
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:17,220
time I came back kind of not exactly renewed but I came back with real

161
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:23,640
clarity about what I wanted to do and they and it was a really I think was helpful to know that

162
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:31,260
to know it and in my case it was just keep doing what I was doing so because I but to have that kind of

163
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:39,500
time to really look at that so um

164
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,620
so I think about three of us in this room today

165
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:52,679
went on a pilgrimage two weeks ago the four of us who are here right now

166
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:58,020
amazing there were 12 of us and a third of them are here in this room

167
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:05,880
and um and uh there have been Buddhist pilgrimages uh

168
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:11,220
here in California in the past I don't know if it was a pilgrimage but one of

169
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:17,660
the phenomenal uh Buddhist events kind of pilgrimage kind of events

170
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:24,240
was uh done by a I think he was American from Tennessee

171
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:30,900
or Kentucky I think he used to be like a folk singer in the 60s

172
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:37,620
but he went off to be ordained in a Chinese Buddhist Monastery here in California

173
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:43,140
and learned Chinese fluent in Chinese and been a monk phenomenal practitioner

174
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:49,799
his name is Reverend hingsher and um he came to the family Retreat I taught

175
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:57,840
at Spirit Rock once and he brought his guitar and he sang a song to the kids called put on your samadi shoes

176
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:05,280
it was so much fun and I bet the various temples in California wonderful men

177
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:11,160
well his pilgrimage was I think they had a temple in Los Angeles Maybe

178
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:18,780
and they had have one in Ukiah and so he walked up Highway one maybe or

179
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:24,960
you know I don't know if it's just Highway 1 but it walked certainly along Highway One from Southern California all the way up

180
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:33,539
to yokaya but that that's phenomenal kind of but um uh what's more phenomenal

181
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:40,260
was that I think he took three steps

182
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:45,900
he would stop and he would do a full prostration on the ground I think

183
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:52,260
frustration where you kind of completely flat on the ground every third step

184
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:57,660
that takes a while that makes an impact

185
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:04,919
I don't know what he was doing in his mind I wouldn't be surprised as if he was chanting his chance or something

186
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:10,799
and he had a a late person who went along with a a van

187
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:18,240
and so there was some equipment with him probably and maybe that's how we had food and so all he had to go with him is

188
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:26,220
his robes and his shoes and his uh I don't know if he had gloves for his hands but every time he went down

189
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:33,660
and so he wrote a book about it I never read it but um and um

190
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:40,919
so that was one that was one of the earliest kind of pilgrimages things I knew and then from Spirit Rock out of Spirit Rock Community there was a as it

191
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:46,860
has been for many years now a bicycle pilgrimage and one a few years ago they started from IMC

192
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:54,000
the pilgrimage and they've gone from here to various interesting places often they go to Buddhist monasteries in

193
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:01,320
Northern California so that's nice and um so two weeks ago

194
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:06,720
starting today I was part of a group of about 12 people

195
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:14,039
who went on a pilgrimage from Spirit Rock walking to the green Gulf Sun

196
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:21,360
Center the distance is not you know you know as long as pilgrimages often are but it was

197
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:28,440
meant to be a a trial to kind of begin if maybe a pilgrimage route a Buddhist

198
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:33,659
pilgrimage route here in California for walking and that would go through Buddhist

199
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:40,100
centers and so there's these two there's Spirit Rock Meditation Center in Marin County

200
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:45,720
uh kind of if more or less on the north side of Mount Tamalpais

201
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,760
and then there's on the south side of Mount Tamalpais there is green Gulf Shen

202
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:57,960
Center also in Marin County and the distance that we walked was about 26 miles I believe

203
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:04,200
and we did it over three days and uh it was a quite a wonderful event

204
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:11,940
to be able to do this kind of thing and I was actually surprised by how wonderful it was at least for me

205
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:17,000
and um so some of the details of it was that

206
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,380
we asked Spirit Rock if we could so we could leave early in the morning on

207
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:28,860
Monday we asked Spirit Rock if we come and sleep in their meditation Hall they have two big meditation Halls so

208
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:35,400
with the lower one and um and they said sure not only that but you're welcome to have

209
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:42,059
dinner then I sudden when you arrive on Sunday and you're welcome to have breakfast but just keep the just clean

210
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:47,940
up after yourself and so we showed up and not only that we

211
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:53,880
were welcomed so warmly and ready to help set us up and they had to kind of

212
00:22:53,880 --> 00:23:00,059
meditation mats like this and and a few futons set up for us

213
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:05,600
and um so um

214
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:13,260
and so we kind of spread out meditation all some people outside the meditation Hall but two different places slept

215
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:18,900
and uh and that was kind of nice but what was nice about it was the generosity that Spirit Rock would offer

216
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:24,419
us this opportunity and at pilgrimages where there's generosity that supports it from the

217
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:31,860
community makes it kind of richer and something more heartfelt or more kind of like meaningful oh not only are we doing

218
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:39,360
this kind of little bit active renunciation you know this going on a sacred place but there's support for it

219
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:45,780
and so uh then we set off the next morning oh then that evening we were so

220
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:52,140
lucky there was a there's a wonderful Spirit Rock teacher named Ann Cushman who came and gave us a little Dharma

221
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:59,039
talk and what I didn't know is uh she'd been on Buddhist pilgrimages in India and she

222
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:04,140
actually had gone to India to research it to write a book about it so she knew more about Buddhist pilgrimages than

223
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:10,260
most people so she kind of launched us and like was a wonderful celebratory way

224
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:15,419
and one of her uh the Mantra she gave us was

225
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:20,820
um there's plenty of time how often do you go through your life

226
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:27,140
with that is there Mantra oh there's plenty of time no

227
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:33,299
I think that uh this funny time thing all right many people maybe not all of

228
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:37,940
you but many people

229
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:44,700
are time poor we live in time poverty

230
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,799
everyone in the world has the same amount of time kind of every day if you live through the day everyone has the

231
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:56,640
same amount of time but so it's an equal opportunity event time

232
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,860
but sometimes people live it in poverty and some people live in abundance

233
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:07,919
and I think around here a good percentage of people are pretty poor I wonder if there's a direct correlation

234
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,380
to wealth the more wealthy you are the more you live in time poverty

235
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:20,820
I suspect there might be something like that but any case that was kind of the mantra

236
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:28,320
there's plenty of time and we got up in the morning and we and then there was someone uh supporters of

237
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:35,400
the pilgrimage who showed up with their cars and trucks to take all our sleeping

238
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:41,940
gear tents and sleeping bags and drive it to where we're going to sleep that next night

239
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:48,419
and so we wouldn't all we had to carry was like day packs and just lunch and fruit water and so that was nice

240
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:55,440
and then we showed up at the place where eventually where we're going to Camp that night to enter our surprise at least to my

241
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:01,919
surprise all our tents were set up not only they drive everything there so

242
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:08,400
we got there it would be all there they set it up and uh I think we also some of us had

243
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,900
camping chairs and they were set up it was quite touching

244
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:23,279
so then we walked and um and uh after a short walk not too far we came

245
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:29,820
to this wonderful Redwood Bay Tree that'll kind of Grove next to a creek

246
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:34,980
and we stopped there to have some ritual and the rituals seemed very meaningful

247
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:40,260
they were all the rituals were kind of connected to the four natural elements

248
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:46,679
in Buddhism of Earth water Fire and Air so just that being in

249
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:53,159
the natural setting and being connected to these elements kind of made the natural world come alive more and in a

250
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:59,220
nice way but one of the very meaningful things for me in that opening was there was

251
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:05,460
someone there who did this wonderful with it with rulers

252
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:13,080
that were that kind of were represented chronology over time different kind of ways of using that to see something kind

253
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:18,779
of brought to life the kind of the kind of the

254
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:24,360
human and geological vegetative history of where we were

255
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:30,360
and and how you know

256
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:36,960
how long our lives were at that up to that point got a sense of that and then put that in

257
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:43,380
the context of how long non-indigenous life a lot in digit of humans had been in

258
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:49,500
this bipartis part of California 200 about 200 350 years or something

259
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:55,020
and then um and then how long indigenous people had

260
00:27:55,020 --> 00:28:03,179
been in this part of California and and the the the age that was given was 35

261
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:09,779
000 years so compare your lifetime to 35 000 years

262
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:17,039
compare non-indigenous immigrants to this area and 35 000 years it creates quite a different context

263
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:22,919
for this place and who was here and so the more recent decade asked Millennia

264
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:27,440
was the Miwok native indigenous people

265
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:36,000
and then we did it for Bay trees Bay trees had been in that part of this of the country for 20 million years

266
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,960
wow as we were under them right on these Bay trees wow and then we did it for redwood trees and

267
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:49,140
we looked up at the redwood trees and they'd been there for we were told 200 million

268
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:55,500
years and then later in the hike we saw a sign that said that um that the river

269
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:00,720
trees are some of the oldest and largest living creatures in the world

270
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,880
so 200 million years that's a long time

271
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:11,279
and uh in fact probably Redwood City this land that we're on

272
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:16,919
maybe they didn't even exist right there because we're probably we're under water

273
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:22,140
and we're still waiting for the mud to build up to create this and not only that but

274
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:28,679
probably we were in a different location I wouldn't be surprised if if this land that we're sitting on was

275
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:33,720
where Mexico City is now because these Continental shifts and changes of

276
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:39,919
everything at all I mean we've had all these different continents we don't I don't even know the names of all the continents that have been

277
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:46,380
appeared and disappeared on this planet the shifting changing so anyways we

278
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:51,600
started this wonderful presentation about time and who was here and all this

279
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:57,840
stuff and and they kind of made enriched the kind of walking we did and

280
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:04,320
then as I walked there was a kind of like there's plenty of time kind of Mantra came up for me

281
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,779
and what came up for me that I repeated to myself because it just felt so delicious I felt so nice well I was

282
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:14,820
surprised how nice I felt walking I do a lot of Walking In The Hills in

283
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:22,080
the mountains my wife and I one of our favorite things to do and I have no regrets of how I walk but

284
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:28,679
there was different walking on a pit as a pilgrim and the difference was that um in the

285
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:34,919
pilgrim as a pilgrim I wasn't really trying to get anywhere even welcome to my wife out in the Hills

286
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:40,260
we kind of tried to get to the end kind of but here was really clearly there was

287
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:48,179
nowhere to go so my Mantra was myself was um while going nowhere

288
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:53,760
going somewhere so the emphasis was not going anywhere but we were walking and we're going to

289
00:30:53,760 --> 00:31:01,320
this green Gulch Sun Center and uh and it kind of it was kind of like being on a retreat where time Falls

290
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:06,419
away and there's nothing to have to do or accomplish just peaceful settled to

291
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:12,000
relax just just this moment it's enough just to be alive

292
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,059
how often in your life would you say wow

293
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:21,799
just to be alive is enough

294
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:31,500
without it but but I have my to-do list I have my responsibilities I have to do

295
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:38,460
this to make them safe I have to I have to just to be alive just to breathe

296
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:46,380
and so in this pilgrimage we took the approach was that we were not going

297
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:52,799
to a sacred site every step was the arriving at a sacred

298
00:31:52,799 --> 00:32:00,840
site and so we called this the pilgrimage was in the in poly is upasamapada

299
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:07,020
steps of peace we were just doing steps of peace

300
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:12,779
this step we've arrived this is it what a great thing

301
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:18,840
wow this step this step so it kind of felt that way as we went along

302
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:24,899
and then there were people who supported us there were sometimes we had to drive from

303
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:30,779
where we ended up the day the first day to where the campground was so their people came and picked us up kind of

304
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:39,600
phenomenal and then they drove us back the next day because we could pick up where we left off because pilgrims can't skip

305
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:45,799
you know and uh and then we went through a beautiful countryside

306
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:50,940
you know it was some of the really spectacular hikes in the Bay Area

307
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:56,640
that we went through and were in but the most wonderful wonderful most wonderful one but one of them was really special

308
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:02,159
we were got up and left at 6 30 the last morning

309
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:10,200
and we we hike down Mount Tam into Muir Woods

310
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:16,559
early in the morning before most people had gotten there Muir Woods has considered almost a sacred place

311
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:22,919
and um and in fact some of the Groves in muirwoods are named as religiously

312
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:30,299
there's like Cathedral Grove for example and and to be able to meet millions of

313
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:36,059
people go there and so but to go early in the morning I guess it's kind of closed if you drive

314
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:41,640
in but if you hike in you can get in and it's spectacularly beautiful and quiet

315
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:49,320
and peaceful and we sat there and meditated in the Grove and in the woods and it was so nice to to be there

316
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:55,200
and what enriched it also for me was this whole trip was also some of the

317
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,720
challenges there weren't a lot of challenges I would say we were pretty fortunate the whole thing

318
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,000
but there was this cold wind but you know that especially the first

319
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,220
night and then we had rain and then not being able to sleep because

320
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:19,080
their pain was pounding on the tent for a while in the middle of the night midnight so that that's you know

321
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:24,240
it's a little bit you know you you wouldn't want that for yourself but if you step back it's kind of

322
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:29,520
desired that a pilgrimage has its challenges it makes it more real so that

323
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,800
was kind of you know small scale challenges but it was kind of nice that it wasn't just all kind of a nice simple

324
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:41,220
thing to do and then it was nice also when we came into for me came into Muir Woods they

325
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:47,158
had these visitors signed these information signs on there and one that one that was most powerful

326
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:52,800
for me was a sign that talked about the history of this piece of land and how it

327
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,260
became a park and the people who preserved it and

328
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:03,480
saved it and John Muir and different people to the theater

329
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:09,960
Roosevelt was a player in this the president so it had what uh all the kind of things

330
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:16,740
you expect you know about all the historical things that made be it here but now there's a different sensitivity

331
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:21,900
to what it means what all this means so they had added

332
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:28,619
notes I kind of like by the way and they talked about all the people who

333
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:34,020
had saved this natural parts of California for parks and to save it for the prostate prosperity in the way they

334
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:41,640
did um we're really into eugenics and white supremacy and that whites were

335
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:47,820
white people really their Superior race including the president Theodore Roosevelt and

336
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:53,820
and your wood I'm your John Muir had some of these qualities in himself as well

337
00:35:53,820 --> 00:36:00,060
and it just felt so I was so kind of relieved to see this being named

338
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:07,079
this too is part of it is part of it I wouldn't I want to say it's sacred but this too is part of the profundity of

339
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:12,900
this life we have to deal with and see honestly and clearly and some of the ways in which we

340
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:18,900
preserve the natural world in the United States has been a form of environmental and

341
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:24,240
economic and racial Injustice to do it and denying the existence of people who

342
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,940
were in the land beforehand and as if they had no role that they weren't part of it

343
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:36,660
and so to just be able to walk through the natural world here the Wilderness that's preserved and saved and and

344
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:41,820
somehow ooh and ah and feel that it's sacred without recognizing the bigger

345
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:47,280
context and who would say which is in maybe as a kind of

346
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,380
partial sacredness not the full thing so I was kind of glad that came to the

347
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:57,839
end kind of come to the end of her pilgrimage that also was included and I thought that was also important to this

348
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:03,180
too this too and then we came down to Muir Beach

349
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:08,820
where the bottom of your the valley there that goes up into the green Gulch Zen Center

350
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:14,339
which is was originally a farm and um and I lived there 40 years ago

351
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:19,920
more 40 almost 45 years ago now and work the fields and it was kind of

352
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:27,960
special for me to go back there and see the field see where I'd worked and imagine Gill as a 45 year old 45 you

353
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:35,480
know 45 years ago is a long-haired hippie you know working the farm

354
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:41,040
and um and then we came and then we came to gringold and the woman Fu Schrader

355
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:46,200
who had been the abbess there for the last nine years just a month ago stepped out

356
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:52,440
she received us and um and she in the zendo in their

357
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:57,900
meditation Hall and we were able to kind of end the meditate there and

358
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:03,720
and then she gave us a beautiful Dharma talk so we had a Dharma talk at the beginning at the end from these

359
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:12,599
wonderful teachers and then green Gulch invited us for lunch what and that this too you know this

360
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:16,579
generosity and support for the pilgrims

361
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:24,839
so so we had there was more but um but it felt uh precious

362
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:30,359
to have a pilgrimage in California every Buddhist country that every

363
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:35,700
country that Buddhism goes to in Asia eventually there's been pilgrimage sites

364
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:43,320
created and they're certainly in India and China and the ones I know about and

365
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:49,859
in Japan there's a really rich background of pilgrimages routes that go on and the pilgrimage routes themselves

366
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:56,400
are seen as almost sacred people have been walking them for over a thousand years in some places

367
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:03,240
and 2000 years and um so this is sacralizing is that a

368
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:08,820
word sacralizing um the geography by the associations it

369
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:15,119
has and to make part of California at least for Buddhists have a kind of sacredness

370
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:21,359
to it because people have found profundity in stepping on this land and

371
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:28,260
being there and attuning to the environment their practice to the environment who they are

372
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:33,680
to um find peace with every step

373
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:40,980
s of peace and um and we did it for three days

374
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:47,400
people can do it for months the long trips long hikes where get where you're

375
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:52,880
going is not the point it's how you step that's a point

376
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:58,020
so that's nice but the lesson of this

377
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:03,180
is maybe you're on a pilgrimage every day when you wake up

378
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:08,280
maybe every time you go to the market and you walk down the aisles it's a

379
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:15,500
pilgrimage can they be steps of peace what would it mean

380
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:21,480
you don't have time for that that's a silly

381
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:27,260
you have important products to get into your shopping cart [Laughter]

382
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:34,560
and you have to look and make sure you get the right one and the right price and and also study what other people are

383
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,619
getting and judge them and for what they're doing there's all these important things to do in life and get

384
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:46,800
finished with so you can go do other important things so sorry about that and you know so this

385
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,839
pilgrimage thing is kind of a headache now it challenges you like it makes you

386
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:58,079
question you what are you doing with his life of yours what are you doing

387
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:05,400
and um why not make every day a pilgrimage why not have plenty of time why not just

388
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:10,859
make every step the step of peace

389
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:17,160
just that question you might have really good answers to say why you shouldn't be that way

390
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:23,460
but maybe that's your going and you know like I did Into the Wilderness that questioned my life when I was 50 and

391
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:30,300
come back with more clarity of what I was doing maybe you'll come back with Clarity and wisdom about why it's really necessary

392
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:36,960
for you to 95 of the time to be in a rush

393
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,480
to get someplace to do something go to the next thing maybe there's good reasons

394
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,760
or maybe there's sometimes good reasons

395
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,980
but maybe there's not good reasons to do it as often as you do it

396
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:58,619
maybe there's something very profound that you offer the world

397
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:05,280
not just for yourself the possibility that just this moment is

398
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:11,820
enough here in this moment you're going to find your peace you can find your well-being you can

399
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:18,540
find your contentment and maybe not even for its own sake

400
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:25,020
but maybe because that's the way you can be attuned

401
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:31,859
to others that's a way to be attuned to others so that some of the most deepest ways that

402
00:42:31,859 --> 00:42:38,280
we can connect to others with compassion with love with kindness with friendliness has the best chance to come

403
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:44,160
through and that was one of the nice things about this pilgrimage some of the people

404
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:50,160
I went on I never met before but it was marvelous to do these 12 people together

405
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:56,400
and share this thing together and and have this common Bond of humanity and

406
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:02,099
engagement and warmth and friendship and and this kind of shared shared

407
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:09,318
pilgrimage there was a kind of a depth that happened in the community I felt that was really special

408
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:16,859
can that be a lesson for all of us who went on the pilgrimage that actually this is possible even in

409
00:43:16,859 --> 00:43:21,900
the supermarket engine only those other people were paying

410
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:27,000
attention but you're standing in the line waiting for your turn and you're there to say

411
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,240
hello you're there to kind of appreciate people if only they get their met their you

412
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:40,020
know face out of the National Enquirer but then just to live there ready ready

413
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:46,520
it's every moment as sacred pilgrimage

414
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:53,700
so thank you thank you for being here today and thank you for just sitting and meditating here

415
00:43:53,700 --> 00:44:02,540
and perhaps this was a pilgrimage just being here this morning and and I hope that um

416
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:09,540
some of the qualities of what I was talking about just exist from coming here for these this time we had together

417
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:12,140
thank you
