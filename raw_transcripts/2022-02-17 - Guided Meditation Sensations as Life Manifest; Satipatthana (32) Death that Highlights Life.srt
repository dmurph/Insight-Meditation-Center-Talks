1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,600
so hello everyone and

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:16,880
it's always special when people gather to practice the dharma to practice

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,119
awareness showing up for this life of ours in a fuller way or deeper way than maybe we

4
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,880
can do in ordinary life maybe in a way that we connect to more

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,239
of ourselves more of this experience of life

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:43,120
so that but the topic these days in sati patana is contemplation of the corpse

7
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:51,120
and i think it's significant to recognize that the corpse contemplation

8
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,280
occurs right after the four elements the four elemental properties

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:04,239
meditation that just before we're doing these the

10
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:11,760
sensations the living sensations which are a manifestation of being alive it's what

11
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:19,520
animates us it what fills us in with life

12
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,960
and uh when we're no longer alive

13
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,119
then there's no more sensations the body might still exist as a corpse

14
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:38,400
but it's not animated with the sensations it's also not animated with awareness

15
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,280
and it's not animated with the depths of our feelings

16
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,880
so there's something about

17
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:56,079
for me at least that the contemplation of a corpse that's not animated consciousness is not in it

18
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:02,719
anymore highlights awareness highlights consciousness

19
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:08,399
highlights our sensations our animated life right now

20
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,000
it's kind of like absence often highlights things better

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,239
silence can help us hear sound

22
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,720
a blank piece of paper can highlight a dot that's

23
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,480
a pen puts on the middle of the paper in a way that you wouldn't be highlighted if it was a

24
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,560
piece of paper that was scribbled all over

25
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:46,640
so the contemplation of the corpse the way it goes is this too

26
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,319
my body also one day will become a corpse

27
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:59,840
one day will decay or be cremated or

28
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,640
it will change to something else the elements of it the pieces of it

29
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:16,000
and perhaps this idea that your body one day

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,720
will be sensation free absent of sensation

31
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,720
for now we have

32
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:36,720
sensations and that can be the place where we center our attention

33
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,560
perhaps highlighted and appreciated or valued more

34
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,560
knowing

35
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,799
not only is it temporary just for this lived life we have

36
00:03:52,799 --> 00:04:01,120
but this live life we have through our sensations the way we directly experience ourselves

37
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:08,640
is a river of change a river of unfolding

38
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,560
coming and going you hear a sound

39
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:21,919
like i hear the train right now train whistle i can't grab it or hold on to it it'll

40
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,240
be gone now it's gone

41
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,080
comes and goes

42
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,639
many of the sensations you have they appear and disappear maybe repeatedly

43
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,320
like the sensations of breathing

44
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,240
one day your body will not have these sensations

45
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,400
this day you have sensations

46
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:12,880
but they're fleeting and passing perhaps you can settle back

47
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,800
marvel at this animated life of sensations

48
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,639
while they're occurring one day they won't

49
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:37,800
so taking a meditation posture oh

50
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,919
let's see my

51
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:31,360
okay so there we go sorry about this my laptop froze

52
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,039
and i thought maybe i'd lost you but that i muted and then i forgot to unmute i think

53
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,520
we're back on

54
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,240
so yes back on so it's part of this theme of today's

55
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,199
meditation absence the end of things

56
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:17,759
everything will be gone someday and on this day

57
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,599
the deep experience of

58
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:33,360
sensation or sensate life is meant to help us not cling to any of

59
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,518
it just aware

60
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,760
so settling into your body and your breathing

61
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:53,240
following the sensations in your body noticing when they appear

62
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,560
noticing when they disappear

63
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,040
following the appearance and disappearance of sensations

64
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:27,760
the appearance of sensations indicate you're alive

65
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:36,839
the disappearance of sensations is a reminder it won't always be here

66
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,120
and then we'll sit quietly

67
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,919
you

68
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,080
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

69
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:58,880
to not only appreciate that the living animated life we have

70
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:04,880
is found in our sensations and our senses

71
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,840
it's also found in our capacity to love

72
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,400
to have a tender warmth and care for others

73
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,880
it's found in our ability to care for ourselves

74
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:30,240
a gentle valuing of our own life as well

75
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:38,398
and to go deeper into the heart to places where we can love

76
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,000
either because we can do it or because

77
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,320
we're making ourselves available for the day when we can

78
00:27:54,399 --> 00:28:00,640
and to end the sitting maybe expressing that love or

79
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,559
inviting that love if it has not yet come

80
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:16,080
to consider the welfare and happiness of others that others just like you

81
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:23,440
have the capacity for happiness for being alive in a peaceful

82
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,158
happy way

83
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:36,080
and maybe this be our wish that all of us self and others the whole

84
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:43,279
world move towards greater and greater happiness and

85
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:50,720
peacefulness freedom may all beings

86
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:58,278
be happy may all beings be safe

87
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:03,200
may all beings be peaceful

88
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:08,559
may all beings be free

89
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,799
and may our love or our aspiration to love

90
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,398
be expressed in action

91
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,840
may we care for this world in how we live

92
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:55,320
[Music] thank you

93
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,679
so to continue with something i said at the beginning of the meditation this

94
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:17,039
sixth exercise of the 13 exercises that make up the practice

95
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:23,840
of the four foundations for awareness

96
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:34,320
this sixth one is the contemplation of the corpse

97
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:41,039
sits between the mindfulness of sensations

98
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:46,159
and mindfulness of feelings and so

99
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:53,520
we're preparing the ground to go deeper in this practice of sati in becoming sensitive and aware of the

100
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:58,720
sensate life the lit the sensations that come and go

101
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:04,640
but those sensations have a characteristic qualities

102
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:10,640
of being pleasant unpleasant or neutral and this ability to feel

103
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:17,440
the pleasure of things to feel the pain of things is part of this deeper animated life

104
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:24,080
that we have and the pleasure and pain is in some ways we can think of it as something

105
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:29,840
deeper and more in within us because it's not only physical

106
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:36,240
when we feel the sun of the war the the warmth of the sun against our skin

107
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:43,200
the that's a physical pure physical sensation the pleasure we get from that

108
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:49,600
is mixture of physical pleasure and mental pleasure the mental evaluation of it and so it

109
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:56,399
something deeper more connected to our lived life and

110
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,240
and so between these two between sensations and feelings

111
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,760
there's this contemplation of a human body that has neither

112
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:13,440
has neither feelings sensations or feelings and

113
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:19,840
to spend some time contemplating that there will be a day for each of us because this this contemplation of the

114
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:25,679
corpse there's nine different states of decay that

115
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:32,159
the practice talks about and um and to imagine for each one of

116
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:38,399
those i will be like this too and then um my body also will

117
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:45,440
but all the things of our body that we cherish we love we're identified with we may be attached to

118
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,799
preoccupied with they will slowly go and

119
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:55,840
now this contemplation of the corpse involves uh

120
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:01,919
what happened to corpses in the old day bef uh when many people did not cremate

121
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:07,519
their bodies but rather they were just put on top of the charnel grounds

122
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:12,960
where wild animals just were left there to rot and decay and

123
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:19,120
decompose and so you could go to the charlotte ground and see this process

124
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,399
a friend of mine wasn't up in the himalayas where they still have charnel

125
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:30,399
grounds and came across walked through the charnel grounds

126
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:36,240
and came across a recently dead body that was just laying there

127
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:43,120
and been left and so and this uh i mentioned yesterday the teacher buddha dasa who had the skeleton

128
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:50,480
hanging of miss thailand 1936 his instructions for when he died

129
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:56,480
was to simply be put in the forest a place for his followers his monks nuns

130
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:02,000
could come and just contemplate his body decaying

131
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,919
he didn't get his wish because he was one of the most famous monks in thailand and so

132
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:13,280
other authorities had other ideas but

133
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:19,200
so our skin that we put a lot of attention to perhaps

134
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:24,560
our hair will all decay and pass away

135
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:33,280
may be eaten by worms and other things mushrooms and fungi and

136
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:40,398
the muscles that maybe some of us might be exercising working out

137
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:47,358
the muscles fade and decay they won't be here some point

138
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:52,878
the tendons will no longer be here the bones will no longer be held

139
00:34:52,879 --> 00:35:00,160
together the bones will begin to decay and eventually just become dust

140
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:08,160
so you know it's orient and orientated feeling knowing that not only the sensations go but all this

141
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:14,640
ways in which we're attached or we orient ourselves around the body will also go

142
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:21,920
um the absence of it the highlights that we're alive

143
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:30,320
and the and some of the core elements of that aliveness is are the sensations and the feelings

144
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:36,800
so to maybe we appreciate these sensations deeper in contemplating their absence through the image of a corpse

145
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:42,480
that we will be like a corpse too and maybe it's a way of taking a little

146
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:49,839
more seriously this moment the only place that you can be alive

147
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:55,760
is in the present moment and now there's a a

148
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,880
a very powerful verse in the dhammapada in chapter 2 the

149
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,720
first verse that says it goes something like

150
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:13,200
negligence is the path of death vigilance path to the deathless

151
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:19,119
those who are negligent are as if already dead

152
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:24,880
those who are vigilant never die

153
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:31,040
and i don't know you know what the figurative meaning this would never die but the sense of

154
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:36,320
to be vigilant to be hateful to be careful to be present

155
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:44,240
in a full way and the only place where that can happen which is now in the present moment

156
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:50,560
and to feel that to be pray to feel and pray present for that the flow of sensations of flow of

157
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:57,440
experience the flow of feelings to let go of everything else

158
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:06,440
when you die in your corpse you'll have letting go you will have let go of everything

159
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:14,079
it's possible to do this before you die

160
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:23,359
and why not why not when that gives us freedom why not that lives us gives us

161
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:29,280
an experience to really be alive and present and free

162
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,800
in a way that that is fantastic and wonderful

163
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:41,200
so to spend time contemplating

164
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:47,520
a corpse you might

165
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:54,320
that you might not have a place to go anatomy lab to go visit a corpse it's probably pretty easy to find some

166
00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:01,359
photographs but the photographs of

167
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,880
people who are peacefully dead maybe photographs of bodies which are

168
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:12,000
decaying not to make it gruesome not to

169
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:19,920
upset your stomach but is there a way of contemplating corpses the body that has no animated

170
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:26,720
sensations that brings you into the present moment i'll tell you a story which i've

171
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:33,200
something i do which i've told many times but it's related to this

172
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:39,440
i'm fond of looking at old photographs old enough that the people in it are no

173
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:45,040
longer alive like from 100 120 years ago 130 40 years ago

174
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:50,240
and i like it when the people in it when the photograph has a really good resolution

175
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:56,800
and and you see portraits of people see people and i'll go up and look at their eyes

176
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:03,119
get close or their expression in their face and occasionally you see you see in the

177
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:08,480
old photographs a gleam in their eyes like the spark of life that was there for that moment

178
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:15,838
other times you see the expression of their faces that are kind of stand out like expression of the moment

179
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:24,960
and now when i see these i i contemplate this was their moment to be alive

180
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:31,760
and this is my moment for me to be alive somehow appreciating that that was their

181
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,960
moment i don't want to miss my moment this is my moment my

182
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,400
my glimmer of spark of life life is short and

183
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:50,400
and so kind of looking at for old photographs puts me into my own life in a fuller nicer way

184
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:57,760
so um i think that's what i'll say today and

185
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:03,920
i'm unsure what we'll do tomorrow i kind of would like to do one more day on the corpse

186
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,960
i haven't really introduced you to the full text of it

187
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:14,079
and um but um maybe maybe we'll see or we'll move over

188
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:21,400
to feelings and so

189
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,078
thank you and i'll be here tomorrow
