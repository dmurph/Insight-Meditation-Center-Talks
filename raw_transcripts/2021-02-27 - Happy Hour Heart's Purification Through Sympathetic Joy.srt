2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,759
preliminaries before you actually get to sit and meditate so these are our preliminaries

10
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,600
own good fortune which gets expressed as gratitude

11
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:13,119
and we spent a few sessions with the practice of vicarious joy

12
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:18,799
appreciative joy for a neutral person just anyone in the world which is

13
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:27,600
such an expansive practice in in expanding our heart and um and as many of you comment in the

14
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,880
previous sessions this is such a an expansive a hard expansive it's such

15
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,560
a happy making practice um to really turn our minds

16
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,320
to good fortune with appreciation whether it's ours or other peoples and just

17
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,320

19
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:04,719
happy that you're happy so as we work through these concentric

20
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:10,879
circles in this practice and we start where it's easy and then we expand

21
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:16,319
our heart more and more and more and then we might get into areas that

22
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:24,879
are a little challenging and we work with them and we expand our heart further so for today

23
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:31,280
we are going to both work with the neutral being and a little bit

24
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:39,599
ourselves and then dip our toes expand into the next category which is someone we're having

25
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:47,760
some challenge with someone we're having some challenge with and um

26
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,280
really feeling that they too are a human being just like us

27
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,760
and can we also celebrate their good fortune not condoning everything all the other

28
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,959
complications that we might have but saying hey can

29
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:11,599
my heart be expanded to just feel happy for their happiness and

30
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:17,120
see wow how that can be transformative how transformative that can be

31
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:25,360
in the in the way we see our own capacity to relate to others

32
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:32,959
we can actually really surprise ourselves in how we can celebrate the good fortune

33
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:39,920
of others even even if we're having some entanglement

34
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,760
can really surprise us and really get us to see dimensions of our humanity

35
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:52,640
that maybe we were not even privy to so so that's the invitation for tonight

36
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:59,200
and we'll get into it slowly slowly slowly especially if this this seems a little intimidating what

37
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:05,760
what are we gonna do don't worry we'll slowly slowly as usual we'll get it to also the

38
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:14,959
end if any challenges come up i always want to say this if any challenging emotions come up

39
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:22,880

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:45,679
them maybe they're a neighbor you see walking by

112
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:53,919
or maybe someone at a store where you shop

113
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,559
or a delivery person

114
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:10,080
bringing this person this human being a stand-in for all of humanity

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:15,840
of the heart not condoning the harm or the hurt

178
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:24,000
the poor behavior not condoning any of that but it's also possible to step

179
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,799
out of the limited view of me and you and them i just

180
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:35,679
feel happy for happiness for good fortune

181

for good fortune in the world as if you're stepping out of yourself

182
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:57,600
because if you're a little fairy with wings a little angel that is you this feeling

183

happy for happiness in the world including this person

184

letting your heart feel expansive in its own gladness and generosity

185
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:39,840
so much more expansive and glorious

186
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:53,840
capacity of our heart that we give ourselves credit for

187
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:32,638
and as you may see yourself as this little fairy with expansive heart

188
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:37,919
sharing feeling gladness the gladness of

189
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:45,760
this person you are entangled with also you're neutral this neutral person

190
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:54,320
as well as yourself seeing yourself from perhaps an external perspective

191

[Music]

199
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,200
thank you all thank you for your

200
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:56,880
practice so we have some time for reflections questions

201
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:02,240
reports from the field the field of your heart

202
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:11,119
what did you notice what worked what was challenging it's all welcome

203
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:18,720
everything you share is supportive of others

204
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:26,320
nancy please um i have sort of

205
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:35,839
repeated problems with this issue of um jealousy that arises when i'm trying

206
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:43,440
to wish somebody that i clearly uh care deeply about um

207
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:51,680
but uh i'm struggling with it yeah yeah thank you for sharing

208
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:59,599
so just to say this is very common uh with this practice as i've

209
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:07,040
said before um it's considered um since this is a purification practice

210
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:12,640
it will bring up it will bring up the feelings that we have so is it okay if i ask you and you don't

211
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,880
have to answer if you don't want to but you can unmute yourself

212
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:22,880
does it come up in the sense of you feeling happy for this area of their life and you want that

213
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:29,920
thing they have or can you say just a little more what's how if you feel comfortable i would like

214
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:39,200
to have what they have and i would also like um to share that with them

215
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:48,680
say more i if you would what do you mean um

216
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:57,280
[Music] having a partnership with them in that certain area

217
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:04,880
okay to share it to share it with them i see a love relationship but a partnership

218
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:11,680
a creative process partnership yeah yeah i see so this is something that

219
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:18,960
they have you feel happy for them it's a blessing in their life that they have partnership creative partnership with

220
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,160
others and and you're so happy they have that and you want that in your life

221
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:31,839
too um and you want to have it with them oh oh so so that's where the tightness

222
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:39,520
though i want this and they're suffering oh i really want this yeah um but it's clearly

223
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:47,359
um a beautiful and very um um rich uh

224
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:53,520
fruitful part of their life right now yeah yeah yeah so a couple of couple of

225
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:58,880
suggestions i have nancy both for you and and everyone will be many of us

226
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:07,200
experiencing this because as an aspect of this so one thing you can do is to um

227
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:13,920
start perhaps with feeling um practicing uh

228
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:20,160
mudita practicing vicarious your appreciative joy first for an area of their life

229
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:26,880
that is not also what you want just kind of start where it's easier right start where it's

230
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:35,280
easier and then make your way towards something that you also want so that could be uh

231
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:42,720
one way to work with it that's one idea and then another idea is actually

232
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:51,200
um what i was suggesting towards the end of the guided meditation is for you to uh what if you stepped

233
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:56,720
out of yourself and you were this little fairy right and you were saying nancy oh nancy

234
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:04,400
oh dear nancy she wants that too i have compassion for her oh and then this friend of of hers has this

235
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:10,079
has this great partnership oh can be so so basically what i'm suggesting to

236
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:17,839
not personalize it because when we are in our selfing we're not then it feels like me

237
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:23,359
i want this for me it's like but if you try to remove yourself

238
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:29,599
even if for a moment you tap into that like oh wow this is possible

239
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:36,720
this is possible i can open something new up yeah i'm really stuck there

240
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:45,839
then try the first one and try the first one yeah yeah great thank you nancy

241
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:53,599
yeah appreciation for you asking the question mothers

242
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:01,680
so any other reflections or questions you like to share before we

243
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:13,838
move on

244
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,640
ah william please hi

245
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:30,000
i had a similar situation to nancy and what came up um

246
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,720
was the wish like what i could what i could access and i don't know if this is bypassing

247
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:41,920
was a wish for their happiness um

248
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:51,440
that was free from conditions so like a happiness free from dependency on conditions

249
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:58,319
um rather than wishing them more of the thing that i wanted um so i don't know if that's equanimity

250
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:03,520
or if that's bypassing yeah no it's not so what what basically

251
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:09,119
you did what i appreciate in how you tried to work with it is you went to metta

252
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:14,960
which is may you be happy may you be well may you be safe so basically uh

253
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:21,200
generally wishing them well without focusing on that thing that

254
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:28,720
you also want so i think that's what you did ram is very skillful yay and that i consider

255
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:34,319
what you did also a bridge a bridge to then doing with beta for

256
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:39,520
them because mudita is you know happiness for someone

257
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:44,640
who has what you want especially if they're challenging person it's kind of it's like expanding expanding and we

258
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:52,720
want to start where it's easier and then make our way for it so what you did is lovely fantastic it's not a spiritual

259
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:59,040
bypass at all it's going to matter cultivating just goodwill may you have

260
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:06,079
plenty and then later when there is more stability in the heart and mind more expansiveness more practice than

261
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:11,599
then i do suggest expanding it a little bit how does that sound

262
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:19,920
doable doable is good great fantastic

263
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,240
um

264
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:34,480
jerry asks is it helpful to see others accomplishments as something to admire rather than be jealous of them um

265
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:41,599
i appreciate that that suggestion that that's another way to see how actually what they have can can

266
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:46,960
inspire you can be inspiring instead of contractive

267
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:52,880
how it can be inspiring so um that's great also building bridges these

268
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:58,240
are all creative ways to work with our hearts and minds when they get contractive

269
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:04,319
to see oh how can i work for it to be more open you know either you little fairy or you

270
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:10,319
start with meta or you you uh feel inspired like oh wow

271
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:16,800
what they have is lovely it's fantastic oh i'm so inspired by that that's that's a great idea too so this is a

272
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:24,079
creative practice everyone this is a creative practice so so let's

273
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:29,839
practice in a small come in in little groups so my invitation

274
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:36,079
is tonight as we get into small groups first um let's

275
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:42,560
just start with sharing one thing you're grateful for or one blessing in your life let's do

276
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:48,000
one round of that one round of that all around and then you can share anything you like

277
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:55,359
about anything you wish about your practice something that was challenging something that was

278
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:03,680
inspiring something creative that you work through so um that's the invitation so

279
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:10,200
let me make the rooms and here we go

280
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:15,280
[Music] okay i'm opening here we go

281
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:21,280
the rooms are closed so we've got a couple of minutes we'd love to hear what you discovered in

282
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:27,359
um practicing together and and discussing so especially if you haven't shared

283
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:39,200
please if you'd like to raise your hand or type in chat i'll wait a minute and

284
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:45,599
actually while i'm waiting for you to raise your hand i'll say that this is not an easy practice

285
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:51,599
because of exactly these um challenging emotions that come up

286
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:56,880
wanting some especially with respect to what we did tonight someone we have

287
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:04,160
entanglements with this is it's a challenging practice and yet and yet we work towards it so if you if

288
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:09,599
you found it challenging great you're discovering the

289
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:14,880
purification power of this practice so hang in here hang in here hang in

290
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:23,359
here it's very very very common for this to come up and i remember years ago um for me also when i was a

291
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:29,440
beginner practitioner these are the things that would come up and there's a lot of purification what happened

292
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:35,280
so this is part of it this is part of it don't feel like you're failing or you're not doing it right

293
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:43,040
you're doing it exactly right this is what's supposed to happen on the way to to purification of

294
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:49,280
emotions and wanting and the contraction so it's all good so and really appreciate nancy for

295
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:58,640
bringing it up yes enough hey good morning nikki oh morning now

296
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:03,920
talking about uh entanglements um i'm wondering about the relationship of this

297
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:10,160
practice with expectation so you know the idea that you know an expectation can be a contract with

298
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:15,760
ourselves to be unhappy until we get what we want so um are we really ultimately working

299
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:22,640
with um our expectation of the other in this practice

300
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:28,960
so so um what i heard you say is or what i

301
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:34,640
understood you say was is all the maybe one thing that's making this practice challenging is that

302
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:41,280
this idea that we have this understanding that until we get what we want we won't be

303
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:47,839
happy and oh other people have what we want and also there's the scarcity mentality perhaps that could be a part of that oh

304
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:53,440
they have what what we want and we want that too so and and uh

305
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:59,839
happiness without conditions we can be happy um this this my my

306
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:06,400
one of my favorite quotes happiness is a choice you make it's not about what you have which is

307
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:15,200
part of this path it's really so um it's about realizing that the even if you had what

308
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:20,800
you think would make you happy there's still more to want so

309
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:27,680
it's it's yeah this this can this is a huge teaching

310
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:33,839
both in terms of selfing just being happy for your own happiness and wanting what you want

311
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:41,359
uh and and also as you brought up beautifully this expectation that what you want will make

312
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:47,680
you happy and that person is happy because they have what you want it's just all these implications that

313
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:53,599
you're pointing to um yeah thank you enough anything else you want to add if i missed

314
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:59,839
what you were trying to bring up yeah i'd love for you to just touch a little bit on generosity

315
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:06,880
and kind of cultivating that quality of fullness i mean i think um you know the that base

316
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:13,200
in which all action springs from um i wonder if like that's the base quality that

317
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:21,599
really needs to be cultivated in order to kind of have this right view yeah yeah it is and and it's

318
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:29,440
you know it's interesting because um there are so many different ways that this practice works there's so many

319
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:37,200
different ways that it works so um for some people it does work with

320
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:42,880
this sense of abundance and generosity of spirit and this concept that i've brought into

321
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:48,400
into this meeting a lot uh through this sense of generosity of

322
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:53,920
spirit um and for example the example of the little fairy that i was bringing up

323
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:59,040
for you to try on is this sense of generosity of spirit this little fairy

324
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:04,880
who's not attached to an ego or herself is just generous just generous

325
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:13,200
so that could be one way that works for some people for some people that doesn't work it might the need might be to go through

326
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:19,040
the pain of wanting oh i really want this and i don't have it and ouch that's painful

327
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:24,319
really working through the emotions of contraction and wanting and selfing so

328
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:31,839
there are many many different paths to the temple uh nav and what you're bringing up is

329
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:39,760
one path a beautiful path and there's it's it's very individual it's not one size fits all

330
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:46,559
yeah thank you thanks for bringing that up yeah good to see you so

331
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:51,599
um [Music] one quick question from bill

332
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:56,880
purification implies that these negative states lessen over time correct yes correct

333
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:03,680
that is a correct bill so the time has come for us to bring this session to an

334
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:11,200
end so thank you all thank you for your practice for your generosity of heart to show up

335
