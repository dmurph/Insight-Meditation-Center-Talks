7
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:28,799
together and this week and I've been using a metaphor of um sitting like a

8
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:36,240
mountain uh as a a way to ground ourselves and then today I'll be

9
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,000
building upon uh the metaphor sitting like a

10
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,240
mountain uh to evoke uh something else in addition to

11
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,719
being grounded here and so and join me along if you

12
00:01:53,719 --> 00:02:00,000
like I'll offer some guidance at the beginning and then we'll be sitting

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:10,640
together uh in silence so I'll begin with the sound of

14
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,369
[Music]

15
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:30,440
bowel so here we are gathering together

16
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,160
practicing

17
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,200
Dharma if you like you can take a few long deep

18
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:56,440
breaths as you settle in feel that we're practicing in community

19
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:12,840
and coming here arriving here and now in the present

20
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,840
moment knowing that we we have all this

21
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:39,480
fellow practitioners practicing together maybe we feel

22
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:45,400
uplifted inspired and

23
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:54,439
happy so we arrive here with a measure of

24
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:04,599
happiness in the midst of all that is here in the body and mind and

25
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:30,319
heart allow mindfulness and a heartfulness to come to the foreground

26
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:54,080
feeling and sensing the overall posture of the body

27
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:11,680
sensing contact of the body with the floor our Earth

28
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:33,479
underneath there is a gradual sense of of gathering

29
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:38,800
collecting composing

30
00:05:53,919 --> 00:06:01,638
inwardly releasing the weight of the body towards the Earth

31
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:17,599
we don't have to do anything it's

32
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:24,800
natural for this body to settle itself

33
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:36,800
allow the earthy body resting on Earth

34
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:08,599
the earthy feeling of the body is

35
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,520
grounding or

36
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,800
grounded

37
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:34,080
stable you may feel a sense of a root otness of this body on

38
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:46,039
Earth sitting like a mountain

39
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,400
you adjust according to how you

40
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:29,919
feel resting here in the quietude of the mountain

41
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,199
with in

42
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:03,240
you may hear a

43
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,360
sound you may feel a

44
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:15,279
temperature

45
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,360
smell for

46
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:21,120
it's natural in the quiet [Music] Mountain we can feel and sense the

47
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,399

in this last few moments of the meditation

93
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:21,519
together if you like maybe

94
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:29,600
inviting to open to a kind of

95
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,519
vast inclusive

96
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:43,480
field that includes all of us that are practicing

97
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,039
together we're sitting in the Refuge of

98
00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:00,440
aanaa and a feel like

99
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:12,880
this gratitude May naturally

100
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,320
arise connectedness

101
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:36,430
[Music]

102
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:45,720
and when you open your eyes and imagine yourself being a a live

103
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:51,120
mountain in the range of Mountains

104
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:56,279
mountain range alive

105
00:32:56,279 --> 00:33:01,960
vibrant in its own Own Way each of

106
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,919
us thank you thank you for the

107
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:21,679
practice so um this week I've been sharing some

108
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:29,080
Reflections about uh Refuge uh today I like to bring this

109
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:36,200
notion of Refuge in Dharma and some of you have probably

110
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:41,720
done this before um but I'd like to kind of invite

111
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:47,559
us to uh feel and Savor this sense of

112
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:56,159
Refuge in Dharma uh in our daily life the word Dharma has many

113
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:02,799
meanings um and so as such refuge in Dharma can have

114
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:10,158
many different aspects to it one of the many meanings of Dharma is

115
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:18,118
teachings the Buddhist teachings is called Dharma and Dharma also means nature and

116
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:25,878
so in our meditation I was pointing or hinting a sense of nature

117
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:33,679
within and we can say say that the Buddhist teachings are related to clear

118
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:39,800
seeing or knowing the nature of our body mind and

119
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:46,440
hearts so in practicing Dharma we're learning to come to know

120
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:52,359
this nature the nature the Dharma within

121
00:34:54,119 --> 00:35:01,160
ourselves um so what did the Buddha teach and some of you know that in over the

122
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:07,760
years of this 7 7 a.m. there are many lists being offered and so yes the

123
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:14,880
Buddha taught a lot and there were some huge volumes of poly Canon text that

124
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:23,640
gathers the teachings and of the Buddha and his disciples and yet

125
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:32,400
um if I had to summarize what the Buddha taught we can also say that there is a Core

126
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:40,079
theme to The teaching the Buddha is concern was concerned about suffering

127
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:45,520
and the end of suffering and that was what brought him

128
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,760
to his own path and also what motivated

129
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:57,960
him to teach after his Awakening and so many of you probably

130
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:04,359
know that this is a shorthand um form of the teaching of the

131
00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:13,280
Four Noble Truth there is suffering or the poly term Dua there is the origin or the

132
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:21,000
cause of the suffering and there is a seizing or a cessation of the suffering

133
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:29,520
and there is the path practice path that leads to the cessation of the

134
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:37,240
suffering and so there is this Core theme uh that uh the Buddha had taught

135
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:44,119
many of the lists all the different lists you've heard um one in one we are

136
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:51,520
another are ways to elaborate the different aspects of the Four Noble

137
00:36:53,520 --> 00:37:00,400
Truth I as I was reflecting about this and remembered that the first uh very

138
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:07,640
first discourse that the Buddha offered after his Awakening to his first five

139
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:15,839
disciples uh was the Four Noble Truth teaching and uh and then towards his

140
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:22,079
last days of his life and as documented in Parana

141
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:29,280
suta uh you can find the for Noble Truth there again

142
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:35,680
and so that's the Core teaching but how would this teaching or

143
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:41,240
this Dharma be a refuge for us how do we

144
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:45,640
understand this and how do we feel into

145
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:53,480
this so for most of us if we are fortunate enough to have lived long

146
00:37:53,480 --> 00:38:01,160
enough to have experiences of of a wider range of Being Human living this humanly

147
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:08,800
life going through a lot of up and ups and downs happiness distress and the

148
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:16,200
worldly wings that um guil spoke about a few weeks ago pleasure pain gain and

149
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:24,240
loss praise and blame Fame disputes you know all this kind of

150
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,599
swirling opposites of um Our Lives

151
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,960
sooner or later we may begin to ask

152
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:43,520
ourselves is this it you know just kind of endless going around from wanting not

153
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:53,280
wanting um having not having or good or bad right or wrong I like I don't

154
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:58,599
like and we know um at some point

155
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:08,119
maybe even under the best circumstances of Our Lives this kind of spiraling patterns

156
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:17,800
can persist in small and big ways and so it can begin to stir our

157
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:25,280
hearts what is all of this what is this about right and so if the questions are

158
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:33,280
not being touched in or answered in some way it can be very unsettling for us I

159
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:40,400
felt this kind of stir in my own heart uh at some point of my

160
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:45,800
life and so inevitably we'll begin to

161
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:52,400
seek and um we'll also notice that this kind of pattern not happen not only

162
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:59,119
happens on the larger scale of our lives and it can happen in kind of micro

163
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:04,599
moments uh Moment by moment uh in our day in our

164
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:10,839
days uh if we observe Our Lives just in a day

165
00:40:10,839 --> 00:40:16,040
closely you may begin to see that you know there are some times that you're

166
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:23,800
very comfortable physically but after a while and there is a discomfort and pain

167
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:30,119
or I'm very satisfied content with the things and Then followed by

168
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:36,440
discontentment so it goes on at uh endlessly throughout the day if we begin

169
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:43,880
to kind of notice this so how do we relate

170
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:49,160
this um is there a way to meet

171
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:56,960
this is there a way that we can live with this without getting caught in the

172
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:03,599
SW ing patterns and this is where the for Noble Truth teaching comes

173
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:13,040
in and it acknowledges the viudes of life and it points out the root cause uh

174
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:19,800
that's craving of this viudes and there is a possibility to be

175
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:28,440
free from being caught by the ups and downs and and uh

176
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:34,119
pain and pleasure and most

177
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:41,200
importantly there is a practice path that each of us can engage in that

178
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:49,079
naturally leads to the possibility of being freed from the caught upness you

179
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:54,480
know being caught up and this word is quite important

180
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,480
being caught up is what is being being

181
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:07,200
freed it's not that we won't have pain or pleasure but rather how we relate to

182
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:16,000
them becomes different when I heard this first time

183
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:23,520
boy it's like light in the dark night I had the sense you know sign me

184
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:29,240
up I'm in maybe that's one way to experence experience The Refuge in

185
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:35,839
Dharma you know I'm in I like to I like to give myself over to this I wanted to

186
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:43,559
know this I want to practice this this path and so taking refuge in

187
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:49,119
dhma on one level just means that we give ourselves

188
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:56,079
over to the teaching we learn we practice it and we immerse ourselves

189
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:04,319
into it and we let the teachings and the practice come in life come alive in us

190
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:09,240
and so they become real in our

191
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:16,559
lives and so the Buddha had offered the practices that we can engage in like all

192
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:22,880
of us have been practicing and this is 700 a.m. and many other ways on retreats

193
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:31,319
in our daily life so that we can see that it is possible to break out of this

194
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:39,920
locked in pattern of reactivity wanting not wanting pushing pulling demanding or

195
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:47,079
avoiding and this is down through gradual gradually gradually getting to

196
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:52,800
know the nature of our mind and um

197
00:43:52,800 --> 00:44:02,400
heart and so we can get to know the patterns of duka and we can deeply understand how it

198
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,880
manifests in big ways or in very subtle

199
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:13,640
ways and we get to know how it arises and how it passes

200
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:20,800
away and so in the way it's a good news that when we're feeling anger

201
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:27,319
frustration jealousy happiness or feeling depressed

202
00:44:27,319 --> 00:44:34,040
we are not too quick to dismiss them but this is the the nature that

203
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:42,240
we're to explore to understand to see to really know what is this

204
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:49,200
pattern and in this exploration the Dharma the wisdom

205
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:56,240
naturally flows the care The Compassion naturally flows and that's the nature of the

206
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:03,359
Dharma and that the release of this caught upness of the

207
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:11,400
swirling becomes available to us it's through our curiosity in getting

208
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:20,200
to know this nature deeply and so for me taking refuge in

209
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:27,920
such a process a practice is like homecoming

210
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:34,720
you know I bow to this I give myself to this as best as I'm

211
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:42,559
able and trusting this gradual shifting and changing that may become available

212
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:47,079
to us through our sincere

213
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:53,359
practice and so I and uh I'll end this uh

214
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:59,280
darat by uh inviting you to save her a

215
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:06,440
little uh what does it feel for you to be in The Refuge of

216
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:14,160
Dharma maybe dropping that as a inquiry in your day and let yourself a feel what

217
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:20,960
does that feel for you what gets

218
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:29,200
evoked so thank you for your attention and May our exploration uh be

219
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:36,839
a source of a benefit to all beings so have a wonderful rest of the

220
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:42,800
day I'll be there tomorrow with you again
