1
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:08,360
so welcome and the topic for this week is

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:15,759
mindfulness of emotions and these emotions are to be respected

3
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,320
and cared for and attended to they're very important part of life but not only

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:27,960
life but they're very important part of Buddhist practice they're in integral to the

5
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,760
whole uh unfolding of Buddhist practice and to

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:40,039
not include our emotional life in the Buddhist practice is to Short Change

7
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:45,280
oneself in the richness and the unfolding of the

8
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:53,480
practice and important as it is maybe because it's so important we want to

9
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:59,359
create the right conditions for being present for the emotions right

10
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:07,320
conditions for our emotions to um to reveal themselves to

11
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:14,759
us the right uh way of developing a capacity to hold whatever emotion comes

12
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:20,280
through and that begins with the [Music]

13
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:27,560
posture that we assume when we meditate and whether

14
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:33,159
you're whatever way you you're you're meditating whether it's sitting or lying

15
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:40,320
down or standing or walking meditation the idea is to find be

16
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:47,240
careful not to just take a habitual posture not to just uh sit on the couch

17
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:53,840
and and um not give any care or attention to the posture you're

18
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,960
in but to uh find a posture that's appropriate

19
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,159
for you where you feel that there's

20
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,599
stability and uh a kind of postural

21
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:15,319
alertness a kind of uh

22
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:21,040
uh uh intentional capacity

23
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:31,760
to for the body and the posture to be the temple the container the the

24
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,840
that holds the emotions so it's not just the mind it's

25
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:46,200
not just our thinking that is responsible for finding a way to be with our

26
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:52,159
emotions because if it's just the mind if it's just thinking and

27
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,319
reacting we don't really allowing

28
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,920
ourselves opportunity to feel feel the emotions fully to let the emotions be

29
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:11,360
free within us without us reacting or picking them up or fueling

30
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,959
them so to spend a little bit a Time

31
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:23,440
adjusting your posture and it could be as simple as the way your hands

32
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,680
are that there's a feeling of being grounded in the

33
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:36,319
hands a sense of maybe strength I usually keep my hands my

34
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:41,080
Palms facing down on my

35
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,120
thighs and it's a little bit of a posture of being ready for

36
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,280
anything it's a posture that provides a kind of tripod effect for the rest of

37
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,120
the Torso

38
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:05,239
and maybe the spine is a little bit

39
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,280
straighter maybe the shoulders can roll back a little

40
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,439
bit even laying down that's possible sometimes to have the shoulder

41
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:23,479
blades shoulders roll back the shoulder blades going down the back a

42
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:31,600
little so the chest is a little bit more open

43
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:37,400
if we're the chest is caved

44
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:45,638
in there's less room in our torso for feeling and sensing our emotional

45
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:57,800
life and with that with a stable

46
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:05,199
open posture that maybe has some modum of

47
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,080
strength one of the first things we try to do with

48
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,758
emotions is to listen to

49
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,560
them and not just for their me not for a message or thoughts or stories connected

50
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:37,400
to them but a deep attention to how they're felt and

51
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:44,199
experienced in the body it's almost like we're listening to the

52
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:51,120
body many people benefit tremendously from being heard having

53
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:58,479
someone who's a really good listener hear what's going on our body benefits

54
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:06,599
immensely if we listen but not expecting words or not

55
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:10,599
expecting a verbal

56
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:19,800
conversation but listening represents a sensing where we make room for things to

57
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:27,039
be felt deeply fully as present moment

58
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,478
phenomena in the stable

59
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,479
posture the open

60
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:47,160
receptive attitude of listening as if your

61
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:55,039
body has important messages to tell you don't try to discern the messages

62
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:01,680
just listen [Music] feel how how your

63
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:08,680
emotions manifest physically in the chest in the belly in

64
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,840
the

65
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:19,080
shoulders so to gently close your

66
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:28,240
eyes feel your body the threedimensional

67
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,280
quality of the

68
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,560
body the weight of the

69
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
body

70
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,840
and as if you can make more room in your body by breathing in

71
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:25,800
deeply feel your torso fill your lungs with

72
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,240
air so that your chest expands

73
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,080
even your back rib cage

74
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,640
stretch and a long exhale to settle in to

75
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
relax

76
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:19,160
and letting your breathing return to normal and continue the process

77
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:25,399
of feeling your torso expand as you breathe

78
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,600
in relaxing as you

79
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:01,320
exhale and then notice how your your

80
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:09,040
feeling emotion that are present

81
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,480
mood mind

82
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:26,320
State the broad general feeling of your state of

83
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:34,000
being and whatever way you're feel feeling whatever emotions are

84
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,720
present it's allowed for this exercise it's

85
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:50,839
okay but find where in the body you most feel your

86
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:54,279
state of mind your inner

87
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,160
state is it mostly in the the

88
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,959
Torso mostly in the

89
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,399
head and your arms or your

90
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:23,880
legs is it's in your chest or in your

91
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:34,560
belly in the face or in the

92
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:46,639
neck wherever whatever wherever the emotion is most

93
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:52,680
active in your body wherever the evidence in your body

94
00:11:52,680 --> 00:12:00,560
is of how you're feeling trust the feeling it's it's

95
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,560
okay make room for

96
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:14,199
it and become a good friend to it by simply listening almost as if you're sitting

97
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:20,120
next to it on a park bench and you're attending you're

98
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,399
accompanying whatever feeling is

99
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:33,480
there and part of the purpose of listening in

100
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:41,320
the body feeling in the body with the emotions is to give more room for those

101
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:47,680
sensations of the body to move to

102
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:54,839
unfold emotions are always in motion if we

103
00:12:54,839 --> 00:13:03,959
allow them if we give them space listening to the emotions not

104
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:11,079
to hear a message but listen in such a way

105
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:16,920
that whatever movement the emotion wants to do physical

106
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:22,680
Sensations allow the sensations to flow to

107
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,760
move to change whatever way they want to change

108
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
for

109
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
for

110
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:43,160
if you're listening to someone playing music you're

111
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:49,040
quiet so it's not to disturb the hearing and the

112
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:57,639
music let your thinking mind become quieter so you can hear the music of

113
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:03,399
your emotions how emotions are

114
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:10,440
felt expressed in the

115
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:25,720
body giving permission for the emotion to live in the body in whatever

116
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,600
way it wants while you

117
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:38,319
sit stably in posture of stability and

118
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,680
strength that can allow it all to unfold

119
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
Within

120
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,519
e

121
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
e

122
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
for

123
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
e

124
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
for

125
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
for

126
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
for

127
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
for

128
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,400
as if you're

129
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,080
listening from a place deep

130
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:31,480
within that has lots of capacity to just

131
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:39,080
listen just feel whatever the mood or emotions you

132
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:51,120
have however subtle and if it feels right to do

133
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:58,200
so you can breathe with your emotional state your mood how

134
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:04,360
you feel breathe through

135
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
it

136
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
for

137
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
e

138
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
e

139
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,480
and as we come to the end of this

140
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:31,399
sitting to take a few gentle deeper

141
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:38,039
breaths relaxing the body as you

142
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:49,960
exhale breathing in relaxing the

143
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,120
heart softening in the

144
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:04,799
chest breathing in and

145
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,240
softening the thinking

146
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:32,240
mind and then

147
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:43,720
considering in whatever way that you experience emotions and feelings

148
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,398
moods so do

149
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:55,480
others that the moods and states of Mind inner states of being of

150
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:00,720
others is an important part of who they are

151
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:05,759
and regardless of what they do in their

152
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:13,279
life if we just could be attuned and feel their inner

153
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:24,360
State we would probably care for them we'd probably wish them

154
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:33,000
well and to end this

155
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:40,759
meditation with a wish for the well-being of

156
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:48,159

emotions and uh yesterday the topic was or the practice was to be able to

172
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:32,880
recognize the presence of an emotion in a respectful way to recognize it with

173
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,039
some feeling of Freedom not participating not activated

174
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:44,120
by not reactive to emotions but this beautiful way in which the mind can know

175
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:50,720
something clearly name something ah it's and in the naming in the recognition of

176
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:57,559
what it actually is there's a feeling of space or feeling of of uh n non

177
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:04,320
stickiness non- entanglement oh this is how it is and the exercise yesterday was to

178
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:11,559
just disco try to discover that just in a in a moment not that it have to last anything more than just a moment when

179
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:18,320
which you're recognizing this movement to be

180
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:24,760
unentangled un not reactive to emotions not judging them not participating in

181
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:31,880
them not um collapsing in them but finding a certain degree of Freedom with

182
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:38,159
emotions is U supported by mindfulness of the body and this is one of the

183
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:43,640
reasons why in this series we do mindfulness of the body before doing mindfulness of

184
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:50,480
emotions all emotions are uh one way or the other are

185
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,159
manifested in Sensations in the body and sometimes we have to be very they're

186
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:04,320
very subtle and you have to be be very attempted to feel it but they're always there in the body and and um and there's

187
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:09,840
a way of dropping in and feeling the physical manifestation of emotions which

188
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:17,200
is a wonderful alternative to uh living in the thoughts about the emotion to

189
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:24,320
living in the stories of the emotions some emotions are really closely connected to the stories we tell

190
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:30,240
ourselves and um in fact you we can just be sitting peacefully and then we

191
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:36,559
remember a story of being hurt by someone or someone offended us and as we tell ourselves the story remember the

192
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:45,159
story we can feel the emotions arise and um and uh and so the more we stay in the

193
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:51,440
story of mind repeating and repeating and repeating what happened or thinking about it or caring repeating the

194
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:59,679
conversation um uh it it fuels the emotion more and more and uh one of the

195
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:06,799
reasons some people will go distract themselves is so that they're not repeating the harmful way of thinking

196
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:15,240
that's causing difficult emotions and um so the um uh so to drop down into the

197
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:22,120
body as an alternative to to the Mind thinking and story making is a very

198
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:28,559
significant way for uh us to start giving the emotions some freedom freed

199
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:35,639
uh and freedom doesn't mean that we act freely in whatever way the emotion seems to want to direct us in it's powerful

200
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:45,760
very significant in meditation we're more or less committed not to move and uh so we don't uh give in to

201
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:52,760
whatever the emotion wants us to do we feel it instead we feel it with

202
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:59,200
respect and uh another way of talking about feeling the emotion in the body that I like a lot this idea of listening

203
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,720
to it um all all emotions are

204
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:11,200
messages all emotions have some you know almost like a purpose to

205
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:17,320
be there they shouldn't be dismissed but one of for the people who do mindfulness

206
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:23,000
meditation uh one of the purposes of the emotions is to allow the momentum the

207
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,960
movement of whatever we're feeling to move through us unencumbered uh unencumbered by

208
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:36,840
attachment unencumbered by resistance unencumbered by preferes and judgments

209
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:43,080
unen unencumbered by repression and pushing it down to avoid it and to learn

210
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:48,840
that we have the capacity to feel the emotions of our life without being troubled by

211
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:54,720
them and that can be difficult emotions and it can be beautiful emotions we can

212
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,360
uh and we start learning that the freedom to feel is better a better

213
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:06,639
pleasure than the pleasure of good emotions some people lean into the uh

214
00:34:06,639 --> 00:34:11,839
good emotions and hold on to them and celebrate them in a way that kind of is

215
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:17,919
being caught in their a grip there's nothing inherently wrong with doing that

216
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:24,760
but there's something better to do and that's the pleasure of being free

217
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:30,480
in uh in relationship to so it's not just allowing the motion to be there so

218
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,079
listening deeply like we're listening to the body the body is almost like the

219
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:43,398
transmitter of emotions and so that's where we want to listen and the benefit of that is that

220
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:48,520
um it takes us out of the story-making Mind the thinking mind which can add

221
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:54,158
fuel to the fire of the emotions uh or is where we how we get

222
00:34:54,159 --> 00:35:01,520
caught by them and how we identify with the emotions to uh dropping into the

223
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:11,680
body and allowing the emotion to have its life in the body all emotions want

224
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:18,599
to move if the if the emotion creates tightness in the body contraction and

225
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:24,079
and then if we make space to listen to it it begins to relax and open if there

226
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:29,440
are if the emotions involve some kind of nervous energy as we listen to it and

227
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,680
make space for the nervousness uh it has nervousness has it chance to settle that

228
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:40,480
it doesn't if we keep thinking about the scary thoughts so listening to the body oh

229
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:47,720
that's where the nervousness is and now let's listen deeply as if it has a message as if it's a friend in distress

230
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:53,960
who just wants someone to be to accompany them and listen to them oh that's where it is in the belly the

231
00:35:53,960 --> 00:36:03,359
nervousness or in the chest in the shoulders wherever it might be um and um same thing with anger if

232
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:11,359
anger is uh uh a feeling of pressure and and forcefulness within us tightening uh

233
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:16,560
if we you know if if you feel you know if your hand is clenched and a friend

234
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:22,920
comes along and doesn't say anything doesn't judge you but just holds the clenched hand you didn't even know was

235
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:28,880
clenched until you felt the warmth softness of your friends holding it and then it

236
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,920
releases so the we bring this capacity

237
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,800
to hold to feel to listen to whatever the emotion might

238
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:46,760
be if the emotions involve tension of any kind attachment in any kind this

239
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:54,000
practice of just feeling in the body and letting it like let it letting the body's expression have room and space to

240
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:01,640
change and be it tends to change by relaxing tends to some emotions some

241
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:10,440
difficult emotions need to have the chance to get stronger before they can pass away you might feel some anger but

242
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:17,319
as we feel the anger the inner kind of Wellspring the volcano allow maybe needs

243
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:24,440
the volcano to the to the U it to become kind of strong anger rage and so we then

244
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:30,280
we learn we open up to the capacity to feel the rage in this meditative posture

245
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:37,599
that we have and uh make room for it and learn slowly over time that no matter what the

246
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:44,680
emotion is we have the capacity to be still receptive open

247
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:50,920
kind um uh so that it can process itself in a sense all emotions are being our

248
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:57,640
processes unfolding and there's something very significant about just making room for it in body that's quiet

249
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:03,680
and still there are certainly other ways of processing emotions and uh you know

250
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:10,160
sometimes it's good to I like to walk if there's a lot of anger I used to be like to just go for long walks to get it

251
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:17,359
moving and that allowed me to keep stay in the body there's many ways of processing but for in meditation this is

252
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:25,440
the way it can be done and then if the emotion is a healthy one a nourishing one um this

253
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:33,200
making space and listening has a different effect than letting it relax uh then it allows the goodness the

254
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:40,800
goodness over the warmth or the tenderness or the good feelings of the happy emotion to begin spreading through

255
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:46,640
the body it makes room for it to become to suffuse the body rather than being

256
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:53,520
bottled up some good emotions can have a little bit like attachment connected to them like we're excited and we it gets

257
00:38:53,520 --> 00:39:01,319
channeled in some way but to make room for it there's a kind of calmness and suffusion and spreading of that goodness

258
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:06,720
throughout the body so a huge part of mindfulness of

259
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:14,599
emotions is um the practice of uh embodiment of feeling the emotion as it

260
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:22,280
is expressed or felt in the body and um the first step in this doing

261
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:29,000
so is just becoming familiar with how emotions are in the body um all the different ways that are

262
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:35,079
different emotions different moods mind States um energetically

263
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:41,599
uh sensation wise all Sensations that come into play getting familiar with it

264
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:48,079
as we get familiar with it then the second stage is to make room for it to

265
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:53,480
make room to see to allow for how those Sensations

266
00:39:53,480 --> 00:40:00,400
connected to the emotion change how they unfold and how they're part of a ongoing

267
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:06,520
processing that cannot happen if we are living in the reactivity of the Mind the

268
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:11,720
thoughts of the Mind the attachments the stories that keep fueling

269
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:17,000
them and um and so

270
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,920
um so for today if you would like um

271
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:30,800
make it a day to explore this sensations of whatever mind State mood

272
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:37,440
inner state of being that you have um no matter how subtle it

273
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,599
is uh and chances are pretty high that

274
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:48,720
there's always going to be something to feel uh and uh but it takes sensitivity

275
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:54,359
it takes pausing and looking so through the day you might find a way to pause

276
00:40:54,359 --> 00:41:01,040
and to feel carefully respect F what are the sensations in the body connected to

277
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:08,839
how you're feeling and uh and and if you want to do the Second Step then um just quietly

278
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:14,040
listen to it as if it has permission to be there uh as if there's no need to

279
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:20,040
judge it but just make room and listen and feel and sense and and see if as you

280
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:27,160
do so what changes maybe you want to breathe with it and that's a nice way of connected

281
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:33,640
sometimes breathing with an emotion makes it easier to stay present rather than drifting

282
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:41,240
away so uh uh I hope that uh doing this

283
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:48,119
mindfulness of emotions this way in the body enriches your life U I found that it enriched my life

284
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:55,800
tremendously and uh it's a fantastic foundation for deepening Dharma practice

285
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:02,160
which the deepening of practice is through the vehicle of what could be called emotions or

286
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:07,559
feelings so thank you and we'll continue

287
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
tomorrow
