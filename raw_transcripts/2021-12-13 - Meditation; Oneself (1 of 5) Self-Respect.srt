1
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,640
so now let's see okay so

2
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,840
all the equipment i think is right now

3
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,480
so good morning a good day it's a nice day here in redwood city

4
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,559
because we've had a nice rainstorm overnight and we certainly

5
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:55,360
certainly needed it here so

6
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,000
i would like to try something different this week for the this seven o'clock time this guided

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,159
meditation time and uh and that is um not to do a guided

8
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:15,600
meditation but to allow you to have these minutes in silence

9
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,720
we've done doing for many of us guided meditations now for you know since the beginning of the pandemic

10
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:29,439
and there's also a great value in sitting silently and quietly in community in this way

11
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:36,640
i know some of you will be disappointed and but just for this one week and

12
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,079
and i hope that the teachings the instructions you've

13
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:48,000
received now over this time will um you know

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,119
come to fruit and as you sit for these minutes of quietly about 25 minutes

15
00:01:53,119 --> 00:02:00,799
we'll have and then and then i'll give the teachings for this week starting at 7 30.

16
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:07,360
and so so without anything

17
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,479
more to say please

18
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,040
settle in and and then maybe in the silence of practice you'll be more

19
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,640
receptive or ready for the teachings that will come today

20
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,159
so then as we come to the end of the sitting

21
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,320
to

22
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,840
spend a few moments

23
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,720
reflecting on how whatever benefits have come or whatever

24
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:55,279
has we've learned from this meditation about ourselves about

25
00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:01,279
presence attention silence stillness

26
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:08,799
how can it be beneficial as we go into the world how can we benefit it benefit others

27
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,320
through what we've had this morning

28
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:23,360
to be able to reflect on

29
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:32,480
benefiting this world is one of the great

30
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:40,399
benefits of treasures of spending quiet time meditating

31
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:47,559
to come out of that wishing for the welfare and happiness of all beings

32
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:58,639
may all beings be happy may all beings

33
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,480
be safe may all beings

34
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,559
be peaceful and may all beings everywhere

35
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,440
be free

36
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:30,369
[Music]

37
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:45,360
okay so um

38
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,880
so for this week the theme will be

39
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:02,080
oneself so the focus is on a relationship through oneself

40
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:07,440
and um i was a little surprised that this came up as a theme for this time of the year

41
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:13,360
i had thought perhaps this was a better time for something like loving kindness or

42
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:19,039
compassion or generosity so we get into the holiday season

43
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:26,080
but then i thought that no i think that a focus on oneself

44
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:31,279
to kind of come into a better space a

45
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:37,360
better way of being with oneself can prepare ourselves to be in the social world those of us who are going

46
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:43,600
to be more social perhaps or more interactive during the holiday season

47
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:50,720
so oneself it's a little bit of surprising theme for

48
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:56,080
buddhists sometimes because of sometimes an excessive emphasis on

49
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:01,120
not-self and it seems like we should not shouldn't talk about self at all

50
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,200
but if you find and then look in the teachings of the buddha he often talked about

51
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:14,080
that we use the word self the pali word is atta atta in positive sense

52
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:19,840
i believe without any [Music] fear a concern

53
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:27,200
that would be misunderstood as being a metaphysical cell self or being some kind of permanent self or

54
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,640
permanent existential self that somehow the ordinary idea of

55
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:39,200
oneself is a valuable and and useful uh reference point

56
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:46,640
for understanding ourselves and our lives and uh the um

57
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:53,440
and i think that to some degree there's this wonderful uh interactiveness and and balance and

58
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:59,039
ancient teachings of the buddha between a certain kind of individualism

59
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:04,399
and a certain kind of collectivism certain kind of emphasis on

60
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:10,720
personal agency and what we can do and an emphasis on

61
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:17,360
being open receptive connected with others in the world around us

62
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,559
and the combination of those is a fascinating way of living this life

63
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:28,080
and i'll say more about that in a couple of minutes but i wanted to read a passage from the dhammapada

64
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,919
where this word self is is utta is used

65
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:38,240
and here it's being translated as oneself

66
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:47,600
if one knew oneself to be precious one would guard oneself with care

67
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:54,000
the sage sages watch over themselves in any part of the night

68
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,640
so i think that sages often stay up and meditate through the night so they're caring for each other caring for

69
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:08,320
themselves this idea if one knew oneself to be precious one would guard oneself with care

70
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,760
and also goes on and says one self indeed is one's own protector

71
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:20,320
what other protector could there be with with self-control one gains a protector

72
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:26,320
hard to obtain so to having the agency of being one's own

73
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:31,919
protector and um what other protector could there be

74
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:37,279
many of us are hoping others will protect us others will make us safe if only other people would behave in a

75
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:45,039
certain way then we'll be safe and it's it's common these days to for plenty of people to

76
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:51,600
say that they're not safe and then insist that others change how they are to make them safe

77
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:57,279
and there's some value to that and we don't want to discredit its importance of doing that

78
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:03,039
at times but there's also something very important about learning how to be one's own protector

79
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:10,079
and learning how to find safety within and here it's i said it's

80
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:15,919
obtained through self-control when gains a protector hard to obtain

81
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:21,358
and so one of the uh one of those ways i i'd

82
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:28,480
like to present this idea that each of us for ourselves is precious each of us for ourselves is dear

83
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:35,118
is uh through the notion of self-respect respecting ourselves and

84
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:41,040
respect has this wonderful combination of having agency

85
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:47,520
with doing something and also a kind of openness a kind of

86
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:54,079
making space for kind of letting go of conceit and self-concern for something to that which we respect

87
00:34:54,079 --> 00:35:01,040
to give some kind of care to it or deference to it generally we think that it's easier to

88
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:07,040
understand with other people or some other parts of reality if we have respect for it

89
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:13,280
so to respect someone is a powerful act that we generate from

90
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:19,200
inside of us when it's done wisely and then to

91
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:25,040
at the same time as this taking agency for this respect having this respect for someone

92
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:31,200
there's also a kind of putting oneself a little bit aside hopefully in a healthy way a little bit

93
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:37,280
of a difference here they're making space for the other person that we respect it's kind of like hospitality

94
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:45,040
is one of these things where these dual related dual activities is there then on one hand we are the agent of offering

95
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:50,240
hospitality to someone and in offering hospitality we there is

96
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:55,760
a kind of self-forgetting it's kind of putting oneself aside for the purpose of supporting helping

97
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:01,440
hosting someone else i think generosity also has this this

98
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:08,640
dual action of of agency that we do but also a giving away

99
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:14,320
and perhaps compassion is the same way that we can generate compassion care for

100
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,680
others and at the same time it is caring for others and a certain kind of healthy

101
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:25,359
way we're putting ourselves aside our preferences and things

102
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:32,400
so respect is that way and and um and that dual kind of relationship can be towards ourselves

103
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:39,119
we can have agency in deciding or having respect for ourselves

104
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:44,640
giving ourselves respect and at the same time as doing that

105
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:51,440
letting go of conceit letting go of certain kind of preferences for what we do and what we

106
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,720
should do so that we can really know ourselves better feel ourselves better be present

107
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,920
for us in a bigger way and um

108
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:07,520
so this idea of um we are important enough we're valuable

109
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:14,480
enough that we are appropriate object of our own respect

110
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:19,839
and and just like everyone we can respect

111
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:25,520
there's certain kind of way of valuing and seeing the worth of every human being and

112
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:30,960
not to leave ourselves out of that to have respect for ourselves to have

113
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:36,640
care for ourselves the the movement of love in buddhism

114
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,760
is not a movement where everyone is loved but oneself

115
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:49,119
but it's a movement of love that includes ourselves so i think of sometimes as the

116
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:56,320
as the heart the emotional heart being kind of like a light bulb and then you turn it on the light you

117
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:03,119
know maybe it's you know the room gets filled quickly with light but there the if it went the first light shines on

118
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:08,240
ourselves and and then it light it shines on what's

119
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:14,800
around us the the love the care the respect first goes through us

120
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:23,680
and then into the world around us and it's my hope that if we have self-respect we actually have uh uh

121
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:30,800
more substance in ourselves for respecting others that we show up more fully when we have

122
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,920
self-respect and the more fully we show up the more we're there

123
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:41,839
to care love be friendly supportive kind to other people

124
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:48,000
the self-respect that we are we are we're allowed to live we're allowed to

125
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,880
be we don't have to be apologetic for ourselves defend ourselves we don't have to be self-effacing we don't have to

126
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:01,359
kind of um not count we're allowed to account

127
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:08,079
so that we can let everyone else count better we're allowed to be worthy and full so that we can

128
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:14,920
offer the gift of attention and presence and space for other people as well

129
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,119
so this idea of refuge

130
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:30,079
oneself is the refuge of oneself what other refuge can there be

131
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:35,359
so again the idea of protector with our own protector our own refuge

132
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:40,880
and so how do we make ourselves a refuge for ourselves how do we make protect

133
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:47,119
ourselves and uh how do we so i would like to say that

134
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:54,720
it takes some agency it's not kind of just trusting that we're innately good

135
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:01,599
or everything is is wonderful about ourselves which some people are so eager to feel because there's maybe such

136
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:07,119
a low negative self image that's a bomb it's a kind of medicine to

137
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:14,560
hear that you're worthy and wonderful but the way to give substance to it is through

138
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:22,960
agency and the buddha gave a number of things one was through living ethically

139
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:29,040
that the more we can live ethically the more self-respect there can be

140
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:35,599
so we we kind of create the conditions to have self-respect and in that regard

141
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:41,200
one way to develop self-respect is not that we are automatically ethical

142
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:48,240
but rather where we have a commitment some people would say a vow to live as ethically as we can

143
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:55,680
and to learn from our ethical mistakes to try to do better in the future that kind of attitude i think is

144
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:01,119
warrants more self-respect and so the idea of making a commitment

145
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:06,720
making a vow is um is a very i think a powerful thing

146
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:13,520
to do the other thing that can uh for making ourselves a refuge or self-respect

147
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:20,480
is to develop mindfulness to have the self-awareness enough self-awareness to see how we

148
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:26,079
undermine ourselves how we criticize ourselves how we doubt ourselves

149
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:31,119
and then um and then not not believe it so much

150
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:36,160
be able to see it clearly enough and fully enough that we begin trusting the

151
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:42,480
seeing the knowing the perception uh well there it is again that habit of

152
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:48,800
mind to be self negating but i see it

153
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,319
and the word respect as you know many of you know um

154
00:41:54,319 --> 00:42:00,480
comes from the word to see again the latin word respect

155
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:06,079
and so to this idea of mindfulness really being able to see

156
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:13,040
and see with care see with kindness see with a certain kind of openness

157
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:18,240
so that there's this we're not caught in the negative self-talk

158
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:23,280
and begin having respect that we can do this we can meet our negative negativity

159
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:29,839
with kindness with care with openness that's respect worthy

160
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:34,480
so to um

161
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,800
and then the last one i think the last one i want to read here

162
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:49,680
is um fascinating poem by the buddha verse

163
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:58,160
a person should not give oneself away should not give oneself up

164
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:04,400
beautiful speech should be released malevolent speech should not

165
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:10,880
um so this so this idea of one should not give

166
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:16,960
oneself away to have self-respect we never give ourselves away

167
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:23,760
though we might do that dual action where there's self-respect and we get out of the way

168
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,440
to supp we get rid of our we let go of our conceit we kind of

169
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:35,520
respect powerfully with agency put aside our own preferences sometimes

170
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:40,800
for the benefit of others but we're not giving ourselves away we're not giving

171
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:46,480
up on anything we're not giving up on ourselves so uh

172
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,599
so the theme for this week is oneself and

173
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:57,599
the topic for today is respect to self-respect and

174
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:04,640
i suspect that not many of you have thought about this in relationship to yourself some of you probably have

175
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:10,880
and maybe for today you can reflect on this idea of self-respect what does it mean for you

176
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:17,920
maybe talk to friends and family about you know what it might mean and how it this idea of self-respect can be

177
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:23,359
beneficial for you and and maybe significant maybe even powerful for you

178
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:28,400
to live with greater risk self-respect to um

179
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:33,920
to find how to have self-respect to tap into self-respect

180
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:39,040
and so reflect on this topic and uh look at it and live with it for the day and

181
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:45,359
then tomorrow we'll go on on in other aspects of focusing on oneself

182
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:49,480
so thank you
