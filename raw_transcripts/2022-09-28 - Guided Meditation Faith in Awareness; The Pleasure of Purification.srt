1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:11,000
okay welcome uh welcome folks um yeah welcome to you

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,799
all um so we'll uh we'll sit yeah and

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,119
um yeah and it occurred to me just to say in case it's not already clear that

4
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:30,759
some level I the way I approach these morning sessions is that already received some instruction on how to

5
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:37,040
meditate uh there's something you can do that you're familiar with in one way or

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:45,039
another and um these are explorations of of technique and so um yeah take

7
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:53,760
whatever uh whatever value there is in them uh and add that into uh what you

8
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:01,480
already know and do so uh so let's uh find our posture

9
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:08,280
and uh and see what's uh greeting

10
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,280
us today

11
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,600
it's both so familiar and so

12
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,840
fresh kind of dense web of assoc

13
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,200
iations of the Stillness and the

14
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,640
silence almost as if it cues our

15
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:35,840
body and of awakens the muscle memory of of steadiness and silence and

16
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:58,239
release but it's also so fresh

17
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:15,319
who knows what this moment will feel

18
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,400
like where the body and mind is

19
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:31,760
today where the next Insight lurks

20
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,720
Laten

21
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720
e

22
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,639
e

23
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,680
e e

24
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,319
no matter what phenomena the moment brings

25
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:24,319
there's some Dharma posture some

26
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:30,759
gesture of awareness gesture of the heart

27
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,880
that serves our long-term welfare and

28
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:50,160
happiness no matter what's

29
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:01,520
arising there is goodness that can be cultivated

30
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
and

31
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
e

32
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
e

33
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
e

34
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
e

35
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
e

36
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

37
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

38
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,279
e e

39
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:25,680
we we're so often looking for signs of our progress

40
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:33,680
signs we're doing it right signs the dark is quote

41
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:41,480
working and so we look for concentration we look for insight we

42
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,959
look for

43
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:53,720
tranquility but the mechanisms of healing and Awakening

44
00:12:53,720 --> 00:13:00,560
are not usually evident to us

45
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:11,720
then fold in ways we can't actually

46
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:32,160
see and so sometimes it's okay to lock stop stop

47
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:39,199
looking for signs that we're on the right track to

48
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:45,639
stop orienting towards some

49
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:52,160
trajectory we uh imagine is the right

50
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,240
one and we just settle back into a certain kind

51
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:10,399
of faith and

52
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:21,399
awareness trust that the Dharma is working its way

53
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:23,800
through

54
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,040
us and then our job description

55
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:38,680
as a practitioner becomes a lot

56
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
simpler

57
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

58
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

59
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

60
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

61
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

62
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

63
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

64
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

65
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

66
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

67
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,640
e e

68
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,760
so there's relief in learning that we don't have to

69
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,840
engineer the

70
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:47,240
moment that the seeds of

71
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,720
Awakening are already

72
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
here

73
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

74
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

75
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

76
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

77
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

78
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

79
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

80
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

81
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

82
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

83
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:31,159
e e

84
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:20,480
we listen very

85
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:30,000
carefully or the the thread of uh wisdom

86
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:43,799
compassion we tuned to that as best we

87
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,519
can and then

88
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,080
rest e

89
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,039
for for

90
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:58,159
so Dharma pleas um we

91
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:04,600
think that um the practice is about uh about the

92
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:13,120
Peaks yeah and and meditation teachers are no doubt partially to blame in so

93
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,679
far as we talk about somat and the enjoyment of

94
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:24,440
Stillness or talk about insight and those moments

95
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:31,279
when um chunks of suffering just cleave

96
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:36,600
off and we talk about love and the the

97
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:44,240
possibility that it might um radiate yeah radiate out in all

98
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:51,919
directions and so we get the sense that um

99
00:31:51,919 --> 00:32:00,360
the practice is about uh about the Peaks and that the the valleys are kind of

100
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:06,200
intrusions or sort of um pit stop before another

101
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:14,440
Peak but um the point of practice is not the Peaks the point is the ascent the

102
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:22,639
peak The Descent and the valley the point is all of that because at each

103
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:28,600
point along that ride we grow different capacity

104
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:36,399
and strengthen qualities of the heart that are relevant for our own process of

105
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:41,480
waking up and um

106
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:47,880
the The Descent and the valley is

107
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:54,200
they they have one of two tastes the

108
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:59,840
taste of suffering or the taste of

109
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:07,639
purification the taste of suffering or the taste of purification it's there aren't other options as far as I can

110
00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:16,360
tell yeah and um and so uh today's theme is uh the

111
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:23,200
pleasure of purification when I

112
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,720
um tried coffee as a kid um

113
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:34,399
I thought it was just like inconceivable that any member of my

114
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:40,960
species could prefer that to um

115
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:46,240
say red Gatorade

116
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:52,480
yeah but um as is said some tastes are

117
00:33:52,480 --> 00:34:00,760
acquired tastes yeah and um the pleasure of purific ation for sure is an acquired

118
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:07,760
taste but um we come to appreciate it and it becomes very

119
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:16,638
rich and um on this path uh we we do have to come

120
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:26,200
to to enjoy enjoy this taste to appreciate it to become a connoisseur of

121
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:31,960
the the whole wholesome unpleasant yeah the wholesome

122
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:38,560
unpleasant the forms of discomfort that um are onward leading

123
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:44,520
rather than the sign of injury and

124
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:51,679
um um practice can unknowingly recapitulate our resistance to anything

125
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:57,040
uncomfortable it it's it's so deeply conditioned you know everything in our

126
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:03,280
body kind of just says no even to small

127
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,320
discomforts and um and we have to uh

128
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:14,200
that's we're working with that conditioning you know uh that runs so

129
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:20,119
deep in us and much of the the path is

130
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:27,079
about breaking the links of suffering yeah the links of suffering

131
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:35,200
the way this came up last night in in the conversation like the way that acting

132
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:41,079
out are clinging partially delivers

133
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:46,280
yeah the way that acting out our clinging partial we say oh clinging is

134
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:54,880
suffering clinging is suffering I think Ain cha said to somebody like is it really do you really believe that yeah

135
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:01,440
pointing to the ways in which we have some fidelity to clinging and we have some Fidelity to

136
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:07,119
clinging because it and this is the tragic part it partially

137
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:13,720
delivers it's an it's an impoverished form of pleasure but it's a pleasure

138
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:19,240
nonetheless and to actually interrupt the Cascade of

139
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:27,040
dukka means that we have to move against the stream against the the cycles of of

140
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:36,359
reinfor en forcement that that acting out our clinging brings us

141
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:43,079
yeah and so um to move against against

142
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:51,720
the partial satisfactions of clinging brings with it a distinctive

143
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:58,640
flavor and it's a flavor of discomfort but it's a disc comfort that

144
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:04,440
has this kind of other other hint yeah

145
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:09,680
of um another taste the taste of relief

146
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:18,000
the taste of purification many many years ago I was

147
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:26,520
um getting physical therapy for an injury and um the uh the physical

148
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:35,000
therapist uh who I loved would cause a lot of pain and um sometimes it'd be

149
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:42,400
working like in a hamstring and um and I remember he say ah it's very ropey you

150
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,480
know and then uh kind of lean his weight

151
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:53,200
into the tightness yeah and uh that that

152
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:59,400
brought a um that was not we would say comfortable

153
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:06,079
that that is an acquired taste maybe but you can taste the release in it that

154
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:12,200
this is not the pain of injury this is the pain of uh

155
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:17,440
healing and this is um my

156
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:23,000
uh my teacher one of my teachers shinzen Yang

157
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:30,760
um uh says um the the taste of pure purification is very hard to describe

158
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:36,560
but in essence it is a kind of joy you may be in great pain but there is a deep

159
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:42,640
Joy because you feel the blockages being worked out each time you greet the pain

160
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:49,319
with equinity you can feel how the energy in the pain is wearing away the separation

161
00:38:49,319 --> 00:38:56,040
between you and your spiritual Source you sense that Holdings from the

162
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:01,240
past are being grounded up digested

163
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:08,599
metabolized by the peristaltic vibratory movements of

164
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:16,920
impermanence the grinding and digesting is both painful and liberating at the same

165
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:22,720
time this is the taste of purification

166
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:36,000
the options are often the taste of suffering the taste of

167
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:44,119
purification and uh in that taste of

168
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:52,400
purification you can feel something is being softened yeah like your heart is

169
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:58,680
being needed needed like dough

170
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:05,480
and we get out of the kind of conceptual

171
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:12,480
world of this this hurts I don't like this how do I fix this and instead we

172
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:20,960
surrender to the flow of an N of impermanence sense of um the the

173
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,000
movement of any given moment the movement of any given

174
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:33,960
moment and we just in a sense take take refuge you

175
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:40,599
take refuge and let

176
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:48,200
anicha wear down the forces of

177
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:56,119
clinging we keep noticing um the the bracing that which kind of you know the

178
00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:03,839
ways we kind of subtly brace you know and um we keep noticing that that that

179
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:09,760
quarantines the pain in some ways we brace for reasons it quarantines the

180
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:17,960
pain it actually amplifies the distress and then maybe there is a kind

181
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:24,960
of surrender you know like okay

182
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:32,640
Sensations okay heartache you can have

183
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:41,440
me can have me I offer myself up to

184
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:47,800
you and in this we're we're

185
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:54,079
so kind of awake that it it's it's almost like we're we're

186
00:41:54,079 --> 00:42:02,480
feeling the exposure therapy that is purification working Moment by

187
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:09,319
moment it's you know it's like I think last time I I did last month did

188
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:15,160
something and sort of alluded to the ways that uh that Dharma is in part an

189
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:20,480
exposure therapy um and it's it's like the in

190
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:27,720
this purification we can like feel it we can feel it working Moment by moment

191
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:37,318
uh I'm habituating to the discomfort I'm I'm habituating to the wholesome un

192
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:44,720
unpleasant and that hurts it's an acquired taste for sure and you can

193
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:52,440
taste the freedom in it and there's um something that

194
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:59,440
um this kind of willingness breathes a very easy easy mind state in the wake of

195
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:06,800
purification it breeds a very easy mind State and so when you get up after a

196
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,559
kind of and have actively chosen the taste of

197
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:20,000
purification um the forces of clinging the cesas the forces of

198
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:29,119
suffering just seem very uncompelling very uncompelling hate

199
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:35,520
so obviously a form of self harm so

200
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:41,920
absurd not it's not like we have to Marshall our energy to put it

201
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:47,838
down the dead end of greed so

202
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:54,880
obvious and in the wake of purification you really don't need much stimulation

203
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:59,039
at all to feel very

204
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,559
fulfilled and

205
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:14,280
uh it's a whole other topic but um it feels to me like one of the the

206
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:21,760
byproducts in this cauldron of purification is also uh

207
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:27,880
love that um we've experienced suffering with such

208
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:35,800
um Exquisite Poise and uh such vivid

209
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:41,319
ways that um the The Human Condition itself

210
00:44:41,319 --> 00:44:48,400
becomes more poignant the predicament of our own life becomes more poignant not

211
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:55,640
frenzied but poignant there's pleasure it's a weird

212
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:05,000
pleasure but it's pleasure are nonetheless so I offer this for um for

213
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,440
consideration and uh please pick up what's useful leave the rest

214
