1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:07,359
hello everyone very nice to be here and hearing about the potluck next week I'm

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:13,080
looking forward to coming uh it's great to bring something but don't let that

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,160
keep you away if you don't have anything it's fine to come it's just uh just

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:25,840
wonderful to be here so um so you can hear okay everyone

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,960
okay so um

6
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:38,960
I thought I would describe to you a sequence that can be a reference point

7
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:45,760
for how to meet anything how to be in the middle of whatever is

8
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,360
happening and it can be used in meditation it can be used when

9
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,800
meditation is going to help you deal with the challenges of life it can be

10
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:04,040
used in stepping forward aom meditation into the world and to find your

11
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:10,159
way and sometimes it's nice to have a sequence a series of practices to do and

12
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:18,680
it makes a little bit easier to know what to do because this world is so complicated and um So It

13
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:27,479
Begins by the practice of not knowing uh and so in meditation it means

14
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:33,840
you begin by not coming with knowing who you are knowing what you're about

15
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,240
knowing the situation but preparing yourself to know and this idea that we

16
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:46,520
need of preparing ourself getting ready to know something so and that's just not

17
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:53,000
that's not only true in meditation but uh some people say Now with uh uh with

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,399
this not last election that we just had that maybe now is a time for preparation

19
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,880
for what's coming and so maybe that begins by not knowing not knowing what

20
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,920
to do what's supposed to happen what actually the situation is and there's

21
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:14,720
value in not knowing because often when we come to meditation come to challenges

22
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,760
in our life the knowing we come with sometimes is not so

23
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:28,319
helpful sometimes the knowing we come with comes with comes with judgments comes with old memories ideas of what's

24
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:34,239
going on and um and we're projecting onto the world projecting onto ourselves

25
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:41,800
uh a kind of knowing uh if you go meet meet meet someone maybe for the first time uh but

26
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:49,159
the clothes they're wearing reminds you of some kind of person that you think

27
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:54,640
is not the kind of person you want to hang out with and um and so you're

28
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,640
coming with a pre-existing knowing that you project onto that person based on their

29
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:07,440
close and but instead to do this process is that you would begin by not

30
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:14,319
knowing who is this person let me not carry with me my old associations let me

31
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:20,840
find a way to clear my my eyesight clear my hearing to find out who who is this

32
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:27,040
what is this let me not know let's not begin by no by knowing let me Begin by

33
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,879
not knowing and uh and not knowing that can

34
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,159
meditation can involve relaxing uh I wouldn't

35
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,840
underestimate uh the tremendous value of relaxation of calming of

36
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,280
settling because when we're not relaxed when we're not calm or settled there is

37
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:57,560
an agitation or a tension that is squeezing or pushing some of the

38
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,920
projections some of the prej es some of the preconceived ideas that we bring

39
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,159
with us it's kind of like U you know if you squeeze a

40
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,599
toothpaste uh you know tube when the when the cap is off it's just going to

41
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:19,239
keep coming out and so if you're a tense something's going to keep coming out

42
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:25,919
pushing and kind of a compulsion sometimes to think certain ways or be certain ways feel certain things and

43
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:32,600
there's something about relaxing softening gentling settling

44
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:38,560
calming that stops that kind of pushing of our ideas pushing of our prejudice

45
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:47,240
and preconceived ideas and our projections of what's going to happen so that we can come into a deep State a

46
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:54,360
healthy state of not projecting not assuming not re

47
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:01,000
associating not coming with prejudice preoccupations but showing up

48
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,960
fresh new with new eyes and I call that the the practice of not

49
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:15,240
knowing so we prepare ourselves and if it's in meditation I don't know how long you have to prepare yourself to meditate

50
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:22,479
to the next steps that's up to you but maybe it's a few minutes maybe it's longer if you could do a day long like

51
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:30,680
some of us did yesterday maybe it's the first two meditation sessions that that has this flavor to it

52
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:36,520
if it has to do with uh International world affairs and uh you you're the one

53
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:42,400
who's supposed to solve them that preparation might be much

54
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,440
longer to really get really kind of clear your mind clear your heart to be

55
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,160
ready to really do the next step and the next step is to

56
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:58,479
discover now this is the place where you get to know but now you're you're here

57
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,759
to discover what what's right here discover something new discover without

58
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:09,240
the lenses of prejudice or preconceived ideas that we tend to bring pre

59
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:17,080
prejudged ideas and uh and so now look carefully what is here what's happening

60
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,759
so in meditation how are you right now what's actually going on here and now

61
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:29,039
it's not an easy thing to stop and do because for some of us the mind is keeps

62
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:36,560
spinning it's thinking about things thinking about our issues thinking about the future fantasizing doing something

63
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:43,000
that stands in the way of really checking in with ourselves and in meditation one of the I

64
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,039
think very profound aspects of meditation is a chance to meet

65
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:54,919
yourself to really meet yourself in a deep intimate close way to discover

66
00:06:54,919 --> 00:07:00,560
what's here and not only to meet yourself and do that discovery

67
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,479
but uh to find a way to meet yourself that comes out of this not

68
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:15,000
knowing but is respectful is kind is caring for this person just like we hope

69
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,120
it would be that way in meeting someone else that we meet someone we we are there to be present to respect to be

70
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:29,639
kind to to get to know them well yesterday I talked about um

71
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:36,120
my experiences in life with meeting people uh uh sometimes with

72
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,680
handshakes and um I once met a a candidate for

73
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:48,080
president many years ago and um and uh I think I was behind a little fence or

74
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:54,080
something and the candidate was walking down and shaking hands and and um so I I

75
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:00,960
oh good I get to shake this person's hand and as soon as the person's hand touched my

76
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,520
the person the candidate was already looking over to the next person and and

77
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:13,199
there was this limp limp hand like oh what was that like you know it was like

78
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,280
there was no contact there was no seeing being seen being recognized it was like

79
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:25,240
I was just almost like an instrument or something to just I don't know what to pass by and move on to the next person

80
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,520
who was more important or something so um so this you know there

81
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:38,360
could be that kind of meeting uh there is then the meeting of um of someone really stopping and

82
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,880
shaking your hand in a nice way and you feel like they're really there for you and they're stopping and they're curious

83
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:50,160
they're interested in you uh you're important for them the equivalent for this when I was

84
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:56,120
in the Zen Monastery was that uh in the M Monastery there's a tremendous amount

85
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:02,120
of bowing going on and once I counted how many times I bowed from the from the

86
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:10,120
time I woke up in the morning I think which was 4:00 in the morning until maybe 10 so and I think I got close to a

87
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:17,959
100 bows and uh but uh what happens in the monastery is that every

88
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:23,279
bow carries a little bit of significance like you're supposed to bow to people

89
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:30,240
when they pass they when you all kinds of times you're supp to Bow people like if you pass them in the pathway you're supposed to bow to people if they serve

90
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:37,560
you meals which they often were doing theyd serve you their food you'd bow before and bow after and um and so much

91
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,800
was communicated by how you bowed you know like if if you kind of

92
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,079
didn't like them or kind of angry with them you know like you you know you you're kind of like a

93
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:53,200
little just a little little kind of you know just you know maybe you bow an

94
00:09:53,200 --> 00:10:00,079
inch and and your hands wouldn't really come together but you were about

95
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:05,120
right uh or sometimes you know You' bow really deeply or sometimes when you the

96
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:11,000
idea when you saw them coming down the path and you knew you had to P you bow and you pass them uh you just went the

97
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,200
wrong way around so there was a lot of things that

98
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:23,760
got conveyed through these bows so was part of the richness of the monastery was to study and see all these things

99
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,800
that uh were were involved with bowing that highlighted who we are what was

100
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,880
going on in the the moment so how do you meet yourself how do you bow to yourself

101
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:41,399
the meeting is really important so first not knowing and then meeting yourself discovering meeting and discovering

102
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:48,760
being the same thing here really discover what's here and the layers of what's here and I'm surprised sometimes

103
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:54,760
that uh like you know after the election for me there was layers of emotions and

104
00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:00,880
I had maybe the first recognition that I I felt dismay or something something and

105
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,079
um and that was strong enough uh and I was just operating like kind of doing my

106
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:11,160
life I I busy doing things and and just kind of carrying this feeling that I

107
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:19,040
just kind thought was dismay and um but then when I sat to meditate then I saw oh there's layers

108
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:25,079
here there's fear there's uh there's for me a little

109
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:32,720
different than fear is alarm there is anger there is all kinds of things and

110
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:39,600
and as I went through them all it was kind of oh oh I was kind of delighted as

111
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,639
opposed to caught in the grip of them because that's what happens when you

112
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:51,480
start with not knowing if you start with knowing then you fold what you discover

113
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:58,240
into that preconceived ideas preconceived attitudes preconceived judgments and it's a lot diffic more

114
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:06,320
difficult the the advantage of not knowing and you know and you feel yourself what's going on oh look at that

115
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:12,839
there's fear who would have guessed and and uh and you're but the

116
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:20,240
how you meet is so important so oh there's fear this needs attention this needs

117
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:26,959
care this needs kindness so H so so there's a process of

118
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:34,199
discovery discovery of what's Happening with your thinking what you're thinking about more deeply than that maybe what

119
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:39,279
you're feeling what the emotions are more deeply that sometimes is deep under

120
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:45,240
underground kind of attitudes with which we carry ourselves into the world and so

121
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:51,320
as we relax and calm we start going through the layers and start meeting

122
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:58,120
more and more parts of who we are and in different days we meet different parts of ourselves as different days there's

123
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:03,920
different things to meet here and uh and so two people coming

124
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:11,160
meditating at the same time might have radically different experiences of meditation uh because they're coming

125
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:17,800
from different events in their life or different things that they're concerned with and they're meeting different

126
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:23,680
things and because of that meditation uh mindfulness serves a different function

127
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:30,480
for them because of what their need is given what's happening so so that comes to the third

128
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:37,600
so not knowing Discovery and then the third one is the

129
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,600
gift the gift what's the gift

130
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,519
here and then that's an odd odd thing to do to ask what's the gift here and part

131
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:56,519
of the gift can be what's the gift you have to offer how do you like if you're sitting

132
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:01,560
in meditation what's the generous thing to do here to

133
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:07,480
yourself maybe this is a time when you do loving kindness that's the gift maybe

134
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:14,839
this is the time that you um uh really now say okay now is the time to be my

135
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:21,800
own companion I'm going to companion my anger I'm going to companion my fear

136
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:27,480
just like a good friend might you might take a walk in the park with them and they they're mostly just there to

137
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:33,040
accompany through your grief and it's just so good to have someone there accompanying you who's not going

138
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,079
to fix you and not going to judge you and not going to say aren't you over by

139
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:43,519
now we've been talking about your grief for five minutes you know it's enough already we

140
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:50,199
have to talk about you know the warrior scores you know that that doesn't work

141
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:55,959
you know you really just accompany you know your friend so you accompany yourself that's a gift that we can do

142
00:14:55,959 --> 00:15:03,199
for ourselves and we don't know how long that's needed until we go through it at some point you

143
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:09,639
feel oh yes something releases something lets go something

144
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:15,120
opens maybe the gift is

145
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:21,480
freedom and uh and this is kind of the calling card of the Dharma freedom and

146
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:27,880
so what's the gift of Freedom here and it might be that you give your

147
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:36,160
fear freedom you give your anger Freedom you give Your Love Freedom you give

148
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:42,120
your your patience Freedom you you give freedom to what's

149
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:47,360
here maybe even you give freedom to your thoughts maybe that's what's needed is

150
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:55,000
not resist your thinking not try to change it not to judge it and be horrified by it or whatever but and and

151
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,720
maybe also what's not needed is to keep fueling it

152
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:07,800
participating in it but there's a whole other way of giving freedom to your thinking mind will you get out of the

153
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:14,319
way and so the compulsive fitivity the pushing of the toothpaste tube is

154
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:20,680
stopped you give freedom to your tube to just be a tube without you you know squeezing the life out of

155
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:26,920
it and so this freedom and I love the idea that uh the

156
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:34,880
word emotion comes from the word has the word Motion in it the e is a Latin prefix that means

157
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:42,600
out so moving out all emotions are moving out or all emotions should be in

158
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:49,440
motion but we get stuck we resist we hold on we get tight we get somehow

159
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:56,000
afraid we get alarmed a lot of things that kind of keeps the the gears inside

160
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,800
from moving and so the idea is how do we give freedom to our emotional

161
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,319
life uh liberate your grief liberate your

162
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:13,880
anger not to get rid of it but rather to let it flow

163
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:20,760
freely because in in a certain circumstances where you're not participating in the grief not

164
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:26,720
participating in the anger uh but you're giving it Freedom it

165
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:33,440
has a chance to evolve and Flow and heal and do what it needs to do it has a

166
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,880
chance to Pro to give you the message that it wants you to

167
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,080
hear and so let let it free and one of the I think one of the greatest places

168
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,559
in the world least for me there's two great places for me for really giving

169
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:55,720
freedom to my emotional life is in meditation where I know I'm not going to

170
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:04,400
punch someone out it's safe so I can feel my anger just let it flow and move through me and

171
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:11,559
then to discover something new about it to see what happens it might be that

172
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:17,679
there's a relaxing then with the anger or opening up for something and maybe underneath the anger it turns out

173
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:26,000
there's fear and so then oh that's interesting underneath the fear there might be love

174
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,400
even there might be a capacity for k care and kindness oh that's what's going

175
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,400
on at the root what a great thing to have done giving freedom to my anger led

176
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:47,600
me through these layers that I tapped into something deeper so the um giving

177
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,919
freedom and uh leaving things

178
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,640
alone and so what's the gift what's the gift we give

179
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:05,960
ourselves the gift of Freedom the gift of gift of kindness the gift of

180
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:11,200
understanding it's invaluable to discover deeply and well what's going on

181
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:17,679
so I said there are two ways I deal with you know strong emotions one is I love sitting like this in this posture and

182
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:24,760
the other is I love going for a Hikes go alone in the mountains and go for a long hikes and that also just lets it flow

183
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:30,679
and there's a different way that it flows when when I'm walking because when when I walk I let my mind think what it

184
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:36,559
wants to think in meditation I kind of stop

185
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:42,080
thinking and uh and it's valuable to let the mind just flow but because I'm

186
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:48,840
walking I don't get caught in my thoughts they stay you know I kind of constantly kind of not letting go of

187
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:56,159
them but kind of staying staying limber loose kind of staying unattached to them and they just kind of flow and flow and

188
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:03,960
that helps this process also because thinking and emotions have a wonderful Synergy and so there's something

189
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:09,080
important about how they work together to see deeply what's going

190
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:17,480
on so the gift and just asking yourself that question what's the gift here and I

191
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:25,240
say that uh with with the intentional idea that there's two kinds of

192
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:30,360
gifts what's the gift you want to give to you're the one meeting yourself or

193
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:36,360
meeting the world and what's the gift of this situation to

194
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:43,600
you what is it to learn what is it to be what is it what is there to be changed

195
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:50,440
what is it to be transformed what is there to be received and so from yourself or from the

196
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:57,000
world and so sitting in meditation and uh and saying what's the

197
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:04,440
gift here what's the gift of fear have you ever asked yourself that or you just

198
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:11,039
you know Fe afraid and that's good enough no what's the gift of fear what's

199
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:17,520
the gift of anger what's the gift of love what's the gift of

200
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:25,159
respect what's the gift of compassion what's the gift of mindfulness what's the gift of presence

201
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:30,520
what comes out of it for you what what's the message what's the attitude what's

202
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:36,279
what's possible to it and one of the ideas of the gift is that

203
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:43,240
um you've made yourself ready for it the not knowing and then the knowing

204
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,960
the discovery the me really the meeting of the situation it kind of is getting

205
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:54,320
ready what is the gift so it can register so you can feel it and know it

206
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,400
in a deep way and um the gift of setting an

207
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:06,120
emotion free inside is that uh maybe now you have

208
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:11,320
confidence that you don't have to be caught in the grip of the emotion you've

209
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:20,120
learned that it's okay there's a possibility of having strong emotion but not be glued to it not be entangled with

210
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:27,880
it not be defined by it identified with it but just it's almost like wow there's

211
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:33,080
there's fresh share there's breathing room here by giving it freedom in the

212
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:38,320
context of mindfulness there's breathing room that's the gift who would have

213
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:44,640
known what's the gift and what's the gift that you that

214
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:51,080
you want to offer the situation so not

215
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:56,640
knowing Discovery and then uh what's the gift

216
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:03,679
and then this third step is to uh after the last step of this process is what do

217
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:09,440
you want to bring with you now what do you want to uh be different now having

218
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:16,240
done this process how do you want to be different how do you want to live differently how do you want to act

219
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:22,760
differently and uh what have you learned that that that has shown you something

220
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:29,799
that yes I want to be different in some way without a desire to be different

221
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:37,520
you might stay stuck simply the willingness and the openness to be different loosens

222
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:43,919
something loosens the the you know up the it like lubricates the gears so

223
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:49,520
something can move and change again if you don't want to

224
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:58,799
change well good luck I mean that in two ways

225
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:06,679
one is then you really won't change some of the ways you're stuck so easily and the other is yeah good luck

226
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:13,720
you'll change anyway we're always changing but if you're stuck in something you might

227
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:19,960
change for the worse if you're stuck in your anger and resentments and that's what you're

228
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:26,279
churning away in and you're not going to give it up and you continue feeding that and

229
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:34,200
living in that it just gets worse and wor worse something gets kind of debilitating or drained out of

230
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:40,919
us we're always changing and we could be involved in

231
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:49,200
having some Choice over what change we allow for ourselves what change we want to how we want to change by asking the

232
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:57,240
question having gone through this process now what what would I like out of this maybe that first step was so

233
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:04,480
impactful relaxing they say oh I want to be careful that I don't tense up I want to

234
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:13,360
be careful and to bring that more of this calming into my daily life maybe I'll set a timer for on the hour to

235
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:20,360
remind myself to pause for 10 seconds and relax maybe that's what that's what how

236
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:26,440
you want to change maybe the Second Step was impactful it was like eye opening to

237
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:33,120
stop and take a look and see what's going on and to learn and you say I think I need to do this more often I

238
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:41,120
think I need to kind of get to know my when I run into someone take the time to know them before

239
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:47,760
I say something silly or joke with them or say something I've told the story

240
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:53,080
many times of a friend of mine showed up and I I just was immediately kind of

241
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:59,399
silly and said something only to find out that I think his best friend had just died

242
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:06,360
and I was kind of so you know so so disappointed that I

243
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:12,240
had acted that way not not taking time to know my friend and find out where who the person what was going on before I

244
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,880
kind of barreled ahead and and so maybe that's the gift that

245
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:25,120
you how you want to change is to get to take time to get to know people situations before you prejudge

246
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:30,760
them or maybe it's a the gift of kindness or the gift of giving other

247
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:36,480
people Freedom or the gift of caring for people's welfare and and uh living

248
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:42,840
living in a good way in Buddhist Meditation that's often one of the gifts

249
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:49,240
that is regularly reflected on at the end of any significant Dharma event it

250
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:55,000
could be your own meditation it could be some Dharma ceremony D and we do at the

251
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,159
end of every Retreat is uh it's called we call it at

252
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:05,440
IRC we call it dedication of benefit traditionally it's called dedication of

253
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:11,399
Merit and that is to um consider how the

254
00:27:11,399 --> 00:27:16,880
benefits of this event can be used to benefit the

255
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:23,360
world and um and so at the end of every meditation I spend a little bit of time

256
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:29,799
now I've meditated that's nice now is there any way from this that I could

257
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:36,159
now uh benefit others can I make this world a better place and if you get a

258
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:42,360
big no because you're overwhelmed and exhausted um then maybe it's simply I

259
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:49,200
just I'm just going to sympathize with other people who are exhausted I can at least do that Comm

260
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,919
commiserate with them maybe that's nice for them to know that they're recognized and

261
00:27:54,919 --> 00:28:00,240
understood but what is it that how is it that coming out of meditation that you

262
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,279
can be different that you can change and and in the Buddhist tradition

263
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:14,360
this idea of living for the benefit of others um is done for your own

264
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:20,080
benefit partly because to not there's something

265
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:26,760
about not living for the benefit of others that actually limits us it's kind

266
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:32,880
of a being closed down or being shut down or the heart's not really open

267
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,519
something is is you know is being clouded

268
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:44,919
over and the idea is to step forward in the world with no

269
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:52,840
limitation and if we're Unlimited in our freedom I it's I think it's a natural

270
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:59,240
thing to Delight in people to love people to care for people to want this

271
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:05,159
world to be a better place if we go if we don't do this

272
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:10,559
process and we're caught in fear caught in

273
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:17,480
Anger then there's a danger that what we spread into the world is more fear more

274
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:24,600
anger I'm struck very much struck that uh um moved uh feel like it's a profound

275
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:29,880
thing that uh if a parent lives

276
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:37,519
afraid as they raise a young child the child learns the world is a frightening

277
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:43,240
place is and is that the best way to raise a child to have that

278
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:49,159
anxiety so a parent I I hope really takes this idea

279
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:57,440
seriously in order to want to change to not be spreading more fear

280
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:03,000
into the world world but to do so it with sincerity and honesty and

281
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,080
authenticity maybe doing this process start with not knowing relaxing

282
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:17,399
and calming so there can be a deeper and deeper discovery of what fear is and where it comes from and how to relate to

283
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:23,120
it so that maybe there's a discovery of how to the gift would be to give that

284
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,559
give that fear Freedom or as I like to often say

285
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:37,360
a a big huge task with chronic fear is to give the fear help the fear feel

286
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:43,720
safe help the fear feel safe that's what it most wants a young child who's afraid

287
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:49,000
mostly wants to be held so this is safe now you're here it's okay now you're

288
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:55,880
safe with me let me give you a cookie you know and they just feel like they're protected a little bit our fear

289
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:03,000
is that way also so the gift would be help that fear feel safe inside of us

290
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:10,080
safe from what most likely it's from you because of how we relate to

291
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,919
it and um so how do you want to change so the

292
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:21,480
world is a better place and one of the ways to really make

293
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:28,440
the world a better place is to do this process over and over again to meditate

294
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:35,039
meditate to practice to clarify to open up discover the gifts of what it is to

295
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:40,080
be a human being and bring those gifts into the

296
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:46,279
world and um and that's so as I said in the beginning so that's true in

297
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:53,760
meditation and it's true for not only international events of cos Cosmic

298
00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:01,720
events in this Cosmos we live in uh that we can do this process of not

299
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:08,279
knowing which is also a preparation to be ready to do

300
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:17,000
something then Discovery meeting ourselves asking the question what's the

301
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:23,240
gift and the get what's the gift to offer what's the gift to

302
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:30,039
receive and then how to how to go from here in a different way to benefit the

303
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:35,880
world benefiting yourself how do you want to change how do you want to be

304
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:42,240
different and then go forth into the world and you'll probably forget about

305
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:48,639
it very quickly so we do it again and it again

306
00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:54,159
and so in meditation you can do this four parts process you could do this

307
00:32:54,159 --> 00:33:00,159
four part process uh talking with a friend let's go through this four part

308
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:05,320
process let's not know here first then let's discover let's just

309
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:12,279
talk together what's the gift here and how do we want to change we could do it slowly we can

310
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:20,240
Journal about it we can spend days on each step if it's a really big thing in our life that we don't know

311
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:28,799
about so so if this interests you and seems like a nice four-step process

312
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:35,000
I think it's a wonderful kind of um thing to to live by and a

313
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:44,519
wonderful way of um orienting yourself in this life and um and uh it's kind of a

314
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:50,360
reframing of the basic Buddhist practice of mindfulness which is a profound

315
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:59,559
process and this is one way of understanding this process not knowing discovery the

316
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:05,480
gift and then living differently going

317
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:12,358
forth so we have a few minutes and um any comments

318
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:19,158
questions clarifications anything anybody like to

319
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:41,040
I appreciate it that you talked about the emotions and kind of welcoming them

320
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:47,480
and letting letting yourself feel them because for me I've had to feel a lot of

321
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:53,118
emotions that I'm very uncomfortable with but I feel like that's that is part

322
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:58,400
of the job right now it's part of what's in front of me so thank you

323
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:05,520
yeah yeah emotions are a huge part of being human being so learning how to be wise about them and familiar with them

324
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:11,720
and and uh is part of the task we're not supposed to reject them but you know

325
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:17,119
what's the gift being in being

326
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,599
emotional it's odd how the word emotional kind of has negative

327
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:31,320
connotations I think that person is too emotional but what else are we supposed to

328
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:39,079
do yes good morning thank you for very timely talk this was very important

329
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:46,240
because I went through all the Dynamics that you described in terms of emotional reaction to the to the election that

330
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:52,920
happened um but I wanted to ask I this morning I I've been very fearful of what

331
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:58,920
is might be happening in in uh Ukraine um with the current

332
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:06,800
Administration and the all bad things that are happening in a theer of war and so forth and I read an article in New

333
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:14,160
York Times that I essentially the shed a different uh light on the

334
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:20,440
situation what it what the author said of this in this piece was that um this

335
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:25,800
war that's going on over there is costing a lot of life and uh is really

336
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:31,760
not solving anything and the perpetrator of the war are not just Russia and

337
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,960
Ukraine but also United States that in in a process of

338
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,760
providing uh just enough ammunition and help and support and financial and so

339
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:50,119
forth is are we are trying to diminish Russia we are trying to make Russia

340
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:56,160
smaller in the process without helping Ukraine win the war so the very fact

341
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:02,920
that this person administ rtion is planning to potentially this is a part of not

342
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:09,560
knowing is potentially might be aiming to to really bring this war to a

343
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:16,280
conclusion but not in in the terms that we have favored in terms of Ukraine winning and getting their territories

344
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:21,800
back and all that but in but lots of compromise that will make Ukraine much

345
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:29,280
much smaller potentially but at least stops the um the Bloodshed and all these

346
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,440
horrible things are going on in the upcoming winter and all the grids are

347
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:40,640
essentially coming down and so forth so I just that gave me a different thought

348
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:46,960
maybe I was wrong in really having a a Prejudice or pre preconceived notion

349
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:52,079
that there's there's only one desirable outcome and maybe there's a different

350
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:57,640
different desirable outcome that is completely different from what I've taught yeah so so to so to then to to

351
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:03,440
tie it into what I said you had a preconceived idea about this situation

352
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:10,720
it's one of the one of these International challenges that we live with and then uh something inside of you

353
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:17,160
off something offered a different perspective on it that was a surprise for you and now you're reoriented around

354
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:23,280
this and wondering if there's a different attitude different way of responding and um and U that's a

355
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:32,400
wonderful process to be involved in questioning and looking and wondering and looking for new ways and um and uh

356
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:40,880
the the art of it all especially in a room like this and meditating and all that is to offer these words without

357
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:48,280
trying to offer the truth without saying this is now this is not the new truth but rather this is uh part of this

358
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:55,400
discovery process that we're all in and you've now contributed a little piece to it and um and and you also contributed

359
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:02,280
to the this wonderful fact that it freed you up it kind of loosen something for you and and which allows you to go

360
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:07,319
through this process in even better way because now you can relax even more and

361
00:39:07,319 --> 00:39:15,520
discover even more what's going on and see so thank you so out in the outer

362
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,079
hole it's

363
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:30,880
coming push the button and help it like a

364
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:38,200
lockar um thank you Gil this was really so wonderfully timely um one of the

365
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:44,280
things I've been to manage the whole anxiety and

366
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:50,800
stress and of what happened in the election for me is horrifying is I've been telling myself

367
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:57,720
it's going to get worse before it gets better and I wanted to get your thoughts about that because to me as reflecting

368
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:04,119
on what you talked about that it's not that in a way it's not knowing but it's all way also kind of saying it is

369
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:11,240
knowing right well I'm I'm I'm reconciling that it may get worse and before it gets better um and I just

370
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:19,000
wondered what you thought about that is that really being unknowing or is it

371
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:25,359
not well I I don't know probably I'm not going to ask the question uh directly the way you know in terms of how you ask

372
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:32,520
the question uh it just seems to me that uh for a lot of us who are not in the

373
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:40,520
middle of the political world where there's a lot more information going on that um it's

374
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:46,720
it's we're partly in this phase of not knowing and getting and and Discovery

375
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:53,520
and it's a matter of really discovering and so if you have this idea that things will get worse before they get

376
00:40:53,520 --> 00:41:00,720
better that's a very big generalization and uh it might be that some things get

377
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:06,520
worse and some things get better uh and uh and so it's important

378
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:13,960
maybe to make that distinction if we generalize about the state of everything as one single thing then we come to one

379
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:19,359
conclusion but if we have the ability to tease apart where there's benefits where

380
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:25,000
there's harm being done maybe it's possible to support the benefits how

381
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:31,520
things are going to get better uh and and somehow then contend then then we're in better position to contend about how

382
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:38,640
things get worse and chances are no matter who is going to win the election it would have been that way

383
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,839
think some things will get better some things will get worse and so so so you

384
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:49,440
want to be very careful that these ideas don't limit our ability to

385
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:55,640
discover and uh it's reasonable that you have that idea but my my words of

386
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:02,800
caution is be careful with it as a the generalization U um relax don't know and

387
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:08,200
then discover what actually is there is that okay that I answered like

388
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:16,000
that yes it is and what's what's also occurring to you is when when I came out

389
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:23,520
what I've been pondering is this question of factchecking and that there's been so

390
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:30,200
much delusion in the media and so that's for me an action that I'm taking is

391
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:37,040
whenever I see something I really go deep on not a lot of issues but a particularly like let's say one or two

392
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:42,920
where I really really really look at the source yeah and and for me that's um a

393
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:49,319
little bit of not knowing like keeping it in mind that I don't know you know yeah I'm being it's it's being said that

394
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:58,200
this is the truth but there's a lot of there's a lot of um of intention that

395
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:03,880
isn't really about the truth in those messages that I then I'm so I'm that's

396
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:09,280
one of the like what to do next is that's what for me I'm doing on and I'm

397
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:15,319
finding that very helpful very nice I love that factchecking and um and there's a couple

398
00:43:15,319 --> 00:43:21,880
of things a few things that I'd recommend around the news is um when I was in the Zen

399
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:29,480
Monastery in the 1980s they had something back then some of you probably don't know about it's kind of there were

400
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:36,599
big pieces of paper and there was lots of what's called print on them and they

401
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:43,119
F they'd fold them sometimes at first in half and then in quarters and sometimes they roll them put rubber bands around

402
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:49,680
them and um and uh and I was talk to someone recently who grew up in Palo

403
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:55,559
Alto and he said all his friends and everyone uh took those and they would

404
00:43:55,559 --> 00:44:00,960
put the rubber bands around them and around in the morning sometimes at 4:00 in the morning and deliver them to

405
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:07,000
people's driveways there was a whole Army of of teenagers who did that so um

406
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:14,920
so when I was in the monastery these things with big pieces of paper would show up and uh the the newspapers and um

407
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:21,119
but they always c not usually they came a few days late because we were deep in the mountains and there wasn't daily

408
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:29,760
traffic back and forth and and I discovered how different it was to read the news fresh news on the day versus

409
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:37,200
few days old that there was something that grabbed me when it was like the first day the paper the current paper it

410
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:44,200
was like was I'd be more alarm more attached more involved more like something but if I read the same thing

411
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:49,680
and I knew was old news I could do it in an even ma matter of fact kind of more

412
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:55,200
Curious way and it's gotten worse now because we we don't use the paper thing

413
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:02,160
anymore so now we're now now it's like minute to minute we're keeping up and so then it's really alarming really get

414
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:07,839
caught in it so there are ways of changing how we do the news one is to

415
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:16,280
actually wait and read it on Wikipedia we and uh it's not

416
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:21,920
necessarily accurate but it doesn't come with a kind

417
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:29,000
of language that is designed with headlines and first sentences to to to

418
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:35,319
excite you and pull you in uh there's not that click baiting going on and so

419
00:45:35,319 --> 00:45:41,960
it's you can kind of read it in a different kind of way the other is there is some news services that will present

420
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:47,640
both sides of of a you know political side of things and one I forget the name

421
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:53,040
has uh both sides and then who they think is the cists news so you can kind

422
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:59,480
of study the same piece of news and how it's being presented different ways another one that's more recent is called

423
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:06,000
tangle t n GLE e which is also trying to offer serious news from both sides of

424
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:13,119
the of the partisan divide and so you get both and you get it engaged in an intelligent way and and uh so then then

425
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:18,599
it's easier I think to start being more uh care careful about what you take in

426
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:25,240
and how you respond to it so thank you all for being here and

427
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:34,000
being part of this and may you live a life of gifts
