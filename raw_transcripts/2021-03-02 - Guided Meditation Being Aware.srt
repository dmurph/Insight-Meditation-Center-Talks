1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:10,400
so good morning and welcome to

2
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:17,039
the first meditation session of the retreat that some of you are doing and for those

3
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,560
of you on youtube good morning and good day and

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:31,840
welcome to this monday morning meditation

5
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:44,800
and for this morning's meditation i would

6
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,399
like to emphasize the word awareness

7
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:59,520
sometimes i like to think of the word awareness as a synonym or for mindfulness or

8
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,320
and i'll talk more about that but what's interesting about awareness

9
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:14,400
is we talk about being aware we don't talk about doing aware

10
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:22,640
someone doesn't say i'm a wearing they say i am aware

11
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:32,560
and i associate being aware or awareness

12
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:40,640
to something like hearing versus listening hearing

13
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:47,520
is something that we can just hear those of us who have the ability to hear we can hear

14
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:54,560
something without intending to hear it the sound arises in the ear maybe a loud

15
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,000
sound nearby and we hear it if we're curious about it

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,600
then we turn our attention to it and we listen to it and listening

17
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:16,640
being the active and the intentional quality of what we do with our capacity to hear

18
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:25,120
and um i am so so i am aware

19
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:32,720
is equivalent to the hearing we can be aware without intending to be

20
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:39,040
aware we can be aware without directing the

21
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,680
attention with our interest in our intentionality

22
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,360
and when we practice mindfulness we're bridging the world bridging these

23
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:00,560
two aspects the non-intentional and the intentional the directed and the non-directed

24
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:08,480
the doing and then not doing and the word awareness

25
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:19,200
gives a little bit more emphasis on the on just allowing awareness to operate

26
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,680
so rather than doing awareness we

27
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,879
are being aware

28
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:38,480
and as such awareness is closer to

29
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,640
a state of mind than it is to an activity of mind

30
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,159
in particular mental action

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,599
as important as mental actions can be

32
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:09,840
are just a subset of what awareness can be aware of

33
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,879
and so with this anapanasati mindfulness of breathing

34
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:20,079
as it develops as we settle in

35
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:27,440
we're getting closer to the state of awareness than we are to

36
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:36,000
moments of knowing moments of what sometimes is called mindfulness

37
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,840
so taking a meditation posture

38
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:50,400
and finding a posture

39
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:57,840
adjusting your body to a posture that is suitable for you

40
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:05,039
to be aware in a calm and relaxed way

41
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:16,560
for this purpose it's helpful if the posture is relatively comfortable relatively

42
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,840
relaxed

43
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,759
and then it's helpful to

44
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:50,000
settle into your body and one of the ways of doing that

45
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,560
is to take a few long slow deep breaths at the beginning of a sitting

46
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:09,280
and the deep inhales are maybe three quarters full three-quarters of a full in-breath

47
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:17,360
nothing that would tire you out or strain you but something that would allow you

48
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:24,560
to feel your body more fully breathing in and that

49
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,919
full breath not only feels your body

50
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,840
but a little bit energizes it in a good way

51
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:56,639
and then taking letting your breath return to normal

52
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,840
and feeling

53
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:11,440
your body letting your awareness your attention

54
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:18,400
roam around your body maybe in its own way

55
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,440
to the places where there are some tensions or holdings

56
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:34,639
and as you exhale relax soften the places of holding

57
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,680
perhaps it's a little bit in the muscles of the

58
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,080
belly softening the belly

59
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,840
maybe there's some softening around the front of the chest

60
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:13,840
softening in the shoulders

61
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:41,839
and softening in the face

62
00:08:52,880 --> 00:09:01,200
perhaps also there's a some possibility on the exhale to relax the thinking mind

63
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,959
maybe around where the brain is

64
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:22,240
or are there places in the body where thinking has its tentacles

65
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:28,720
and as you exhale to quiet the thinking mind

66
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,279
allow the thinking mind maybe to think slower

67
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,519
there's no hurry here in meditation

68
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,760
there's no requirement to think of anything else besides the meditation

69
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:02,880
and if you're thinking about what the meditation maybe you can do so quietly

70
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:09,279
calmly slowly

71
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,560
in ways that are clearly supportive of the meditation

72
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,320
so maybe the thinking is kind thoughts about

73
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,160
now turning the attention to the

74
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:38,160
breathing thoughts about experiencing

75
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:47,839
being present for how the body experiences breathing

76
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:31,440
simple thoughts of receiving the inhale

77
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:44,800
thoughts are being present for the inhale just as it begins

78
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:55,760
and letting there be a receptive quality where the the body's ability to be aware

79
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:11,839
to sense and to feel receives the inhale

80
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:19,120
maybe receives it as an upwelling feeling of energy of movement

81
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:25,839
of sensations

82
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:39,839
and then as you exhale to release with the exhale

83
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:49,680
there is a letting go in the exhale allow yourself to exhale

84
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,839
allowing the release

85
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,959
inhaling and receiving the inhale

86
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:49,519
in awareness

87
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,199
allowing the exhale

88
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:02,959
to release within awareness

89
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:08,639
so not so much focusing on the breathing

90
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:17,839
but more allowing breathing to focus itself in the middle of awareness

91
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,680
as if breathing

92
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:31,839
is received it's like the waves received by the beach

93
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:39,440
in which the beach then releases or allows to wash back

94
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,800
roll back back into the ocean

95
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:59,839
across the beach of awareness comes the waves of in inhaling and exhaling

96
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:43,519
and regardless now of what you're thinking about what you're thinking about is less

97
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,720
important than noticing the

98
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,720
it as activity of the mind

99
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,079
whatever the activity the actions the energy

100
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:11,040
energetics of the mind are see if you can let that relax

101
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:25,120
as the activities of the mind relax into a calmness of the mind

102
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,959
set a place of subtleness

103
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,839
a calm body a calm mind

104
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:26,798
and then we are always aware we're we're always conscious

105
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,880
there's always some degree of awareness going on

106
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:46,880
see if you can allow for a state of being aware or state of awareness that is more

107
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:54,960
naturally there it doesn't require a

108
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,840
doing but more an allowing to be aware

109
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:43,840
allowing awareness is close to being in a receptive state

110
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:57,840
receiving experiences as they occur in the present

111
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,559
and with breathing at the center of it all

112
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:18,480
a receptive awareness that also receives breathing

113
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,799
receives the experience of inhaling and

114
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,840
exhaling

115
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,799
breathing is a rhythm

116
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,240
that reminds us

117
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,720
to be receptive in the awareness

118
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:30,158
not to fixate on anything or get caught in thought

119
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,200
the rhythm of breathing received an awareness

120
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:46,840
in a sense a rhythm that keeps awareness open and

121
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,840
receptive

122
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:03,840
so we stay closer to a place of quiet receptivity

123
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:15,440
a state not dominated by thinking a state more characterized

124
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,919
by receptive awareness of what is

125
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,360
a state of awareness

126
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:38,640
that we repeatedly allow for repeatedly return to

127
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:45,840
resting in receptive awareness

128
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:40,000
there is a way of being aware where awaring is not doing

129
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:49,278
but more being more a state that we're in a state of awareness

130
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:59,519
and within that state we can register be aware of many

131
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:06,879
different things that occur but those things can occur

132
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:15,200
without intentionality from us without desire without

133
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,480
making something happen

134
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:31,519
and to relax allow for that form of the state of awareness

135
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,440
allow yourself to be aware

136
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,760
in that allowing allow the experience of breathing

137
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:53,840
to remind you to stay receptive

138
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:07,840
to be allowing of what is

139
00:40:53,440 --> 00:41:02,720
if we can recognize awareness as a state state of awareness

140
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,759
like a state of mind or state of being

141
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:15,838
that allows us to

142
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:27,119
be content in that state or to be to rest in that state

143
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:35,839
to allow ourselves to be receptive in that state of awareness

144
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:43,920
perhaps a state of awareness where we're not actively involved with what we know

145
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,599
we're not for things or against things

146
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:54,880
we're not trying to fix things or get away from anything

147
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:05,200
that there's a willingness to just be aware of whatever is happening

148
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,559
a state of awareness

149
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:17,838
that's receptive and open

150
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:03,680
and with a state of awareness resting in it content in it

151
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:13,839
you might bring to mind or include in that awareness now

152
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:18,880
some of the people that will be part of your life today

153
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:27,838
the community of people on the retreat or those are not on the retreat

154
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:34,240
in whatever communities you might be in today

155
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:42,799
whether personally or on some form of communication technology

156
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:54,720
and for a few moments to allow for a sensitivity of awareness

157
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,760
of those people

158
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:11,119
that's only possible if we rest in awareness allow them to exist in awareness

159
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:19,279
while we rest in the awareness or remain receptive in that awareness

160
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:28,640
where we can be we can be aware of people without doing anything or

161
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:34,160
needing to respond act just

162
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:37,839
aware

163
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:56,480
and that being staying close to this way of being receptively aware of others

164
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,079
just being aware of them

165
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:10,800
not paying attention to them but being aware simple awareness

166
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:18,640
that perhaps there in that awareness you can now tap into your good will

167
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:33,839
for others or your wish for their welfare your well-wishing of others

168
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:43,680
