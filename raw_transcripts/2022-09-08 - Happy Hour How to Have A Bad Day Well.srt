1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:08,960
so so so for the theme for tonight's teaching

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,559
um i wanted to talk about um something that

3
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:20,720
inspired me actually i was reading uh stephen levine's a year to live i love

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:27,359
the book and there was a there was a few lines that that really struck me and

5
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,398
i thought and they inspired me to dedicate tonight's practice

6
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:40,160
to this theme so so the theme for tonight is um how to have a bad day well

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,079
how to have a bad day well you get the joke right you get the point

8
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:53,360
right because now and then of course we're gonna have bad days days that are difficult days that

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,199
difficulty happens maybe we feel really really sick random example

10
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,478
or just challenges arise and how to have a bad day

11
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:10,720
well you know we can we can add insult to injury we can

12
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:18,479
blame ourselves we can resist we can really add second arrows to the first

13
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,240
arrow that's already there all these second arrows or we can have a bad day well

14
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,320
we can meet the challenge the difficulty the misfortune the

15
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:38,159
whatever it might be with with grace with compassion for ourselves for others

16
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,680
with ease instead of resisting and refusing seeing what is needed what is the

17
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,759
appropriate response right now is it kindness is it care is it rest

18
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:57,119
is it um [Music] wisdom what is it so what what um having

19
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,640
it a bad day well can really save us um

20
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,800
from a lot of misery a lot of dukkha a lot of pain in this

21
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,480
this life because guess what challenges having what we're calling a bad day or

22
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,800
difficult part of life it's not that you've made a mistake or you're to

23
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,959
blame or or um it's your fault it's it's part of

24
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:32,640
life to have challenges challenges are part of life

25
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,160
and how can we how can we what are the ways

26
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,239
that we can have a bad day well having a bad day with

27
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:51,519
grace with generosity with kindness so that is the theme

28
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:58,000
and i will share this paragraph here from um from stephen levine

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,200
uh page 126. if later you guys wanted to go check check it out

30
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:11,120
um it's actually the next paragraph

31
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,159
actually i want to say one more thing before i read the paragraph and that is also

32
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:25,840
acknowledging or realizing that the times when things are challenging that looking perhaps back at

33
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,640
how much how much wisdom how much kindness how much

34
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,120
um compassion you've already uncovered in your life and how much momentum you

35
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:46,159
already have because when there is a challenge it seems like it's all lost it's all oh you're back to

36
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:52,640
square one but actually turning back and realizing that there's so much momentum that you already have that is going to

37
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:59,840
support you that is going to support you so taking heart taking heart in that momentum

38
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:06,799
the forward momentum but that you have uncovered with kindness and compassion and wisdom

39
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,159
through your life so here's the paragraph i wanted to read um [Music]

40
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:20,079
so so yeah the more the more we practice how to have a bad day well

41
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:26,960
the better a day it will be and it continues when we stop protecting ourselves from

42
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:34,080
life each moment takes on a new significance

43
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:42,360
we come to treasure our being even more than our becoming

44
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,880
i want to read this again it's so beautiful so profound okay i'll start from the top when we

45
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,440
stop protecting ourselves from life

46
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,120
each moment takes on a new significance we come to treasure

47
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,960
our being more than our becoming

48
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,919
each moment of remembering is precious the eternal moment

49
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:20,639
in which there is no other eternal

50
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:28,160
moment in which there is no other

51
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:34,080
so i think that is plenty of sending the frame for tonight's practice and of course

52
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:41,039
we'll have a chance to to explore together in the guided meditation and in the groups

53
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:47,759
later and just to say i'm excited tonight for the groups because the prompt would be

54
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,840
how what are some of the wise and compassionate choices you make to have a

55
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:00,800
a bad day well how do you how do you try to have a bad

56
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,759
day well i think that the wisdom of the community wisdom of the small groups could be

57
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:14,160
quite quite interesting and juicy tonight so so i hope you hang hang around for that

58
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:21,840
all right so without further ado let's meditate together

59
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:34,360
so i'm gonna silence myself and take cough breaks throughout

60
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:42,800
so inviting ourselves inviting ourselves welcoming ourselves

61
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:51,120
to this moment this just is sitting here

62
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:02,599
this moment this body

63
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,160
allowing this body to land

64
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,840
to arrive

65
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:27,840
just as it is doesn't need to be any different

66
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,800
than it is right now

67
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,520

71
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:24,000
welcoming yourself this being who is you

72
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,840
simply being in this moment

73
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:38,880
without the need to become anything or anyone

74
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,928
without the need for becoming [Music]

75
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,680
just celebrating being in this moment

76
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,000
however it shows up

77
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,399
allowing the breath to move through this body

78
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:17,200

79
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,279

and turning the gaze inward

83
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:26,000
to notice to welcome [Music] the sensations of the feet

84
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,120

anything

145
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:28,240

rest feel nourished just be

147

and if needed if an extra dose of kindness is needed

149
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,919
given the kind of day or body what's been happening the arrows

150

slangs and arrows of life of life

151
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,840
it's okay to feel with every in-breath

152
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:39,440
that you're breathing in kindness breathing out kindness even if you don't

153
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:46,159
know what that means even if it seems abstract it's okay

154
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:53,360
breathing in kindness in this body breathing out kindness

155
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:00,320

160

166
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:08,399
these invitations you have choice feeling feeling embodied feeling

167
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:14,960
the breath in your body acknowledging that there is more call

168
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:21,760
there is more settledness even if it's a tiny bit more

169
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,158
compared to when you started to sit

170
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:34,829
acknowledging landing [Music]

171
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:43,360
in that spaciousness in that extra bit of calm

172
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,480
as if you're inhabiting it more fully owning it yes it's here

173
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,760
i see you [Music] i see you calm

174
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,880
settledness relaxing your body into it

175
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,840
and from a place of embodiment

176
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:12,559
if it feels okay bring something that was challenging today not the biggest

177
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:18,398
challenge perhaps it's a minor challenge

178
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:26,480
open your heart invited to this calm spacious

179
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:32,640
space of kindness just that moment that lived moment not

180
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:38,000
into your head not to think about it this is different you invite this moment

181
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:46,799
into your heart as if a hologram held in your heart with kindness

182
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:53,760
that moment of challenge maybe you beat yourself up or whatever

183
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:59,279
it was let your heart open and hold it with

184
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,279
kindness

185
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:16,480
as if you were able to use the momentum of your

186
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,480
practice

187
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,320
you relive this moment

188
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:35,360
support the karmic knot of that moment of challenge

189
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,760
ah yes i can be kind to myself

190
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,679
maybe you were kind to yourself already recognize you were having a difficult

191
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:57,000
time [Music] you were kind you were wise

192
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:05,760
and it's not too late it's not too late now

193
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:12,000
to bring kindness to bring generosity compassion to yourself

194
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:17,279
it's okay sweetheart it's okay that was hard

195
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:21,399
that was a challenging moment

196
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:38,159
and noticing how holding yourself with kindness

197
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,360
maybe something drops away maybe some weight drops away

198
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:52,158
or some recognition arises maybe that it's not needed that extra weight to carry around

199
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:57,840
it'd be just a split second of seeing

200
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,799
differently and letting go

201
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:26,480
letting go of the whole exercise returning to the body to the breath

202
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:32,000
just feeling nourished and breathed for another couple minutes

203
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:41,960
breathing in kindness breathing out kindness

204
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:15,040
may we all have the wisdom may we trust

205
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,679
in our inner wisdom and compassion

206
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:32,599
and rely on it more and more

207
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:41,679
so that we can have our bad days well

208
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:48,158
lift them well as a gift to ourselves

209
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:53,358
as a gift to others all beings everywhere

210
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:01,040
may all beings everywhere including ourselves be happy

211
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,680
may they be free

212
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:11,300
[Music]

213
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:25,359
thank you for your practice everyone

214
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:35,119
may we all learn to practice how to have a bad day well

215
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:40,480
so we have some time for reflections

216
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,838
for questions for reports from the field

217
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:52,560
you can type them in chat if you're typed to me privately i won't read your name

218
00:35:52,560 --> 00:36:00,079
you'll be private and if they're typed to everyone i will read both your name and reflection and

219
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:07,599
you can also raise your zoom hand if it's your physical hand i will not see you because there are many of us online

220
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:15,280
so any reports from the field what might have came come up for you

221
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:24,440
with this practice of just being just being not becoming

222
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:34,960
letting go of becoming or any insights came up as you

223
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:44,079
as you viewed the challenges of your day with more kindness with more compassion

224
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:49,920
sandy i see your hand please

225
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:58,240
i teach preschool kids and it strikes me how much all this applies to them

226
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:04,560
and pursuing this kind of thing i haven't been to your event before but

227
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,760
it's so helpful for me to be even better preschool teacher

228
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,359
to have deep empathy for them and then watching how

229
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:21,200
instead of oh you shouldn't feel that way you know it calms them down

230
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:27,599
so i think the deeper i go the better i can be with them

231
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:34,560
so thank you so much for all of you all that offer this yeah thank you sandy thank you so much

232
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:42,560
for showing up for coming to happy hour welcome and for for doing this practice both for

233
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:48,240
your own sake and clearly for the sake of those you teach and support all these

234
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:54,480
little ones what a beautiful inside of the calmer and the more stable

235
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:00,800
your heart becomes oh it's more available to empathize to hold with compassion

236
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:06,560
these little ones as they're forming these patterns for life

237
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:13,599
yes yes exactly pattern them for life really transformational

238
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:19,800
yeah thank you thank you thanks andy beautiful

239
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:26,520
other reflections questions aha moments challenges

240
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:48,480
wendy please so i'm pretty new this is my second

241
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:54,560
happy hour um thank you for for you being here and for everybody

242
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:01,599
being here so i had a really bad day and um just i mean the day was fine my feelings

243
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:08,960
were really bad and they're not any better now i mean and i think like having a bad day

244
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:15,520
well is coming to this rather than distracting myself with something else but

245
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:20,640
no buts i just i still wanna i just wanna cry yeah you know

246
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:26,960
and um so i guess to just trust that feelings pass they always pass

247
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,800
yes and i made a good choice

248
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:38,320
yes yes yay just as you said um

249
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,440
you know the the point of this practice meditation practice

250
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:49,119
in general not just meta and kindness isn't to make

251
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:54,560
things go away because sometimes we try to use it as a like make it go away make

252
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:01,119
it better make it and that's actually using the practice

253
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:07,839
in not in a skillful way because it will trip us up and it may not go away the challenges might still be there but our

254
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:13,920
relationships might be different it might the heart as you said right now is still heavy like

255
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:19,839
oh this has been a hard day and yet the wisdom of having the bad day well not

256
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:27,119
distracting yourself but coming to a place where you can sit in silence feel nourished have some stability

257
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:33,440
um have more kindness with the support of sangha that oh yeah they're in that there's a

258
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:39,520
little more space right there and you feel that space

259
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:45,599
i trust wendy yeah yeah i see your thumbs up yeah no i

260
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:51,760
do you yeah yeah and and trust and it's

261
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:59,119
it's both trusting that feelings emotions everything is transient everything is

262
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:04,960
impermanent everything of course everything is impermanent right we have this delusion of permits like it'll

263
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:11,359
never go away this will never change so that's part of that part of the

264
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:17,680
realization of sweetheart it will go away and yet it's

265
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:24,800
i think what i like to say is is learning to be okay with not being okay

266
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:30,800
that there's so much stability we can have there's so much spaciousness and trust

267
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:38,000
we can have really that sense of trust we can have that even if things are challenging

268
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,680
right now that we can be okay in the midst of not being okay there's there's

269
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:49,119
more to us and and that our vision sometimes when things are

270
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:54,800
challenging our vision gets very small that's all we see it's like oh this is just a challenge we come

271
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:00,880
right it's like like a little binocular that just

272
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:07,680
focused on the challenge whereas open open it up open it up there's so much more to you

273
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:13,440
there's so much more to your heart to your your being that this challenge is just

274
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:19,440
yes it's there but there's so much more here as well so these are a few suggestions for

275
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,480
holding the difficulty having a bad day well thank you

276
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:31,599
thanks wendy so dear ones let's turn

277
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:37,440
to our small groups the breakout rooms

278
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:44,560
break out group breakout rooms which i like to call them breakthrough rooms because so many breakthroughs

279
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:50,880
really happen in the breakout and for tonight as i mentioned there's a particular prompt

280
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:57,680
and the prompt is what is one way that today

281
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:02,880
you have been kind to yourself and maybe an example is oh i brought myself i had a

282
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:10,960
tough day i brought myself to happy hour this is the way i was kind this is the way i i had a bad day well just as wendy

283
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:18,400
was was sharing and modeling beautifully like one thing that you did oh i was feeling really cranky and i decided i

284
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:24,720
was tired i took a nap that was my kindness to myself or whatever it might be just a share of

285
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:31,200
sharing your uh one way that wisdom and kindness showed up

286
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:38,240
to to meet a difficulty in the day and if today there has been no difficulty for any of

287
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:44,800
yesterday this past week the past month and of course a new part of human life is to have challenges but just in case

288
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:51,119
so uh what what way what way do you meet do you meet and that way

289
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:57,280
it's so beautiful to let ourselves be held witness by others our own care our own wisdom

290
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:03,680
and both sharing and let ourselves be seen again we're sharing these not to educate or impress

291
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:10,560
anyone that's not the point the point is let ourselves be seen and witnessed by

292
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:16,560
others we're speaking for our own sake we're speaking for our own sake these amazing

293
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:23,599
other two human beings are just holding us witness so each person will share one nugget not

294
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:29,040
a long monologue but like one thing you've done today and then the next person will say one thing

295
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:34,400
then the next person will say one thing and then i'll come back to you you can add more at that point and the next

296
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,440
person the next person go around and around make sure everybody has plenty of

297
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:47,200
time and let's go in the order of first name alphabetical order just to

298
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:52,400
make it simple and be kind be kind to yourself be kind

299
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:58,000
to others really hold witness with uh kindness

300
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:04,480
and also not a good idea to share to to um

301
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:09,760
should i put it it's um be be judicious

302
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:15,440
with how you share what you say you want to feel both

303
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:22,319
comfortable in in your heart and and also take care of others in a way so

304
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:28,560
we're taking always taking care of ourselves and taking care of each other okay i think i've said plenty to set the

305
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:35,440
space so so creating the rooms now give me a moment

306
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:42,720
and please don't hop off it's so um these rooms can break out

307
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:49,119
rooms can be so um supportive and if you have to go no

308
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:56,160
judgment no judgment whatsoever so so creating the rooms

309
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:03,280
here we go and um wow it's right on

310
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:09,760
seven o'clock i think we had a lot of reflections um so i tell you what i like to respect the

311
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:15,760
time and and bring the practice for clothes but i'll stay a couple of extra minutes

312
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:22,640
afterwards for those who are on zoom if there any reflections you like to share any aha moments that came up

313
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:29,119
from the small groups would love to hear them so let's dedicate the merit

314
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:34,640
may all beings everywhere be happy be well be free including

315
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:43,838
ourselves may all of us practice having a bad day well

316
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:51,440
[Music]
