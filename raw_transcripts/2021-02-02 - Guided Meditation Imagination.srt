1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,280
so

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,559
warm greetings to our meditation time

3
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,040
together

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,080
and i want to start with a principle of

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,160
meditation that

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,359
is not well appreciated i think or

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,720
taught and that is that

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,720
in some of the challenges we have for

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,359
meditation

10
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,320
the art is rather than fighting the

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,079
challenge

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,120
is uh transforming the challenge

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,879
into something that helps us to be

14
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,040
present and to enter into the meditation

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,640
space

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,878
and um the um

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,640
so for example if there's a lot of

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,239
thinking going on

19
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,920
and you really can't stop the thinking

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,440
and just like you know really obsessing

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,360
about something or other and

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,120
think you know and you try to come back

23
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,800
but just it's

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,760
hard or you keep spinning out then

25
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,280
rather than struggling with your

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,479
thinking

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,320
you might reorient your thinking

28
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,520
to think about meditation think about

29
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,119
what's actually happening in the present

30
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,320
moment

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,200
and thinking about meditation is not the

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,360
same as meditation exactly

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,600
but it's certainly better than the

34
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,640
alternative

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,799
because you're pointing the thinking

36
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,240
into the present to what's actually

37
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,040
happening what you're dedicated towards

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,200
and so a variation of this has to do

39
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,360
with the imagination

40
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,000
that if we're thinking about the past or

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,280
the future

42
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,399
it's partly an act of imagination

43
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,680
we're thinking thoughts of fantasy it's

44
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,439
imagination especially when there's

45
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,880
visualizations going on we're

46
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,960
visualizing things

47
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,040
and to some degree imagination is at

48
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,880
play with a lot of the ways in which we

49
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,719
drift off in thought

50
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,159
and that's one of the reasons why it can

51
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,960
be so compelling

52
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,200
and so it's also possible then to use

53
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,640
imagination

54
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,439
to be present to point us back into the

55
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,119
present moment

56
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,560
and and ideally for the purposes of

57
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,760
meditation

58
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,840
this would be a very simple act of

59
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,800
meditation of imagination

60
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,000
imaginations which support is settling

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,440
and concentrating and becoming more

62
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,239
attentive

63
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,520
to the present moment but to harness the

64
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,519
power of imagination

65
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,040
to be present is something that the

66
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,720
buddha never taught

67
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,920
explicitly but in his teachings it's

68
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,319
kind of

69
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,680
implicit and i'll talk about that later

70
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,280
so i'll offer you some simple

71
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,800
i'll offer you some simple uh acts of

72
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,879
imagination that maybe can help you

73
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,239
gather yourself together and become

74
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,959
focused and present here in the moment

75
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,120
and so if you hear as you hear these

76
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,519
little exercises in imagination

77
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,360
keep in mind this is this is the purpose

78
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,120
of them to help us really be

79
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,560
here in the present moment

80
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,000
so to begin to uh

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,319
some care for your meditation posture

82
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,120
and

83
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,400
the attention to the posture is the

84
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,280
beginning of

85
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,879
mindfulness meditation being mindful of

86
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,599
the posture

87
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,440
making mindful adjustments

88
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,280
and as you exhale mindfully relaxing and

89
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,080
softening

90
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,959
parts of your body

91
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,599
and gently close your eyes

92
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,400
and to begin the process of

93
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,200
being present in the place you're at

94
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,959
here in this body

95
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,840
this time

96
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,440
slowly maybe tenderly

97
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,759
take a few long slow deep breaths

98
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,360
breathing in and deeply

99
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:43,840
and maybe lovingly exhale long exhale

100
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,918
and then

101
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,840
letting your breathing return to normal

102
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,600
and then one more time one more round of

103
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,000
going through your body

104
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,120
and on the exhale

105
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,360
relaxing the parts of your body that are

106
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,319
easy to relax

107
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,600
and as you relax

108
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:25,840
relax into the pull of gravity

109
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,479
and then sitting here quietly

110
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,840
meditating quietly in your meditation

111
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,160
place

112
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,000
evoke your imagination

113
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,880
that with your eyes closed imagine

114
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,000
yourself

115
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,319
sitting meditating where you're

116
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,960
meditating

117
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,960
imagine yourself in this space

118
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,360
imagine yourself on your spot

119
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,639
imagine you're seeing yourself in your

120
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:35,840
meditation posture

121
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,199
in a sense you're using your imagination

122
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,280
to imagine what is actually happening

123
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,800
here

124
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,120
but it is an act of imagination a little

125
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,080
bit removed from the

126
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,198
direct experience

127
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,199
imagining

128
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:02,800
your spine your back

129
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,880
have a picture in your mind perhaps of

130
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,400
what's happening with your hands

131
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,520
your legs

132
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,280
if you have an easy ability to visualize

133
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,039
maybe visualize yourself sitting here

134
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,400
quietly peacefully

135
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,840
just here

136
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,479
and then imagine

137
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,840
that side by side with you is a person

138
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,080
who

139
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,879
really inspires you in in the dharma

140
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,800
maybe the buddha sits next to you

141
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,960
or kuan yin available

142
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,759
or some teacher that greatly inspires

143
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,000
you

144
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,319
and they're meditating next to you

145
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,639
and what would it be like to have this

146
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,680
inspiring meditator

147
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,160
side by side with you sharing with you

148
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,759
in the meditation

149
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:27,840
in your space

150
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,800
and then imagine that

151
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,560
see sitting here in your own experience

152
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,880
you're sharing a lot of experiences with

153
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,760
this

154
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,959
companion of yours

155
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,360
both of you feel the temperature of the

156
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,839
room

157
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,800
both of you who hear the same sounds

158
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,440
around you

159
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,640
in this inspiring person next to you

160
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,200
imagine how this person feels the

161
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,920
temperature

162
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:23,200
hears the sounds

163
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,519
and like you this person is breathing

164
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,000
and while there might be differences

165
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,720
between your breath and theirs

166
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,640
there's also a lot of similarities

167
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,480
they also experience their rhythm of

168
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,920
breathing in and breathing out

169
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,040
and maybe imagine how this person would

170
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,880
sit peacefully and

171
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,640
feel that rhythm and sensations of

172
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,040
breathing

173
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,279
and like you this person feels

174
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,720
their body maybe there are some

175
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,079
differences but a lot of similarities

176
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,120
to be in this body to feel it and sense

177
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,640
it

178
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,320
and imagining how this person meditates

179
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,800
and holds and relates to their body from

180
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,279
the inside out

181
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,839
maybe with peacefulness or calmness or

182
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,839
ease

183
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,000
and as you're sitting with yourself here

184
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,519
can you feel or intuit

185
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,240
within yourself some degree of calmness

186
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,880
or peace

187
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,519
embodied calmness

188
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,160
settledness

189
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,720
which receives your breathing the

190
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,839
experience of breathing

191
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,120
imagine what it'd be like for you

192
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,839
to be peaceful maybe you're not peaceful

193
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:28,399
particularly

194
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,079
but imagine what it'd be like

195
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,720
maybe remembering a time that you were

196
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,000
peaceful or contented

197
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,519
settled at ease

198
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,120
remembering what it was like at that

199
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,640
time

200
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,519
physically the actual experience from

201
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,320
the point of view of your body

202
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,000
what was it like in your body to be

203
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,079
peaceful and settled

204
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,800
at ease

205
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,440
and then to let go of the imagination of

206
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,959
your companion

207
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,800
of some other time and place where you

208
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,440
felt peaceful

209
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,519
even the imagination of yourself sitting

210
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,760
here

211
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,880
but allow the there to linger some of

212
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,760
the qualities of

213
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,200
peace or calmness

214
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,839
and gently tenderly now

215
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,320
allow the experience of breathing

216
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,600
to be received in whatever calmness or

217
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,839
peacefulness that there is

218
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,880
receiving the experience of inhale

219
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,120
allowing for exhaling

220
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,880
letting there be an ever so short

221
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,639
pause before you inhale

222
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:35,839
then pause where the mind can get quiet

223
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,880
in which then you can just receive the

224
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:49,519
inhale when it wants to begin

225
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,560
an ever so short pause at the

226
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,839
before the exhale

227
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,160
so that you can feel more fully how good

228
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,720
it is to allow

229
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:17,839
for the release the exhale

230
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,800
imagining that all around you and all

231
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,880
within you

232
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,560
is lots and lots of space

233
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,839
lots of room

234
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,240
and breathing

235
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,079
has lots of breathing room

236
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,639
room with space which is peaceful

237
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,040
expansive

238
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,759
peaceful

239
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,720
and breathing in and breathing out

240
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,600
allowing and releasing

241
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:51,759
is intimate with all the space and room

242
00:15:51,759 --> 00:16:09,839
peace that's also present here

243
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,720
imagining the mind

244
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,480
what it would be like if it were there

245
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,360
was a refreshing silence in the mind

246
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,879
a silence which was maybe

247
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,160
that may be spread through all the space

248
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,839
that's here

249
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,039
silence that makes your thinking

250
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,840
not so important

251
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,559
silence that allows the thinking to

252
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,320
relax and dissolve

253
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,840
diffused into the silence

254
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,000
breathing in and breathing out

255
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,840
in space and silence

256
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,760
having a very teeny pause at the end of

257
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,000
the

258
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,679
out breath the end of the in-breath

259
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,880
relaxed pause

260
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,320
can be a little protection

261
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,799
from being caught up in your thoughts or

262
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,760
your imagination

263
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,880
little reminder stay here with the

264
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:05,840
direct experience of breathing

265
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,039
and then as we come to the end of the

266
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,440
sitting

267
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,000
take a few moments to imagine

268
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,159
some of the people that you'll encounter

269
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,600
today or

270
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,640
communicate with today or maybe think

271
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,360
about today

272
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,480
and imagine what it would be like if you

273
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,000
could encounter them

274
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,960
being peaceful

275
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,039
having a simple good will

276
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:18,080
without any animosity or anxiety

277
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,080
or any strong

278
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,799
desire that their expectation for

279
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,278
anything

280
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,520
imagine what it'd be like to meet them

281
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,840
in a peaceful goodwill

282
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,200
that is not so strong

283
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,360
to

284
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,840
disturb them but just nice for you

285
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,159
imagining that possibility

286
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,240
and then wishing aspiring

287
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,399
that whatever benefit and goodness

288
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,520
that's come from this meditation

289
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,200
then it might be translated in your body

290
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,600
and your heart and the mind

291
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,760
to walking through the world in a way

292
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,039
that brings benefit

293
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:25,039
to others whether seen or unseen

294
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,039
whether you know knowingly or

295
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,360
unknowingly

296
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,080
may it be that the merit the benefits

297
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,760
the goodness of

298
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,120
our meditation together

299
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,480
spreads into the world

300
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,840
with kind actions supportive actions

301
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,240
generous activity for the welfare and

302
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,600
happiness of all beings

303
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,159
may all beings be happy

304
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:03,120
may all beings be safe

305
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,880
may all beings be peaceful

306
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,720
may all beings everywhere be

307
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,840
free

308
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,480
you
