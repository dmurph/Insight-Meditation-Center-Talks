1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:06,160
good evening welcome

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:15,240
welcome so tonight I want to talk a little bit um about

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,880
conflict and interestingly there's this way that conflict shows up in theas the

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:28,519
early Buddhist literature in that apparently there is some Heavenly

5
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:33,640
realm this is just like some little Side Story That's Just sprinkled in very

6
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:39,239
rarely but it's in there a few times in the suas this heavenly realm where the

7
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:45,239
gods and the Titans are always battling they're always in

8
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:51,760
conflict and this and the Gods in kind like in Buddhist cosmology they are just

9
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,120
disembodied beings they have no special powers they don't have special knowledge

10
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,440
or anything like this they're just like humans who happen to be

11
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:09,080
disembodied and Titans are I don't know what they are they are

12
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,560
other disembodied beings who are not gods and they are there's this conflict

13
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,640
between the gods and the Titans uh the poly word for Titan is Aura and some

14
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,240
people translate them as demons but uh they're not demonic so much as you'll

15
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,880
see so looking a little bit about these uh Gods and Titans interact and

16
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:40,320
specifically the king of the Gods and the king of the Titans interact we can learn a little bit about conflict about

17
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:48,079
uh how it was portrayed and how they um what the Buddha had to say about it and

18
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:54,640
you know what Jim I asked you to increase the volume but now can we decrease it just a tiny bit I can hear

19
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,960
that it's a little bit Lou yeah so is it possible that it could be just like in between there yeah so I'm not having to

20
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:08,560
throw my voice okay thank you

21
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,120
so maybe not surprisingly because there's yeah I'm sorry can it be just a

22
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:20,840
little bit tighter I feel bad as this but I'll lose my voice by the end of the evening if we don't do this okay I think

23
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:28,360
this will be good so Saka who is the king of the Gods

24
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,959
right they're always in this uh conflict with the Titans he asks the Buddha about

25
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:40,000
this and I'm paraphrasing a little bit he says to the Buddha when beings

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,159
including Gods humans and Titans all wish to live in

27
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:52,239
peace why are they perpetually embroiled in conflict and this is a question where we

28
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:58,519
could ask ourselves everybody wants to live in peace but why is there so much

29
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:05,799
conflict why is is there so much disagreement or violence and all these things that are happening and then the

30
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:11,959
in answer to this question the Buddha gives a discourse that um it begins by

31
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:18,599
saying this discourse like is tracing the cause of uh conflict and hostility

32
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:27,480
and uh the Buddha first says to Saka the co um why there is conflict is because

33
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:34,920
people have jealousy and stingy and that is we could say is wanting what

34
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:40,799
other people have or not wanting to share what you

35
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:47,439
have it's all about you know like mine I need more this kind of a feeling that uh

36
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:54,280
certainly we see a lot of that right in contemporary times too and soing that God is very happy to

37
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:00,280
finally learn this like oh okay okay great jealousy and stinginess is the source of conf

38
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,840
fantastic thank you I understand this and then Saka says but wait what's the

39
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:13,560
cause of jealousy and stinginess and then the Buddha says

40
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:20,359
um you know what I didn't write the whole list here but maybe I'll summarize this because the Buddha he's he points

41
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:31,080
to subtler and subtler things that are underg guarding each of these things and it gets all the way down to views

42
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:38,080
beliefs opinions this is the source of conflict and it gets expressed in so

43
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,800
many different ways there's this way in which clinging

44
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:51,240
to our views leads to conflict and some of you might be Pro protesting but of course

45
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,759
I'm clinging to My Views I'm right they're wrong of course you know

46
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:03,759
of course but there's this way in which we all know this that clinging like holding on

47
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:10,000
tightly to anything isn't the way to Greater Peace and Freedom whether it's a view or

48
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,160
whether it's uh well I guess views are probably the

49
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,319
strongest that we hold on to so tightly or maybe this wish to control

50
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:27,800
other people or you know there another way in which we hold on to things so not holding on to not clinging

51
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:33,479
to philosophies or doctrine or even teachings or including Buddhist

52
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:39,479
teachings right that's not to be held on to they can be a support and they can be

53
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:45,280
helpful but clinging to anything is not the way to the greatest

54
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:51,160
Freedom they can be held I've often find myself doing this like with open hands

55
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:57,759
as opposed to really holding on and part of the way that we can

56
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:04,600
recognize that the Buddha he's placing this emphasis on not clinging not holding on to not gripping our views is

57
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:10,800
he describes an awakened person somebody who has the most amount of Freedom

58
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:18,319
complete freedom and in this uh small little quote he says an awakened person is not

59
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:25,919
an enemy to any Doctrine seen heard or thought but not

60
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:31,560
forming opinions not shut down and not desirous they are wise ones who have

61
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:37,639
laid the burden down so the burden of trying to hold on like I'm right and

62
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:45,120
you're wrong I know things and you don't so it's not that they don't have

63
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,479
ideas and but and this word opinions here opinions are often like our views

64
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:55,599
that have implicit in them and here's how you're wrong and here's how you should fix it it's kind of like you know

65
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:01,840
this recommendation of a something that you should do so the Buddha is saying a completely

66
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,560
awakened person isn't one that's out there fighting with everybody who has different

67
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:14,280
teachings or has a different understanding instead they're helping other people to find more freedom

68
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,479
they're not spending time putting down everybody

69
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:26,160
else so this idea of to not engaging in disputes over beliefs and Views because

70
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:34,160
this recognition that uh when we get into disputes or conflicts about views

71
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:42,960
it just tends to lead to dogmatism it leads to like fundamentalism like people just dig in to their views when they're

72
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,440
kind of like see uh opposite ones we see this happening a lot in the

73
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,479
on the world stage or even in our um

74
00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:00,560
Even in our personal lives we can see that oh just because somebody is has a

75
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:08,159
different view than our than we do then we just kind tend often to hold our views a little bit tighter maybe we feel

76
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:15,639
a little bit threatened by something that's completely different feel threatened of wait if they believe

77
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:20,680
something that I believe then that means I'm wrong so they can't be right because

78
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:26,800
implicit in that is I'm wrong so I must be right and they are wrong and then soon as you have this feeling like I'm

79
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:35,000
right then this US versus them Dynamic gets even uh created in even a stronger way and

80
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,680
and this can we just dig in in whatever way is necessary

81
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:47,399
or I heard this a story once that had a big impact on me I think it was from Sharon

82
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:54,320
solsburg uh she's a one of the elders in this tradition and she talks about um how she

83
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,720
found herself in this really big fight about with another Budd Buddhist

84
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:05,560
practitioner but a different Buddhist tradition than this one about what happens after death and their voices

85
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:11,720
were getting higher and higher and they were like fighting and arguing and then she realized what are we fighting

86
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:17,959
about we don't know we're not dead we don't actually know and yet there's this

87
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:25,959
big way that they both got kind of dug into their own beliefs and Views about

88
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:32,600
this because part of the truth I mean the truth is is that

89
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:39,519
we have this tendency to think that we know the truth based on our experience

90
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:45,279
of course of course but by Nature we have a limited

91
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:52,240
experience we don't have like all possible experiences so other people's views

92
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,360
often are coming from their experience and ours are coming from ours

93
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:04,200
so it does it's we often are setting up this Dynamic of like well My Views are

94
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:11,399
based on you know observation and thoughtfulness and intellect and those

95
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:19,200
their views are just you know idian syncratic and weird but it's just really all based on

96
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,839
people's experiences right nobody's making views just for the fun of it out of complete

97
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,839
nothing

98
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:38,320
so there's this way in which our unexamined opinions or assumptions or

99
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:44,160
beliefs we've just inherited them we have experiences but part of this

100
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:50,880
experien is the family we grew up in the culture we grew up in the society we

101
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:58,120
grew up in the society we're in now we're just kind of like uh adopting

102
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:04,639
these without necessarily looking at them or examining them and of course we are some ways that's how we Define

103
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:11,959
society and culture people have similar views that's okay of course we have them

104
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:18,000
the problem is the clinging and the insisting that we are right and everybody else is

105
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,079
wrong US versus them and with this practice something

106
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:30,560
that I appreciate so much it's like we don't have to turn off our critical intelligence and just adopt some

107
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:37,600
beliefs that is absolutely not what this practice is about what this tradition is about instead it's the opposite it's an

108
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:43,800
encouragement to investigate get

109
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:51,399
curious about what you hear as the teachings what you read about the

110
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:59,519
teachings and about yourself what are your views how how did you come to have them

111
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,639
are they helpful do they lead to more freedom or not and what I'm pointing to

112
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:12,880
is not the great like psychological archaological dig which is something a little bit different but just this uh

113
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,320
this openness this curiosity just like asking the question

114
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:25,440
where did these come from or what are my beliefs it's the asking of the question

115
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,800
that makes the difference because asking of the question just helps this recognition like oh yeah this is a

116
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:39,320
belief and there might be another belief possible if we don't ask that question that we just assume there's only one

117
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:45,560
belief the one that I have and it's the right one but just

118
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:52,600
asking helps create some space and some room for something else to a new idea or

119
00:12:52,600 --> 00:13:01,120
maybe a new understanding or appreciation of people who have different beliefs different views

120
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,839
so when Saka asks the Buddha why why would everybody wants peace why is there

121
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:16,120
so much conflict the Buddha starts with something that's obvious and that we all experience like wanting more not wanting

122
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:21,760
to share and then when Saka has this conversation well what about that and

123
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:27,680
that and that they get down to views and beliefs this is a source of

124
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:35,680
conflict now I'd like to share another little story with uh Saka the king of the Gods and uh the king of the Titans

125
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:41,320
here's a another little story about conflict and in this uh The suas

126
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:47,399
Preserve this the Buddha is telling this story to the

127
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,920
monastics and there was this there was a battle

128
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:01,079
between the gods and the Titans and then the king of the Titans his name is

129
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:06,560
vti he goes to Saka the king of the Gods and says let's have a debate and let's

130
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,800
win over debate so this is after a battle maybe they said okay you know I'm tired of fighting maybe there's got to

131
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:19,720
be another way we can do this let's uh have a debate I'm paraphrasing here of course

132
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:27,000
and uh Saka the king of the God says okay so they assembled a panel of both

133
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,880
gods and Titans who they said would you know be able to determine who wins the

134
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:39,959
debate and then vti the king of the Titans he uh says to the king of the

135
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:45,040
Gods um why don't you go first and Saka

136
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:51,040
the king of the God says no you're the senior David you're the S senior here

137
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:57,639
why don't you go first it's a little bit of respect there and so V pitti the king of the

138
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:04,480
Titans he the this is the F his uh first uh statement and this is done in verse

139
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,079
so the English feels a little clunky sometimes but it's then in

140
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:17,240
verse fools who would vent anger even more if no one would keep wait here we

141
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:23,880
go fools would vent anger even more if no one would keep them in check hence

142
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:30,959
with drastic punishment the wise person restrains the fool

143
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:37,959
and the Titans applaud and the gods are silent for me I

144
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:44,759
just love this little bit of detail right we see this so much today right if you're on this team or that team or this

145
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:52,800
side of the aisle or that side of the aisle you're like all this you're just whatever you're yay and then uh this side is silent

146
00:15:52,800 --> 00:16:00,480
right this was you know composed thousands of years ago and here we are still doing the same thing

147
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:07,240
so then um so the king of the Titans said that

148
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:14,240
and then um he said to the king of the Gods now you speak and the king of the Gods

149
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,720
says I think that this is the only way to put a stop to a

150
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:27,920
fool when you know that the other is upset be mindful and stay

151
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:34,800
calm and the gods applauded and the Titans were

152
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:41,040
silent and then uh the god of the Titans speaks next and he

153
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,680
says I see this fault Saka Saka writes the name of the king of the Gods I see

154
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:53,160
this fault Saka in just being patient when a fool thinks of you thus he puts

155
00:16:53,160 --> 00:17:00,440
up with me out of fear the fool will chase you even more like a bull chasing someone who

156
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:06,319
flees so the king of the Titans is uh criticizing this whole idea of be

157
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:13,038
mindful and stay calm because he's saying well if you don't you know really punish them or hit them with Force

158
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:22,159
they're just they will assume that you are afraid and if they think that you are afraid they will go after you even

159
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:28,480
more and of course the Titans applauded when uh the king of the Titans said this

160
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:34,320
and then uh the king of the Gods replies let the fool think this if he

161
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:42,679
wishes that he puts up with me out of fear of goals culminating in one's own

162
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:49,919
good none better than patience is found I'll read that it's a little bit clunky

163
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:55,480
of goals culminating in one's own good

164
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:02,760
none better than patience is found this idea that patience really supports

165
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:09,280
one's own good one's benefit idea of patience and then he

166
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:15,280
continues when you get angry at an angry person you just make things worse when

167
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:22,520
you don't get angry at an angry person you win a battle hard to

168
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:29,600
win right I love this right if one person's angry and then another person's angry and they get angry again then

169
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:36,000
where's it going to end right you can't stop anger with more anger it's impossible it's just somebody it has to

170
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,280
stop somewhere or else there's just this resentment that just bruise and gets bigger and

171
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:48,600
bigger and here's Saka the king of the Gods is saying when

172
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:55,760
you when you don't get angry at an angry person you win a battle hard to

173
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:01,039
win otherwise right it just escalates escalates escalated and if you could just say you know what I'm just not

174
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:07,919
going to play that game I'm just not going to I'm just not going to engage and play that game with

175
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:14,799
you win a battle hard to win and then the king of the Gods

176
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:19,919
continues when you know that the other is angry you act for the good of both

177
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:27,360
yourself and the other if you're Mindful and stay calm so the king of the Gods he's also

178
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:33,440
saying that it's also beneficial not only for you to not get angry but it

179
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,640
helps them also and this is the greater good right

180
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:46,159
to support the person who is you are in conflict with and to support

181
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:55,919
yourself to not escalate instead to deescalate by simply being Mindful and

182
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:04,000
calm of course this is powerful it's not our natural impulse of

183
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,559
course and then this uh ends with the the um the panel of Judges that are

184
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:16,919
consisting of both gods and Titans said this the verses spoken by the king of

185
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:22,520
the Titans evoke punishment and violence that's how you get to arguments quarrels

186
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:28,400
and disputes the verses spoken by the king of Gods don't evoke punishment and

187
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:34,640
viol Ence that's how you stay free of arguments quarrels and

188
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:43,120
disputes you can imagine that uh all the gods clapped when they heard that and

189
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:49,759
the Titans uh were silent when this final ruling came

190
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:56,760
down this idea of being patient this idea of being Mindful and

191
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:02,000
calm in the face of conflict when meeting

192
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,400
somebody who's perhaps uh meeting you with

193
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:12,679
anger this is not something easy it's not something that's

194
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:21,799
straightforward and there's this way in which we can understand patience is this nonreactivity it's like

195
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:28,919
not acting on these uh impulses that aren't helpful that uh aren't supportive for us

196
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:35,200
so not raging and not blaming and not blaming themselves or not blaming um not

197
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:41,120
blaming others not blaming ourselves or not despairing or not making wild

198
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:47,840
stories but just to say wow okay so there's anger here and this is

199
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,960
uncomfortable I wish it weren't here maybe I don't even know what to do but

200
00:21:52,960 --> 00:22:00,720
not escalating but said being mindful like recognizing this is very uncomfortable I

201
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,400
I wish it weren't like this chances are but is there a way that we can just

202
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,159
have hold our difficulties maybe in a spacious way instead of you know trying

203
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:20,480
to fix everything by as fast as possible by yelling or acting very quickly irrationally

204
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:28,000
perhaps be before we've had a chance to think things through is there a way that we can have

205
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:36,799
this more more openness and feels more peaceful and this recognition that yes this is difficult but I don't have to

206
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:42,400
fix it right this moment often we want to just to get out

207
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:49,720
of that feeling of discomfort and part of meditation practice this is not in the advertising

208
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:56,760
but part of meditation practice is to learn to hold discomfort because sometimes it's just

209
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,919
physically uncomfortable to be sitting still or sometimes we're meditating and

210
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:07,600
uncomfortable emotions come up or uncomfortable memories come up and as as

211
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:13,120
best we can to be able to hold them this is great practice for our daily life the

212
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:19,919
exact same thing right to discomfort arises and can we hold it so meditation

213
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:25,039
practice of course it's a allows some steadying of the mind but even if you're

214
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:32,000
having a very uncomfortable meditation session there's tremendous value tremendous

215
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,240
value in that so is there a way that we don't can

216
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:44,559
not lash out and maintain composure even when we're met with uh

217
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:51,679
somebody who is angry just instead maybe just take a deep breath feel our feet on the

218
00:23:53,600 --> 00:24:00,080
ground and maybe even just doing that taking a deep breath and allowing that person to to see it maybe that's enough

219
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,360
that can uh bring things down maybe not

220
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,720
too don't underestimate how helpful it can be to feel your feet on the ground

221
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:17,720
often when there's conflict we don't have our wits with us necessarily that's instead we're feeling like oh wow what's

222
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:23,080
happening but feeling our feet on the ground is a way we can feel grounded and

223
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:31,080
uh maybe steady otherwise the thoughts are more likely to go out and spin and make some wild

224
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:39,720
stories so to have some patience when meeting some

225
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:45,559
conflict but I want to say a little bit about what patience isn't because it's

226
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:51,840
uh tempting when we hear about this okay have some non-reactivity to maybe think about it

227
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:59,440
in a certain way but patience isn't like this numbing resignation like

228
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,960
okay all right and there was this kind of like uh and we just kind of like

229
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:11,960
disconnect from our emotions disconnect from The Experience disconnect from what's Happening and there's this kind

230
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:18,159
of this okay well I'm just going to check out until this is over and then

231
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:24,360
maybe I'll check back in later maybe I won't so that's not patience that's

232
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:30,200
numbing resignation that's like just checking out is there way that we can stay

233
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:38,360
present feel our feet on the ground take a deep breath and feel the discomfort and not run away not check out I'm not

234
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:45,000
saying this is easy but there's a way that meditation practice really can support us in this

235
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,080
just this feeling discomfort and realizing okay it's not going to kill me I don't like it that's okay we don't

236
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:56,120
have to like everything it's

237
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:05,080
also patience is not gritting your teeth holding on and you know just

238
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:10,559
um maybe waiting for things to be over but with a lot of tension we could call

239
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:18,000
that waiting with aversion that's different than patience patience has this way of some

240
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:25,200
steadiness and allowing things to unfold so recognizing uncomfortableness

241
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,679
staying connected and allowing things to unfold how they're going to unfold

242
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:36,840
they'll unfold differently if we have some steadiness of course they will if we have some

243
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:43,240
calm patience also is not like being impervious to pressure it's not like

244
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:50,640
saying nope I'm going to stand here and not do anything no matter what that's just

245
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:56,960
stubbornness so instead uh patience is okay I'm feeling connected I know what's

246
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:04,600
happening I'm allowing things to unfold and it might become clear that it would be really wise to do this thing or that

247
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:10,000
other thing and then we do this thing or that other thing but we're not just

248
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:17,799
standing there not be uh not reacting as uh just out of principle and even though

249
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:24,720
it might be harmful to others or to ourselves to do that we're not doing it just for the sake of doing

250
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:32,640
it and patience the way that I'm describing it of course is not passivity this is work right to not check out not

251
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:39,000
run away but to stay present and this is a way that really we

252
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:46,799
can be with conflict is okay can I hold this and not masking or suppressing

253
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:53,640
what's happening maybe we flashes of anger come up maybe maybe flashes of

254
00:27:53,640 --> 00:28:00,519
like why is this happening to me comes up but we're not acting unskillfully we're acknowledging our

255
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:08,480
experience and as best we can we're holding them spaciously with some

256
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:14,200
patience so that's one way to work with conflict is right this patience and

257
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:21,120
mindfulness and calmness and then the first story with suaka when he was asking the Buddha

258
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:27,360
about okay well why when everybody wants peace why is there so much conflict and the Buddha eventually got

259
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,399
down to well it's about views so this is a second way to work with

260
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:38,919
conflict is to have some awareness what are the views that we are holding on to

261
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:45,960
or that we are um maybe maybe just to Simply become

262
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:53,640
aware of our beliefs because most likely our views and beliefs they are not obvious to us

263
00:28:53,640 --> 00:29:01,600
that's kind of the nature of views and beliefs that they are kind like buried underneath they're subtle and they are

264
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:07,840
have a giant impact on our life our actions but they're not obvious to

265
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,960
us and we may not even recognize them until there's a conflict and we realize

266
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,880
oh there's something here that's getting threatened what is it that feels threatened and this can be a way just

267
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:24,440
bring some curiosity to this this could be a way in which we can recognize oh

268
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:31,840
yeah I have this belief that things should be this way and they're not that way and they should be that way we might

269
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:38,120
have that belief and somehow just recognizing our

270
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:44,399
beliefs and naming them allows them to be held a little bit

271
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:52,080
less tightly I'm not saying we have to get rid of them I'm not saying we have to change them all but it's if we become

272
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:59,840
aware of them then we could start to see and recognize okay what's helpful what's not helpful what leads to more freedom

273
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,919
what leads to less Freedom can we bring curiosity and some

274
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:15,559
inquiry into our beliefs are like our inner life our views what are we holding on to is it

275
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:23,000
helpful maybe I also just want to add in here that beliefs are resistant to change they're not something that once

276
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,240
we see them they're going to be different or if we see things are like for example we might have a belief no

277
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:36,600
pain no gain I think this was a Nike slogan right for years ago but this idea that

278
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:43,360
you have to work hard and if you're not working hard nothing Good's going to happen I know I certainly had this

279
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:52,240
belief and uh I mean it worked until it didn't right until I the working hard

280
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:58,320
this idea that I had to work hard I realized oh actually this belie of

281
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:04,880
working heart I'm using this as a distraction from the rest of my life from my inner life and all these

282
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:12,360
difficulties my insisting that I have to work harder harder harder I just put all my attention and my energy there and was

283
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:19,960
ignoring everything else in my life my inner life my relationships these types of things I'm not saying you don't have

284
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:25,600
to work hard of course not but we might have a belief that uh nothing valuable

285
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:31,679
will happen unless we're doing that unless there's a lot of

286
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:37,039
striving and then there's a way in which we can dismiss things that are beautiful

287
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:42,919
uplifting easeful we might just be dismissing them when that might be exactly what's

288
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:50,039
needed in some ways all of us are so often I shouldn't say all of us many of

289
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:55,399
us are have this like this uh needs some nourishment like need some nourishment

290
00:31:55,399 --> 00:32:02,559
of uh some ease and well-being and no pain no gain is uh can get in the

291
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:09,720
way get in the way of this so working with conflict we can

292
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:18,639
work we can learn from the king of the Gods the king of the Titans who uh have some conflict I guess

293
00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:25,960
uh that's kind of what the Buddhist cosmology has and uh the Buddha is teachings about

294
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:34,960
well look at your views and have patience at your views and have patience

295
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,960
don't feel like you have to act so quickly and when I was thinking about

296
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:47,120
this I thought well looking at your views and have patience for me kind of felt like taking the high road right

297
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,399
this kind might be a way in which we might understand that uh in contemporary

298
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:58,120
teaching like oh this is what part of taking the high road means

299
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:03,360
and then I'll end with this last little story about the king of Gods and the

300
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:09,639
king of the titans the king of the Titans was really sick he was uh ill and

301
00:33:09,639 --> 00:33:15,440
the king of the Gods went to him and uh offered to cure him you know I can cure

302
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:22,200
you I can make you say you're not sick anymore but I'd like you to teach me this magic

303
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:29,039
uh s's magic I don't know who SRA is some character teach me the magic of

304
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:35,279
sbur that's what the king of the Gods is saying and the king of the Titans said

305
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:40,960
no I'm not going to teach that to you because sbra used this magic and now

306
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:46,200
he's in purgatory and in hell I don't want you to have to go to hell so I'm

307
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:53,760
not going to teach it to you so there was some kindness there so here we are these two uh people that are two people

308
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:59,519
two beings that are in constant conflict and yet there was a way they had some

309
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,760
care and respect for one another

310
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:11,118
too so working with conflict with views and

311
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:19,158
patience maybe a little bit of respect in there to sprinkle some in that can't

312
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:25,440
hurt and with that I'll end and open it up to see if there's some comments or

313
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,638
questions thank you

314
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:45,040
so one of the aold path is Right View and I'm wondering Enlightenment like the

315
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:52,599
Buddha for example does he have the right views is it possible to have views that are actually

316
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:58,440
correct yeah thank you for bringing this up so right view some

317
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:04,320
the word right is not like the opposite of wrong in that setting it's more like

318
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,640
right in terms of like the correct tool the way that you would if you needed to

319
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:17,720
paint a wall you would use a paintbrush not a screwdriver kind of thing like that so your question is about does the

320
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:23,960
Buddha can you ask it again so in other words Enlightenment like a liberated being like the Buddha for example or who

321
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:29,280
who I'm sure the other ones but he he must have some sort of views

322
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:35,560
of some nature are they actually true correct I see I

323
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:42,800
see the actually I think the question is so is or the answer is whatever views

324
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:50,040
there are he's not holding on to them clinging to them so has we might say like well this

325
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:56,240
is his current understanding or this is this uh what seems to be true now

326
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:03,440
something like he's holding things that that way and then so there's just it's an absence of clinging so it's not maybe

327
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,720
that the views are I guess they are correct I don't

328
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:14,960
know next time I meet a Buddha I definitely will ask them though but isn't the Dharma of view is like a it's

329
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,880
a way of seeing right is could it be looked at as as a way of viewing the spiritual

330
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,520
path sure sure we could view the spiritual path like the Buddha talks

331
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:32,000
about this as a we're going to learn everything on this path so that we can better at winning debates with people

332
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,720
with other religious traditions and the Buddha would say no that's actually not a good reason why to learn this it's more to find more freedom or something

333
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:45,359
like that so is that helpful yeah great thank

334
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:51,960
you anybody else have a

335
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:06,040
I think it's I think I'll just offer more of a comment and then I'm reminded in your discussion of conflict a line

336
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:11,880
from the talmud which is uh a hero is someone who turns an enemy

337
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:17,839
into a friend and I could just see at the end of The Last

338
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:25,119
Story um some kindness turning to friendship between like the god of the Titans and uh Saka like this oh yeah

339
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:31,839
kindness coming first or even when uh was it Reagan when he met Gorbachev

340
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:38,440
there was a me he was like Hey if aliens were coming to attack your country would you let me know he's like oh yeah and

341
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:44,280
that was kind of star of a dialogue between the two of them that's just the comment thank you

342
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:48,079
nice nice thank you thank you

343
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:00,839
Conrad uh just a comment um so two actually one question then a

344
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:05,960
comment I know in Buddhism like the emphasis often is on Equanimity but I'm

345
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:11,240
wondering if patience I feel like it could hold an equal place but it's not

346
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:18,319
often talked about is that my understanding correct perception yeah so patients and this is a a good question

347
00:38:18,319 --> 00:38:23,760
like how is it different than equinity and uh patients is part of the pyrames

348
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:30,599
which are these uh practices that are usually practiced not on the meditation cushion but out in daily life but

349
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:36,000
equinity is a little bit higher bar equinity is

350
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,680
um like patience would be more like okay this is really uncomfortable and I wish it weren't otherwise but uh I'm going to

351
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:49,040
stay here as best I can and be with it equinity was like oh wow look at that it's

352
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:55,520
uncomfortable and not with the sense of like oh and I really wish it weren't here what can I do to get to to

353
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:02,599
persevere through this so I quity is more like just noticing discomfort and as discomfort and not wanting to push it

354
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:08,560
away or get away from it uh and the second comment I was going

355
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:14,400
to make was especially when you talked about patients in terms of the when being in the

356
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:21,560
conflict um there's a quote in the taed Chang you've probably heard it already the Steven Mitchell version he says do

357
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:26,960
you have the patience to let the water settle and let the answer Rise by itself

358
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:36,160
here we go something like that there you go lots a good wisdom Diana there was a question on the

359
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:42,520
chat which is what what's the name of the suta so these are uh two different sutas

360
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:50,920
uh so the one with um uh where Saka asks the Buddha you

361
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:56,680
know what when everybody wants peace why is there conflict that's the Saka suta

362
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:03,200
that's a de 21 and then the other one where the uh

363
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:10,560
the king of the Titans and the king of the gods are in conflict and they're having this debate that's I doesn't have

364
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:15,640
a title necessarily I don't remember what the oh yes uh fine words it's

365
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:24,559
called and that is samut 115 so we go

366
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,720
any other

367
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:45,599
comments okay so may you have a if you I

368
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:51,280
was going to say may you have a conflict free but maybe you need to have conflict so then you can practice like what are

369
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:58,880
My Views have some patience may you have a wonderful evening thank you
