1
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,480
so good day everyone greetings

2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:21,199
and you know we've come together to do this

3
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,800
meditation and

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,398
the obvious thing is that the act of coming down to meditate sit down here to

5
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,000
be here to meditate together is an action and

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
meditation itself is a kind of action or in the traditional buddhist language

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
it's like it's kama karma which literally means action

8
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:57,920
and many people associate meditation with being rather than doing but the movement

9
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:04,478
to let go to allow itself to be that is also an action that we do something we're doing we let

10
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:11,439
go so we can be and um and the

11
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,640
buddha tended to define people if they if he defined people

12
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:25,200
or described people by what they do not by how they are in a sense of

13
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,640
how they're born especially in ancient india that born into a particular caste was not

14
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:38,400
interesting for the buddha but how people acted and behaved did they behave ethically or not

15
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,759
and now this is all leading up to the idea that um that in meditation sometimes people

16
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,920
focus a lot on their experience and they maybe they're not having a good experience and so they're trying to have

17
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,200
a better experience or let go of something that seems you know not good and

18
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,680
and fix it or something and and or try to do something that creates a great

19
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,720
experience and so they measure themselves by how they are and in

20
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:19,120
another whole approach is to let let be in a certain sense how you are

21
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:27,280
and now focus a little bit more on what you do the actions so in meditation there are

22
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:35,599
two actions related to concentration that are important there's the action of

23
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:42,720
beginning again the action of the mind wanders off and we place it back in this case on the

24
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:50,560
breathing and we connect again with the breathing and the second act action is the action

25
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,640
of hanging in there with the breath once we're we've landed on the breathing to continue

26
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,400
on the breathing and uh and and that's a little bit of an action

27
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,440
to do so and some people don't engage that way

28
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:14,159
and so they're able to connect to the breathing but they quickly wander off again because there isn't that second action okay now

29
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:21,280
stay there linger there hang out there get to know it better feel and explore the breathing really

30
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,040
stay present and now so that's one whole thing

31
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:35,680
but the other thing that's the one what i want to stress today is that the orientation around

32
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,040
action is to do it in a way that's nourishing

33
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:48,959
to do it in a way that's enjoyable that's wholesome that nourishes us has a good influence

34
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:55,680
on us so that it's not just the action to do something quickly and get it done with but to do something

35
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:03,040
with an action that has a nice influence so it's nourishing it's wholesome for our system

36
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,560
so the very ideal way in which we the mind wonders often thought the way we come back from that where we

37
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,400
recognize that come back resist reconnect to the breathing that's an action

38
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,600
that we try to do it in a way that's wholesome that's nourishing that's pleasant that

39
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,720
has a good influence on us so he wouldn't jerk the mind back we wouldn't

40
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:31,360
attack the breath again bear down we wouldn't be ambitious with greed and

41
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,280
and uh for some kind of meditate meditation states uh we're not expecting something

42
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,400
demanding something it's more like like almost like a

43
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,320
tai chi movement you know that the movement itself is satisfying the movement itself is

44
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,880
meaningful that we come back and we just enjoy the coming back because it's nourishing and wholesome

45
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,960
and like we come back with care with love with with um

46
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:07,919
and then the second action of sustaining the attention over time hanging in there not bearing

47
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:16,400
down not keeping the mind in check not reigning the mind in all these forceful things but how can we

48
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:25,520
stay in a nourishing supportive wholesome way a caring way and this art

49
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,960
and this exploration of how to have the actions we do in meditation the mental

50
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:37,199
actions be nourishing be satisfying be

51
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:44,560
you know enjoyable gladdening for us is part of this art and uh so learning exploring thinking

52
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:53,039
about this as we meditate so that um you know we are not so goal oriented

53
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:58,960
with the action but rather maybe like tai chi or beautiful qigong practice

54
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:05,120
where our dance practice we're just doing the movement is so satisfying and meaningful that's

55
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:12,479
the important thing not where it gets us and so the movement of landing and staying on

56
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:18,319
the breath the movement of of staying there and sustaining it

57
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:24,639
that's that's what supports uh a nourishing samadhi nourishing

58
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,960
concentration um so to

59
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:39,199
assume your meditation posture and prepare yourself for the meditation

60
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:45,360
a bit to consider how you can be here

61
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,240
in a wholesome way how you can be here so that

62
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,520
you enter into your the activity of meditation

63
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,880
with a sense of beauty or nourishment or wholesomeness

64
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:17,840
not in a hurry not resisting anything

65
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:30,240
not expecting or demanding that your meditation should be a certain way

66
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:38,479
and then beginning right away to see if you can land on your breathing

67
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:46,720
connect to your breathing in a nourishing way in a nice way wholesome way

68
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,160
so the very way in which you take in the breathing and aware of it

69
00:07:52,160 --> 00:08:01,919
has some maybe spaciousness care [Music] love tenderness

70
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:13,440
some way of being as you would be with a a good friend you care for

71
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,960
and the way you attend your garden when you're in love with your garden

72
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:34,479
and then in this caring nourishing way taking a slow gentle deep breath

73
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:43,919
allowing yourself to take in and feel the goodness of a deeper breath

74
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,560
and the goodness of allowing that to happen

75
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,240
and then relaxing as you exhale

76
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:09,839
relaxing your whole body

77
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,320
letting your breathing return to normal

78
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:27,120
and can you adjust a little bit your state of mind your state of your heart

79
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:33,680
just a little if that's all that's possible so you have a nice attitude a good

80
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,399
attitude wholesome

81
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,880
as if you're getting ready to

82
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:54,560
do tai chi or mental tai chi or mental gardening

83
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,519
and mental caring for something that you

84
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:08,399
love perhaps by relaxing the thinking mind

85
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:18,320
softening the energy of thinking

86
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:33,839
relaxing the muscles that are connected to thinking the pressure the tension to be here

87
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:50,079
and then gently calmly connecting to the beginning of the

88
00:10:50,079 --> 00:11:01,839
in-breath receiving the beginning of the in-breath

89
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:11,440
and then sustaining the attention for however short or long the in-breath

90
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:19,360
is so you're there with a full in-breath

91
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,720
sustained attention

92
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,519
connecting with the beginning of the out breath

93
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:43,839
and then sustaining the whole out breath

94
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,240
and these two movements of connecting

95
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:02,399
receiving the beginning of each in-breath and out-breath and then to

96
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:11,839
sustain the attention on the full out-breath the fallen breath

97
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:20,079
can you do that in a wholesome way nourishing way

98
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:26,639
it is an action can you make it an action which is free of greed or hatred

99
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:32,240
or delusion confusion free of

100
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:38,240
wanting it to be different

101
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,760
pushing something away aversion

102
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:50,560
is simplicity of maybe generosity

103
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,839
love and care

104
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,319
and the attention to the breathing

105
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:09,519
and to support the sustained attention through the exhale especially

106
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,680
you might count the exhales

107
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:21,440
a gentle careful count of one that maybe gets stretched out the whole

108
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:28,500
length of the exhale one [Music]

109
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,560
and then the next exhale two

110
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:54,160
if you lose count start over again and count up to ten or up to three

111
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,040
or up to one

112
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,839
exploring the wholesomeness and nourishment

113
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:17,839
of attending to the breathing

114
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,840
so then as we come to the end of this sitting

115
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:05,679
what do you know about having your mind be wholesome

116
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,399
nourishing

117
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,279
a mind which feels satisfied

118
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,480
and if the mind is not that way

119
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:29,279
can you remember that the mind is a

120
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:34,960
collection of mental activities it's not a thing

121
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:42,399
what can you adjust mentally your way you think what you think

122
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:49,840
what you're oriented towards what you're expecting hoping for

123
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:57,200
so that how you are mentally or heartfully

124
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:05,200
feels as if it has a good influence on you maybe if things are hard that what has a

125
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,278
good influence is to be forgiving

126
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,840
or to be friendly

127
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:23,440
or to be generous towards yourself

128
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:45,840
to have compassion for the challenges

129
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:53,360
to appreciate whatever wholesomeness is here

130
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:59,840
nourishment there is here

131
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:10,480
and let that be a reference point stay close to that or either feeling it or imagining it

132
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:18,960
and then again imagine that you're with someone who is challenging for you

133
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:27,840
but you don't have to speak or do anything you're just sitting in the same room together

134
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:36,960
and staying close to your nourishing mind your wholesome mind and heart

135
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:44,399
without having to do or say anything what happens if you take in the other

136
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,159
person the challenging person

137
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:56,640
if you think about them is there some way that

138
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:03,440
then there's a chance for your care your friendliness your tenderness

139
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:09,840
to be touched by that other person

140
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,720
and you staying close to that place where you feel wholesome

141
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,320
a way of being that feels satisfying for you

142
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:35,039
so not getting caught up in shoulds and shouldn'ts he said she said the resentments

143
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:41,120
the fears just staying close to what's wholesome for you

144
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:50,559
has a good influence on you

145
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:56,320
and then imagine that you do so for the whole world

146
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:03,919
that you include the whole world and your wholesome heart your wholesome mind your wholesome

147
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:06,480
awareness

148
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:17,279
that wholesomeness is the reference point for how to think and feel about other

149
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:24,559
people may all beings

150
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:32,159
be happy may all beings

151
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,960
be safe

152
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,840
may all beings be peaceful

153
00:31:42,799 --> 00:32:01,840
and may all beings everywhere be free

154
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,840
so

155
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:24,880
before i begin this talk i want to mention that

156
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:30,480

for how for many of us how wonderful it's been to do this so i thought that next monday we could

161
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:03,760
do a community meeting to acknowledge celebrate this one year mark

162
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:08,320
and we haven't done it for a long time and

163
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:15,279
my own personal life has meant that i can't it's been hard to do add more things like that but um i can

164
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:20,960
do it next monday and uh so we can um

165
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:27,840
so it'll be there'll be a zoom meeting so after we finish here at about 7 45

166
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:36,159
you'll be given access to a zoom link and then we'll switch over to the zoom and be able to meet and

167
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:41,760
hang out and talk and maybe break up maybe break into little groups and so you can chat a little bit with uh

168
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:50,640
this youtube community and maybe meet some of the people whose names appear on the you know in the chat

169
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:56,880
and then we can also talk a little bit about some of the maybe some of the questions and issues around our little

170
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:03,919
community and this meetings and uh the continuation of it and all that planning to continue

171
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:12,079
and um so so next monday the 15th

172
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:21,280
so one of the foundational cornerstone teachings of

173
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:30,398
the buddha and that intimately connects to both meditation and living a daily life is

174
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:35,520
the idea of wholesome and unwholesome sometimes it's translated skillful and

175
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:42,240
unskillful more informally i like to translate it as helpful and unhelpful

176
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:48,720
that that there is a way of of and it has to do with the

177
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:54,158
actions what we do that we and some of those actions don't really maybe in english we don't think

178
00:34:54,159 --> 00:35:00,880
of them as in actions but more like states wholesome states but they still have a kind of a little bit

179
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:08,079
they're an activity of the mind in the background somehow and so um these are these are

180
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:14,640
states of mind actions of the mind activities of the mind ways of being that feel like as if

181
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:20,560
they're nourishing and that word nourishing is a is a word that the buddha used that's

182
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:26,160
different things different mental states and mental activities operated as food as nourishment for

183
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:32,480
ourselves so it isn't just simply generosity's generosity generosity is a wholesome

184
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,920
state a healthy state that is nourishing that has a good

185
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,119
influence on us so loving-kindness is that

186
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:50,400
mindfulness is considered a wholesome state that is nourishing and and has a good influence on us

187
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,839
tranquility is a wholesome state wholesome way of being that is uh as a

188
00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:04,160
nourishing it nourishes us nourishes more tranquility and and so this idea of both of

189
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:11,119
nourishment wholesomeness comes into play now in the third tetrath of the 16 steps of

190
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:16,160
anapanasati in a number of ways the

191
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:23,680
tenth step is gladdening the mind and this gliding the mind some people's translated as satisfying the mind or

192
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:31,359
or enjoying the mind and this comes with the ability to feel

193
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:37,440
the goodness the delight the enjoyment not just of pleasure but of this nourishment this

194
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,480
wholesomeness that can happen and this comes with as we no longer

195
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:48,160
fixate or focus on the details of our inner life

196
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:55,200
but begin looking at the big picture and that's what uh being experiencing the mind as a whole

197
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:01,599
we're not preoccupied with the past preoccupied by the future our desires are focusing on particular emotions that

198
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:07,359
we have that are really troublesome for us all reasonable things to do at times but

199
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:14,400
to um but as we go deeper and deeper into meditation we're relaxing and letting go and not

200
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,839
fixating on things that there's a softening and a deepening and an opening

201
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:25,680
that begins happening that we've become aware of the the general the quality of our inner

202
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:31,520
life and another way i'd like to translate chitta the mind or the heart

203
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:38,160
the whole the holistic a whole quality of the inner life and as we let go a lot and going through

204
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:44,560
these deeper states of meditation we tap into um

205
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:50,960
we tap into a sense of wholesomeness a goodness and some nourishing nourishment

206
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:57,520
something it feels very satisfying just to be here and now this becomes a valuable

207
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:05,680
thing to experience this becomes something to imbibe to feel to allow itself to be influenced by

208
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:12,240
and so and so to understand that the buddhist teachings is based on this

209
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:19,280
movement towards the wholesome and to the degree to which we do what's wholesome do wholesome things in our life uh

210
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:25,520
skillful things do things which are ethically wholesome that is psychologically wholesome

211
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:31,440
that leads to a sense of being whole rather than being fragmented a sense of

212
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:37,920
being inclusive rather than holding things at bay and holding things in check

213
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:45,280
this becomes very important as we start moving into developing samadhi or unification the

214
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:50,400
eleventh step of anupanasati breathing in one unifies the mind

215
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:56,800
breathing out one unifies the mind another translator breathing in one steadys the mind

216
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,920
breathing out one steadys the mind another translator breathing in one

217
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:07,200
concentrates the mind breathing out one concentrates the mind so these words

218
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:13,599
unify steady concentrate are all in the domain of this

219
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:21,040
fourth this third tetrad when experiences the mind one gladdens or satisfies the mind and

220
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:29,440
then one concentrates unifies the mind and the sequence points to the fact that

221
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:36,320
it's a lot easier for the mind to get unified to gather together to get organized to get settled to be

222
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:42,720
steady um when there's a feeling of when the mind feels like a satisfying place an

223
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:47,760
enjoyable place to be the heart is wholesome and good

224
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,800
and so we're not recoiling from inner pain or struggle or angst

225
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,160
we're not afraid of ourselves and and trying to avoid parts of ourselves

226
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:04,000
we've come to the place where we're now we're inclusive the mind we associate more with the

227
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,599
inclusivity of the big mind rather than the particular details we

228
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:15,520
might still have particular details that are difficult for sure but it's not where we're locked into or

229
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:21,599
what we're preoccupied with we respect it but where now the mind holds it all

230
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:29,040
in a more expansive open way and then expansive open mind that is is where we begin

231
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:35,440
feeling something allows for something wholesome and satisfying and deep to happen

232
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:43,280
and so rather than huffing and puffing to get concentrated it's more like da this is good

233
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:50,839
the mind wants to settle the mind wants to go into uh

234
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:57,599
into uh you know be more subtle doesn't want to be scattered in fact to be scattered to go into the

235
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:03,760
past and the future to be caught up in thoughts to become narrow again or

236
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:10,720
locked into something again it just starts feeling not doesn't really feel interesting it's not like it's like why would you

237
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:17,040
and there's not much juice much energy to to be distracted because it feels so

238
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:22,720
good to be here right here so maybe my way i'm talking is kind of grand

239
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:28,800
and grandiose a little bit seems like a little bit beyond what's possible for you but what

240
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:35,119
i want to emphasize is that we are kind of moving in the direction of an

241
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:41,280
inner goodness and inner wholesomeness and inner some kind of way that inner life feels satisfying

242
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:49,040
and i like to use the word we feel at home in ourselves oh i'm home it's so good to be here of course i want to be here

243
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:56,160
and it's with this mind this way of being that when we connect to our breathing

244
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:02,319
that we do it in a way that feels satisfying tender caring we appreciate the opportunity to

245
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:07,760
start again rather than being a burden and rather being dejected or dismayed that we

246
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:13,119
wondered often thought we feel ah yes i come home this is good

247
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:19,119
and then when we sustain the attention it's not because we're struggling to do it or holding things at bay

248
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:25,280
it's because we are ah this is good i'm home and this feels nice to be here in the

249
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:30,480
present moment so the um it's called the initial

250
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,760
application of attention this connecting and the sustained application of

251
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:42,000
attention this sustaining attention ideally it's all you all kind of nourishing

252
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:48,640
and maybe each of you can have a different um um reference pointer example that

253
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,760
supports you for this uh i used in the meditation idea of doing tai chi

254
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:59,760
tai chi of the mind coming back to your breathing hanging in there with breathing those

255
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:06,160
gentle flowing movements of tai chi where the point isn't to get to the end of the tai

256
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:11,359
chi movements as quickly as you can the point is there's an action we're doing tai chi

257
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:18,079
but we're each moment we're just is complete in itself is we're really into that part of the movement

258
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:23,920
for some of you might be gardening maybe you love gardening or just being and weeding and planting just

259
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:30,560
doing it there's not you're not in a hurry to do it it's just tender it's nourishing it's

260
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:36,000
maybe it's kind of a parental feeling of your plan so just kind of tending and

261
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:43,119
caring maybe it's a craft maybe it's caring for someone who's sick that you do

262
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:50,560
do it in a loving way so you might think about what example you have in your life of doing something which

263
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:56,480
has qualities of wholesomeness nourishment

264
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:02,000
satisfaction inner goodness that is the that represents for you the

265
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,359
movement we're going the downhill slope the pull of gravity of meditation

266
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:15,040
this is where we go going and and with that we cultivate unification

267
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:21,920
we cultivate a steadiness a deep subtleness in what some people call concentration

268
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:27,839
so enjoy yourself enjoy your mind

269
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:34,000
and or provide your mind with a way of being that

270
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:42,720
the mind enjoys let your inner actions inner attitudes thoughts and feelings

271
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:50,640
be something the mind really appreciates that the mind feels ah this is good the mind says oh i like

272
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:56,319
being with this person i like being here i don't feel like i need to run off anymore

273
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:02,480
because the way this is operating for this person this is really good and maybe your mind will

274
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:10,160
stick around and stick around for your breathing and for your meditation in the present moment

275
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:17,838
so thank you all very much and i look forward to tomorrow
