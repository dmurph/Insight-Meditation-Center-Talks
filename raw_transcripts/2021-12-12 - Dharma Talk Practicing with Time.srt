1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:07,600
so warm greetings everyone happy to have you all here and

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,880
um before the pandemic we used to broadcast these sunday morning talks on youtube but i never thought about the

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,640
people on youtube but now i do so now clearly

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,320
they're right there where the camera is

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:33,038
so thank you for those of you logging in today

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,520
so um the topic that i want to talk about today is time

7
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,640
it's been on my mind lately and uh

8
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,320
i want to tell you a story from my time at the monastery

9
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:59,840
i was the the kitchen manager i guess that

10
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,680
and uh so i was like the person most responsible for the production of the

11
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,280
food and the meals and there was a crew of

12
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,320
anywhere from maybe four to

13
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,799
sometimes ten depending on the time of the year that i supervised

14
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,640
and but during the retreat time we had three months of retreats

15
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,479
and at that time uh in zen things are highly choreographed

16
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,840
the schedule is really clear and set

17
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,479
uh it's kind of like time is one of the teachers in his end monastery because you have to kind of do things on time

18
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:52,799
and and also you have to stop on time one of the great challenges was

19
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,960
we'd have this 15-minute cleaning period breaking the grounds or sweeping or doing something

20
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,159
and when the bell rang to end it you couldn't just keep doing it to

21
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,759
finish the job when the time to end happened you were supposed to stop

22
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:16,400
and then it took a training people to learn it's okay to stop and next day you could do it some more

23
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:23,520
so anyways everything's choreographed on time and so one of the things that was uh was that it was meals

24
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,760
and meals basically had to be served up in the meditation hall

25
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,760
by them at the minute that it was supposed to be there because there was saw this ritual beforehand

26
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,760
and so the ritual people are chanting and bowing and doing all this stuff and then sitting there and sitting in

27
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,200
meditation hall you know just for the meal to come and so in order for all to go smoothly you know

28
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,879
the meal had to be there right on time so i don't i don't remember exactly when

29
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,920
lunch was but maybe we the food had to be ready and

30
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:05,840
at the door of the meditation hall it's something like 12 15 or 12 20.

31
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,200
and then we had us and it was kind of you know hectic to get everything ready

32
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,720
but then one of the rules of one of the practices of the monastery

33
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,879
when you worked in the kitchen at noon exactly at 12 o'clock everyone had this all the cooks had to stop what

34
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:30,159
they were doing go in front of the kitchen altar and chant the heart sutra chant this

35
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,200
text and uh i would regularly since i was

36
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:41,200
supervising you know like be aghast no

37
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:48,560
we're never gonna get done we have all the stuff to do and just like 15 minutes before supposed to be served up no

38
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,920
and uh but you had to do it so which had the heart suit drop and always when we finished chanting

39
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,120
there was more time to get it done without fail and we you know we always

40
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,360
the meal was always ready but somehow the the sense of time

41
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:14,480
for me was very much tied up in how busy my mind was how much my mind was concerned with all

42
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,639
the things and the desires and the complications and my mind was crowded

43
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,160
and somehow that crowded impulse of the mind the pressure of the mind

44
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,240
you know i had a very different feeling about time then after chanting my mind got calm and

45
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,600
settled and there was more space in my mind more calm in my mind

46
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,440
and they just seemed like oh yeah we have time and somehow i don't know if we worked naturally faster or just it was

47
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,520
all an illusion in my mind but but we always had time so

48
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:56,000
in the years since then there have been times when i feel like i'm running out of time i'm too hectic too much to do

49
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,280
what am i going to do and don't know which foot to stand on because there's so much to do and i learned that if that happens

50
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,720
i just do one more thing and uh that seems impossible right which

51
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:15,600
is sit down to meditate and i'll meditate for 10 minutes and then when i come up suddenly oh

52
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:23,120
there's time i'll do this now and i'm still here and i've survived

53
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,160
and um so it always works out it's remarkable to do this

54
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:34,400
but i had no one waiting for me so it wasn't like you know you know i took the 10 minutes when

55
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,720
people are already up in the car ready for me to come you know that wouldn't make sense

56
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:47,520
but so time the sense of time our relationship time uh as a is a fascinating topic an

57
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,800
important topic because a lot of suffering that people have is directly or indirectly connected to

58
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,479
the topic of time and if we consider a little bit the nature of time

59
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:06,639
and how we will how we live in time and and often in subconscious ways

60
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:13,680
unconscious ways we'll start seeing our life in a different way

61
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,639
some people are time poor impoverished in time

62
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:26,479
because time is constantly slipping away they're running out of time they didn't have enough time so they ran out of time

63
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:32,880
for whatever they had to do or their time has deadlines and things you know and so

64
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,400
to have to finish before a certain time and uh and people are struggling with

65
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:45,520
these notions about time and part of it is the nature of in the industrial society when things

66
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:52,800
became started getting regimented and organized that people started to have to show up at

67
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,639
these factories at a particular time and and had to

68
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:04,080
have teams of people had to kind of be organized shifts and all kinds of things

69
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,440
and then with the industrial form kind of idea of scheduled time

70
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,960
there arose the idea of school time my understanding is that school time was

71
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,800
kind of modeled on the kind of what happened in factories and so then school time became very regime

72
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,639
originated i guess people didn't go to a lot of people didn't go to school before that or education happened in a different way

73
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,800
there was not so time centric you know and um

74
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,800
i remember when in high school the bell rang and leave the classroom and it was just like

75
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,800
this sea of humanity in the hallway you know jostling for their way to the next classroom and

76
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,400
but if you left the classrooms to go somewhere during class it was really peaceful in the hallways but you know

77
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:58,639
this this rhythm of the temporal rhythm that we were living and then that was

78
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:05,440
and uh and i don't know you know nowadays zen monasteries japan and america that are

79
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:11,280
very time centric i don't know if that was always the case i don't know when that started

80
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,240
the in the ancient times in zen

81
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,960
they knew when to end the morning meditation when the person who could see the bell

82
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:30,319
could look at their palm and see the lines in their pawn so that's a kind of a different

83
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,440
different kind of time than waiting for the clock to you know

84
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,839
clock hands to be in a certain position so you know so we've kind of lived in

85
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:48,080
time and the other day i was reading about um you know parts of our society now

86
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:55,200
are are running on nanoseconds you know the partial nanoseconds are so

87
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,240
the gps devices we many of us use right because many of us kind of depend on gps

88
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,760
devices gps devices with these satellites that are 12 000 miles

89
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,440
above the earth there so every day there's a time correction

90
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,279
because this nanosecond difference between those satellites the satellites of the time and the satellites and the

91
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:23,519
time that we live in and is all it needs to be in order for their measurements all work

92
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:30,720
has to be exactly the same time um and so these you know nanoseconds

93
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:37,360
partial point 10 nanoseconds or something the def of time difference has to be

94
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,480
corrected for 100 nanoseconds

95
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,080
well let's come down it's come down to that yeah i don't think in the time of the buddha they he thought much about

96
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:54,800
nanoseconds he had to worry about it so it's kind of remarkable but it's also

97
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:01,839
remarkable that i think that just in my lifetime how much time has become more and more of a

98
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,959
pressing thing an issue and an event and

99
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:13,200
that we live by and so it's easy to imagine that we become time poor we don't have enough

100
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,880
fine time and we wish we had more time

101
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:25,200
and some of it is that uh there's so much available to us and there's a kind of hunger for it and expectation we

102
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,240
should be able to get to everything that's made available to us

103
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,640
i still remember fondly all kinds of you know times in my life when i was young

104
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,519
of um looking back at it now

105
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:50,959
there was no internet there was no cell phones what did i do

106
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,480
you know you know i just wouldn't you know i'd go the whole day without checking for a

107
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:03,680
message on my phone is that legal or possible you know so but you know i

108
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,600
remember i have happy memories now i didn't think about it then but now uh

109
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,440
these many years later i actually have a visceral memory of walking around san francisco

110
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,720
with lots of time and uh the streets being compared to other traffic now

111
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,839
being much more spacious the things that you know the whole feeling of the city has

112
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:32,240
changed and um and that was one of the great values of

113
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,240
the monastery that all the different monasteries and retreat centers i was at i've been at

114
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,079
is how the the relationship to chime time changes so erratically

115
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:50,240
so that there's no time pressure very little time pressure even though there's crooks have to be

116
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,519
had things on time anyway so there was also lots of space lots of time

117
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:04,079
and there wasn't so much to do you know you weren't supposed to you know you'd have to check the internet and news and

118
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,839
and uh my kids watch tv programs on their their

119
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,959
computer and i'm just amazed how many there seems to be

120
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:20,880
i mean it's like you could spend your life watching new tv programs and not get to them all

121
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,160
that would be a sad life wouldn't it if you didn't get to get to them all

122
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,760
so the point being that there's so much to do that he can do and we're available to us

123
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:38,320
in a way that hasn't been available for people for until recent times it's a phenomenal thing to live in this world

124
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,600
so it takes some care to learn and navigate the world of time

125
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,440
to learn to navigate the world of all these possibilities that exist for us

126
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,959
and today's topic is time how to be time rich if you want to be rich

127
00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:01,040
be rich in time spacious time live in spacious time

128
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:07,200
not tight time contracted time

129
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:13,760
live in a kind of boundless time as opposed to a bounded time that's bounded by all the concerns and needs

130
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:21,160
and duties and responsibilities and uh

131
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:27,120
so one of the things i learned in the monastery was to live in time like this

132
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,920
schedule of things that had to be done at a certain time but do it within spacious time and so

133
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,680
the two don't have to be separate from each other there's a way to be relaxed calm and

134
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,959
fully engaged and you know it was working in the monastery sometimes it

135
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:52,320
was you know very engaging very active engaged work and there was a spacious time for it

136
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:59,680
sometimes time would kind of disappear because of the full engagement in what we're doing

137
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,880
so uh meditation

138
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:14,000
meditation is a wonderful reference point for discovering our relationship to time

139
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,120
and in many ways meditation is a time to do something very different than what we

140
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:25,680
usually do in our lives and then in that difference

141
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:31,040
i have the difference highlighted so if we're

142
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:37,199
always running around being busy and it's become second nature to do that

143
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:42,880
and then what's the problem that's what everyone else is doing too and then you sit down to meditate and

144
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:51,199
you feel the cost of that running around you feel the impact it has of a distracted mind a tense body

145
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:56,880
and uh and then in meditation because the contrast

146
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:03,440
then we can see the busyness in a way we couldn't do it when we're living in it to see it in a different way so

147
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,880
meditation is a reference point to understand ourselves and that's a different purpose than

148
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:16,000
thinking meditation is about becoming calm it's fine for it to be help you become calmer

149
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,279
but if that's the it's all about you're not going to become wise about how you

150
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:27,279
operate when you're not calm and if you use meditation little may start seeing the contrast the difference

151
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:33,360
to use it as a as a look a standard kind of to see really get to know yourself

152
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:40,720
better what's going on so when we first sit and meditate maybe not

153
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,240
first sooner or later most people will notice that their mind is

154
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:52,720
distracted and they they bring the mind back to their breath then they get distracted

155
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,000
again come back to the breath distracted

156
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:05,040
so to be to be distracted chances are you're living in time you're

157
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,720
caught up in time in some way so to ask yourself the question when

158
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,560
you're distracted from the present moment are you are you living are you thinking

159
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,839
about the past kind of living in the past thinking in the past

160
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:28,160
are you thinking about the future are you somehow actively distractingly

161
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:34,959
in thinking about the present maybe the present that's not here but someplace else

162
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:40,880
and uh or or you're thinking in kind of a mythic fictional time

163
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,959
you know fantasies can you know don't exist in time exactly they can just be a fantasy

164
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:53,920
um or you might be solving some wonderful problem that uh

165
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,959
or task or something writing the great great american novel in your head

166
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:05,120
and so that doesn't you know it's kind of like outside of time but so it's kind of i call it mythic time or fictional

167
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,558
time and which which is your tendency

168
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:16,480
which which is your default where do you tend to go in time when you get distracted

169
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:23,280
do you attend when you get distracted is it more often in the past is it more often in the future

170
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:29,600
is it more often about things happening in the present but not here and now is it more often do you get distracted

171
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,799
by what's actually happening here and now and

172
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:40,559
like you can sit here and meditate with a room full of people and just have your eyes closed you know you know

173
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,679
there are a lot of different kinds of masks that people are wearing right now i can't remember because my eyes are

174
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,960
closed let me see if i remember their color and their shape i wonder if someone had the ideal mask and i'll try

175
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,240
to remember which what that person had that kind of shape that's distracted thinking right but

176
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:02,640
it's about the present moment so where does your mind go what does it do

177
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,880
and if there's a pattern for you what does that tell you what does that say about you

178
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:15,520
if you're mostly thinking about the past what are the values what are the priorities what are

179
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:23,679
the desires what are the concerns that you have that keep bringing you back into the past

180
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:30,480
if it's mostly about the future what are their concerns what are the values what are the what is the

181
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:37,280
where's the what's the energy what is it about the future that keeps pulling you into the future

182
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:44,080
and so forth so forth for the other ones so to try to understand oneself deeper what's going on here

183
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:49,440
for the purpose of meditation uh knowing what it is that not just knowing

184
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:55,280
that you're thinking about that past future and so forth but to know you know oh my this is my

185
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:01,120
pattern and this is kind of what's driving the pattern

186
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:08,559
it helps you then to bring your mindfulness to something deeper than the distracted thought

187
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:14,400
if you're thinking about the past because you still feel hurt about what happened years ago

188
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:20,720
and you're trying to navigate and negotiate and figure out the hurt and who did what and who's to blame who's

189
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:27,760
responsible what you could have done and just reviewing it and reliving what happened a long time ago

190
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:33,679
maybe that hurt still festers and that hurt might need our attention

191
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:42,320
the hurt is always in the present moment and if we want to heal the hurt it's probably not going to be healed by

192
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:48,160
making a better past thinking about but rather to really meet the pain

193
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:54,400
and learn how to sit with that in present moment if we're thinking about the future

194
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:01,120
some people they think about the future because they're planning and they're you know anxious about the future

195
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,200
the anxiety is what needs our attention or maybe it's delightful anticipation i

196
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,559
know people who just seem to have a joy in anticipating things

197
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:17,919
and uh my son one of my sons was that way he would just like lay in bed and he'd be anticipating planning and it

198
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:23,120
seemed like that was like and what you know and sometimes he loved

199
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:31,360
like his little kid he loved like building a stage for play but the play would never happen

200
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:38,159
and that was besides the point it was just the building anticipating and that was that was so much fun and then he'd

201
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:44,240
build it and then he go on to do something else and uh so there's you know sometimes it's joy

202
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,679
that brings us into past and future and being distracted so that's nice

203
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:56,880
but if you if you bring your present moment attention into the joy and follow that back

204
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:03,919
to the source follow that back inside to what's going on that's a very different uh movement to

205
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:09,760
to arrive in the present moment then continually kind of batting away distracted thoughts and letting go and

206
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:15,120
coming back letting go and coming back because you're getting to the underlying source from which these distracted

207
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,400
thoughts are bubbling up from probably something that's close more intimate and more important and

208
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,519
closer to something value and you know really important about yourself

209
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,799
so that's one way meditation can be a reference point and and seeing understanding

210
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:36,480
what's going on with earth distracted thinking another thing about distracted thinking

211
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,080
is that um there's there's probably desires involved

212
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:48,400
in them that are time sensitive time concerns like and so what is that how does time

213
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:54,320
operate in the concern itself and uh

214
00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:00,000
so for example being anxious and planning in the future it's because something is again time bounded and i

215
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,880
have to get it done in a certain time and so let me think about ahead of time so i can do it fast enough or efficient

216
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:14,799
enough so so time comes into play but as we settle down more in meditation

217
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:22,960
then and we're no longer so distracted but here and present time can still be an operating concern

218
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,799
it could be that yeah i'm present but they better ring the bell you know when is this meditation going

219
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:34,880
to be over yes i've been present but i've been present long enough

220
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:40,799
you know and so um you know so there's there's maybe restlessness coming up

221
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:46,480
and that that's a you know and something wanting something to come to an end

222
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,480
and uh or it could be that we're trying to get concentrated or calm or something

223
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,559
and so there's an attainment focus about attaining something in the future

224
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:05,440
hopefully in the next minute or something but still it's like leaning into the future and operating on the

225
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,880
assumption that you have time in the future time and that you can kind of

226
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,640
navigate and try to attain something in the future and uh

227
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,799
and so time is operating again so we're kind of being we're making kind of being

228
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:29,679
i don't know if it's too strong a language you said but we're being led around by time or caught up in time

229
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:36,240
what happens if we don't have a future in meditation what happens if it's just about the

230
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,440
present moment so we would we would then no longer be

231
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:48,840
attaining anything because attaining is always in the future and uh so it's a little bit of a

232
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:56,000
fantasy and sometimes we do attain things we do get calmer so sometimes we can practice in such a way that good

233
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:03,679
things happen to us so it's not like we it's illegal to do it and impossible to do it but it is operating in time

234
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:10,480
and as the mind gets quieter sooner or later you'll notice that any concern with

235
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:16,720
about the future is a bit of a drag for the mind any concern for the future means the

236
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:22,159
mind is activated with with a certain activity of thinking

237
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:28,880
and that i think that's time involved and what's fascinating about this is we

238
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:35,440
start discovering how much we are the time belongs to a conceptual world

239
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,480
that we create at least the time that we experience

240
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,720
the time that we live in is a is a is born in our minds in how

241
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:52,240
our minds operate and it's not like a time is not like a

242
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:59,200
the time that we live in the time that we're operating under is not doesn't is not cost free it's not

243
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,559
like you know the air that's just always here for us

244
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:10,640
and we can just breathe and not have to think about it there's sometimes idea that time just exists

245
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:16,400
there's a big debate in philosophy does time exist does it not exist how does it exist what is time

246
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,760
independent of those kinds of concerns meditators can learn

247
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:27,600
as their mind gets quiet that the very we're very conceiving of

248
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,720
things dependent on time takes mental energy tends meant takes a

249
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:40,480
kind of mental work and if the mind is quiet enough we'll see that work as being agitating

250
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:46,480
if you're super agitated to begin with the level of agitation about the future

251
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:53,120
is so subtle that it's in consequence it doesn't mean anything like you can't give me a break

252
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,880
but when the mind is really quiet we start seeing that the activity of even cons

253
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:05,919
being concerned about a future takes work it's agitating it's ripples it's uh you

254
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:14,320
know on the on the surface of the the mines lake thinking about the past same thing

255
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:21,440
so then if you want to settle more we let go of past and future

256
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:28,960
and the way we do it in mindfulness practice you can just let go of it of course but one way is again always turning towards what's going on

257
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,400
and you know where's that work where's that pressure yes it feels like there's agitation or

258
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:40,240
very subtle pressure or little piece of stress having to do with this past and future

259
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,520
where is it now can i hold it can i bring my attention to it

260
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:52,960
so not let go of this first chance you have but keep coming back and feeling it and sensing it and one of the advantages

261
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,400
of doing that it's kind of like trying to bring you moving you back to the source to use a

262
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:05,039
kind of buddhist language and you're kind of following the stream back to the source

263
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:10,400
and you know what is that source are you following it back back and then

264
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,600
as the mind gets quieter it's fascinating that

265
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:21,120
even concern for any kind of subtle subtle

266
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:28,080
concern is where like if you're following your breath in breath any idea that there's an end to the out

267
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:34,480
breath is extra any idea that you know the beginning of

268
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:40,080
the outbreak just happened is extra

269
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:49,158
there's what happens when you're just with experience or breathing without a past and a future

270
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:55,120
it can be very peaceful it can be very settled

271
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,320
no past no future just this moment of the breathing as if as if kind of like

272
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:06,320
it's forever but of course it isn't forever but it becomes something else and becomes something else

273
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:12,480
but every every new thing is just itself just that moment

274
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,399
just the experience and they some people will say that

275
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:26,960
the moment of experience and time have become no different from each other but just this time just this

276
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,720
and uh so you can see that for example there i

277
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,880
start seeing it and eating a meal if you're eating quietly not talking or

278
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:46,080
on your device but just eating lifting a fork up to your mouth

279
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,440
you know it's it's kind of goal-oriented right you you're trying to get it up into the mouth

280
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:58,399
in you know in a timely way but uh what if there's no you know you're living just without in the past

281
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:03,440
in the future there's like infinite time for bringing

282
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,799
that fork up to your mouth it's qualitatively a different way of

283
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:15,039
experiencing eating than if part of the mind is so you know a very subtle part of the mind is

284
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:21,279
concerned about the results of the action of getting it up there to the mouth so you know

285
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:27,919
you can you know put in the mouth and put another mouthful of food on the fork quickly

286
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:34,159
just to and start starts being sensitive walking down the steps

287
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:41,840
each step each stepping is not without the past and the future

288
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:48,320
that becomes a as that becomes available that sense of that you can never do it i don't know if you

289
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:53,360
could ever do it 100 perfectly but that's not the point is to do it

290
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:58,720
perfectly the point is to see use that as a reference point you get a

291
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:06,799
sense oh just too close to the present just this and then we see oh there's still a little bit of greed or desire operating

292
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:13,120
for something to be different in the next moment or a little bit pressure to get to the bottom of the steps

293
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:20,880
as opposed to just walking down the steps just walking when eating just eating

294
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:27,279
but i have so many things to do i can't you know i can't just to walk down the steps you know i have all this

295
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:35,679
stuff that has to be done and have to get there quickly and and if i don't the sky will fall down and

296
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:43,039
just walking just this but i have to be ready and

297
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:50,399
just walking and it's possible you'll discover that if you're walking someplace

298
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:55,520
and you just walk without future in the past just this this activity is the

299
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:02,720
thing of the moment when you come to the next activity you're actually in a better space

300
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:08,640
to meet it take care of it be present for it then if you were hurried and came out of breath and you have all

301
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:15,519
these things to do and okay now i'm here now i have to do this quickly and so i can move on to the next thing

302
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:21,760
i've there's been times when i've started one thing and as soon as i start that thing which

303
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:28,399
i've been thinking about for a while to get to i'm already thinking about the next thing i have to do

304
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:34,240
or the next two things or three things i have to do and uh it's this momentum

305
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:40,640
this uh of the mind this habit formation of the mind to live in time to live concerned about

306
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:45,840
doing and getting and getting to the next what's in the future what's in the future

307
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:52,480
you know it's rather unfortunate how strong i can operate in some people's minds

308
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:59,679
so as we meditate we get to see all this and that's hopefully one of the one of the opportunities in meditation is to

309
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:06,000
really see your mind clearly and how it's living in time its relationship to time and how much you

310
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:14,320
can put down the time and quiet the cons the conceptualization the conceiving of time that we do

311
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:21,360
and one of the fascinating feelings you can get from all this is the feeling that

312
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:30,559
time always begins in the present that's where time begins

313
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:37,600
the past begins in the present

314
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:43,440
because we conceive of the past

315
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:49,039
in a few minutes we'll leave here and this talk

316
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:55,919
will only exist for you in how you conceive of it how you remember it how your mind construct

317
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:01,519
reconstructs it being here what it's like and

318
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:06,640
so when you leave out the door got the door the talk only exists in some kind of way

319
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:13,760
in your memory that that when this talk becomes the

320
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:19,279
past that past was born

321
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:24,480
here the past is born in the present that's a

322
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:31,039
very different idea that the linear movement from the future i know you know into the future looks

323
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:36,960
like it's a line that passes behind us and the future is ahead of us some cultures have the

324
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,880
future coming towards us and and we leave so the

325
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:49,760
but anyway so the uh but what happens if we understand that

326
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:56,080
time future time past begins in the present

327
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:01,360
if that's the case the present is the source

328
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:07,519
for all time past and future in a certain kind of way

329
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:14,960
and uh and if that's the case how are we going to be responsible

330
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:20,320
how are we going to be intimate how are we going to care for ourselves at that

331
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,838
important juncture this present moment where time begins

332
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,638
are we are we creating time as a gift are we creating time as

333
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:39,200
something that's useful and healthy for us and for others we are the creators of time at least for

334
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:44,560
our own minds we are the creators of the past the creators of the future in a certain kind

335
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:50,879
of way so it gives us a phenomenal vantage point phenomenal

336
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:58,960
potential to live in the world a very different way around time

337
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:06,320
and so if you feel harried by time if you feel in a hurry in the world of time

338
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:13,440
you've constructed that time that's been born in your mind

339
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:21,599
is that how is that what you want to have produced in your mind for the world is that your gift to the world

340
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:26,880
a hurried mind a harried mind what happens if you construct a

341
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:32,320
different time is there a timeless time is there

342
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:41,119
spacious time is there a way of holding the events of your life past future and present

343
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:45,838
in a wide open time

344
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:52,320
and that i think is one of the gifts of meditation is that

345
00:35:52,320 --> 00:36:00,320
because to the degree to which we can get calm in meditation it slows down the incessant

346
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:07,760
kind of rush of thoughts ideas constructions conceivings that the mind does

347
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:14,240
and one of those conceivings is the conceivings of around time and so you get a sense you get a feeling that time

348
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:21,119
is now opened up is more spacious and that

349
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:28,240
is a valuable place to take care it's a valuable place to

350
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:33,760
value to see it as important see it as a teacher

351
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:41,280
see it as reflecting on what is important to now and what and your role

352
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,559
in staying close to it and your role in losing it

353
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,599
and if you find yourself in a hurry

354
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,760
you've become attached to something there's no hurrying

355
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:06,480
without attachment but there can be

356
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:13,680
doing things fast without hurrying there can be doing things fast

357
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:20,400
without attachment but you can't hurry without there being attachment

358
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,920
so as we slow down in this becoming a more spacious time

359
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:31,200
we have then the opportunity to discover what these attachments are

360
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:37,440
and why do we live with these attachments why do we give them so much authority

361
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:44,240
why do we think that they're required and so necessary and so important

362
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:51,920
follow that back that idea back to the source where does that come from where does that arise from in you

363
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,760
what are the beliefs what are the deeper feelings and emotions

364
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:03,640
that give rise to the attachment that causes hurry

365
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:12,960
so there is time poverty

366
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:20,400
which i think has been growing for our modern society

367
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,920
more and more empowered people impoverished in time

368
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:33,320
and then there's being rich in time an abundance of time

369
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:40,480
that is only a moment away or you know we have to be faster these

370
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,640
days it's only a nanosecond away

371
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,838
abundance of time that's always here

372
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:06,320
so i hope that uh this gives you something to a little different than usual to

373
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:12,240
be curious about and consider and talk to your friends about and

374
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:19,920
and study your mind with may time become your friend

375
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:27,160
by you becoming friends time thank you

376
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,240
you
