1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,480
hello everyone hello and welcome

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,799
and um part of the value of our gathering

3
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:19,199
together for sunday mornings meditation and talk is the gathering together of a community

4
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,400
of people and this connection to community to others

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,000
human beings is an integral part of buddhist spirituality

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,920
that might easily be overlooked if the emphasis is uh too much on meditation

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,360
meditation where maybe we close our eyes and are kind of you know not

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,920
paying usually too much attention to the people around us

9
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,800
in the teachings of the buddha meditation clearly has an ethical

10
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,640
component or say it differently that meditation clearly

11
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,559
has a very important role for how we live our lives in relationship to

12
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:10,400
each other that an ethical life in buddhism

13
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:17,680
is arises out of a kind of um a sense of well-being

14
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:25,520
feelings of wholesomeness nourishment that is possible to feel for a human being

15
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,640
and so rather than starting with ethical principles

16
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:37,040
so much or if you'd like principles starting with a principle of

17
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,200
being attuned to one's own wholesomeness one's own inner will sense of well-being

18
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,320
subtleness and so part of meditation

19
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:55,680
is not only to become calm and peaceful but to

20
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:03,200
awaken inside of us a disposition that is free of ill will

21
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,520
that's free of any inclination to harm and that this position disposition

22
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:18,239
arises out of touching into something within that feels wholesome that feels

23
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,920
healthy that feels nourishing a certain way

24
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,640
so part of the function of meditation is to feel that nourishment it's not of course of course not easy to

25
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,400
do but but it's just interesting to know at least

26
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,160
that in the teachings of the buddha this is actually one of the purposes of meditation

27
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,640
so that then we can live our lives without the ill will we can live our lives with good will

28
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,640
live our lives with care because it's our disposition not because we're following rules that

29
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,720
we should do so so as we sit today perhaps uh

30
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,440
you can give yourself the benefit of the doubt perhaps you can somehow

31
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,840
go under the radar of the thoughts ideas that you might have

32
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,599
that you are somehow not able to access

33
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:26,400
an inner sense of wholesomeness or goodness or well-being

34
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:33,840
that sometimes is referred to as something within that's beautiful beautiful states that we have

35
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,680
that maybe all of us have access to something if we as i said go under the radar because we

36
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:49,120
have sometimes these very strong orientations that beliefs and preoccupations that

37
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,720
give us the message that no this is not possible not that kind of way

38
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,840
so assuming a meditation posture

39
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,959
and part of the

40
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:16,079
road to inner is wholesomeness assume a posture

41
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,160
that allows you to have some feeling of confidence

42
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,199
maybe some modicum of strength

43
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,199
some degree of

44
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:41,280
respect a posture of respect and it can be done in any posture at all

45
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,360
but maybe an adjustment that maybe maybe straightens the spine

46
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:54,680
opens the chest positions the head better

47
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,800
so those qualities might be a little bit more evident

48
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:09,759
or perhaps it has to do with the position of the hands letting the hands be in a position where

49
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,440
maybe they embody kind of confidence strength

50
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:29,600
and it helps very much to be rooted to be grounded here and now

51
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:36,720
the radar the messages we have that we are not wholesome not good

52
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:44,080
our message is kind of from the control tower when we're kind of swirling around in thoughts and ideas

53
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,520
swirling and feelings that are a little bit maybe disconnecting and disgrun

54
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,800
non-grounding so to take a few moments to ground

55
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:02,080
ourselves here taking a few long slow deep breaths

56
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:12,000
and as you exhale feeling the contact contact against the surface that holds up your body

57
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:22,400
as you exhale maybe imagine that you're getting firmly established

58
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,840
here and on that surface

59
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and then as you exhale to relax

60
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:49,520
you need any extra holding you have tension in your body

61
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:57,880
maybe so you can relax into that support of the surface that holds up your body

62
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,960
and then letting your breathing return to normal

63
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:21,360
and as you exhale with a normal exhale relaxing the muscles of your face

64
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,800
the forehead the eyes

65
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,160
the cheeks and the jaws

66
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:47,599
maybe there's even a way to relax your scalp as you exhale

67
00:07:52,879 --> 00:08:00,719
throughout throughout the day we can do so much work with the muscles of the face and the scalp

68
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:09,199
responding reacting to letting their face get have a break a

69
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,199
vacation

70
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,720
and on the exhale relaxing the shoulders

71
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,120
on the exhale relaxing the belly

72
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:49,360
and then for the next three breaths breathing intimately closely

73
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,120
but allowing on the exhale for your thinking mind

74
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,839
to also relax

75
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:19,320
relaxing any tension or holding or pressure associated with thinking

76
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,279
and for the next three breaths staying close and intimate with

77
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:41,440
breathing see if you can also if it's easy enough

78
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,760
if you can recognize it to relax the pressure

79
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,240
around any emotions you might be feeling

80
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,959
any tension connected to them

81
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,959
and then settling in more with your breathing

82
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,240
can you also notice

83
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:07,120
any place within where you feel wholesome

84
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:13,680
healthy where there's a feeling of inner goodness or

85
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,560
well-being

86
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:26,519
or when you do feel such things where in your body do you tend to feel it

87
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:43,839
and if there is a place in the body that you associate with inner wholesomeness or goodness

88
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,720
as you breathe you might gently breathe

89
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,399
with that place so you're aware of both breathing and

90
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,000
the location of your goodness

91
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,160
or you might breathe through it

92
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,760
and if possible stay close

93
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,200
to your inner goodness as you sit here

94
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,440
part of the reason to let go of thoughts is to be under the radar of

95
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:42,720
the beliefs ideas the concerns of the thoughts so you can be more here and present

96
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,920
for your inner well-being

97
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:43,720
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

98
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:49,919
to again

99
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:56,399
is there now some degree of well-being

100
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:04,320
or inner disposition towards that which is wholesome within

101
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,639
and if there is

102
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:20,559
to imagine yourself living closely connected to this

103
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:28,640
maybe it takes the form of a disinclination to ill-will hostility

104
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:36,480
may be an inclination to become have a healthy concern for the

105
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:43,919
impact your behavior has on others to not cause harm or pain

106
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:53,840
perhaps it's an inclination for good will

107
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:01,600
for simple friendliness and care for compassion and love

108
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,840
may it be that our meditation

109
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,720
frees us from any disposition that's hostile

110
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:23,760
of ill will and establishes in us a disposition of

111
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:30,480
good will and may that good will

112
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:37,598
travel in no in insane in unseen ways out into the world

113
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:47,760
so the benefits of this meditation practice extend outwards to others

114
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:53,358
may all beings be happy

115
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:59,200
may all beings be safe

116
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:05,280
may all beings be peaceful

117
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:11,400
may all beings everywhere be free

118
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:24,820
[Music]

119
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:31,520
so before giving the talk here

120
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,480
excuse me for a moment

121
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:42,160
so before giving the talk i would like to make a few announcements

122
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:48,480
the one is i don't think i've said this here on sunday that a few weeks ago we

123
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,920
had a little big fundraising drive for a couple of days for

124
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:59,599
haiti after the the earthquake there

125
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:06,720
and um and we raised money for a non-profit that does grassroots work

126
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:13,200
there working in partnership with local healthcare workers and

127
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,240
and they're called partners in health and it was delightful that

128
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:24,960
we raised about 32 000 dollars for that and that i'm confident can make a difference

129
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:31,280
for the people of haiti in the communities where the partners in health goes in and partners with people

130
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:38,800
so that was very nice and the other is that um

131
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:47,119
we're beginning to think again about ways of opening imc

132
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:53,760
maybe in october and maybe with more

133
00:37:53,760 --> 00:38:00,400
restrictions on it than we had were planned originally in august and um

134
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:07,599
so maybe fewer people and and proof of vaccination and things like that

135
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:13,280
and that um so i thought that for those of you who are interested especially the local

136
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,960
people we could have a community meeting about this on april 4th on um

137
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:26,000
on october 4th um so and it's a ways away but uh

138
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:33,440
and then next week i won't be here i'm teaching a retreat for the next two weeks and so for next week i'm happy that max

139
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,640
erdstein one of the teachers here at imc will come and give the talk and

140
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:45,119
i'm delighted that max will uh be able to do that he he had a baby in um

141
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:50,560
i think in april so he's been a little bit uh not teaching so much

142
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:56,320
but he's ready to do some teaching and so he'll be here next next

143
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:05,599
sunday so for the talk i've been thinking some this

144
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:11,760
week about an important discourse of the buddha called the kalama suta

145
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:17,760
and it's one of the more well-known sutas in the west

146
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:23,680
and um and the buddha kind of teaches i think kind of brilliantly in this text

147
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,720
and they're taking his audience the kalama people on a journey

148
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:35,760
i think of it as a four or five step journey where he reframes their question to him

149
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:41,680
in a sense he reframes it by turning away from abstract questions of

150
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:47,359
abstract questions of truth and falsehood and and questions of who is it that speaks

151
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:53,599
the truth and who is it that speaks the falsehood to um directing people's attention inward to

152
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:59,760
themselves uh with ethical principles of attention

153
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,359
and then applying that in their behavior and then

154
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:11,119
leading it into pointing to the absence of ill will and

155
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:17,760
the presence of good will so it goes from kind of buddha talks about kind of principles

156
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:23,359
to behavior to inner dispositions and so it's kind of leading the audience

157
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:28,960
through this and so it begins by the buddha visiting this

158
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:34,319
country where the kalama people live and they've had a lot of spiritual

159
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:41,040
teachers visiting and they're perplexed by them because they all seem to say things

160
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:47,280
like i'll quote the text um

161
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:54,000
they say um

162
00:40:54,079 --> 00:41:01,760
they explain and elucidate their own doctrines but disparage denigrate and deride and

163
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,880
denounce the doctrines of others so they champion their teachings but they

164
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:14,160
criticize dramatic terms the doctrine of others um

165
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:20,880
and uh so and they say we're perplexed and have doubt they're all saying the same thing that we teach what's true and

166
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,319
other people are all wrong and so they asked the buddha

167
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:31,440
which of them speaks the truth and which of them speak falsehoods

168
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:36,720
it's a question about what is true and what is false and

169
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:42,560
and so so the buddha i guess he doesn't want to be just one more person that champions

170
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:49,839
his doctrine and certainly doesn't want to denigrate anybody else so but what he does is he changes the if

171
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:56,640
he reframes the conversation uh he doesn't actually answer their question directly

172
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:01,680
about who speaks the truth and who's false he first says uh

173
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:07,200
what you should not rely on in deciding what is true

174
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:13,280
and then he points to how you can know something for yourself

175
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:19,839
and he doesn't say it's the truth exactly but maybe it's implied but you'll see for yourself and when i

176
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:24,880
go through this and so when the buddha responds and says yes

177
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:32,160
it's reasonable you should be perplexed and have doubt given that all these people are coming making claims and then

178
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:38,079
criticizing others and um and uh but here's something you should

179
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:43,359
be careful for don't re these are some things you should not rely on

180
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:49,599
in in order to rely on these things these are kind of spiritual sources of authority common

181
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:55,119
ones for many people that they take these sources as providing some access to the truth

182
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:00,319
and the buddhist says don't don't rely on these and after a number of scandals

183
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:06,079
and challenges in western buddhism here in the united states there

184
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:14,400
was a wonderful zen teacher named yvonne rand who's now passed away and um she was i had a very strong

185
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:19,520
orientation towards uh being ethical and addressing the ethical

186
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:26,720
unethical behavior and that was going on in buddhism at that time and she once said that these uh

187
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:33,440
this little what i'm going to read you now she said it's kind of dramatic uh tattooed on the in the inside of

188
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:38,800
people's eyelids she wanted everyone to know this really well

189
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,839
um

190
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:52,960
so he says do not go

191
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:58,560
by oral tradition oral tradition because it was all oral oral tradition back then there was no

192
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:05,040
books but i guess don't go by the traditional teachings in books or because it's uh the tradition these

193
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:09,838
particular teachings don't go by traditional teachings

194
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:16,720
or by the lineage of teaching so if you're in a particular lineage of teachings in particular

195
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:23,520
organization religion denomination just because it's part of that lineage

196
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:30,319
don't just accept it as a tr by the just automatically by that don't go by hearsay just because you've

197
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:36,079
heard it around and maybe it sounds good don't depend on hearsay

198
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:41,200
don't uh by a collection of scriptures so don't because because it's in that's

199
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:47,440
a scriptures that are particularly important for you or your tradition the fact that it's in scriptures doesn't

200
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:54,000
make it mean that it's true and don't go by logical

201
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:00,480
reasoning so to establish what's really most valuable at least from the buddhist point of view

202
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:05,680
don't go because it seems reasonable or logical don't construct a logical

203
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:11,760
argument for it and don't go by inferential reasoning

204
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:18,480
kind of intuition for example and by reason cognition more of the same

205
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:24,000
thing and and by some kind of acceptance of it

206
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,599
just because you've thought it out all kind of similar kind of kind of mental

207
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:34,720
kind of consideration or

208
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:41,839
by the seeming competence of a speaker just because someone has charisma or seems confident or seems

209
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:48,480
very convincing in how they are that's not a reason to accept something

210
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:54,960
and then finally uh don't accept it don't rely on

211
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:01,520
the ascetic is our guru just because someone you think is because oh because my person is my

212
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:06,800
teacher i should accept it so all always be very careful don't

213
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:12,720
accept naively or simplistically these other these sources

214
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:18,400
it's not a rejection of those sources but rather that's not that you might get

215
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:24,240
ideas uh you might get encouragement inspiration uh things to think about

216
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:31,040
from all these sources but they are not the place to find out what is true

217
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:36,720
now the buddha doesn't actually talk about what's true he doesn't use that language but now he um

218
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:42,960
he talks about principles of what you should go by and

219
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:48,480
he says but

220
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:56,079
but when you know for yourselves these things are unwholesome

221
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:01,440
these things are blameworthy these things are criticized by the wise

222
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:08,720
these things if accepted and undertaken lead to harm and suffering then you should abandon them

223
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:15,520
so um when they're uh when they're in the word for things here can mean action when

224
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:20,640
there's activities that you do that involve that are unwholesome that

225
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:26,720
you can feel they they make you feel bad they

226
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:32,000
deflate you they somehow feel unhealthy in doing them

227
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,359
then uh uh don't do them you should abandon them when uh

228
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:44,480
they're blameworthy and exactly what that means we don't know but if they seem unfair or injust

229
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:51,040
abandon them and then they're criticized by the people who are wise which means

230
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:56,240
take into account the people who you respect

231
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:03,200
and maybe they know something that you don't know maybe they had more experience or something so here we're really it says

232
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:08,559
here when you know for yourself but here we're lying a little bit on

233
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:14,960
other people um those people who are wise and what that means

234
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:22,480
is not relying on them on what's true but relying a little bit to be careful about how we act in the world

235
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:28,000
and and then if you know for yourself that these things

236
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,200
if accepted and undertaken lead to harm and

237
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:38,240
suffering so the idea is we don't want to do anything that has the consequences as

238
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:44,480
harm either to ourselves or to others but then he goes and says the opposite

239
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:49,520
um uh if you know for yourself

240
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:54,720
these things are wholesome these actions these actions are blameless

241
00:48:54,720 --> 00:49:01,280
these actions are praised by the wise these if accepted and undertaken lead to

242
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:08,240
welfare and to happiness so that's the principle he's offering so it's a principle of your own

243
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:14,559
evaluation with the help of the wise people that's only one of four or five criteria

244
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:20,960
and so here the emphasis now is on what you undertake the actions we do

245
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:27,040
so the buddha now switches the conversation from the question which is about truth and

246
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:35,280
falsehood to action behavior and this is a indicates an orientation the buddha has

247
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:42,079
he's often certainly disinclined to get involved in controversies around what is true and false

248
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:47,599
so you're not getting involved in the the question that was asked but he's pointing people to

249
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:53,760
a behavior to their actions and he's talking about principles for which to evaluate your actions

250
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:59,359
and there are consequential there's two things about them that i would emphasize

251
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:04,400
one is the um that there's a reference point to what

252
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:10,240
feels wholesome inside what feels that has a goodness or a rightness to it

253
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:15,280
it maybe shouldn't be the only criteria but certainly we want to avoid what

254
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:20,400
feels unhealthy to do a kind of inner sense of when well-being is

255
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:25,440
diminished as we do these things and then also where it involves

256
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:33,520
consequential thinking do these things lead to harm and suffering do they lead to

257
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:38,640
to benefit to welfare and to happiness and so it involves some reflection some

258
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:45,599
thinking some based on experience perhaps where we have some sense of the harm that this thing or the benefit that

259
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:52,079
comes and the text does not specify to who so it could be either to oneself or to

260
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:58,319
others and we are meant to be they are custodians of our own well-being

261
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:03,359
and being careful not to harm other human beings this is a

262
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:08,880
central orientation principle of the buddha's teachings and i probably can't underscore enough

263
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:14,319
how central and important this is so here he's bringing it up

264
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:21,040
and then because he's talking about behavior he then applies it to

265
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:28,800
particular forms of behavior which we can understand is the four first four of the five precepts

266
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:35,599
um um we also go zonda says well he applies it not to a behavior

267
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:43,119
first but rather to mine states and the behavior that comes from mind states and he says is greed wholesome or

268
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:50,559
unwholesome is hatred ill will wholesome or unwholesome is delusion wholesome or unwholesome

269
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:57,760
and the answer is that great hatred and delusion is unwholesome that it harms the person who has them

270
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:04,160
there's something unhealthy about the presence of greed in the

271
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:10,559
person who's greedy it's often invisible because greed is so focused on the object of what we want

272
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:16,160
people are not paying attention to what it feels like to be greedy with ill will or hatred same thing

273
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:21,200
people are often focused on what they dislike and so they're not

274
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:27,040
noticing the effect it has on them but it's considered unhealthy

275
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:32,240
and uh if we act out of that then that is also un-wholesome

276
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:37,680
so an example he gives is if we kill steal

277
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:43,839
engage in sexual misconduct or lie

278
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:51,760
based on greed or based on anything that's unwholesome and those things should not be done

279
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:57,599
so they lead to harm but if we analyse analyze or evaluate

280
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:02,960
the situation that this is wholesome we recognize the goodness in it

281
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:09,359
and that it doesn't lead to harm then we do it but

282
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:15,680
jumping around a little bit he does the same analysis with non-greed non-hatred non-delusion

283
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:21,119
and so non-non-greed is not

284
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:26,880
only the absence it's a wholesome state he asks them is non-greed wholesome and

285
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:33,680
they say it's wholesome the kalamas do so this kind of care and sensitivity this

286
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:40,319
might seem abstract it might seem kind of theoretical or principle based it is little bit

287
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:46,079
principles but they're principles that are meant to be oriented towards an inner sensitivity

288
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:53,119
an inner capacity to feel and sense for oneself what is healthy and what is not healthy

289
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:59,440
what harms ourselves and what does not harm ourselves what is beneficial for

290
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:06,400
ourselves and what is not beneficial and this kind of capacity for clearly

291
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:13,200
being present being mindful is something we're training ourselves to do in the mindfulness tradition

292
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:20,480
and this training to be present and be mindful as we go through our day has this ethical component because as we

293
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:26,800
are more and more mindful in the present moment we have access to these feelings the sensations inside

294
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:32,319
of what has an ouch and what has an ah in it we

295
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:40,319
kind of feel we become we become our own reference point our own guide for what kind of behaviors to do

296
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:46,720
that supports us then to avoid greed and stay close to non-greed avoid hate

297
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:54,559
and stay close to non-hate avoid delusion and stay close to non-delusion this is the

298
00:54:55,200 --> 00:55:02,720
the direction that buddha is going as we do this as we do this kind of care and attention to

299
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:09,599
the present moment experience that arises within us of wholesome and unwholesomeness as we pay attention to

300
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:15,838
the presence of mind that allows us to pay attention to the

301
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,280
to consequences this then tends to lead people

302
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:27,760
to living without ill will to live unconfused

303
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,799
and to live um with kind of clear comprehension of what's happening

304
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:39,440
so the buddha now is leading the columbus and he evokes this based on living this way

305
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:44,640
then there is this non-confusion

306
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:50,480
there is clear comprehension and a lack of ill will

307
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:57,359
with those three states strong the buddha then moves into

308
00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:04,079
being rooted in good will rooted in compassion rooted in

309
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:10,559
appreciative joy and rooted in equanimity and these are these inner dispositions

310
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:16,160
that can arise from wholesome states of being

311
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:22,319
um and uh and and so and these are dispositions they're social dispositions

312
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:29,200
or social emotions they're how we relate to other people we relate to them with goodwill

313
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:34,400
or when it's when it's appropriate with compassion when it's appropriate with appreciative

314
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:40,799
joy feeling joy appreciating their success in other people's happiness

315
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:46,880
and with a certain kind of love or care called equanimity which is to be caring

316
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:52,400
for people but to do so without being caught up with with

317
00:56:52,400 --> 00:57:00,000
any reactivity any reactivity around it and um so um

318
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:07,440
so we have this journey the kalamaz ask about truth and false

319
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:13,280
and who has it the buddha answers differently than the questions been asked

320
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:18,799
he says he focuses on what you can know for yours yourself

321
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:25,440
he describes the principles for how of what is what's useful to know for yourself

322
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:33,839
and especially the idea of wholesomeness and leading to harm and suffering

323
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:41,440
he then asks this question about greed hatred and delusion these inner dispositions

324
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:47,119
towards create hatred and delusion and help people to recognize that these are unhealthy

325
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:54,480
and that behavior that comes from them is also unhealthy and then he does it for the opposite and

326
00:57:54,480 --> 00:58:00,400
this is all kind of turning the attention in towards oneself so he's not answering abstractly

327
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:06,720
philosophically but he's kind of pointing them inwards and i see this as a progressive talk almost like a guided

328
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:13,200
meditation if you will encouraging his audience to recognize this in them these things in

329
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:19,680
themselves and if they do this well that leads to

330
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:26,079
a state where there's no ill will and there's no confusion anymore about what to do and not to do

331
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:34,319
because it's a we have clear criteria for avoiding harm and doing good

332
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:40,559
and then there's clear comprehension there's a clear sense of presence and attent attentiveness

333
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:46,880
to what we're doing not just mindfulness but a mindfulness where we just be aware of something but

334
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:53,440
a wise understanding about behavior and action and impact of what

335
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:59,760
we're doing that leads to a disposition and exactly how it leads to it the

336
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:06,480
buddha doesn't explain to these things that are highly valued in the early buddhist tradition

337
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:13,200
which is good will compassion sympathy appreciative joy and equanimity

338
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:18,720
and so one of the things i want to highlight in this discussion is that

339
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:24,160
uh in in switching the focus from truth and falsehood

340
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:30,079
the buddha offers central teachings core teachings of what he wants to emphasize

341
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:37,040
and all of these could be in western terms be considered ethical they have to do with how we behave in

342
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:43,920
relationship to ourselves and our relationship to others how we behave in our mind how we behave in our behavior

343
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:50,640
physical and verbal behavior and so there's so such a central feature of the buddhist teachings

344
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:56,559
has to do with how we get transformed so we live in the world

345
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:03,200
in a beneficial way that the transformation that buddhism looking looking for is not just to make

346
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:10,720
people who are peaceful and calm and free for themselves and they go off in

347
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:17,680
kind of an enlightened retirement and have nothing to do with the world anymore but rather the whole enterprise is

348
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:24,559
couched contextualized in in in being ethical in nature

349
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:29,599
or if you don't like the word ethics it's contextualized

350
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:36,079
in the healthy relatedness that we can have have with the world around us the people around us

351
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:44,079
and it's not a practice and a goal that is only to benefit oneself

352
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:49,440
it's a goal and practice that's there to benefit self and others and both self

353
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:54,640
and others that's one of the so this is my reading of the buddhist

354
01:00:54,640 --> 01:01:00,160
teachings is one of the really central components of it and this kalamazoota

355
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:07,760
is a wonderful text both because of the challenge it is to us about what we use

356
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:13,280
to rely on to know what is true and the buddha's

357
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:20,559
brilliant way in which he turns that towards avoiding questions of truth and falsehood and rather focusing on

358
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:26,319
behavior and if you follow through on what the buddha is teaching here

359
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:31,839
all really thoroughly not only is it beneficial for the world around us does it lead to

360
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:38,000
a disposition ethical disposition it also brilliantly if you do carefully

361
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:43,359
leads to awakening to the spiritual liberation that the buddha also champions

362
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:51,280
these two are not separate they're closely connected intertwined to each other

363
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:59,440
so thank you and um and uh this kalamazoo is found in the numerical

364
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:05,359
discourses of the buddha in the chapter three and um

365
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:13,400
and it's a delightful text so thank you all very much
