1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:09,440
so welcome to our Friday and end of this week on

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,679
the instructions on mindfulness of the

3
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:22,039
body and uh strictly speaking the way that I was taught mindfulness in Burma

4
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:27,960
at the place called the mahasi center the

5
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:37,040
um we weren't practicing exactly mindfulness of the body that wasn't precisely the description more precisely

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,480
we were practicing sensory awareness there was

7
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:50,000
a referencing almost everything you experienced to how the how how it was

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,399
felt in the body in terms of Sensations and uh it was a wonderful

9
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:04,680
Adventure because so many of things that go on even even thinking which the thinking itself might

10
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,880
be disembodied but uh uh the process of

11
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:18,040
thinking the energy of thinking the the pressure of thinking can have a physical

12
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:25,520
component emotions uh we probably wouldn't even know what emotions we're having unless

13
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:34,438
they were somehow connected to our body and uh Body Sensations that we

14
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,960
feel and uh and so to refer everything back to the body to the sensations that

15
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:49,240
U make it up now

16
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:58,240
um today ID like to offer you a little different uh way of

17
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:05,079
practicing um what we taught so far this

18
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:15,400
week and that is to uh have a centering or a a home base in the

19
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,519
breathing but you don't have to stay there for very long don't feel like you

20
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:26,840
have to kind of develop concentration on the breathing for this exercise but rather it's the default you

21
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:33,519
come back to it regularly and maybe maybe it's only three or four breaths it could be longer

22
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:41,440
if it's enjoyable to do so and then you let the awareness take

23
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,800
in some sensation in your body perhaps the strongest sensation in your body or

24
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:54,319
if you've already recognized that a few times to recognize something else whatever one one way to do it is just

25
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:02,400
whatever comes to you if you open your awareness to the body what what sensation come into

26
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,840
view and um and then know them feel them like you we exercise a few days ago like

27
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:17,239
feeling the hand feel that place of your body take it in but in both of these the

28
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:23,840
breathing and the sensations see if the the thinking mind

29
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,879
can be quiet enough that it's not projecting projecting its ideas on

30
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:37,560
what's happening ideas can give rise to a feeling of permanence or constancy or

31
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,720
but if we can feel or sense instead make a sensory awareness exercise out of it

32
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:50,480
then with the breathing you'll see that there's a a flow or Kaleidoscope of

33
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,239
different Sensations that come and go on inhales and exhales the sensations of

34
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:03,439
inhale are different than those of the exhale and to kind of just take those in

35
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:10,840
and then when you bring your attention to some other part of your body then um see if you can be quiet

36
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:17,600
enough in the mind calm enough enough that you can start becoming aware of how those

37
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,720
Sensations are also um Dynamic that they are coming in

38
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:31,639
and out of appear they appear and disappear come in and out of awareness they move they shift they dance um it's

39
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:36,720
fascinating to get really clear or Lucid

40
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,960
awareness of some strong sensation and see that it's not constant it's kind of

41
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:50,919
flowing and moving and jumping around in all kinds of ways and

42
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:57,199
uh and uh and then the way to move between the

43
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:03,680
breath and something else then back to the breath and something else in the body back to the breath is to do so in a

44
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,120
very calm flowing way like uh like you're just kind of moving in a relaxed

45
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,800
way natural way between them and the the the reference point

46
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:23,360
that I like for that is if you have if your eyes are looking at something anything maybe her mountain or the sea

47
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:30,360
or a river going by or something in your room and your your eyes are just roaming

48
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:38,400
gently landing on something and then floating away to the next thing landing on floating away and there's a ease or

49
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,639
relaxation in how awareness flows and here we're flowing to the breathing then

50
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,759
flowing to a body sensation flowing to the breathing and feeling maybe three or

51
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:56,280
four breaths and then the length of time that you're with those that breathing uh when

52
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,720
you flow to a body sensation you're with maybe maybe that's that's all the length of time you're

53
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:09,720
there and if it's a painful sensation knowing that you're just doing this briefly can be very helpful because you

54
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:16,520
don't have to get stuck on it or reactive to it just oh just tapping in kind of like just being present for it

55
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:24,080
like touching it with a soft cotton ball just oh I'm here a few breaths feeling it and then

56
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:31,400
going back to the breathing so assuming a meditation posture

57
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,520
and gently closing your

58
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:47,039
eyes and becoming more established here and now in your

59
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,120
body by taking some long deep

60
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
breaths

61
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:13,599
and then to let your breathing return to

62
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:20,879
normal But continuing maybe on the inhale feeling tension holding in your

63
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:26,080
body and the exhale relaxing the

64
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
body

65
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
for

66
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:18,840
and then settling into how the body experiences

67
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:31,240
breathing and the areas of your body where breathing occurs

68
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,560
there too as you exhale relax that whole area

69
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,240
soften the breathing

70
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
process

71
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:10,600
and then to begin the practice of

72
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,560
today maybe you can do a three breath

73
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:24,760
Journey staying with the breathing closely and in a friendly soft

74
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:31,519
way and then to after those three or four breaths

75
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:39,240
too let your awareness be relaxed and open to or receive the

76
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:45,160
strong sensation in your body or some sensation in your body and

77
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,240
feel that for three or four

78
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:01,120
breaths and then returning to your breathing

79
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:07,279
and if that is too fast for you you can stay with your breathing longer and stay

80
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:14,240
with the sensations longer but track yourself so that you don't get caught in thoughts

81
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:22,320
or reactive so the awareness

82
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:28,040
stays soft

83
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
light

84
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
for

85
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
e

86
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
for

87
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
for

88
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
for

89
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
for

90
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
e

91
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
for

92
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
for

93
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:40,160
and then continue with going back and forth between breathing and Sensations in your

94
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:50,920
body but as long as it's comfortable to stay with one you feel like you're well connected

95
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:59,639
and not becoming distracted stay with the breathing or

96
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,440
stay with the

97
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:14,079
sensations maybe until there's a Clarity to know that now

98
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:19,800
it's time to switch something else needs the attention

99
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:27,360
now back to the breathing back to some

100
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,519
sensation

101
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
for

102
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,960
maybe it's not that the Mind moves attention moves

103
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:37,840
which is a metaphor anyway but rather that

104
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:50,360
awareness doesn't move it just receives sometimes it receives

105
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:54,000
breathing sometimes

106
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
Sensations

107
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,679
so the mind is soft and

108
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
relaxed

109
00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:01,960
and when the thinking mind becomes quieter so we we can sense more fully or

110
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:08,480
deeper see if you can notice how Sensations are

111
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,559
changing shifting

112
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:22,760
moving pulsing flickering in and

113
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
out

114
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
for

115
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
e

116
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:05,320
for and if it's easy

117
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:15,200
enough let go relax any holding or

118
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:25,760
fixating of attention any contraction or pressure

119
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:31,400
tension in the mind espe esally in relationship to breathing or Sensations

120
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:38,840
doing this practice when you switch from breathing

121
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:43,000
to Sensations Sensations to

122
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:51,200
breathing let it be a welcome occasion to let

123
00:21:52,960 --> 00:22:00,039
go let go of any holding or fixation

124
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
for

125
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
e

126
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
for

127
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
e

128
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
e

129
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
e

130
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:32,360
and then coming to the end of the

131
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:36,840
sitting as if the curtains are

132
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:47,200
pulled let your awareness now take in be aware of the wider

133
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:52,960
world with an awareness with an

134
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:05,640
attention which is relaxed and peaceful as possible easeful attention for the

135
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,240
world gaze upon the world with Good

136
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:31,360
Will wishing that the practice of mindfulness that

137
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:38,880
you're doing will benefit the people in your

138
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:47,720
life people in your communities your society and the whole

139
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:56,600
world and may it be that all of us here in this meditation

140
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:03,159
collectively benefit a few people even in small

141
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:12,279
ways on this day and so collectively we have a huge

142
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:18,200
effect on the world spreading care goodness

143
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:26,520
generosity may all beings be

144
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:34,679
happy may all beings be

145
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:42,278
safe may all beings be

146

[Music] free

148
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:17,629
thank [Music]

149
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,440
you

150
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,320
e

151
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:49,640
so my friends so this is the last talk on this

152
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:56,679
having to do with instructions on mindfulness of the body and next time will be mindfulness

153
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:02,679
of emotions the um I was reminded Yesterday by

154
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:08,679
someone that she had asked me many years

155
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:15,200
ago for some books to read on Buddhism and I had told her that the

156
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:22,640
only book she needed to read was the book of her own body and um apparently this was made a

157
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:28,279
very good impact on this woman this prct this practitioner

158
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:36,399
um and uh so the idea that our body is a book

159
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:42,840
to study the body is has information has wisdom everything you need to know about

160
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:48,919
Buddhism can be found in your own body and the meditation practice that I

161
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:56,679
did in Burma that when I was really learned this bipasa practice was as I've said was was a

162
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:01,760
sensory awareness practice more than anything else certainly we were mindful

163
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:09,159
of the mind and mind States and mind activity but there was this default to always feel and sense how it is

164
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:17,200
physically the S sensory level of it and part of the advantage of that is that

165
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:25,159
um Sensations are not thoughts thoughts and ideas and stories and Concepts is

166
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:32,080
often where we live or or it's often the filter through which we see our experience and so we see things a little

167
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:37,320
es skew because of those ideas we have those Concepts and even Simply Having a

168
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:42,880
concept of something the concept can have a kind of enduring quality a

169
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,080
concept is like platonic concepts are unchanging and so there's a kind of

170
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:55,200
feeling that things can and if we see through that filter it can feel like oh nothing changes and so if you see your

171
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:01,880
friend um always in through the filter of some difficult experience you had 10

172
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:07,639
years ago then you're not seeing how the friend is changing or different every

173
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:14,600
day or every occasion and every minute and every hour but you're suck in that that lens

174
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:21,360
that perspective so to begin meditation where we begin quieting and calming the mind

175
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:27,600
and settling in and getting somewhat concentrated or still that it's not the purpose of not

176
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:33,600
just to become calm but rather to be able to have a kind of more Lucid

177
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:40,159
awareness of the sensations of our of our direct experience unmediated by

178
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:46,519
these Concepts Concepts ideas might still come into play they might be there as part of

179
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:53,720
the bigger picture but they're not the lens through which we're seeing and we're able to perceive or to

180
00:32:53,720 --> 00:33:01,480
feel much more directly the direct sensory experience experience and uh and then to begin

181
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:08,200
seeing how that is Shifting and moving the seeing the inconstant impermanent

182
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:14,120
shifting changing nature of Sensations has two major benefits that I can think

183
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:20,159
of one is that um

184
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:29,200
um that uh the tendency to fixate on

185
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:35,399
something uh has usually a lot to do with holding things in kind of permanence or thinking things are

186
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:41,679
permanent or trying to make them permanent trying to make things as they are and there's when things are shifting

187
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:47,000
and moving it's it's more likely like we realize we can't quite grab them or hold

188
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,600
on to them or kind of begin relaxing the grip and this is one of the reasons why

189
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:59,399
breathing is so relaxing for some people is that the rhythm of breathing in and out it's constantly shifting and

190
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:05,519
changing and it's settling it's opening and it's a kind of focal point for the

191
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:11,878
mind not to get tight or or straining as it might be with it when it's thinking

192
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:19,040
about plans or resentments or desires or hostilities we have uh when thinking

193
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:24,638
about things from the perspective our conceit and so to begin loosening up the

194
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:30,040
ways in which we're stuck by breathing helps things to relax so the same thing

195
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:37,200
with the sensations of the body if we start feeling difficult Sensations pain for example as shifting and changing

196
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:43,800
Sensations then the extra added layer of lens of reactivity of judgments or fears

197
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:50,398
or projection into the future it's always going to be like this begins to soften and relax as

198
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:58,359
well and so that's one advantage is that um uh it's easier to be to relax to let

199
00:34:58,359 --> 00:35:04,599
go and to kind of just be with this the river of change within us the second

200
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:09,880
benefit is that when we're just at that sensory awareness level of our

201
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:15,520
experience the sensation level um we're not again we're not

202
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:22,160
imposing our desires we're not imposing our expectations or our Concepts or

203
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:28,880
ideas and so it gives more room for those Sensations to to be

204
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:34,960
themselves uh uh if um if we're tense in some way or say like I'm angry and I'm

205
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,640
making a fist If I Stay it's looking at whatever is you know thinking about

206
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:48,480
whatever I'm angry with the fist stays clenched but uh if I feel the clench the

207
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:54,720
tightness in the fist feel how tired the hand is becoming feeling the pain of the

208
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:00,640
clenching just feel it closely uh and start feeling it more as shifting

209
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:07,480
changing Sensations sometimes my little finger sometimes my thumb sometimes the back of my hand sometimes the palm of my

210
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:12,680
hand my fingernails going into it it's very sharp the stretching on back of my

211
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:17,920
hand feeling all those Sensations something begins relaxing there

212
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,280
softening the the natural tendency for the clenched hand to release has room

213
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:31,680
now to relax it doesn't have that room to relax If I Stay seeing the situation with

214
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:37,960
anger so so there's something about creating that uh this awareness of s

215
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:44,000
sensation sensory Awareness stuff is um allows things to

216
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,520
be um flu uh makes it's like kind of like giving

217
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:56,079
room for things to move towards health things to begin flowing and moving in

218
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:01,520
the way they should should and the amazing thing is that

219
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:09,160
those things that are byproduct of tension a byproduct of clinging or

220
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:16,760
holding strain attachment those things begin to

221
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:22,240
dissolve and those things that are byproduct of an openness of a generosity

222
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:28,000
of kindness of of uh emptiness spaciousness

223
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,240
those things begin to grow and this wonderful re movement that

224
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:39,920
the things that cause suffering things that have to do with attachment begin to

225
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:46,520
dissolve if we make space for things and room for things and like the clenched hand begins

226
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:57,240
to relax the open hand and the sensitivity of the Open Hand um the um the uh this

227
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:03,359
gesture here mudra here in Buddhism it means the Buddha do does sometimes is the gesture of

228
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:10,319
friendliness and the gesture of the Open Hand pointing down is a gesture of

229
00:38:10,319 --> 00:38:19,599
um of um safety offering safety to people and

230
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:29,000
so there's something happens with the Open Hand something releases and so and so in this process of feeling

231
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:36,000
and sensing and discovering our body in a deeper way the sensations and not being stuck on anything but being open

232
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,400
and receptive something begins shifting in our body shifting in our heart shifting in our

233
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:46,839
minds and and uh because the body is so closely connected to the mind and the

234
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:53,760
heart as the body changes so the Mind changes as the body relaxes and softens

235
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,920
so the heart does the same so in this sense um reading the book of

236
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:05,960
your body is so profound so significant the body in some ways the experience

237
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:12,119
body the body that we experience to a great degree uh it uh how we experience

238
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:17,760
is is influenced by our thoughts our minds our judgments our priorities a

239
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:24,160
selectivity process that we select what to pay attention to maybe based on our

240
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:30,359
desires our fears our conceits and so to stop making these selectivity

241
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:36,160
process but allow it to open up is um is really

242
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:42,920
great there are some schools of uh vasana inside meditation where they do

243
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:49,839
body scans systematic going through different parts of the body over and over again and so that the whole body

244
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:56,119
steadily over time is visited with this kind of generous attention and seeing

245
00:39:56,119 --> 00:40:04,400
and feeling and making room for that part of the body to show itself and be seen and maybe relax or unfold in a good

246
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:10,440
way in the tradition that I teach in we don't generally do the body scan

247
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:16,720
systematically but it's more like we have the idea is that um the body knows

248
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:23,000
what needs attention so the basic instruction is to let the breathing be

249
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,240
the default if that works for you and um and develop mindfulness on

250
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:33,440
the breathing develop attention on the breathing um develop concentration on

251
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:39,000
the breathing and breathing is a shifting changing flowing series of

252
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:45,839
Sensations so a lot of the benefits of just doing sensory awareness practice can be right there with the

253
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:52,400
breathing but if some other sensation becomes more predominant then the idea is to switch

254
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,560
your attention from the breathing to that predominant sensation in your

255
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:03,800
body and um and just be with it as long as it seems to need attention and be

256
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:09,359
present for it and feel it when it's acknowledged enough or it's or it shift

257
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:15,000
and changes and and it kind of faded away or become less strong then go back to the

258
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,480
breathing and so it's a little bit random where the Mind might go what part

259
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:27,319
of the body might speak over a long period of time much of the body get

260
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:35,000
our attention but it's not done systematically uh uh the body knows what

261
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:41,000
you need attention to and so this idea that the wisdom of the body operates

262
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,440
whether that's literally always true I I don't know but it's a wonderful

263
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:52,160
attitude that oh the body knows what I need what needs attention now so rather

264
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:59,800
than saying oh no this shouldn't be happening oh no I shouldn't have this pain oh no I shouldn't have these these

265
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:05,839
Sensations the idea when we do this practice is oh yes the body is speaking

266
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:11,520
to me now it this is the body is saying here now this needs

267
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:18,560
attention and you don't make it any more complicated in that the interpretation but uh just a very different attitude

268
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:25,160
the body knows and then feel and be with it and then come back to your

269
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:31,119
breathing if there's a lot of strong Sensations in the body maybe you there's a long time

270
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:37,200
before you come back to your breathing that you would just kind of maybe go from one sensation to another and just

271
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:43,720
tap into them and be with them for a while and when in doubt come back to

272
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:51,160
your breathing be with your breathing and if breathing is not a good object for home base for you then uh

273
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:56,920
some people's home base is just Body Sensations all over the body and just kind of gently

274
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:05,440
letting the attention just flow and move between the different parts of the body the body speaks and shows you what needs

275
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:12,440
your attention so thank you so

276
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:17,960
this last week talking about breathing and this week about the body um is very

277
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:24,079
important in many ways but for what's coming it's extremely important as a

278
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:30,119
reference point as a basis of foundation for practicing mindfulness of emotions

279
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:35,960
and mindfulness of thinking which is also coming we can be more wisely present for

280
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:42,640
our emotions if we're really grounded in the body so I won't be here next week I'm

281
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:50,880
going on Retreat and I'm delighted that um uh Nikki mapori is coming to uh teach

282
00:43:50,880 --> 00:44:00,359

284
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:13,960
