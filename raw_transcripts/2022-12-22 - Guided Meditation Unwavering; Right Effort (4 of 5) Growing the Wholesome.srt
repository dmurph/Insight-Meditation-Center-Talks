1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:08,099
so good morning hello everyone and Welcome to our

2
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:12,980
Friday meditation and teaching

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:21,619
the Thursday today's Thursday tomorrow so I'm already thinking ahead a little bit

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:29,279
so um the theme for this week has been the

5
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:36,260
Buddhist teachings on a right effort and there's four of them and today's the topic is

6
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:42,899
cultivating maintaining growing wholesome States

7
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,000
I'll talk more about that than during the talk but for this meditation I want

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,219
to point to a very important wholesome

9
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,980
State a Wholesome Way of being that maybe is the foundation for the

10
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:06,019
growth the development the allowance of other wholesome States

11
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,700
and that is being unwavering

12
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,400
an unwavering way of being in this world in meditation

13
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,400
so to be unwavering and are

14
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,580
application of ourselves are doing unwavering in our thoughts on wavering

15
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:36,299
in our mind and heart so in the body maybe that's experienced

16
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:43,140
as a kind of stability to feel stable here

17
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:49,200
to in the mind maybe it's steadiness to hold the course to be hold the Mind

18
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,700
steady on something and um and the

19
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,979
and maybe in the heart I don't know what uh is that what the

20
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:08,160
quality of unwaveringnesses of the hearts maybe it's uh kind of a devotion

21
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,280
or maybe it's a kind of a feeling an attitude of yes

22
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,459
to being present to being here regardless

23
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:26,280
and this uh idea of of being unwavering as being an important mental quality

24
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:33,599
the foundation kind of gives gives us a sense that it's cultivating wholesome qualities of

25
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:39,000
mind it doesn't have to be like all these wonderful things like love or

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Good Will compassion uh which are maybe kind of very important

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,120
but uh maybe sometimes even a little bit forced or maybe not so accessible

28
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,420
but if we can cultivate stability steadiness unwaveringness

29
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:04,080
um then that is the ground from which the wholesome other wholesomes can grow

30
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,260
to be wavering to be unsteady unstable that's the ground from which the

31
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:15,319
unwholesome the unhelpful states of Mind grow

32
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:23,400
so for this meditation we can focus on being unwavering being steady and stable

33
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:31,099
and when the mind your mind wanders off in thought don't you come back to your breathing

34
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:39,000
come back or re-establish a stability of the body

35
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,440
a steadiness of the Mind and kind of a settled subtleness of the

36
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:53,540
heart settledness in the heart that is yes to being present

37
00:03:54,379 --> 00:04:00,780
stable steady settled unwavering

38
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:08,360
so assuming a posture for meditation that

39
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:15,620
allows you to feel stable in your body

40
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,340
it might be a posture that's a little bit more intentional

41
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:29,900
a little bit more engaged and active than a posture that you have

42
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,680
prioritizing being comfortable

43
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:41,580
it's important to be comfortable up to a point but it can be overdone

44
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:49,139
with the loss of kind of bringing the body into an alert

45
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:51,979
stability

46
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:01,080
that supports a kind of

47
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:07,699
the kind of energy that of being present

48
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,620
gently closing your eyes and breathing deeply

49
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:25,680
relaxing the body as you exhale with the idea that the exhale

50
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,800
is moving to a stability of the body

51
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,180
where the weight of your body settles into the seats or the

52
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:44,280
place where your weight is supported by the chair or the bed or wherever you are

53
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,180
the floor

54
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:05,300
letting breathing return to normal

55
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,880
and then if as you breathe a normal breath is there some way that you can steady

56
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,600
your mind

57
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:34,139
kind of like you would if you were going to do a very precise Movement Like

58
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:37,460
threading a needle

59
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:50,580
steady the mind letting go of thoughts relaxing the

60
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:58,199
tension of the Mind settling whatever way the mind

61
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:04,380
is agitated in favor of the where the mind

62
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:09,198
is steady stable

63
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,780
and then as you breathe maybe on the exhale

64
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,220
just settle your heart

65
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:37,520
almost like your heart happily responds to the pool of gravity

66
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,020
to relax and settle on

67
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,520
quieting the agitation of heart

68
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:02,340
and if you find yourself wandering off in thought or very much caught up in thought

69
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:10,400
you might go through these three steps on your way back to breathing

70
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,560
find some stability in the body

71
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:27,020
some steadiness in the mind and some subtleness in the heart

72
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:34,459
and with that Begin Again with your breathing

73
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:42,860
with an unwavering attention to the next in-breath

74
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,480
to the next exhale

75
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,440
one breath at a time

76
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:16,860
chances are if you're wondering a lot in your thinking

77
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:25,759
the mind has some agitation in it it's wavering and unsteady

78
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:36,920
relax deeply as a way of steadying the Mind

79
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:50,660
stabilize yourself here in the present moment with your body

80
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,600
foreign

81
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:17,779
in the next couple of minutes before the closing

82
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:25,380
gently with a gentle way

83
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:32,179
can you be a bit more stable settled in your body

84
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:39,080
so the body is more present more

85
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,740
aware of its embodied nature

86
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:58,278
and gently steadying the mind the attention

87
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:02,240
may be on itself

88
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,480
underneath your concerns and preoccupations agitations

89
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:22,380
settling into a deeper layer in the mind where it's stable quiet

90
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:29,820
settled appreciating just being aware being

91
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,360
conscious

92
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:51,779
and settling the heart as if

93
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:55,700
you feel reassured

94
00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:03,120
safe as if for this next few moments everything is good

95
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:09,919
all is good the heart can rest

96
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,179
for a few minutes be content

97
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:30,720
and from this unwavering stance of stability steadiness

98
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:37,580
subtleness from a deep within you

99
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:45,919
what a wholesome quality seems to want to emerge

100
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:51,679
what goodness what sweetness

101
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:14,360
what is it that wants to appear and Flow

102
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:22,759
that's something that's enjoyable or appreciatable

103
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:52,140
to be stable steady settled

104
00:28:52,500 --> 00:29:01,158
makes it possible to be more sensitive aware of the world around us

105
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:11,039
to be with others and let their being registered for us

106
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:17,460
feel the connection that doesn't require words

107
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:32,880
in the presence of people that we care for when we're settled they might want to

108
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:39,380
love might want to emerge kindness good will

109
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:42,500
Delight

110
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:51,620
settling back

111
00:29:54,659 --> 00:30:01,140
and then ending this meditation with extending our Good Will out into the

112
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:08,779
world may all beings be happy

113
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:16,039
may all beings be safe

114
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:23,480
male beings be peaceful

115
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:30,440
may all beings be free

116
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:43,159
and may it be that inner stability subtleness steadiness

117
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:47,600
unwavering ability to be present

118
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:56,000
that we contribute to the welfare and happiness of everyone

119
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:17,999
thank you [Music]

120
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:26,460
so hello everyone welcome to this fourth talk on the four right efforts

121
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:34,380
and today's emphasis is on the fourth being the

122
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:43,080
a focus on wholesome states of mind or skillful helpful States or qualities

123
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:49,340
and um and the um

124
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:57,419
this is actually a very important part of the teachers of the teachers of the Buddhas

125
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:03,960
teaching that at least in my for me was not really appreciated very much in a

126
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:09,960
few Decades of being a Buddhist and practicing I think perhaps like I think maybe a

127
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:17,880
good number of people I had somehow become tuned into prioritizing

128
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:23,700
the teachings On Letting Go and uh and sometimes it was

129
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:30,539
indiscriminate letting go it was just that means it's very powerful sometimes especially in meditation to let go of

130
00:32:30,539 --> 00:32:37,140
everything even the wholesome because sooner or later everything needs to be let go of no holding even to the

131
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:45,179
wholesome but it's possible to overdo it and not then support the growth the

132
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:50,940
cultivation even the presence of beneficial states of Mind beneficial

133
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:55,980
states of heart and that as we allow them to be there

134
00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:02,100
and they're just let go of them or ignore them that we can actually promote or make it

135
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:10,080
possible for him to grow and it's possible to become filled with well-being filled with really good

136
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:18,440
qualities I was kind of really amazed and stunned when I started doing the long meditation

137
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:24,360
lots of meditation to discover how thoroughly saturated our the whole body

138
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:29,460
and being can be in particular wholesome states of being

139
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:35,640
uh joy and happiness tranquility um now the one that surprised me I think

140
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:42,720
the most was equanimity uh just the the Equanimity was such a

141
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:48,240
clear full embodied kind of way it wasn't just some like little policy in

142
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:55,140
the mind to be equanimous it was a way of being and um

143
00:33:55,140 --> 00:34:02,159
so this idea that the wholesome is supposed to be proof so in this four right efforts

144
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:10,520
the first right effort is to prevent the arising of unarrisen

145
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:15,720
unwholesome States so states that haven't not really healthy for you to

146
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:21,300
have thoughts feelings attitudes motivations

147
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:28,700
if they're not there and they're not operating you know they're a common part of your life then

148
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:36,179
within reason maybe make the behavioral changes and other changes that would

149
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:43,280
kind of um prevent them from arising these unhealthy ways of being

150
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:48,898
the second right effort is if the unwholesome states of Mind have come up

151
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:56,398
abandon them so this is the Letting Go part and how to abandon them healthfully and

152
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:02,940
is is important but these four right efforts you were always using them as a kind of a perspective an analysis

153
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:08,460
of what we're actually doing so if we're letting go is the Letting Go

154
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:16,200
itself done in a Wholesome Way or is it unwholesome if letting go is being done with a

155
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:21,540
version with conceit with Greed for something better

156
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:28,140
if it's then it's not so wholesome and it kind of will backfire in some way

157
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:34,800
but if we're looking for how to do this in a Wholesome Way uh it's a it's a whole the whole it's a

158
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:42,359
game changer it's a very different way of being with it and then there's not so much self-involved or conceit or greed

159
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:47,640
that kind of comes in slowly we begin to learn how there's a whole other source

160
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:54,359
Within that is the source of how to do things in wholesome ways including this letting

161
00:35:54,359 --> 00:36:02,099
go one of the things to discover is that letting go is one of the things that our

162
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:07,440
heart wants to do if all the conditions are right it's not like we have to let

163
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,480
go but we have to enable the letting go that that's already there that wants to

164
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:19,859
happen so kind of a very the third right effort is to evoke to

165
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:25,859
bring about to recognize wholesome states that haven't Arisen yet to bring them about

166
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:31,800
and that also might involve behavioral changes to stay close to things that inspire you

167
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,960
bring your gladness and happiness and steadiness and you know do the things

168
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:43,640
that help you be more settled in your life or stable in your life and uh rushing around is not helpful

169
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:49,680
doing things in a steady stable manner is much more helpful

170
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:57,960
and then the fourth is the this is a dramatic so it kind of goes comparable to the second right effort to abandon

171
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:03,359
uh the unwholesome states that have risen now it's to maintain the wholesome

172
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:08,460
states that have arisen so things that are good going on maintain them and

173
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:14,400
again this can be done with behavioral ways if you feel really happy and good and just feel like this is unusually

174
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:23,900
settled and peaceful maybe it's not the time to get lost on the web or in the news or

175
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:29,820
or you know start doing something that you know is going to just get you really

176
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:35,339
angry um you know just kind of maybe there's a way of maintaining it keeping it going

177
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:43,079
being careful not to lose it easily to sacrifice it for um you know some petty irritation that

178
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:49,079
you want to complain about and so um

179
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:54,839
however what I want to emphasize today is that this cultivating and maintaining

180
00:37:54,839 --> 00:38:01,920
um the wholesome it gets actually much more emphasized by the Buddha because rather than simply

181
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:07,520
one word of what we do prevent

182
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:14,579
abandon evoke for the forthright effort there's a whole series of words so you

183
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:20,099
get a sense of kind of the emphasis the importance like like maybe we're supposed to spend uh you know more time

184
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:26,460
on the wholesome so this is a how it goes

185
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:33,720
practitioners take up and take hold of their minds take hold of themselves

186
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:40,560
and generate desire endeavor and initiate courageous effort

187
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,839
here we go for the maintenance the non-forgetting

188
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:54,839
the frequent cultivation the abundance the development and the Fulfillment of

189
00:38:54,839 --> 00:39:03,240
wholesome mental qualities States characteristics that have Arisen wow I mean that's quite

190
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:09,780
a mouthful once something good has arisen in you be careful

191
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:17,339
don't lose it easily because you get caught up in your desires and your conceits and your you know

192
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:22,800
agendas and your fears and your you know rushing around and doing a lot

193
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:29,460
take time for that and and then are there ways

194
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:34,920
to maintain it keep it going not with again it has to be done in a

195
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:41,160
Wholesome Way not with expectation not with demand not with measuring your

196
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:46,980
success and failure your self-worth by their presence not by in a way that you

197
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:52,440
would be just you know distraught if it's not there and feel like somehow you're a bad person

198
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:58,859
there's a Wholesome Way a freeway a generous way a relaxed way to be with

199
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:05,839
all these things that you know is is kind of sense of freedom in it itself

200
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:13,079
and with that to maintain it to be conscious and aware and choiceful about

201
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:19,020
what we do so that affects our state of mind

202
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:24,240
for the non-forgetting I love this one don't forget it don't overlook it don't

203
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:31,380
lose touch with it it's so easy to lose touch and forget the the healthy way of

204
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:36,420
being in the world being attentive being here in a full way

205
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:41,700
the frequent cultivation abundance development and fulfillment

206
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:47,099
so the city of abundance abundance of good qualities the Fulfillment of them

207
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:54,540
so can't get any better I mean this is dramatic language I think to me it's inspiring language it

208
00:40:54,540 --> 00:41:02,339
could seem exhausting like there's a lot to do but it's not meant to be the kind of doing that is exhausting it's a kind of

209
00:41:02,339 --> 00:41:08,099
a doing which is fun which is nice which is relaxing which the doing itself feels good

210
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:14,760
and that's the art of this whole meditation and mindfulness how do we do anything

211
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:20,400
in a wholesome healthy beneficial way and that's the art that we want to

212
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:27,420
discover and find that's the key to a Buddhist practice Buddhist practice involves practice but how do we do the

213
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:33,540
practice in this Wholesome Way nourishing way inspiring way we're

214
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:39,599
inspired by it feels good we like we like doing it it's not automatic we discover how to do

215
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:47,040
it but that's what we're working towards and then and then uh overcoming the

216
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:53,339
strong urges in the mind uh from fear from desires from Duty

217
00:41:53,339 --> 00:41:58,740
obligation to override the healthy way of doing things to do things in ways

218
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:07,140
which are not wholesome that are rushed that lead to maybe something as simple as becoming unstable and unsteady and

219
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:13,800
tight and focused losing touch forgetting about this Wholesome Way of being

220
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:20,880
because this idea of wholesomeness wholesome states of being that we maintain can can lift the bar kind of

221
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,460
high if we rush to the idea that has to be love and peace and these were dramatic kind of

222
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:31,560
spiritual feelings um the foundational one that I think

223
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:39,599
that we want to remember to always come back to and start with is the wholesome sense of being stable

224
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:47,220
here in the in the moment a physical embodied stability when we're un when unwholesomeness takes

225
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:52,320
over it shifts and changes the physical body and how we live in the world and I

226
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:57,420
mean how we're how we are not so settled but when we're wholesome there's the

227
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:04,140
wholesomes arises out of the settled body stable a settled mind

228
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:11,940
a steady mind and a subtle heart so if that's the first

229
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:18,480
step in evoking the wholesome and maintaining the wholesome maybe that's not so bad

230
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:24,660
maybe that isn't so far Out Of Reach maybe it's only you know ten percent

231
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:31,859
more stable ten percent more steady but that but without ten percent maybe

232
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:39,180
we don't make as many mistakes we don't live as stressfully as we do other times and that steadiness and stability the

233
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:43,980
sense of being living a life which is unwavering

234
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:51,900
is the soil in which the wholesome has a chance to emerge

235
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:59,099
and probably the more stable and steady and subtle we are the more the wholesomeness the

236
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:04,560
appearance the arising of it does it by itself we don't have to do it we just

237
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:12,560
have to recognize it allow it not forget it

238
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:22,039
support it to grow not be embarrassed or ashamed or

239
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:28,380
kind of afraid of it don't be afraid of the goodness that's in you

240
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:35,040
Let It Grow and let it become abundant so the wholesome maintaining growing

241
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:41,940
developing the wholesome within us so for this day's homework

242
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:47,819
I wanted you through the day whenever you can remember maybe set a timer at least do it once an

243
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:55,560
hour or something see if you can emphasize a little bit more coming into a place of stability

244
00:44:55,560 --> 00:45:01,020
steadiness subtleness some places we feel kind of

245
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:07,500
feel this and then when you do something to do it kind of in an unwavering way from this place

246
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:13,740
and see if other wholesome qualities have a chance to follow and awake it's

247
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:19,020
almost like that stability opens the door and that Open Door what wholesome things

248
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:24,480
wants to come from you and uh and maybe make a catalog of what

249
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:32,700
wants to come it's uh you might be surprised what's in there that wants to come out

250
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:38,359
so thank you very much and uh

251
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:46,940
for tomorrow they'll be kind of a concluding talk on these four right efforts
