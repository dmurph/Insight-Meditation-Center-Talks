1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,960
so uh I'm really happy to be with you all this week

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:13,320
um I'm down in Santa Barbara about 300 miles south of of Redwood City and

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,400
uh uh it's uh it doesn't really make any

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:26,240
difference where I am because uh this SA this worldwide SA is uh is always

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,880
present here and now so Gil is teaching a retreat this week

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:40,879
and I'm really happy to be able to offer something in his absence and I I hope it will complement um this introduction

7
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:46,879
he's doing to how insight arises you know our practice prepares

8
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:53,120
the mind um through a deepening sensitivity to our lived experience our

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,199
lived experience moment to moment to allow these deep insights to arise

10
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,720
and on Friday last Friday Gil spoke about how the arising of insight is a

11
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:11,200
it's a natural process it's a a deep seeing and it happens when the obstacles

12
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,280
to that uh deep clear seeing have been left behind have been cleared away so I

13
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,280
thought for this week I would focus on uh some of the obstacles to clear seeing

14
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,520
uh where they arise and how they how they get in our way

15
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,880
so long before the time of the Buddha there was a special kind of

16
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:44,079
uh super walking human and an individual named Rohitasa was one of these and then

17
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,439
later hundreds or maybe thousands of years later this same rohitasa after

18
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:56,799
many um intervening lifetimes in different forms had been uh reborn as a

19
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,719
dva you know a kind of god or angel or some kind of mythological being that

20
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:08,399
exists in the in the text and he came to the Buddha and he asked him if it was

21
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:15,000
possible to reach the end of the world by walking by

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,360
traveling and the Buddha told him that it wasn't possible rohit Tasa was uh he

23
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,560
was really pleased to hear this because during that earlier super walking life

24
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,760
he had walked taking strides that apparently were a couple of thousand

25
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,959
miles in length each stride for the entire time that he was alive which was

26
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:43,200
about a hundred years only taking time out for his obvious physical needs and

27
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:50,680
he had never reached the end of the world so he was glad it wasn't

28
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:56,400
possible and then so the Buddha then replied to Rohitasa saying that though

29
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,120
it is not possible to reach the end of the world by walking in order to reach

30
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,760
the end of suffering it is necessary to reach the end of the world and then he

31
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:17,519
went on to say for it is in this fathoml long body with its perceptions and mind

32
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:24,640
that I describe the world its origin its sessation and the practice that leads to

33
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:31,040
its sessation and uh Bikubodi has has called this you

34
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,080
know Bikubodi the American monk who's such a um prolific translator of a

35
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,120
translator of many of the um of the early teachings of the Buddha wonderful

36
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:48,720
teacher he called this um maybe the most profound proposition in the history of

37
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:55,040
human thought that's pretty high praise

38
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,239
so in this story of Rohitasa of course Rohitasa was asking about how to reach

39
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:07,799
the end of the the outer world you know the physical earth but the Buddha's answer was about the world we

40
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:15,280
experience and some of us might not measure a full fathom i'm pretty a lot shorter than that it's about six feet

41
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:22,479
but no matter what size we are our entire experience of the world lies

42
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:28,560
within this body this is where we practice this is what we practice with

43
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,080
this is where our practice is realized where insight

44
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,759
arises so this week I'm going to offer some words about what the Buddha said uh

45
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:46,880
makes up our world are loca loca in the poly sometimes the word is translated as

46
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:53,600
cosmos but I I really prefer the word world because um it's simpler you know

47
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,800
it's our world how the world comes to us how we

48
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:05,440
know and experience it so here within these bodies is where we develop insight

49
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:13,280
and also the obstacles to the deep seeing of insight arise here as

50
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:19,039
well so to begin let's uh let's meditate

51
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,120
and I'll invite a little bit of exploration excuse me during the

52
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:30,759
meditation into what makes up our world

53
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:40,879
so if you'd like to take your comfortable meditation

54
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:55,840
posture posture that expresses both alertness and ease

55
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:05,120
yeah we want to be awake to our experience but in a relaxed peaceful

56
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:17,440
way so inviting ease into any areas where there's

57
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,440
tension

58
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,360
maybe doing a brief body scan

59
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:38,800
just beginning with the top of the head forehead and the brow

60
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:45,720
area just noticing any kind of tightness straining

61
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:53,479
and letting it ease as much as possible the cheeks and

62
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:59,120
jaw the throat and the tops of the shoulders

63
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:06,319
trapezius muscles just see if you can let those ease

64
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:18,360
up letting the breath be full

65
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,000
the chest can be open not held

66
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,560
tightly the belly can be

67
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:44,599
soft the thighs and calves just

68
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:51,680
relaxed feel yourself sitting or lying whatever posture you're in and feel the

69
00:07:51,680 --> 00:08:00,280
weight of the body being supported by whatever is under

70
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:06,800
you the earth foundationally fundamentally

71
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:28,919
Like maybe taking a little time

72
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:37,518
to connect with your breathing taking a few deep breaths

73
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:46,159
just to help connect to the what's happening in this present

74
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,360
moment and to settle a little

75
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:04,000
bit closing your eyes just sensing into what can be

76
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,519
sensed with your eyes

77
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,399
closed it's actually happening

78
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:34,240
breath in the body whatever is happening in the

79
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:45,800
mind other sensations hearing

80
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:16,480
If there are sounds where you

81
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:27,560
are noticing what is heard and the knowing of what is heard

82
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:37,360
knowing is a a mental function and sensing happens at the

83
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,800
place where something is

84
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:52,240
sensed when we hear a sound you know where is it heard sounds are sensed at the ear

85
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:59,160
door but it's the mind that knows that something has been

86
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:07,200
heard that hearing has occurred when the mind recognizes it

87
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:14,279
identifies it usually maybe reacts to it

88
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:34,399
the sensations in the body the sensations of breathing all the sensations from the tip of the nose all

89
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:40,200
the way down into the the lungs the depth of the lungs the movements of the

90
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:46,079
belly all those sensations they're sensed where they

91
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:54,079
occur the sensing takes place there but the

92
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:59,440
knowing of the sensation is in the

93
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:14,880
mind the mind can simply know and it can also complicate that

94
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,800
simple sense contact but it's all kinds of activity and

95
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,800
reactivity

96
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:55,320
i I want to invite you to to stay with what is sensed just as much as as

97
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:04,399
possible letting mental activity settle maybe ignoring it if it arises

98
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:11,760
turning attention back to the simple sensations of breathing or hearing or

99
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,000
other sensations in the

100
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:27,279
body doing that staying with what's simple it can be easeful it can be

101
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:38,040
peaceful just sitting back and and watching the

102
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:45,320
flow of experience knowing it sensing it

103
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:19,400
whatever is happening in the body sensations of

104
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,799
breathing other

105
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:31,320
sensations even mental activity can it be known

106
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:37,480
simply just sensed into without

107
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,760
complicating let go of the

108
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:52,600
complication just sense and know

109
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:52,159
this uh just simplicity in the the way we

110
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:57,120
relate to our experience that I'm

111
00:27:57,399 --> 00:28:06,159
inviting it can um it can be a way of warming our hearts

112
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:12,720
i think when there is simplicity in our experience there is

113
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:18,600
more access to uh to what is

114
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:23,880
uh friendly and welcoming within us towards our own

115
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:32,320
experience and towards others and maybe we can turn that outward uh now with a

116
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:38,679
wish uh that uh all beings

117
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:44,480
um enjoy a simple relationship to their

118
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:51,960
lives that they can have ease that they might uh have peace in their

119
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:57,480
hearts might feel safe and protected

120
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,279
might be healthy and one day might

121
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:14,200
uh have the deep insight that leads to freedom of heart may it be so

122
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:35,160
[Music]

123
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:29,080
so welcome again um if those some people weren't

124
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:35,200
uh weren't here at the beginning um just to let you know this week I'm going to

125
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,960
be talking about uh some of the things that get in the way of uh of the clear

126
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:48,480
seeing that leads to insight in our practice in our in our dharma

127
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:58,080
path and uh here's that that line from the Buddha that

128
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:05,600
Bubodyi was at such high praise for for it is in this fathoml long body with its

129
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:13,120
perceptions and mind that I describe the world its origin its sessation and the

130
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,120
practice that leads to its sessation

131
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,720
and after the Buddha had given this pathy teaching on what constitutes the

132
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:31,039
world um some other monks who had heard it asked Ananda you know the Buddha's

133
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:36,080
dear cousin and attendant to try to to explicate what the Buddha meant because

134
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:41,559
it's a little bit a little bit enigmatic and Ananda

135
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:49,840
explained the world is that in the world by which one is a perceiver and

136
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:57,760
conceiver of the world it's kind of a convoluted sentence the world is that in

137
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:04,880
the world by which one is a perceiver and conceiver of the world so what is

138
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:10,960
that by which we perceive and conceive the world

139
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,960
and what what the teachings tell us is that

140
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:24,080
what it is is the six sense basis the six sense spheres hearing seeing seeing first

141
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:31,320
usually seeing hearing tasting smelling touching this tactile sense and mental

142
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:38,559
activity and so the path to the end of suffering is found in exploring getting

143
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:44,200
to know working with seeing the true operation of these six areas of

144
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:50,159
experience and gradually letting go of any clinging and craving that's

145
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:56,640
associated with them so often over the years I've heard

146
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:02,799
Gil say that in any one moment there are only two things happening there is what

147
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:07,960
is happening and there is how we relate to what is

148
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:14,080
happening and what is happening is always happening at in one of these six

149
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:21,039
sense spheres that's all there is and how we relate to what is happening through the

150
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:27,120
mind is how we get caught how we get obstructed how we create dooka and it's

151
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:35,039
also how we get free so Gills begun this series on insight on

152
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:40,960
the insights that lead to the end of the world and uh last last week he spoke

153
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:48,720
about different categories of insight that we develop as we practice and first uh first there are

154
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:54,080
what he called personal insights you know seeing into our habits our habit

155
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:59,360
patterns noticing the way we do things how we've come to be conditioned by our

156
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:05,200
personal history i think of those as psychological insights and often I think

157
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:10,960
uh uh we spend uh our first years of practice maybe many years of practice

158
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:17,040
with these being the primary kind of insights that that we have we develop

159
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,320
more wisdom about our conditioning we start loosening the attachments to our

160
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:28,638
our stories our stories of blame and regret and self- judgment we start to

161
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:36,800
not take things quite so personally and then we become ready as

162
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,919
we have opened in that way to our conditioning we become more ready for

163
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:48,878
the deeper insights the ones that apply to all of us to all human beings

164
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:54,878
and Gil introduced uh the insight we can have into what is sensed and what we

165
00:34:54,879 --> 00:35:01,640
make of it namar Rupa appearances and recognition as as he translates

166
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:07,320
that name and form is the the of literal

167
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:12,400
translation and this is the beginning of wisdom developing in us seeing the

168
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,440
difference between what we experience through our senses and the mental

169
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:23,040
activity that accompanies it and what I was kind of trying to uh invite during

170
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:28,320
the the meditation and then uh the next day he

171
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:36,480
introduced conditionality um beginning to see how we experience uh what we experience

172
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:43,040
through the physical senses is conditioned by what's present in the mind and vice versa you know how what

173
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:50,000
comes to us through the senses gives rise to mental activity everything is conditioned in

174
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:56,079
our lives and we begin to see this river of conditions flowing that that make up

175
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:01,760
our entire life all the way from birth to death and when we begin to see that

176
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:10,720
you know we begin to see that impermanence you know inconstancy ana that it's continual it's it's constant

177
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:16,480
inconstancy is constant and then because we see this flow as

178
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:22,640
constant we come to realize that nothing in our experience is stable nothing is

179
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:28,200
concrete nothing is to be relied upon including a sense of

180
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:34,960
self and gradually as a result of this we lose interest in clinging to what is

181
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:41,520
continually slipping away slipping away and then we become ripe for the the

182
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:48,200
deepest insights to arise the insights into the the three perceptions that Gil

183
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:52,520
introduced on Friday

184
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:00,680
so to use Anandas language all the practices that lead to insight

185
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:07,200
illuminate the way we perceive through our physical senses and conceive through

186
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:14,000
our minds the world our perceptions condition the

187
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,280
mental conceptions and our conceptions mental conceptions conceive how we

188
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:25,760
perceive there is this uh kind of feedback loop between between those and

189
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:31,079
gradually our practice illuminates what obstructs freedom and ease in that

190
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:38,160
relationship and leads us in the direction of the end of suffering gradually the way we relate to

191
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:44,000
experience the way we conceive our experience it becomes it's reconditioned

192
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,480
by our practice

193
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:56,000
so the the first uh sense sphere that's spoken of in the texts is seeing sight

194
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:04,880
the eye as the instrument of sight and the objects that are seen so seeing is a process that happens

195
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:11,280
between the eye and its object and of course um the mind

196
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:17,520
interprets what is seen what is being seen it recognizes the object if it's

197
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:24,240
has seen it before it makes assumptions often about its use or intention might

198
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:32,079
begin to tell some stories about the object the mind has the the power and

199
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:38,599
seems like it has the inclination quite often to complicate the simple act of

200
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:45,599
seeing and it does that complication conditioned by all its past experience

201
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:50,800
um with that kind of object and what that kind of object has come to mean in

202
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,960
our life we know what a door is because we've been opening and closing doors

203
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:02,800
since we were little kids you know but the way the mind interprets what is seen

204
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,920
the mental activity that is triggered that's where we get caught and that's

205
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,480
also where we where we can get free so a door you know a door is

206
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:21,760
a a pretty neutral object for most of us I imagine but what about the idea of a a

207
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:29,920
tropical beach and warm blue water palm trees with breezes wafting

208
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:35,920
through are you getting a kind of a visual of that for many you know such a

209
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:42,000
site maybe in a travel brochure will trigger some kind of desire some strong

210
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,680
desire maybe and for others that might just look like torture you know hot sun

211
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:56,240
sand in your shorts noisy people on the beach how we relate to the sights that

212
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:02,960
we see depends on what's in the mind old stories memories attitudes current

213
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:10,320
conditions all those things condition how we see what we see it's not clear

214
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:15,920
all the time and I think it's it's helpful to uh

215
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:21,079
to make a distinction between um seeing and

216
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:27,040
looking um this is something we talk about often it's a it's really useful as

217
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:33,440
long as our eyes function we're going to see what is before us but looking is a

218
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:39,440
more intentional activity there's a focus on one thing usually usually

219
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:44,480
accompanied by some kind of curiosity or interest in the mind maybe there's

220
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:50,480
desire maybe there's aversion or fear there's cognitive complication involved

221
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:57,960
in looking whereas seeing on the other hand it can be a simple receptive

222
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:03,599
process you might experiment right now just looking intentionally at something

223
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:08,960
maybe the screen maybe something else in the room

224
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:15,240
look at it as if you want to know you know what is this exactly really a

225
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:21,920
curiosity and notice what's what's the mind like you know what are the muscles in the face like especially around the

226
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,520
eyes i could feel my own eyes kind of squinting a little bit with that uh even

227
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:36,160
though I'm I knew I was going to say that and now just let go of let go of

228
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,960
that let go of the effort maybe close your eyes for a couple

229
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:48,440
seconds and uh just kind of reset and now opening your eyes

230
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:55,920
again just let your eyes receive what's in front of them maybe the screen again maybe the

231
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:02,160
room you're in notice what it feels like you know in

232
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:10,480
the eyes in the muscles of the face in the mind to just receive the images rather than

233
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:16,480
reaching out for them is there more calm in the seeing is

234
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,960
there more

235
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:29,960
ease moving from looking to seeing is a way of relaxing of calming the mental

236
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:35,560
interaction with uh with what we see

237
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:45,200
so we want to notice what it is that creates attachment between the act of

238
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:50,880
seeing and what is seen because that is where our clear

239
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:57,880
vision gets clouded distorted the things that arise when we're looking instead of

240
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:04,319
seeing sometimes there's some form of aversion maybe some form of desire and I

241
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:09,520
think doing this simple practice of switching between receptive seeing and

242
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:17,839
actively looking it can kind of help us see it can point to whether there's something tying our seeing to what is

243
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:24,880
seen that's maybe uh something we want to look at some way of relating to

244
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:32,920
what's happening that's taking us in the direction of more stress of less ease

245
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:41,359
and of course in our in our daily lives we we need to be looking actively quite often in order to na navigate the world

246
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:46,920
in order to avoid bumping into things using uh what we see to help us act

247
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:52,319
skillfully but noticing this difference um I think it can it can help us to

248
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:58,200
become more sensitive to what is it you know that's driving the

249
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:04,359
looking i know a teacher um who long ago uh gave a

250
00:44:04,359 --> 00:44:10,400
talk a talk on sense restraint and something that he said uh then has stuck

251
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:16,000
with me ever since um he spoke about doing walking meditation on retreat and

252
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,599
how his habit in his life at that time he was a young man at that time had been

253
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:27,040
to be on the lookout for attractive people for the possibility of starting a

254
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:33,200
romantic relationship and so he knew he was often driven by sense sense desire

255
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:39,359
sensual desire and he described you know being determined to simply practice his

256
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:44,640
walking meditation and he he felt this urge to look at the other people walking

257
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:50,280
in the same area when he was doing the meditation and he said to

258
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:57,680
himself "If I look I will see if I look I will see." Not meaning that he would

259
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:02,720
see in that receptive way we just experimented with but that he would see

260
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:08,319
something he liked and be pulled into desire

261
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:16,160
and he recognized that if he used his eyesight to look at the other people walking that attachment that hook would

262
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:21,359
arise he would begin wanting something as a result of looking and so he kept

263
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:27,200
his vision lowered he didn't look at anyone in particular just seeing his

264
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:33,838
walking path and as a result his mind was able to stay

265
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:41,040
calm in daily life you know we aren't likely to be so careful to avoid looking

266
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:46,560
at what we know is going to give rise to unskillful reactions in the mind but uh

267
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:54,160
it's something to think about you know looking at the newspaper or the news online more likely

268
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,680
for most of us i think if we choose to open an article that we already have a

269
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:05,680
sense is going to lead to becoming angry upset filled with hostility no do we

270
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:11,839
really want to do that we can't always avoid seeing what might give rise to unh

271
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:17,760
wholesome reactions but we can look at what the pull is the hook that arises

272
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:24,040
between seeing and what is seen in those moments

273
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:31,680
so seeing is a really uh a powerful way that we perceive and conceive of our of

274
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:36,960
our world and becoming aware of what arises in our minds and hearts when we

275
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:42,240
see certain things certain people certain landscapes aware of whether what

276
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:47,760
arises serves us you know leads us toward more peace toward a a more open

277
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:54,000
heart to a sense of beauty and connection or in the opposite direction toward

278
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:00,480
unhealthy desire toward ill will toward rage noticing that seeing the difference

279
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:06,040
we can't always control what we can hear or see or smell or

280
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:14,000
feel and we don't want to ignore important things that are difficult to see but we have agency in how we relate

281
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:20,000
to the world um that arises in our experience and

282
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,760
learning to be wise in the ways we relate to all our senses is a really big

283
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:34,480
part of how we come to the end of uh of the world of suffering becoming wise about this is a

284
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:40,480
is a really gradual process of course so tomorrow I'll talk about

285
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:45,680
hearing which is another way that we perceive and conceive of our world and

286
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:53,520
in the meantime you know I invite you to spend some time really attending to what it is that you see and noticing when you

287
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:58,880
get hooked in some way in the looking you know maybe there's just simple

288
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:05,599
interest curiosity navigating the world but notice the hooks that might be there

289
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:10,640
desires or aversions judgments or comparisons that diminish your inner

290
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:15,760
well-being your clarity that get your thinking going in a direction that

291
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:21,040
doesn't seem so healthy it's only through noticing the

292
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:27,119
conditions that uh that give rise to stress that we will eventually let go of

293
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:34,079
what gives rise to stress so with that a little over I see

294
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:41,520
um thank you for your attention and uh I look forward to see you tomorrow
