perspective so I just finished teaching a retreat on emptiness and part of that

7
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:53,760
was exploring um the self how self is the reference

8
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:01,000
point of everything in our lives and in our thoughts and in our senses and what

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,880
if we notice that and what if we play around with shifting perspectives and actually I see many of

10
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:15,799
you who are on Retreat so this will be a continuation of our exploration on the

15
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:59,159
invite you to get into your meditation posture whatever that might be if you need to shift and move this body

16
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,960
if you need to lie down if you need to set up sit up

17
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,800
straighter see what your body needs shift move to a

18
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:32,160
cushion and first and foremost as always we are arrive and land with the

19
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,760
body with the breath to

20
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,360
stabilize the attention

21
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,239
stabilized calm the

22
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:01,000
mind to arrive with sense of seclusion

23
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,239
quiet silence

24
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,560
internally turning our gaze

25
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:31,760
Inward and opening to perceptions of the body

26
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:39,720
sitting [Music] Sensations as the

27
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:45,000
feet connected to the Earth touching the

28
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,080
floor maybe the legs the underside of the

29
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,799
legs contact points feeling the contact arriving arriving really connecting with

30
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:03,040
the Earth with each

31
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:34,560
breath relax relxing relaxing softening giving the weight of the

32
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,360
legs feed to the

33
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:45,120
Earth similarly for the sit bones

34
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:12,400
and the abdomen lower abdomen relaxing softening

35
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:52,160
and opening expanding

36
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,639
awareness relaxed awareness to include not just the lower body but the upper

37
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:00,639
body

38
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,680
the [Music] trunk the chest neck and

39
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:22,039
shoulders ah the arms the hands relaxing

40
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,000
softening and all the muscles of the

41
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,599
face the entire body receiving the

42
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,960
breath the entire body being breathed

43
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:24,879
no need for a breather or a doer breathing happens on its own thank you

44
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,280
very much

45
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:39,280
allowing your awareness to be expansive to know to know the

46
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:46,000
breath sensations of breath in the

47
00:07:51,680 --> 00:08:00,560
body without the need for a control to but perceived

48
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:07,919
received in itself in the abdomen in the feet in the

49
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:20,440
chest sensed in and of

50
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
themselves

51
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
e

52
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,360
e e

53
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,600
and if you notice thoughts [Music] arising as they will

54
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:25,959
arise notice the self

55
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,200
reference the self- referential frame of

56
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:42,879
reference noticing it kindly gently without any

57
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:55,160
judgment with curiosity and openness oh interesting look at that

58
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:07,649
with kindness as if you're looking at a friend's [Music]

59
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:16,760
thoughts and gently asking wondering if the frame of reference of the self could

60
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,760
be relaxed jiggled

61
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:33,360
released as if letting go of helium balloons they can just float be on their own without you needing to hold on to

62
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,440
them as me or mine say what happens be

63
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:47,000
curious and then always coming back the breath in the

64
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,160
body being sensed as the anchor calming and

65
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
settling

66
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
e

67
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
e

68
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,120
e e

69
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:11,600
and notice if this inquiry curiosity about letting

70
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:19,120
go of the self- reference creates more ease more

71
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
space

72
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
e

73
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

74
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,959
e e

75
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:41,880
can the sensations in the body for example if there's any fatigue or or

76
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:49,319
aches can they be [Music] felt and and of

77
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:59,560
themselves as if awareness wasn't localized was spread in the body itself

78
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:06,159
not localizing the control tower of the head

79
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:51,240
could even a slight loosening of identification bring more

80
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,360
ease be curious don't push it

81
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
though

82
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

83
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

84
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

85
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

86
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

87
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

88
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

89
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

90
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,520
e e

91
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:06,039
and what if this loosening even for a moment this

92
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:13,840
Letting [Music] Go the self frame of reference When the

93
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:19,640
Thought comes up maybe judgmental thoughts self

94
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,360
judgmental

95
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:32,200
thoughts letting go of the frame of reference you you you me me

96
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:40,440
me just for a moment letting the thought float or if or if it's a sensation or

97
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:47,640
ache in the body just letting it float and be that letting

98
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:52,720
go that moment of loosening releasing

99
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:58,840
see if you can open up perhaps explore on your own

100
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:05,000
that moment of releasing can open up to

101
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:11,360
vast vastness of Love of

102
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,679
care of

103
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,360
compassion as an entry point

104
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,799
again you can start with a thought maybe

105
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:48,840
a thought that has some clinging some Dua some pain challenge in it or

106
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:56,279
something in the body pain and ache sensation notice the frame of reference

107
00:24:56,279 --> 00:25:02,720
of the eye me my see if it's

108
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:09,559
[Music] possible for this thought or sensation to just be as it is

109
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:17,399
floating letting go of the self as the eye as the frame of reference my me I am

110
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:25,520
this I am that and in that moment of release see if there's an opening

111
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,320
up into ease goodness

112
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:37,360
care love compassion however it might show up for

113
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,360
you

114
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,278
experiment e

115
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:35,799
if the thought comes up I'm not getting this this isn't working use that see if

116
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:41,480
you can jiggle the frame of reference of that I'm not getting this this isn't

117
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:48,600
working for me release the

118
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:57,240
eye relax into what opens up the

119
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,240
spaciousness e

120
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:52,720
relaxing into opening up

121
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:58,440
to space of Goodwill

122
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:05,880
as if you're Landing as if Landing

123
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,080
resting the mind the

124
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:30,120
body relaxing into spaciousness of goodwi

125
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,039
for

126
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,039
e

127
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,039
e

128
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,960
e

129
00:30:56,919 --> 00:30:59,919
e

130
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:30,919
e e

131
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:08,320
when the eye is released the heart the mind the Mind

132
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:15,240
heart can land into spacious

133
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:30,278
spaciousness of openness of goodwi and

134
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:52,518
ease can the self reference be released for even a split

135
00:32:54,080 --> 00:33:00,799
second regarding a particular sensation or thought be

136
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,760
curious e

137
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:03,960
and for the last moments of this period of

138
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:13,480
practice thoughts are coming up self- referential thoughts about this

139
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:19,358
perod of practice I was [Music]

140
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:28,040
distracted I was sleepy I was uncomfortable I didn't get it I I I

141
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:36,158
notice the self judgment if any self reference of the

142
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:42,760
eye and see if the statements the self reference can be

143
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:56,320
loosened thought can be just floating safe that opens up releases something

144
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:08,960
into spaciousness and the opposite of self judgment which is meta

145
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:13,089
[Music]

146
00:35:57,319 --> 00:36:08,000
thank you thank you for your practice so with the invitations

147
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:17,400
today I admit for this session they might they may have been a little more

148
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:25,800
on the subtle side needing little more settling of the Mind

149
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:33,400
stability of the Mind more quiet of the Mind quiet in the mind for an opening

150
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:42,079
for this exploration um to to give

151
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:49,960
fruit so I'd love to hear your Reflections if even for a split second

152
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:55,720
this letting go of the frame of reference of the self opened up for you

153
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:01,040
there was an aha and then opening up to a space that was

154
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:06,359
more spacious more easy more filled with

155
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:11,720
meta and friendliness if if that were the case

156
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:20,880
for you even for a split second would love to hear from you if you would be so kind to share Don

157
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:27,720
please thank you so much Nikki um it was um

158
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:34,920
it was challenging practice and uh yeah subtle and for me and maybe for others

159
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:41,440
but for me I tried to of just change like physically change my point of

160
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,760
reference and and sort of look at myself maybe from the perspective of a friend

161
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:54,319
of mine and or somebody else and and to sort of observe sort of the pain or the

162
00:37:54,319 --> 00:38:00,880
sort of the thoughts or whatever is going on and it sort of whatever was inside me

163
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:07,839
was sort of floating up the pain and whatever and was sort of this self-contained thing that people could

164
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:18,359
see anyway that image was helpful and um yeah that's all yeah

165
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:25,160
okay thank you Don I really appreciate how you're explaining that's that's a beautiful way to explore the shifting of

166
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:32,160
perspective wonderful this is is lovely um great that's one way to try this

167
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:37,480
shifting of perspective as you were saying like wow what if what if Consciousness wasn't localized here it

168
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:45,480
was from the perspective of my friend outside or compassionate being and then you and then you said it was helpful is

169
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:54,599
it okay to say a couple more words how what was the nature of it being helpful what happened yeah so um I uh I often

170
00:38:54,599 --> 00:39:00,079
have a lot of doubt and um about about many things in during meditation I have

171
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:08,240
doubt about hey am I doing this right and uh um and and I get a like a tension

172
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:13,760
and it's like this it's like right around my belly button this s like this

173
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:20,480
and and it's just like anyway that was released a little bit and it U it sort

174
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:28,760
of floated up um yeah nice nice so what I'm hearing is

175
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:35,839
that it was the sense of Doubt am I doing this right which is Habitual self-doubt and and this shifting in

176
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:42,720
perspective it there was a release it it released both physically and the doubt

177
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:48,280
itself there was just a release into more ease into what I would call more

178
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:54,079
freedom yeah exactly lovely beautiful

179
00:39:54,079 --> 00:40:00,200
yay thank you for sharing it this is exact what I was pointing to what I was

180
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:07,960
pointing to and which is exactly that shift of reference it's like oh something releases physically as well as

181
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:13,599
in the mind to more ease into more spaciousness and what I would invite you

182
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:21,400
is notice if in that ease there is more ah there's more kindness there's more

183
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:28,760
love um if you notice that or or or next time to to to check it out

184
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:35,960
yeah thank you yeah thank you Don um VI violet

185
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:45,800
please hey um I had a few interesting experiences and a question um I had this

186
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:51,839
moment at some point your invitation was something like along the lines of like your body

187
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:57,040
doesn't need you to breathe like breathing is going to happen and it felt

188
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:03,400
like like all of a sudden my sort of conscious self was who like it's like

189
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:09,760
they were like a CEO who thought they were in charge of the show and then all of a sudden it was like being at like a boardroom table looking at like all the

190
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,839
people who were actually doing the work for you the whole time it's like I thought I was in charge of everything

191
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:23,119
and then all of a sudden I was like oh my foot like my foot does work without me like I don't it's doing its own thing

192
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:28,359
and that's and it's what I realized recently if I've know noticed like when

193
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:35,480
I'm when I have awareness of like parts of my body it's not actually awareness

194
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:43,079
through the sensation I actually even like when I'm sitting it's like I'm looking at it from where my eyes are

195
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:50,960
like my knee I'm looking at it from where my eyes are I'm not actually like going through my body to the sensation

196
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,200
of the knee um and that's something I've been and

197
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:02,240
it's hard when I do walking meditation now I try and like I like wear like a really big scarf so I like can't see my

198
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:10,599
legs at all so that way I'm not like looking at them I'm like feeling them so the question I have is um I have a lot

199
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:16,040
of back pain and what was helpful with this was like taking the self out in

200
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:21,160
terms of like sensation sensation like these are like Sensations without like a

201
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:29,000
me that they're like damaging or like it's not like they're like hurting me um this isn't like an injustice to me

202
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:35,280
that I'm feeling this pain but then I've also been using a lot of like self-compassion and equinity to help

203
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:42,280
manage the pain and then at the end when it got really strong I tried to shift to that but then that felt like they were

204
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:47,400
not aligning like the experiencing the back through like no self and then like

205
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:55,440
trying to do self-compassion like I couldn't they didn't seem compatible so I was wondering about that yeah

206
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,480
excellent thank you violet really appreciate your observations and

207
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:07,040
insights and the question too um beautiful so couple of things one is

208
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:14,119
about what you shared about oh the CEO that notices oh there are other people in the room that are doing the work

209
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:21,640
so I trust you might have heard of this teaching of anata not self that self is

210
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:28,440
not what we take it to be and there are ways that we can have insight into we this self self is a little actually

211
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:36,880
different from this uh standard way we take it and there's so many different ways to have insight into this nature

212
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:43,960
of this not self or self being different and what you just described is one way

213
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:51,559
so beautiful this is just this is this can be a very powerful way of seeing that can continue to open up for you so

214
00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:57,920
continue to sit with it let it let it flourish including way you're talking

215
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:06,960
about with the back pain oh Sensations it's just Sensations being sensed um

216
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:13,640
unpleasant of feeling tone is being sensient of itself which can be very

217
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:19,520
powerful again along the lines of an not self um and then when you try to bring

218
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:26,920
in self-compassion it's like wait a minute these frames of reference AR quite working exactly so the way with

219
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:32,160
the this Paradigm self-compassion can work is that actually

220
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,559
compassion it's it's what I was leading in the meditation into that that freedom

221
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:43,240
this different shift and perspective actually has love and compassion in it

222
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:50,640
there's no giving of it to ourselves so I invite this for you to kind of like

223
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:58,680
sit it sit with and it may not be obvious right now but but it's like it's

224
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:04,280
in in the awareness of this sensation itself there is there can be a sense of

225
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:10,200
care and love in it without the reference of self it's a different way

226
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:15,520
of practicing does that kind of make sense a little bit so the awareness

227
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:22,359
itself is the meta in compassion yes it's in there it's infused it's

228
00:45:22,359 --> 00:45:27,559
infused awareness infused with meta yes

229
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:32,559
both yeah and yep yep no self-

230
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:40,000
needed thank you thank you Violet lovely Nicholas

231
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:49,119
please um I've been playfully exploring that

232
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:54,160
when thinking arises that contraction of oh you shouldn't be there why are you

233
00:45:54,160 --> 00:46:03,680
there why is that thought there why am I thinking those there it's a very fast contraction and your invitation um

234
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:09,520
something playful came up which is meeting that contraction with the question says

235
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:16,520
who who says you shouldn't be there um and

236
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:22,559
it it's fun it's fun it's a nice little space there in that

237
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:27,800
question nice so what I'm hearing is is with the contraction of oh you shouldn't

238
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:33,160
be thinking then it's kind of like oh who says who is the judgmental mind like

239
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:39,040
who is this it's like kind of questioning this frame of reference like ah it's bringing some humor some

240
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:44,599
gentleness and oh that that that question for you releases the frame of

241
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:52,000
reference a little bit and brings more freedom and ease is that what I'm hearing you yeah

242
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,440
exactly lovely and and in that there is compassion there is love because when

243
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,480
self judgment drops away there in that ease there is there's more meta in

244
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:09,240
inherently even if we don't call it out so I want to point that out to you to kind of notice that the next time lovely

245
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:17,559
I'm I'm loving Nicholas you sharing this as well as other sharing their ways like da sharing the physical you know the way

246
00:47:17,559 --> 00:47:25,319
um he found the shifting of the perspective so each of you finding your own way working with this lovely so the

247
00:47:25,319 --> 00:47:33,040
time has come for us to to um practice in sa such an important way to practice

248
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:39,720
in small groups and share our Reflections share of ourselves share our insights and share our confusion

249
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:45,559
whatever it might be and benefit from the wisdom of Sana and and and be held

250
00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:51,000
witness and and give and receive because we don't wake up we on our own and

251
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:56,559
Things become even more clarified in in this friendly way that we come together

252
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:05,040
so I will create the breakout rooms and the invitation is let's start with 30 seconds of Silent meta for each other

253
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:11,480
just 30 seconds of holding your people who are in your room just with care with

254
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:19,920
eyes of friendliness and then um you can share anything you like um as little or

255
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:25,440
as much as you wish about your practice and I'm going to open the rooms now here

hand yes Erica please and then

263
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:27,960
Neil I can just share a quick thing I shared this in my group as well um but

264
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:33,319
as we were meditating this group walked by and you could hear them laughing and

265
00:49:33,319 --> 00:49:39,920
um you know usually when I hear people laughing you know I think like oh their Joy that's like distinct from my joy and

266
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:45,240
maybe I feel a little left out or I feel like oh I'm why is the joy why don't I

267
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:50,480
ever have joy or whatever you know um but because of the invitations in this

268
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:55,680
um meditation I could like feel their Joy kind of like what Don was saying it

269
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:01,799
was like a kind of loose particles of joy you know that were not theirs but

270
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:07,799
were just available and I felt like Oh I like that Joy is like available to me

271
00:50:07,799 --> 00:50:12,839
and like participating in that joy that was a nice that was really

272
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:18,680
nice thank you for sharing that I wow I feel Goosebumps as you share that it

273
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:25,599
just this is the what beautiful practice the the the the power of this um you

274
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:31,960
know when the self is in there my joy your joy oh it's Joy there there's joy

275
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:37,440
and and the Heart the mind the the heart mind the chit awareness Consciousness

276
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:44,200

277
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:50,960
beautiful yay makes makes me happy gives me joy Neil

278
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:58,440
please so it's more than a 30 second answer I fear um

279
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:04,280
you know I find myself thinking a lot about Free Will and self-determinism and

280
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:09,960
such and you know the more I think about Lack of self and things are based on

281
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:15,240
causes and conditions you know the more I feel you

282
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:21,480
know yeah I don't know like like yeah you know yet I yet I still find myself

283
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:27,440
motivated to do things yeah you know and I'm I'm kind of stuck there I don't know

284
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:33,200
yeah yeah yeah and I'm going to give a 30 second answer to be continued so so

285
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:41,480
the idea here is is not that there is no self that's not the teaching at all and

286
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:47,760
in fact now Garian is said if you take the emptiness teachings if you take them from the wrong end it's like taking a

287
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:52,839
poisonous steak if you a PO poisonous snake if you grab it on the wrong end so

288
00:51:52,839 --> 00:51:58,400
it leads to nihilism and confusion so that that's where we'll we'll head so

289
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:04,160
it's not not self that there is no self it's it's more complicated that the self

290
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:11,240
is there is a self you exist of course you exist and yet it's the it's much

291
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:17,160
it's much more open much more complicated much more free it's both

292
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:22,359
it's neither real nor non-real um anyway that's that's getting more than 30

293
00:52:22,359 --> 00:52:29,240
seconds but um what can I say that could be helpful besides that yes there is a

294
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:36,160
self that the teaching is is not a negation of self um and with the idea of

295
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:43,440
Free Will um yeah Buddhism has a lot to it kind of obviates the whole Free Will

296
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:48,920
idea through I mean there's a lot I've thought about this a lot and there's a lot of writing that you can also find on

297
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:54,400
the web um but the idea is is there is

298
00:52:54,400 --> 00:53:01,400
oh this is going to be so much longer than 30 seconds to be continued Neil to be

299
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:07,960
continued so let's continue this another time this

300
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:14,839
is 702 I I do want to bring it to a close I have so much to say about this but we'll give a good D and talk about

301
00:53:14,839 --> 00:53:21,760
this sometime anyway thank you all thank you so much for your questions for your curiosity for your practice for your

302
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:27,000
heart may all beings be free happy

303
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,880
um joyous including

304
00:53:32,599 --> 00:53:38,720
ourselves thank you for your practice and
