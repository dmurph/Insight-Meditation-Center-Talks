1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:06,359
so to thinking about Earth care I love the

2
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,840
word care because it has so many connotations

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,279
you can one is to have care for something is to be concerned for its

4
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:23,939
well-being and it doesn't have to be limited to animate beings we care for objects we

5
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:30,539
care for you know all kinds of things that we care for that are inanimate that are

6
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:36,420
maybe important for us in various ways and to care for it is to be concerned for its well-being

7
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,540
to keep it in the way that it makes it sustainable and honored or respected a

8
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:49,980
lot that kept clean perhaps depending on what it is and uh kept keep something healthy or

9
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:56,760
functioning caring for your car just means making sure that it runs well enough I suppose that some people care

10
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,820
for their car and it means waxing it every Sunday you know there's all kinds of things that people do

11
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:09,600
but uh care also implies not only a concern but also actions like cleaning

12
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,659
the car or helping a neighbor caring for a neighbor

13
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:21,600
and um so but those actions in that care can be overlapped with the idea of compassion

14
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,939
and love and kindness we're to offer care is to offer some of

15
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,979
the most important ways that human beings um

16
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:40,400
you know care for each other connect to each other support each other they we have you know child care that

17
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:47,700
when my first son first went to preschool I was one of those parents who has little been tears about so

18
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:54,659
appreciative of the preschool teachers caring for my you know caring for my son and it was such a profound thing for me

19
00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:00,540
to feel someone else's care and and um in some ways the same way I felt

20
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,880
somewhat similar well last week I suppose it was or two weeks ago where

21
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,039
um my mother died and I accompanied her with the mortician who

22
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:18,360
came to put her on the on the gurney and and wrap her up and accompany her out to the

23
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,780
van that we're going to take her away and and then thinking about where she was going the funeral home and for

24
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:30,660
cremation and I felt kind of tenderly moved I was entrusting them to

25
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:37,140
entrusting her to um to their care and it meant something for me that you

26
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:43,019
know that you know it meant like something profound for me that they were kind of caring for her in her last

27
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:50,580
times in this body kind of and so this idea of care is very touching and paternal care which it kind

28
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:56,519
of is a necessary for children to grow up well is to feel paternal care and

29
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:03,300
that children growing up who don't feel their care of their parents the

30
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,400
um you know they grow up Kind of Rescue something goes a little bit dysfunctional there

31
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:15,540
and I like the word care because more commonly we talk about parental love and but there are parents who love their

32
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:22,739
kids who don't care for them or the cares a little bit Askew and so you know just to limit it just to

33
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:29,040
love kind of maybe it's not the full equation to care and uh

34
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,580
and so Earth care what is all about all the things that implies and what is the Earth

35
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:41,400
um and what does what does it mean to care for it and one of the things that it means for me is this very profound

36
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:48,840
Buddhist principle uh for us to support what supports us

37
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:55,980
that whatever supports us is something for us to support in return and whether it's our community or people

38
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:01,220
around us or it's the the natural world it's the Earth itself

39
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:06,659
the whole earth with all its people somehow we have this very profound

40
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:13,140
connection that where does the where's the limit where's the where's the boundaries

41
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:19,440
of what supports us as individuals where's the boundaries for what supports us as a community

42
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:26,100
you notice it you know Redwood City has boundaries is that it

43
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,919
you know that's all that that's my community that supports me and I'm not going to care about anybody else

44
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:38,639
and obviously not right there's the support circles or support to extend outward and outward and outward and

45
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:46,440
these days it's pretty clear it extends to the whole world with that uh so much of what we consume

46
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:51,540
and and receive and are influenced by it comes

47
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:57,660
from come from anywhere in this planet so we're supported by this wide range

48
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,880
and so do we support it in return and this idea of mutual support what

49
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,160
does that look like and why would we do it why would we care about the Earth why

50
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,259
would we care about you know you know natural resources why we would

51
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:19,139
care what happens to the species in this planet whether they go extinct or not

52
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:25,800
and you can give an argument that you know it's very logical and they can lay out the data and you know and really lay

53
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:32,419
out why in a practical way but that's not the specialty of Buddhism

54
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,479
so when I was Anew to practice actually then it just occurred to me before I

55
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:46,560
started practicing when I went to college first months in college I had we had this communal

56
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:53,639
you know bathroom we shared in the dorm and um and I had a friend who would

57
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:59,100
brush her teeth next to mine sometimes and she did a really strange

58
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:05,100
thing she turned the faucet off when she wasn't using the water for

59
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:11,699
brushing her teeth you'd wear wet her toothbrush turn the water off to brush her teeth turn it on get it wet again

60
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:17,940
back and forth but she's always turning it off and I'm like what's that about why would someone turn off the water

61
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:23,940
that was mystifying to me and um and then at some point she said

62
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:31,139
you know I'm conserving water and now but why would someone do that

63
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:38,460
and then when I first got interested in Buddhism I went to a Zen Center in Los Angeles

64
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:43,940
and the way that they did the evening schedule you did a period of meditation

65
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:51,120
sitting meditation a short period of walking meditation and then another sitting meditation and then a Dharma

66
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,660
talk and the walking meditation was all done together in a kind of a circle and it's really

67
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:02,880
slow so you're walking behind someone you know being really attentive and present

68
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:09,900
and there was a someone in Black robes and robes maybe a priest or a monk or

69
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:15,120
something that was in front of me and we sit on these black like these

70
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,300
here with their Zen things that we have here it's black uh mats that I'm sitting on if there's a meditation mats so in

71
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:26,819
Zen they have they all have that black mats and they're lined up in the room and one of them as we were going around

72
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:33,599
was slightly askew and um so there's a priest or this

73
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:39,660
practitioner in front of me uh she kind of matter of factly bent down and straightened it out

74
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:46,680
and then again why did she do that why bother why would you straighten something out

75
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,020
it was I mystified by this strange Behavior so I'm I was I was strange

76
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:57,840
right so you have to appreciate that maybe uh foreign

77
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:04,580
who knows what influences Me growing up but anyway so so why did you do that

78
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,560
and then uh just a little while later there was a senior practitioner when I

79
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,900
was at the San Francisco Zen Center who was receiving a kind of an admin

80
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:22,440
role received a letter fundraising letter from a neighborhood non-profit that was doing work in the neighborhood

81
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:28,319
for some kind of good work I'm not sure what it was and he showed me the letter like I don't

82
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:34,200
know I don't know why she showed it to me oh yeah and then he asked me again like what do you think how much should I should I give

83
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,839
and I was kind of mystified to give why what's this about

84
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:45,300
and I didn't compute quite and so uh and they thought oh you know I'll send fifty

85
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:50,700
dollars he said and I said what why so you know

86
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:58,019
it feels very strange to even say this that'd be so so mystified by these strange simple things

87
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:03,060
and then uh I came to I was living at his and practicing at um during a

88
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:09,899
retreat that is then Retreat and I was having tea in a little bit formal way with the Japanese visiting Japanese monk

89
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:15,240
sitting next to me and it was time to the people came around and collected the teacups when

90
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,660
you finished having tea and before he was going to let the handists teacup back to the people who receive it taking

91
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:28,800
it he bowed to the teacup why would you bow to the teacup

92
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:36,000
that there's nothing that is a world why would you if a tea it's a teacup it's inanimate it's just a thing you

93
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,959
know why would you bow to a teacup so um so that's kind of you know how

94
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:50,580
clueless I was at some point in life and um and so uh but what Buddhism

95
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:57,180
reveals as you practice it um is How Deeply we're connected How

96
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:03,720
Deeply we're part of for an intimately related to teacups and water and

97
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:09,300
neighborhood community and and uh and even in some way we're actually related

98
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:15,600
we're almost like kin to the way the math is down there on the on the floor

99
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,640
and you know straightening it out does not straightening out the mat it's maybe straightening of oneself

100
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:26,459
you know what's going on there what is this connection we have so then you come to uh the kind of

101
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:33,660
Buddhist teaching and we have this very important word Dharma and uh it often represents the Buddha's

102
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:38,760
teaching the Dharma but Dharma is also the word in the

103
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:44,399
ancient language which is the best match for the English word nature

104
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,980
I don't know of any other word that it fits as well and it's used that way sometimes it goes in dictionary you see

105
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:56,040
that it's one of the definitions of it it has a lot of as other meanings as well but that's one of its important

106
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:01,320
meanings and um and if you make it instrument that the word Dharma into an abstract

107
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:08,579
noun then um translators will translate it as

108
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:15,180
a natural it's natural as part of the natural order of things it's a natural thing

109
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:21,839
so Dharma but what is Dharma besides it maybe being nature it's kind of abstract there's a very famous

110
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:29,579
um very famous little slogan from the early tradition that to see the Dharma

111
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:35,180
you see the Dharma in how things are interrelated

112
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:42,779
and when you see how things are interrelated you see the Dharma and the way this is discussed is in a

113
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:48,060
particular way the interrelatedness is on the way in which things are arise

114
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:55,800
occur exist depend on other things depending on the support of other things

115
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:02,640
they rest we rest on things and then when they get a little bit more sophisticated they recognize that some

116
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:08,100
things co-arize they arise together mutually supporting each other

117
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:13,260
and um and so if Dharma is nature where

118
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:19,800
is nature is nature found in the trees outside in the squirrels is it found in the weather

119
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:25,200
is it found in the whole shebang of this whole you know everything that's kind of

120
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:32,160
born from natural conditions what is nature and one baby maybe very profound way of

121
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,860
understanding it that kind of turns things around for us in a I think a profound way

122
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:44,459
is that nature is not found in a tree or the squirrel in things or in you even

123
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:50,100
exactly nature is found in the relationship between things the

124
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:55,200
relatedness how how things exist in kinship with

125
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:01,019
each other and that relationship is a little bit invisible

126
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:06,540
you know it's like you can't touch it you know you can't you know I can hit the Bell

127
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:15,180
um and uh but is the Bell nature is my fingernail hits the Bell nature

128
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:20,459
for people who like to focus on the world of things I'm here and things are

129
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:25,620
up there then it makes sense that out there is nature just beyond the edges of

130
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:32,519
the city is the natural world some people will say um and and I used to say that as well

131
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:39,240
and it was quite a surprise for me when I spent three years practicing in tosahara Zen Monastery which is in the

132
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:45,360
wilderness really in the wilderness in Los Padres National Wilderness at sir

133
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,000
and Inland from Santa Cruz uh Big Sur the

134
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,120
coast of Big Sur and um and after almost three years living

135
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,360
there I went back to live in San Francisco and one of the big surprises was after

136
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:09,300
that experience of deep monastic practice was I started seeing nature

137
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:15,660
everywhere I saw it on the in the asphalt in the city in the cars of San Francisco I saw

138
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:23,100
those that's too as part of nature but it was still a little bit outside of myself and what I didn't see then was

139
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,860
that the reason I could see it as nature had to do with the way that I was relating

140
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:35,160
to cars and everything had changed and uh rationally I explained it not

141
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:41,459
that way I explained it everything comes out of nature everything's coeg Rising together and we can't really point to

142
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:47,120
anything which is not nature it's kind of how I

143
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,440
explained it to myself but I think what was really happening is with the way in

144
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:58,920
which I was relating the relationship that I was forming or was being formed because a relationship is not something

145
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:07,440
that only comes from me it's mutual it happens together and uh and that relationship is where

146
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,980
maybe what nature is at least in this Buddhist idea where Dharma is called nature

147
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:19,860
and and so what if that relationship is kind of so important to pay attention to

148
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:26,579
what's the nature of that relationship and that's where Dharma Brethren and

149
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:33,480
Buddhism you come up with idea of karma karma is our contribution to that

150
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:40,740
relationship the actions the things we do things we say even the things we things we think

151
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:47,940
and believe has an influence on that relationship that we are in with everything with the

152
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:54,660
water that we get from our sink with um the local neighborhood with the

153
00:15:54,660 --> 00:16:02,160
teacups whatever it might be that relationship is influenced we

154
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:10,019
contribute to the nature of that relationship and um and so in a simple way if we

155
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:17,519
contribute if we hate something or hate someone that relationship has qualities of that

156
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:24,240
hate in it I've known people who have a predisposition to being angry

157
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,279
and there I get angry at all kinds of things and they're upset with the world the world's not doing the right thing

158
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:36,839
and I could watch and see how the world responds to those people people don't like it

159
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:43,560
of course people don't like those people because they're coming at them you know expecting and mistrusting

160
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:50,579
them and suspicious already kind of like thinking that you're wrong and so then it's a self-fulfilling

161
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:57,779
prophecy and so that relationship gets formed in a certain way that's shared it doesn't have to be but

162
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:04,040
and I've watched and seen how people who are kind or supportive or friendly

163
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:11,699
disarm people who are angry or hostile uh sometimes you know you see that you

164
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:18,058
bring something to the relationship and it helps shape the relationship of course there's no guarantee just

165
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:24,298
because you're kind that it's going to change it but uh it can make a huge difference

166
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:30,120
um I I was once saved from a violent attacks I don't know how serious it would have been

167
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:37,020
by my friend who was so amazingly both kind friendly

168
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:43,740
and funny and that he disarmed the people who wanted to attack

169
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:49,500
and uh I didn't I don't I didn't have that ability but that was quite impressive to see

170
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:55,860
so what do we bring so karma has to do with our contribution to that relationship

171
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:02,520
and it gets even more interesting is the karma that we bring the attitudes

172
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,580
the approach we have to what we do what we contribute

173
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:13,080
is also the Dharma of ourselves meaning it's

174
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,419
also the relationship we have with ourselves you can't hate

175
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:24,799
without it affecting you you can't be kind without it affecting you

176
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:31,799
in Buddhism they have dramatic language for this that hate is a poison

177
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:38,760
guess who is poisoning it's poisoning you and it can poison the world but this is where it really has

178
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:46,440
the biggest poison craving and greed is considered a poison it's dramatic language maybe some of you

179
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,539
won't like it that this way but but the what it's pointing to is this way in

180
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:57,780
which the karma what we contribute to the relationship can actually has an

181
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:02,820
effect on us as well so if we live

182
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:10,440
with greed and craving then it comes back and bites us

183
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:16,880
it also creates a skewed relationship out in the world

184
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,980
but it's invisible right so who cares you know it's not obvious so you know

185
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:30,660
probably most people don't think that they're rampant consumerism consumerists

186
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:36,660
but we have a society as a whole that is and that does it to a lot of people all

187
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:42,059
over the world now don't do it without much thought there's a lot of conceit there's a lot

188
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:47,220
of idea me and I want my things for myself I do acquisitionness you know

189
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:53,340
acquisition null kind of quality of I want this and then went down to one don't want it

190
00:19:53,340 --> 00:20:00,179
anymore then I throw it away and someone else is going to take care of it I mean I pay people I pay the trash

191
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:06,000
people to take it away so not my responsibility but and so and there's a kind of

192
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,620
ignorance there there's a kind of uh forfeiting of responsibility maybe it's okay in some kind of abstract

193
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:19,080
way I'll do it that way but it's a lost opportunity

194
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:26,280
the most precious thing we have the most valuable thing we have is the contribution we make

195
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:33,660
to how we relate to this earth to this world to others that's the real treasure

196
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:38,820
and you can feel it I hope if you meditate enough in meditation that's the

197
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:44,880
case I've been meditating now for about 50 years so you know I have a little bit of

198
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:52,860
experience around it but the main thing reason I say it is that I still to this day

199
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:59,039
um but literally this day when I meditated this morning is uh I'm going around the kitchen and

200
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:06,660
getting ready to meditate and doing stuff and that didn't get too much trouble just time I woke up and sat down

201
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:12,620
and um but if I sat down to meditate it was so good to sit down and I noticed

202
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:19,559
that my mind had already began spinning a little bit where there was a kind of compelling

203
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:26,580
feeling like it's all you know like I'm on the right track like this has to be done I should do this and and this is

204
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:33,780
important and um and it was a little bit kind of self-centered in my little universe

205
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:41,880
and then I sat down to meditate and that just kind of dissolved and what was left was so much better

206
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:50,159
this is real this felt like this is like I feel I felt free I felt warm I felt I

207
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:56,820
felt centered I felt at peace at ease in a way that I felt all I'm healthy everything was present

208
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:03,299
and in contrast to what I saw was I was deluded for those few minutes in the

209
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:08,460
kitchen in a certain kind of way ignorant I was being Swept Away by the

210
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:15,299
by the things I had to think about and do and all this kind of stuff and it was enough and I didn't see how I

211
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:22,620
was losing my ease losing being connected in some deep way it's that easy

212
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:27,720
and imagine if someone never has a way of disconnecting from that they believed

213
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:33,360
their minds they believed the momentum they believed the desires the wishes that conceits it's about me and what's

214
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,460
best to happen it's radical to shift that move out of

215
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:45,539
that and come into a place where we have a chance to relate

216
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:50,820
in from a place of Health from a place of being centered and easeful being at

217
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:56,539
peace and so when we talk about Earth care

218
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:03,780
it can come across as Duty as obligation we have a responsibility

219
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:12,059
to do something and let's go out there and fight the good cause and let's kind of shame everybody else into

220
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:18,440
doing it too something something like that can happen occasionally

221
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:24,780
um but I think from a Buddhist point of view My Hope Is that we were tiredly

222
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:32,280
tirelessly care for the world for the Earth entire sleep but not because it's an obligation

223
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:39,600
because it's the most natural thing to do in the kind of relationship

224
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:46,320
that is the healthiest most meaningful most inspiring way to live in this world

225
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,360
anything short of that probably doesn't come from this natural place

226
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:56,580
where we're creating a healthy relatedness

227
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:02,820
where we honor the relationship we we respect it we understand it

228
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:08,700
where we have this cup of tea and I don't think the cup may be itself

229
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:14,520
responds to the monk about to it but

230
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:20,100
what a radically different relationship that that monk has to the cup of tea

231
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:26,159
than someone who just tosses it in the trash can because they don't want to bother cleaning it no no there's so many

232
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:32,220
teacups of this at the Zen Center so you know I don't have time it's a very different relationship

233
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:39,659
I hear this beautiful story yesterday of a Native American a professor a professor a Lakota man

234
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:49,080
who's a professor I mean I think of Environmental Studies in somewhere and um so he told my friend the story of

235
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:54,960
of having an undergraduate class and maybe Environmental Studies

236
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:01,140
and the first day of class the students come and sit down and he stands in front of the class and he says

237
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:06,539
um I have an unusual request if you kind of please do it you know you know every

238
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:13,440
unusual request but if you would please look be any kind would you something can you I know you just sat down could

239
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:19,440
you get up and go outside and touch a tree and they people looked at each other and like

240
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:26,460
apparently they weren't so enthusiastic but what's this going on we came to learn or something but they went out and touched the tree

241
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:33,539
and then they came back sat down and he said well I know you touched the tree I know this is a really strange request

242
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:39,240
but I'm going to ask you to go do it again but however this time before you touch a

243
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:45,919
tree wait until the tree gives you permission to be touched

244
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:53,400
and so they went out and did it and when they came back into the class the students were in a whole different state

245
00:25:53,400 --> 00:26:00,240
of mind they were kind of quiet reverential they were kind of ready to learn they were

246
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:07,260
they something had softened in them you know their relationship was to learn it was had shifted

247
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:13,320
from that simple exercise he had them enter into a relationship

248
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:18,840
with the trees and whether trees can really give us

249
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:26,340
permission is maybe less important

250
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:32,760
that something transpires in the relationship between the trees and you

251
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:40,820
that you feel that's there's a there's an imitation a permission a request

252
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:48,240
When I Was An undergraduate I took botany and

253
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:56,220
I was so amazed by the beautiful Circle uh circles written on the chalkboard of

254
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:03,480
the oxygen carbon dioxide kind of cycles that go on with the plants and you know they make the oxygen that we need and we

255
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:09,840
make the carbon dioxide that they need partly you know so this wonderful cycle and then I went out into this Courtyard

256
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:15,600
in Davis California where they have this Majestic old oak trees in the courtyard of the

257
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:21,720
Auditorium and I just was stood in the middle of the courtyard stunned

258
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:28,440
by the trees and wondering where do I end and where the trees begin where the

259
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:34,919
trees end and where do I begin I could give away one of my kidneys was my hand

260
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:40,679
all kinds of parts of my body I don't really have to have to live but I need those trees

261
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:47,580
to be alive where's the who where am I who am I what's going on here I stood there in

262
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:53,100
silence kind of just in awe of it all that was a very different way of

263
00:27:53,100 --> 00:28:00,779
relating to the trees they know that that looks like firewood yeah and I think you know I need to be

264
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:09,539
warm so I'm going to take my ax and chop it down we are supported by what supports us

265
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:14,760
no I say what supports us is what we want to support if we don't support what

266
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:21,000
supports us we just destroy our support and that's what we're seeing we've seen

267
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,279
down through history now through the centuries we've seen this and I grew up

268
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:32,880
you know in places in the world there's been visiting and I lived right on the

269
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:39,659
um on the Adriatic Coast for a while and uh in a city in Italy called Trieste

270
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:44,700
right on the border with what was then Yugoslavia and we used to go down

271
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:50,880
the coast of uslovia beautiful islands Stark and Stony

272
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:56,580
they used to be covered with soil and trees and but they were denuded and all the

273
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:02,580
all the water rushed away because they they thought they harvested all the trees to build room

274
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:08,580
and things like that we've seen Down Through the Ages that people human beings have overextended

275
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:16,980
their agriculture their wood cutting their farming all kinds of things and destroyed the place of support

276
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:22,380
so it's not a new thing for us to be doing in our generation but there are places in the world where

277
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:28,399
that's happening and perhaps it's what's changed is the scale of it

278
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:35,279
and so we come back to Buddhism what we have to offer for this we have this beautiful principle

279
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:42,840
that we wanted we want to live in in attuned to our relationship our

280
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:48,419
relatedness our relationships because that's the heart of where nature is found

281
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:53,460
and we contribute to that to the degree to which we have agency

282
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:58,980
we're contributed to that relationship and we want to be careful that we

283
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:04,500
contribute something which is healthy something gets me that really is healthy

284
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:10,260
for us as individuals as a community and healthy for the world of itself for the

285
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:15,980
natural world itself that's represented by the slogan that

286
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:23,760
to support what supports us we support what supports us it would be the ideal

287
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:30,480
and so here we have this Earth care day which is celebrating this possibility

288
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,600
celebrating that the the Dual meaning of Earth care

289
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:42,240
could also mean that uh we're recognizing the Earth cares for us

290
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,880
that Earth care day is recognizing how we're cared for how we're supported

291
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:53,100
and it can mean the day the day that during the week the week that we

292
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:59,419
that consider and reflect on caring for the Earth

293
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:04,740
and so in saying all this to summarize now

294
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:12,419
at the heart of it this is Buddhist practice is caring

295
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:20,399
for the attitude the motivation the contribution that we offer to that

296
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:26,399
relationship and uh and if we care for that

297
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:33,000
then I think we'll find how to care for others for the world for people and

298
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,399
everything in a way that doesn't it doesn't drain us doesn't oppress us but

299
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:44,340
rather we'll learn how to do it in a way that uh feels natural it feels like this

300
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:50,880
is this is what we were built to do this is how humans were made to be this way

301
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,700
something that's very hard to appreciate unless you have some way of connecting

302
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:04,620
to the deeper sources within us than what the places of real real Health that

303
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:11,779
goes on inside or connecting to

304
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:17,778
the tree that we ask permission to touch

305
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:25,080
the strawberry plant we wait to pick the strawberry until it feels that we recognize that the plant

306
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:33,299
says it's okay now why would you do that maybe because there's a shift there's a

307
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:38,760
change there's a there's a receptivity there's an openness there's a caring

308
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:44,100
there's a attentiveness in that of course questions

309
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:49,679
that brings forth something deep within ourselves that we then contribute

310
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,840
to our kinship with all things

311
00:32:54,779 --> 00:33:02,179
so um the Earth care week so in a few minutes we'll have this

312
00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:09,539
chance to have tea and talk with each other and and meet with the Earth care committee but before we do we ended a

313
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:16,320
little early like to just start doing what we used to do before the pandemic

314
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:23,820
um is to uh for those of you who are comfortable with this simply turn to someone who's near you and say hello and

315
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:31,200
introduce yourself there's a lot of people here who've been here for the first time today maybe and um and also if you care for it you

316
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,658
might want to say oh Hillary wants to say something
