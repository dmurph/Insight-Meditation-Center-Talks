1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:07,960
okay welcome uh welcome folks good to be with you

2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:17,480
um I fell asleep when I meditated a little while

3
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:23,880
ago and uh so I it the theme didn't exactly

4
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:30,880
emerge with a tremendous inspiration but uh we will find our way

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,440
no matter what condition our minds are in and

6
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,000
um find your posture

7
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,720
maybe you relax absolutely everything as if you were going to

8
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:27,280
sleep except the brightness of the

9
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,600
mind and a

10
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:55,640
luminosity let me see how deeply we can relax everything else

11
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,600
staying tethered to the light of the mind

12
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,480
maybe just being here

13
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:09,879
together tethered by electrons and

14
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:21,000
love maybe that's enough to support the brightness of your mind

15
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:18,359
whatever it feels like needs to be done you need to

16
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:23,720
do uh just relax that too

17
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:29,479
they sense all the busyiness and complication of clinging

18
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,520
conniving and strategizing

19
00:05:52,080 --> 00:06:00,840
sense the taxing quality of willfulness

20
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:33,080
what's left in the wake of letting go

21
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:50,120
what brightness is not governed by you your

22
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,120
willfulness clinging

23
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:48,918
we just keep relaxing until we're wide awake

24
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:41,079
the sense of self is experienced as a kind of knot of tension

25
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,920
deeply can that be relaxed

26
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,920
more safe we feel the

27
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:17,200
less entranced by uh clinging we

28
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:31,320
become the more our mind flows out all directions

29
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,279
like a hangail snagging on fabric the

30
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:39,440
attention snags on

31
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:52,319
phenomena we keep

32
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,120
relaxing softening

33
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,480
widen Hey

34
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,600
The experience of um being

35
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:56,400
you is a kind of reiteration

36
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:06,559
arises ceases but then uh rear arises

37
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:15,240
again and creates the impression of um continuity

38
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:03,960
how deep does a nature run

39
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,278
if the self is uh done by

40
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:43,039
grasping we're invited to become

41
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:54,278
uh deeply unafraid deeply unattached

42
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:08,320
see how much of the self melts becomes porous

43
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,720
fluid is enlarged

44
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,339
[Music]

45
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:15,039
okay it's good to uh good to sit with

46
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:24,000
you so I remember um long long time ago

47
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:31,919
uh I was returning from from a retreat and uh was telling a friend about a a a

48
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:40,880
dissolution experience a kind of prolonged experience of the self um

49
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:48,640
having no trace whatsoever and kind of uh melting away of of agency and

50
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:54,559
boundaries and center you know sense of centerlessness everything everything was

51
00:30:54,559 --> 00:31:00,919
the background there's no foreground background is like everything was

52
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:06,360
background and um it was exquisitly

53
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:13,960
peaceful and as I'm describing it she's laughing saying this sounds

54
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:23,799
horrible you know and um when um people describe a kind of

55
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:32,480
emptiness is descriptions often echo uh some unsettling kind of

56
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:38,919
psychiatric symptoms and uh de

57
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:44,159
depersonalization derealization characterized by feeling

58
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:50,559
kind of uh very detached from one's feelings and experiencing the one's

59
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:59,880
surroundings and objects and people as um people often say unreal or distant or

60
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:05,159
artificial or lifeless and yet the person experiencing

61
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:10,840
that is their their reality testing it remains intact they're

62
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:16,640
not having um psychotic symptoms

63
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,679
uh but it leads to huge distress and impairment and

64
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:28,360
uh almost everybody with that has co- co-occurring depression

65
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:35,200
anxiety conditions and here's nega describing

66
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:41,360
the uh the positive dimensions of emptiness says whenever there's belief

67
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:47,519
that things are real desire and hatred spring unendingly

68
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:52,720
unh wholesome views are entertained from which all disputes come indeed this is

69
00:32:52,720 --> 00:33:00,919
the source of every view without it no defilement can occur thus when dependent

70
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:08,559
origination is completely understood all views and afflictions vanish

71
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:17,120
utterly so that sounds good but I've often thought that there might

72
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:24,880
be some overlap if you were neuroiming a brain on emptiness and a person

73
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:31,240
experiencing derealization I would imagine there'd be some

74
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:36,519
overlaps and I I don't want to say that they're the same

75
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:42,320
experience but the they kind of rhyme a little with

76
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:48,039
each other and so then the question is what

77
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:56,240
accounts for the difference between uh nourishing and terrifying dissolution

78
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,240
experiences

79
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:08,040
uh the researcher uh Aviva Burkovich

80
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:13,878
Ohana and uh meditation teacher Steven Fuler and some of their

81
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:23,040
colleagues published a paper that I I just saw yeah I think yesterday and um examining that that

82
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:28,599
question and it's more complex study I'll post the study in the uh YouTube uh

83
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:33,839
description um uh and I won't go over all of it but

84
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:39,520
want to speak to some elements of it so

85
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:45,919
um as uh as animals like knowing what's going to happen next is of paramount

86
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:55,638
importance i sort of say that often and um and that um our our brains are

87
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:02,160
continuously generating and updating models of self

88
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:10,560
and world and uh these these authors and we we we

89
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:17,359
start to get more sensitive to that that's what I was alluding to in the SID a little you know that the that kind of

90
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:23,359
sense of the reiteration of the model that creates it's like happening fast

91
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:28,839
enough that there's um a sense of

92
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:35,359
continuity and the uh the authors argue that the basic experience of phenomenal

93
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:40,640
selfhood phenomenal is in like the subjective experience of self the

94
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:47,839
experience of feeling like a self this arises as a function of those

95
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:58,119
modeling processes you know and even the the sense of existing

96
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:05,280
existing emerges from some of that predictive

97
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:12,040
processing and we we usually uh consider the

98
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:17,680
um the sense of self as the cause of things i choose to do this i choose to

99
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:25,599
do that i did it myself did it but in Buddhist psychology the sense of self is

100
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:31,800
an effect of things not a cause the

101
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:37,440
self is uh I might say an effect

102
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:43,720
of fear an effect of

103
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:48,400
fear the consequence of

104
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:54,200
fear and there's no greater fear than

105
00:36:54,200 --> 00:37:03,160
death and death denial um is considered a kind of uh

106
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:09,720
transdiagnostic construct so across many different forms of psych psychological

107
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:15,000
distress there's elevations of um death

108
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:21,680
anxiety and of course anybody with even without any you know elevated psych

109
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:30,480
psychological distress is likely uh a lot of feeling of course around

110
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:38,560
death and this um this fear term leads us to associate death with the other not

111
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:45,400
with self and in a way it can sometimes have the sense of like this subtle

112
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,680
default assumption of

113
00:37:51,800 --> 00:38:00,760
immortality so what what does death um threaten seems to threaten

114
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:08,680
everything but the very foundation the sense of

115
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:15,200
self is a target that is put under direct threat

116
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,560
by the prospect of mortality

117
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:29,640
and Andrea Steven Levine asked the question in the the title of a book who

118
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:37,760
dies who dies and this sense of self is it's not the

119
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:45,880
only part but I think it's a part of what makes death so

120
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:56,200
terrifying and it feels like death pertains to to me the kind of me inside

121
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:04,040
me it pertains to the seat of subjectivity the center

122
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:10,359
and in in kind of dissolution experiences that comes

123
00:39:10,359 --> 00:39:18,960
under threat you know the there's a kind of sometimes a fear of non-being the

124
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:25,440
Buddha described um bavatanha the craving to become

125
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:34,760
craving to become the kind of perpetuation of meanness or the perpetuation of a

126
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:42,359
something into the future and dissolution

127
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:49,078
um is the extinguishing of bhavatanha

128
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,680
and so what the the researchers found um

129
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:01,000
previously and you know prior study was that the depth of

130
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,520
dissolution was not correlated with bliss or terror so it wasn't like if you

131
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:14,480
partially melted it's bad it's unpleasant and if you fully fully melt

132
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:20,920
it it's good what the researchers found was

133
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:27,880
that higher levels of death anxiety led to more

134
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:35,000
fearful dissolution experiences derealization

135
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:44,800
depersonalization um that was negatively valued unpleasant fearful terrifying

136
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:50,680
anxious and when one's um

137
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:58,560
relationship with death is deeply unsettled the dissolution experience is

138
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:07,240
sensed as a kind of attack a mortal attack the sense of self

139
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:13,640
and so in dharma practice we contemplate

140
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:19,599
endings mortality groundlessness we place a niche

141
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:26,760
impermanence at the center of all things and

142
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:34,640
then dissolution maybe uh doesn't feel like it threatens as

143
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,640
much

144
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,640
there's still

145
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:55,359
loss but that sense of like the kernel of one's being perishing under the tides

146
00:41:55,359 --> 00:42:00,960
of change and mortality that can

147
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:08,240
shift and there's still a goodbye but a

148
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:14,880
different kind of goodbye and Levine writes death

149
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:23,200
somewhere I think in in a year to live that that book um death is perfectly

150
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:35,200
safe letting go is um kind of rehearsal dying

151
00:42:37,319 --> 00:42:41,319
concert and

152
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:47,839
uh don't mistake what I'm saying uh I I

153
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:54,680
don't I don't think it's my view but I don't think

154
00:42:54,680 --> 00:43:01,760
even enlightenment is a perfect consolation for

155
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:08,079
death not perfect in other words maybe grief is a

156
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:13,720
kind of irreducible part of the

157
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:20,480
universe to my mind it can't be can't be refined

158
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:30,280
further but the dharma really helps and it helps with

159
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:36,079
um the most fundamental problem for all

160
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:40,800
animals and maybe this

161
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,318
um bolsters our courage

162
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:54,240
In this period of um moral

163
00:43:54,839 --> 00:44:00,200
decrepitude I don't know how I'll be asked to

164
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:06,839
spend my modest courage but I do know that I'm being

165
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:11,560
asked to develop it

166
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:21,079
maybe so okay offer this for your consideration
