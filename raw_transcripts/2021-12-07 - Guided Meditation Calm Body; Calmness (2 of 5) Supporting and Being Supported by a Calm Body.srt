00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:09,040
okay so again warm greetings and happy to be here with all of you and

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,679
this week where we're considering exploring the topic of calm calmness

3
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:21,600
and one of the frequent references in

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,279
teaching so the buddha to calmness is physical tranquility

5
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:34,239
so not just a mental calm but a physical calm as well and uh in preparation for this

6
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,480
meditation imagine that you are maybe

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,719
you know a little bit tired and worked hard during the day or something or came in out of the cold

8
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:53,039
and you sat down in a very comfortable chair

9
00:00:53,039 --> 00:01:00,000
and you and it just felt so good to be received

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,079
by the chair and settle into the chair and you can just let go and relax so many of your muscles and everything

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,680
so in the same way it's possible to take an alert posture an upright posture a

12
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,360
good posture for meditation and then inwardly

13
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,600
somehow in that you know in the back side of your muscles

14
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,640
or something i have the same feeling or movement of

15
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:37,280
settling into a comfortable chair so settling in even if your body has some discomfort and it takes some work

16
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,360
to effort to hold your posture upright

17
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,799
the um something inside of you perhaps can have the feeling or allow it to have

18
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:55,600
the feeling of relaxing into the posture

19
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:02,079
into a posture that's not moving that's still a posture that will

20
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:08,879
receive you that'll contain your experience

21
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:15,520
and to settle in and let that the stillness of the body

22
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:24,319
the calmness of the body whatever you can feel be a support for the meditation

23
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:32,239
so assuming your meditative posture

24
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:41,360
and gently lowering your gaze relaxing your gaze

25
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,720
and if it's comfortable to close your eyes

26
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,879
and take a few moments to with your eyes closed or

27
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,800
to make small adjustments in your posture

28
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,720
small adjustments in the alignment of your spine

29
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:24,400
the positioning of your shoulders sometimes shoulders can come back a

30
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,080
little bit so they're not rolling forward

31
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:40,720
feeling how the weight of your body centers itself on your sitting bones

32
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:47,480
is the center of gravity in front of the sitting bones behind the sitting bones

33
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,680
can you make some adjustments so the center gravity of your body is

34
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,280
comes down through the sitting bones

35
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:16,479
and then taking a few long slow deep in-breaths as you exhale

36
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:25,479
settle into your posture relax into your postures if you're settling into a comfortable chair

37
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:03,520
and then letting your breathing return to normal and continuing the process of

38
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:11,440
relaxing into your body as if the body both relaxes and the body is what

39
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:18,160
receives the relaxation maybe starting with the muscles of the

40
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,960
face as you exhale relax the face

41
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,919
so

42
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,720
on the exhale relaxing the shoulders

43
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,840
as if the shoulders when they release a little are received

44
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,120
into a comfortable place

45
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,360
on the exhale relaxing the chest

46
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:22,720
relaxing the chest into whatever support the torso provides so the chest doesn't have to

47
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,680
work or be tight

48
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,759
and relaxing the belly

49
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:51,719
letting the weight of the belly to be received by the softness of the lower torso

50
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,319
on the exhale relaxing your arms and hands

51
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:18,800
perhaps all your hands are re received by whatever they're touching

52
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,800
the fingers can soften

53
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,880
and then relaxing the legs so the thighs

54
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,560
lower legs releasing any

55
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:56,800
clenching or holding and the legs are received

56
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,479
by whatever supports them

57
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,240
and then sitting here where in your body

58
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,279
do you feel the most tranquility

59
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:40,440
the most comfortable stillness

60
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:36,720
feeling whatever is calm in your body maybe there's a particular place that

61
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:45,079
relative to everything else in your body is the quiet place the calm place

62
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
and as you're sitting here

63
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,240
let the calm place support

64
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,440
a calmness of mind

65
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:53,199
in whatever physical calmness or soft stillness there is

66
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,640
let your breathing breathe with that

67
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,959
breathe through it

68
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:20,480
maybe that exhale settles into that place of physical

69
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:30,839
calmness and the inhale somehow begins from there

70
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:04,800
on the exhale either relaxing into whatever calm place

71
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,800
there is in your body whatever calmness there is

72
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,240
or if agitation or tension in the body is stronger

73
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:26,600
every exhale relax the tension

74
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,360
so

75
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,399
so

76
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,600
so

77
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:37,200
feeling whatever calmness there is in the body no matter how small

78
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:47,360
and see if the mind can rest in that

79
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:55,320
the mind can learn from that to also become

80
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,720
calmly feeling breathing

81
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,280
so

82
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,320
so

83
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:36,159
imagine that any ways in which the body is calm

84
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,880
tranquil

85
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:47,520
is a blessing on your heart

86
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:55,000
to allow yourself to receive that blessing

87
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,880
and imagine that the calmness of your body

88
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:26,640
any tranquility in your posture and bearing

89
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,480
is also a blessing on the world

90
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,039
in an agitated world

91
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:55,639
a calm person is of tremendous benefit

92
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,960
and in whatever way that we can be unagitated

93
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:30,720
may that be the vehicle through which

94
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:36,720
we care for the world care

95
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:44,398
to the care for the world with our basic friendliness

96
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,639
kindly kindness

97
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,440
generosity

98
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:06,960
perhaps assuming there's more goodness in others

99
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,840
than even they realize

100
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,480
may our ability to become

101
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,880
be the foundation for living for the welfare and happiness

102
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:33,360
of all beings may all beings be happy

103
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:41,360
may all beings be safe may all beings

104
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:46,799
be peaceful and may all beings everywhere

105
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,039
be free

106
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,559
thank you

107
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:28,240
so in the topic of calmness buddhist buddhism puts a lot of emphasis

108
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,600
on tranquility of the body

109
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:40,480
in fact the word that's often translated as tranquility is most often in the ancient texts associated

110
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:48,399
with the body the body becomes tranquil i think of it as a soft stillness

111
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:55,360
that has a feeling of clarity in it the body starts becoming feeling clear

112
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:02,559
so it's not calmness where that's a soporific or kind of a kind of

113
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:11,200
kind of letting go and luxuriating in some kind of

114
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:18,000
inaction it's a tranquility that feels vital

115
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,360
feels clear maybe even kind of um

116
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:31,279
i like the word clear if you uh there's an ancient analogy

117
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:37,600
having to do with water that in running water it's not often the

118
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:44,080
surface is so agitated or so rippling and wavy that you cannot see through the water

119
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:49,520
into the bottom of the river or the lake

120
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:58,080
but in uh you also cannot get a reflection of yourself but if the water is still

121
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:04,799
or flowing very very harmoniously and quietly and almost you can't even see it

122
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:10,080
flow you can see through it to what's below

123
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,760
and you might also see your reflection of yourself in the surface

124
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:22,559
so that analogy is used for the value of tranquility calmness

125
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:29,600
that it's hard to see the world accurately when we're agitated

126
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:35,519
and it's hard to see ourselves accurately when we're agitated

127
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:40,720
but that if we could have some modicum of calmness

128
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:47,279
the minimum calmness needed is the calmness that knows that we're agitated

129
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:54,399
really knows oh i'm agitated i'm tense i'm stressed out

130
00:31:54,399 --> 00:32:00,399
that's the beginning and then to begin but then as the calmness greater

131
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:05,519
calmness sets in then we start seeing more clearly

132
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,640
and this is one of the great functions for calmness it's not to calmness for his own sake

133
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:17,840
but calmness that sets the sets the ground for deeper states of clarity

134
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,799
stability and wisdom

135
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:29,840
so right today the topic is physical calmness

136
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:36,320
that the mind and body are closely related in some sense they're maybe not

137
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:43,919
too distinct from each other they have a very powerful relationship between them they kind of work in tandem or together

138
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:51,039
and how one is affects the other and if we are agitated in the mind jumping

139
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:57,039
around distracted jumping between one thought another

140
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:02,559
racing ahead in their minds trying to you know a crowded traffic jam of thoughts for all the things we have to

141
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:08,799
do or trying to solve or trying to fix or something

142
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:15,200
that has an impact on the body the and you can see the energy of that kind of vegetation

143
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:21,279
can um can be in the fingers and you know kind of uh tapping our fingers

144
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:26,960
playing with our fingers uh kind of two fingers with two hands kind of coming

145
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:32,559
together and kind of rubbing each other it can affect

146
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:38,000
our uh how we stand and our posture we can get the posture can get tense or

147
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,080
tight or contracted or um somehow in misaligned

148
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,919
uh it can affect what we do with our feet and like we're sitting down the feet begin swinging a lot or tapping a

149
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:55,519
lot and and it's all these are kind of an expression of this inner

150
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:00,720
agitation that might be there but the posture is something we have

151
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:07,840
more control over we have if we pay attention to the posture we can adjust the posture and what the physical

152
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:14,079
activities of the body it's possible to stop swinging the legs or tapping the legs it's possible to

153
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:22,240
stop playing with the fingers it's possible to have the arms uh relaxed in such a way

154
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:28,638
that the elbows are kind of just kind of flapping loosely on the side of the body they're not tense or tight

155
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:34,560
um and uh it's possible to uh

156
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:39,599
sit upright or stand upright in a balanced posture

157
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:44,800
tendency is when we're agitated we kind of lose the balance posture

158
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:52,079
and and then once we start finding a physical posture that has expresses or holds

159
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:59,440
still or holds tranquil that becomes a mirror uh for the other the agitation that's

160
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:05,520
going on the state of the minds that we have so and that's this is considered good in

161
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:13,760
buddhism that you start seeing what's actually happening rather than having the agitation

162
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:20,560
compelling you to move or shake or agitate or

163
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:26,240
fidget or something um we're beginning to kind of

164
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:32,000
take our our [Music] take our life back to ourselves

165
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,599
and and we begin feeding

166
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:43,280
begin supporting the calm body

167
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:49,440
this idea that we have a calm body that's available to us it's uh sometimes it might be called a

168
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,640
spiritual body or a a

169
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:01,280
deep body the deep body that we have and so the calm body

170
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:07,440
is something that we need to feed or support and it's one of the great assets that we have

171
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:14,079
because of how much clarity it provides how much reference point it provides for understanding what's going on

172
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:20,800
how much it it clears the the the inner eyes in a sense

173
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:26,800
so that we see what's happening rather than being pushed around by what's happening within

174
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:32,720
so uh you know we have as i said we have some control

175
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:40,160
over our bodies uh uh some not the inner physiology of the body but the

176
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,520
posture the activities the body's engaged in and so

177
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:51,599
if we're too distracted to know what we're doing with our fingers

178
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:57,839
when we're fidgeting with our fingers then chances are

179
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:03,280
that that level of distraction is limiting your wisdom

180
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:10,560
limiting your intelligence limiting your creativity limiting your ability to see clearly

181
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:16,480
and so to use your fingers fidgeting as a mindfulness bill

182
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:23,920
as a reminder oh i'm not supporting now or feeding or nourishing

183
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:29,920
the what's most wise and what's most kind what's most supportive for this body and

184
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:37,280
mind let me see what i can do to support the calm body

185
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:42,720
not so you can go around to completely calm but so that you're calm enough

186
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,760
that uh you're you're not being controlled by

187
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,800
agitation by anxiety by desires

188
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:59,119
uh compelled to keep moving and compelled to react and and uh or compelled just to be

189
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:04,160
distracted and caught up in thoughts and ideas

190
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:09,680
so to become more attuned to your body

191
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:15,440
and in particular how the body is agitated

192
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:21,440
and how you have some ability to not

193
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:27,920
act on that agitation but rather hold the body quiet let the posture be

194
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:34,079
calm let the posture be kind of like a

195
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:39,119
loving container that holds the agitation

196
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:47,200
i like it a little bit to a small kid on the nursery school playground who somehow

197
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:52,240
has stumbled and scraped her knee and

198
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:58,480
and she comes over to a teacher and then she's upset and crying and she throws herself into the arms of the

199
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:04,400
teacher and the teacher just holds her for a while and uh and she cries and

200
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:09,760
after a while being held she has enough and she wiggles out of the arms and runs back on

201
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:17,280
the playground so the posture can be that nourishing supportive person that can hold the

202
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:24,400
agitation we have and it takes kind of the in a sense the teacher in us the adult in us

203
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,520
to be the one who holds the posture still enough quiet

204
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:35,119
enough so it can hold the agitation that's deeper the impulses the

205
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:41,359
the tense agitated energies that are there so there there's a container for them

206
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:48,160
there's a nourishment for them there's support for them so they can begin to relax and settle

207
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:54,000
so physical calmness physical tranquility and

208
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:00,720
and in the teachings of the buddha physical tranquility has a wonderful kind of reciprocity

209
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:07,280
with joy and happiness that's somehow that

210
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:12,960
with joy with tranquility there can be more happiness with happiness more

211
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:19,280
tranquility with joy there can be tranquility with tranquility there can be more joy

212
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:25,520
and um and so it's not just kind of a state tranquility of of you know of

213
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:31,920
apathy or indifference or you know just holding yourself frozen

214
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:37,040
it's actually the opposite something comes alive when

215
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:44,560
when we can relax and open the body open excuse me

216
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:53,280
when we can open something can relax when we can open

217
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:59,839
the the wonderful vital energies of calmness

218
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:06,560
of clarity in our body so may you become interested in the

219
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:13,520
calmness of your body today and perhaps you can also begin to

220
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:19,119
maybe understand how a physical tranquility

221
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:25,519
is a support for a kind of physical clarity and maybe even mental clarity

222
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:32,800
so look and study your body today study the forces of vegetation in your body

223
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:40,000
and how you might support that agitation to calm down to relax

224
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:47,520
and maybe in a sense for some of you you can reclaim your body from your agitation

225
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:54,000
so that the calmness of your heart can

226
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:00,960
have space to come forth so thank you

227
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:06,119
and i hope you enjoy your day
