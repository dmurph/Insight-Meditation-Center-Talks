1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,080
so good morning Gail good morning good morning everyone hello and hello for those of you who are with

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,200
us online and um

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:18,240
thank you for coming I think I'm still in this um maybe under the influence of the

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:25,019
pandemic of appreciating when we come together more than I did before it's nice to be sitting here and be together

5
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:32,460
in community and so thank you for coming and um

6
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:39,120
so the topic I want to talk about is one that was inspired by the recent Retreat

7
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,300
I sat I did a self Retreat for a month uh and uh by myself and

8
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:54,360
and um and one of the things that I found fascinating was among other things was a

9
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:00,840
kind of an investigation or attention to thinking itself and rather

10
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:07,380
than thinking thinking that thinking is wrong or bad to investigate it to see what was going on

11
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:14,220
we're thinking and in some deeper way and uh and you know one of the things that I've

12
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,439
known up some time at least in my mind is that there are different

13
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,659
um what I call levels of thinking different kinds of kinds of thinking

14
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:30,900
it's not like all thinking are the same and um and so to slow down and stop and

15
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:37,040
take a look at the thinking we do whether it's thinking in images or thinking in words and start

16
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,720
distinguishing the different uh categories of thinking the different

17
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,600
modes of thinking that we have because some of the modes are not so good for us

18
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,360
and sometimes because sometimes those predominate for some people thinking

19
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,180
itself gets a negative reputation in some circles you know it's almost as if

20
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:08,600
all thinking is bad but thinking is an important part of meditation and thinking can be

21
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,739
generative it can be useful it can be supportive of meditation and supportive

22
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:19,739
of life and the thinking can be deadening thinking can be the opposite of

23
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:25,379
supporting life it's kind of deadening it undermines us and and the unfortunate thing is that maybe

24
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:30,900
for not a few people in this modern world that we live in maybe the ancient world too

25
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:38,700
um the something's going to skew with the way that we think in the way that we get preoccupied in thoughts which are uh

26
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:44,879
debilitating undermining and so to be able to see and recognize that there are different modes of

27
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:51,860
thinking is for some people it's a new idea and uh and it kind of opens the door

28
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:58,080
to beginning to live a little different and maybe exercise some degree of choice

29
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:05,819
about how we think what we think about and just as important some choice about

30
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:12,180
how we relate to our thinking the attitude we have about thinking when we're thinking

31
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,220
so it's an important topic of mindfulness and it can be explored in meditation

32
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:24,120
certainly and it could be explored in daily life and you know and all kinds of

33
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,000
situations I've had a fair amount of interesting kind of discoveries around

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,220
thinking while driving uh because if I had the radio off or not

35
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:42,920
doing other things talking to people that um I find that if I can drive safely while actually maybe more safely

36
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:48,299
if I'm kind of a little bit tracking my thinking rather than being lost in

37
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:55,500
thoughts which um twice in in this time living in 30 years I've lived in the peninsula I was

38
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:03,000
driving on 280. at that big Highway nearby here and and missed my exit

39
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,720
because I was thinking a lot about something I was kind of absorbed and I think I think

40
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,879
I was driving safe enough it was I was tracking you know what was going on around me but not well enough

41
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:21,000
to know where I was and where I was supposed to get off so that was a little bit of a wake-up call you know wow you

42
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,520
could that's something so um but I find that you know driving

43
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:33,060
is interesting place when I go for walks I like to hike a lot or go for walks and when I walk alone that's an awesome

44
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:40,100
interesting interesting time to explore this world of thinking and what's going on and if we don't do that for some of us

45
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:45,840
thinking takes over they could have a design work on automatic pilot and they're thinking just kind of she gets

46
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,120
churns away without any question and and without any um

47
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,280
Choice involved it's like thinking has a mind of its own and we better just kind of

48
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,560
follow along or some people are so strongly wedded to their thinking that

49
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:07,080
it's almost like who they are as a person is their thinking self is their thoughts

50
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,180
and for some people it's actually frightening to stop thinking because

51
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:17,220
then they're not they're not anybody they're not telling themselves a story about who they are tailings having

52
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:24,060
fantasies or conversations where they are a player in it reassuring themselves or some not reassuring themselves but

53
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:31,199
still kind of making a self out of it and that's one of the reasons why some people think a lot because it's a way of

54
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,960
Shoring up some self-concept that is has become important for feeling safe in the

55
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:43,440
world or feeling successful in the world or feeling somehow compensating for how difficult this

56
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,500
world is so in the teachings of the Buddha

57
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:54,419
there are two modes of thinking I mean there's many modes of thinking but in

58
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:59,460
the in the the in the in the kind of the what I would call the top level of

59
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:06,780
thinking the more active thinking there is two modes

60
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:14,280
and one mode in the ancient language is called papancha and papancha sometimes is translated

61
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:21,120
into English as proliferating thinking so thinking that just proliferates and has a life of its own just spreads and

62
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,780
Spins and you know creates universes of of ideas and things

63
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,819
and sometimes I like to call that discursive thinking and discursive

64
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:37,860
thinking would I would you know you're giving yourself a discourse or you're having a conversation with someone or

65
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:43,380
with yourself or you're involved in commentary or making living some kind of

66
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:50,400
Storytelling mind a fantasy mind planning the future

67
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,940
um you know the future is completely unknown so kind of involved in planning and it's very active active and it's

68
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:03,900
what what some people might call um mental constructs we're constructing things and ideas

69
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:10,800
and some people spend an inordinate amount of time in this world of papancha of discursive thinking of of the world

70
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,080
of constructs and the other is the Buddha doesn't call

71
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,620
it this I'll tell you what he says that would be in a few minutes sometimes I like to think of it as deep thinking

72
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:28,800
so the first discussion I would I kind of like to think of is shallow thinking and the other is deep

73
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,800
sometimes I like calling it contemplative thinking I don't know what associations you have the word

74
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,699
contemplative but I have very warm feelings for it it's a kind of you know deep kind of spiritual connection that

75
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:48,599
we feel might feel and that from that comes a kind of deeper kind of reflection about things that

76
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:55,620
and the important distinction between these two and this is one of the really important points I want to make today

77
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:01,860
is when we're looking and paying attention to how we're thinking

78
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:08,880
is to discover what's the source of our thinking from where does thinking come

79
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:14,759
so the papancha thinking that we do this discursive thinking the Buddha Likens to

80
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:21,300
a puppeteer so a puppeteer is above the puppet show

81
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,639
and um and you know in kind of up above high above and has these long strings

82
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:33,539
and it's pulling over all the little puppets to get them to do things so this is the thinking mind that's kind

83
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:40,560
of up in the head the control tower in the head and um and it has all these tentacles

84
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,020
all these strings that go into our muscles into our nerves everywhere all

85
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:52,860
over the body and if we're caught up in that World um uh all kinds of big and small muscles

86
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:58,500
are being pulled the shoulders go up the forehead goes gets maybe crunched up

87
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:05,100
the jaw gets tight the belly gets pulled in sometimes and it's fascinating if

88
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:12,180
some of you maybe have done this in meditation of being relatively calm and settled and content and minding your own

89
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:17,300
business and meditation and then your mind the Puppeteer maybe

90
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,740
just has this like really

91
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,320
Big Bang thought and then the energy is there you know

92
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,019
and you've been now you've been ignited with anger and fury or fear and all

93
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:40,080
these things have happened in your body oh you know how could that person have said that then it was 50 years ago but

94
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,360
how could they how could they have said it and uh and the Puppeteer has you know

95
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,420
come back from vacation you know and suddenly it's you know then then you know the puppeteers pulling all these

96
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:57,360
strings and emotional strings and muscular strings and postural strings all kinds of things go

97
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:03,540
on into play and and some people live in that world

98
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:10,380
and to call it the padura call it the puppeteer means that it's not really Who You Are

99
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:15,480
even though it's the only you that you might know that you've been living your whole

100
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:22,019
lifetime but no that's not who you are there's something different the deep thinking

101
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:27,540
the contemplative thinking the Buddha Associates with something he calls the

102
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:33,720
Yoni and the Yoni in Pali I think in Sanskrit as well means Womb

103
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:41,040
and I think it's meant to be a metaphor as opposed to literally the womb but it's a wonderful kind of a metaphor of a

104
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:47,880
place that's gen it's generative something in which something grows and develops and emerges

105
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:54,660
uh just States and so rather than being a puppeteer is pulling strings it's something that is

106
00:10:54,660 --> 00:11:00,779
uh flowing something that is evolving something generative within that spreads

107
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:07,380
out and it can feel very different sometimes Some Kind of Wonderful creative thinking

108
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:12,540
or thinking that if you're kind of sometimes in love or something with some

109
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:19,079
place or person or thing and you're kind of in a revery kind of thinking about it nicely it has a very different Source

110
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:24,120
than this puppeteer unless the love has a lot of desire in it

111
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:30,060
and uh you know and then maybe it's back into the Puppeteer mode you know we're

112
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:35,779
all you know fear and worry and desires and ambition and all kinds of things

113
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:41,820
and um but this deeper Wellspring within and that's a Wellspring and you can feel

114
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,980
how differently it's going to emerging and flowing upward and outward filling

115
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:52,320
us and sometimes it's delicious uh thinking can be if we're in this other

116
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:58,920
mode of being and um and uh and that's where kind of wisdom

117
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:04,860
can occur the this uh this papancha

118
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:12,300
is the world of two things it's world world of often of clinging grasping

119
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:20,399
attachment of some kind where we're driven there's a drivenness there's a a push and that might be connected to fear

120
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,560
it might be connected to desires it might be connected to anger it might be

121
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:33,180
connected to insecurity all kinds of things that it might be what would we call the attachment that kind of kind of

122
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:39,360
is fueling it or it's fueled with what in Buddhism is

123
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,639
called selfing that where we're kind of the part of who

124
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:51,899
we are that's not necessarily kind of who we are naturally in a sense but who

125
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:57,600
we are as a construct how we've learned to kind of create an image an idea a

126
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:04,019
role presentation Persona that we want to present to the

127
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:11,279
world and um and I remember when I first came to Buddhism when I was about 20 or so 21

128
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:17,399
and Buddha Center went to the Zen Center in San Francisco to visit a number of times

129
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:25,139
and um and it was a bit of a shock to be talking to some of the most senior

130
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:30,360
practitioners there have been practicing for a long time because it turned out

131
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:37,079
that I was kind of constantly playing the social game of presenting myself

132
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:43,320
as I wanted people to see me so I was con you know it wasn't just a construct in my thinking mind it was a

133
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,860
construct in my behavior that I was trying to reinforce and my friends

134
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:54,560
they kind of participated and probably were all doing it for each other and you know cooperating

135
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:00,300
but uh at the Zen Center these people had meditated a lot they didn't react I

136
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:07,260
didn't get any response they weren't going to play that game and so they were this mirror

137
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:12,300
and I loved it it's one of the reasons I went back to live at Sun Center I felt

138
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:18,899
so much uh that's where I wanted to live I wanted to live in a place where I could see myself do these funny things

139
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:24,480
odd things because I didn't feel there was much Integrity in them it wasn't coming from a deep place that I wanted

140
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:32,399
to come from so um so there's often a lot of selfings self

141
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:38,220
ideas and if you spend some time looking at your papancha your discursive thought

142
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:44,180
where your mind is mostly spinning stories and ideas and conversations and what it's doing

143
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:50,220
chances are relatively high that you're one of the main players in it that

144
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:57,660
you're not very far away and and it's probably fairly fair to say

145
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:03,540
that for most of us if anybody was walking next to us repeating themselves

146
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:09,139
as much as we're repeating ourselves in our thinking we'd be begging them to stop

147
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:15,320
it might even be worse you know like you know you yell at them like please

148
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:21,420
but uh but one of the you know we can have the same thoughts repeat the same thing you know over and over again it's

149
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:27,600
amazing at least I don't know I shouldn't speak for all of you maybe some of you are always brand new creative thought thinkers for every

150
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:35,180
thought you have but but the but why don't we get bored with it

151
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:41,699
and uh and one of the reasons is we're the main character or important character in it and who we are is

152
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:46,800
important and I don't want to take away the sense of importance but sometimes that sense

153
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:54,360
of importance for maybe for good historical reasons or current reasons it's a part of the

154
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:00,779
finding out how to be safe in the world or how to be successful in the world or how to belong in this world and this

155
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:05,880
discursive thinking is kind of become the mode for doing it

156
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:11,760
however it can come along with a lot of emotions and moods and attitudes which

157
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:17,339
um like like fear anxiety with anger and

158
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:24,600
hatred and with despair with with discouragement without with uh it can

159
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:31,199
come with uh strong ambition and come with a lot of conceit of all kinds

160
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:38,100
and um and so the in what it means is that if you're having this those same thoughts over and over again

161
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:43,920
you're actually reinforcing that mood on yourself the influence not necessarily of the

162
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,380
thinking but the influence of the attitude the mood the emotions that come

163
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:55,440
along with it are constantly kind of uh being registered from influencing

164
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:02,880
shaping Who We Are and that's one of the big dangers of this discursive thinking is its

165
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:09,900
emotional impact on us and as I think some psychologists have pointed out something like a high

166
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:16,500
percentage of people who are depressed are depressed because of the rumination

167
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:22,020
their them the same kind of thoughts over and over again and so there's a whole form of therapy called cognitive

168
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:27,360
behavioral therapy where they they actually look at the nature of the thoughts and what you're thinking and

169
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:33,059
and helping people to think in better ways that don't undermine their psychological Health maybe even their

170
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:40,500
physical health and so this discursive thinking is not more many times is really not good for

171
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:46,919
us and it doesn't often do a lot of good if it's repetitive you know driven over and

172
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:54,179
over again um and um and so as I've said sometimes here I used to do a lot of planning

173
00:17:54,179 --> 00:18:00,240
thoughts I was anxious about what was going to happen so I thought if I planned and thought about it I just you

174
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,760
know I didn't think I think I just did it automatically it wasn't deciding to do it

175
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:13,020
and then very very slowly took a long time it began to dawn on me that my ability

176
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:19,559
to predict the future was dismal and and I would do all this planning and

177
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:26,340
thinking with an image of what it was going to be like in the future and be ready or something

178
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:32,880
and it was seldom that way and after all slow their Donna McGill

179
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,400
you're wasting a lot of time thinking and planning about things that

180
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:46,559
don't never never occur they're always different than what you've ever how you thought and after a while I kind of slowly began

181
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:53,160
to give up this you know this just you know neurotic drive to plan and

182
00:18:53,160 --> 00:19:00,299
think out and make myself safe for something in the future um because I was not being successful

183
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:07,320
and um and so I'm happier now this is nicer not to always I do still think ahead I plan ahead I do I think

184
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:14,360
it's an important part of life but but uh not in the that driven way that I had before

185
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:22,380
and um and so this uh um and so in the Buddhist teachings the

186
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:27,960
discursive thinking gives birth to What's called the five hindrances

187
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:35,780
and these are the thoughts having to do with sensual desire or acquiring things

188
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:41,280
thoughts that have to do with hatred and ill will thoughts that have to do with

189
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,799
resistance and lethargy and giving up thoughts that have to do with that

190
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:53,460
anxiety regrets restlessness agitation and thoughts that have to do with doubt

191
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:58,799
or uncertainty indecisiveness what should I do I don't know what to do

192
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:05,880
and um in contrast this deep thinking this thinking from

193
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:12,660
the womb come gives birth to a whole different way of

194
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:18,360
being in the world and in terms of thinking the one of the characteristics that Buddha gives for

195
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:25,320
someone who has the ability to think from that source is uh they think

196
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:31,380
about the welfare and well-being of themselves

197
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:37,559
of others of both self and others and of the whole world

198
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:43,200
so this the way of thinking kind of what's beneficial here how do people thrive how do people what's good for

199
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,840
people but it's not just for oneself because of its self-focused the chances

200
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:54,799
are it belongs to the world of the puppeteer but to have it be an integrative

201
00:20:54,799 --> 00:21:00,600
integrative whole whole where the thinking is inclusive of so

202
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,640
much that's what I kind of associate with the womb the womb the womb is the

203
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:11,340
whole world for us the whole world everything becomes the the place that

204
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:16,440
something can be can be connected to and be this what allows something generative

205
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:21,600
to grow and develop and flow from within and as we have kind of opened up in this

206
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:29,820
wide way then we're not making sharp lines between me and you me and others

207
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:35,520
that belongs to the Puppeteer that belongs to the constructing mind that's

208
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,860
making a story and making an idea of who I am when all the constructs become

209
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:46,320
quieter and we have a chance to think from this deeper source that deeper

210
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:52,260
source is not driven by division it's not not driven by dividing the

211
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:58,799
world between the good and the bad and the acceptable the unacceptable and the right and the wrong and the right people

212
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:04,200
and the wrong people that's not the way it's orientation because it's it's

213
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,900
growing into this wholeness like like an embryo grows into wholeness in the womb

214
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:16,740
so we're still in this wonderful uh you know womb of our planet that's a whole

215
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:22,020
and we're still growing as adults and uh and that's a place where we don't

216
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:29,159
divide this kind of way we still have a sense of others so we're concern for them but the concern is not

217
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:36,419
divided the the the way with the way we desire the welfare of the world the way

218
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:42,059
we think about people and so we're equally caring for ourselves as we are

219
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:47,520
for others and I love it that the Buddha says also for self and others

220
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:53,760
because it's not just the individuals it's also for the the um the communities we're in

221
00:22:53,760 --> 00:23:01,140
the the you know a paired relationship with friends and family are larger connection to family to community and

222
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:07,020
neighborhoods and colleagues that that that we self and others in the whole

223
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:13,919
world is included so that's very different way of thinking than thinking from the you know the

224
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:19,440
hindrances these other ways thinking from attachment

225
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:25,500
also this deep generative place of that we're thinking can come is associated

226
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:30,900
with um with mindfulness with awareness it's

227
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:36,360
generative of certain kind of attention here in the present moment

228
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:42,000
partly because it feels so uh nourishing that it feels like the feeling of

229
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,700
nourishment that it tends to bring or contentment or well-being tends to kind

230
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:54,900
of awaken a kind of feeling of being connected to oneself where we're aware we're connected

231
00:23:54,900 --> 00:24:01,500
discursive thinking we tend to be disconnected from the wholeness of who we are we're in this world of thoughts

232
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:06,900
and constructs and fantasy and and things and it's not we're divided from

233
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:12,179
ourselves we're sometimes alienated from ourselves because of that discursive world of

234
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:19,580
thinking and now so there's awareness that comes from it there is

235
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:25,380
Clarity we start seeing more clearly what's here there is a kind of a wonderful

236
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:32,760
generative energy that Vitality that can come rather than the thinking being draining

237
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:39,419
us and tiring us it's actually there's kind of feels like it's kind of self-generating and perpetually you know

238
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:45,600
can go on for a long time and there's joy it's kind of sense of well-being

239
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:52,140
the Buddha Associates it with tranquility being calm he associated with being

240
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:58,380
focused to be able to be really here and focused and you know present for what's going on

241
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:03,679
and um and he's and he Associates it with a source for equanimity

242
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:09,900
being and not being reactive to what's going on the discursive mind

243
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:16,620
is the reactive mind so I don't know you know how much you know I'm just making this up but

244
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:23,520
um I associate this this Pancha discursive mind as uh well say I think it's very

245
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:31,380
important not to I'll get back to what I was going to look the sentence but it's very important not to treat the

246
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:36,480
discursive mind as any kind of enemy you know it has it can cause a lot of

247
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:42,120
problems it could cause a lot of difficulty and maybe it sounds a little bit negative you know it's attachment

248
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:49,020
and self-conceit and all that I think it's very important not to treat it as an enemy because in this womb-like

249
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:54,779
approach everything gets included everything has a place everything we're concerned about the welfare of

250
00:25:54,779 --> 00:26:01,679
everything and so I I associate the discursive thought this being surface thinking and

251
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:07,620
what I mean by that is kind of like it's associated with the muscles of our body

252
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:13,500
and that's where we have to operate when it's when it's fight or flight

253
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:20,640
if there's danger we have to we you know that that we're set up to fight or flight or some people

254
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:27,600
to freeze but that's kind of kind of in the muscles of our body kind of that that they could activate it quickly and

255
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,640
engaged and the muscles are I what's you know in my kind of

256
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:39,900
taught way of talking here more the surface compared to this womb-like place which is deep into the organs deep into

257
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:44,940
our deeper nervous system in our hearts maybe we would say in in the west rather

258
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:52,320
than the the womb Maybe and um and it comes from a different Source that's deeper inside

259
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:58,279
but the fact that the discursive thought is associated with survival

260
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:03,360
it has an important role and maybe sometimes it has that world of

261
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:09,840
discursive thinking maybe and what comes from it and the emotions connected to it has in fact helped some people actually

262
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:16,320
to survive and sometimes fantasy even and discourse you know and being lost some people

263
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:23,279
that's the only way they get gotten some relief and some escape from horrendous kind of life that they're living

264
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:30,480
so we want to be very careful not to treat disrespectfully this world of discursive

265
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:37,320
thinking and this is where this ability to have some Equanimity and

266
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:45,539
some open awareness some kindness in order to envelop or hold or look at the

267
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:51,299
discursive thought is so important and because then it has a chance to

268
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:58,260
relax it's almost like that part of us who need what it needs is to be seen by

269
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:04,140
something that cares for it that sees it with respect and so when there's a lot of discursive

270
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:10,140
thinking um and you can maybe feel look at where's the source of this where's this

271
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:15,720
coming from and maybe get a sense of this deeper Source maybe in some certain emotions or

272
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:23,120
feelings or attitudes and or maybe places in your body where it's coming from

273
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:30,059
um and then ask yourself the question what would help settle this part of you

274
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:36,720
what would help this part of who you are feel reassured or to relax or to kind of

275
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:43,620
feel safer to make room for a more integrative

276
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:49,080
way of being in the world that includes this deeper possibility

277
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:54,779
when we get underneath the musculature maybe some people call even called the armor that's on the

278
00:28:54,779 --> 00:29:02,340
surface we get we get from SD per place that's softer more sensitive quieter

279
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:07,559
um maybe even Shire there's not going to show itself so

280
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:13,980
easily unless we get quiet and calm but but allowed that to give time for

281
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:19,500
that to emerge and to meet the discursive part

282
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:25,200
and kind of be in conversation with each other and kind of maybe go go for a walk hand

283
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:31,440
in hand or something so that there's a kind of a different relationship to discursive thought than how we usually

284
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:39,720
do it which is just maybe just giving into it and just letting it run

285
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:46,320
so it's important not to let your mind have a mind of its own where it's where it's in charge and it just kind of

286
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:52,020
running you there is a steeper source that maybe we don't call the mind we

287
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:58,020
call the heart or we call the womb or something that that is very generative and and

288
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:03,720
really brings forth some of the most beautiful qualities of a human being

289
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:10,799
and so um so how to relate to all this how to look at

290
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:17,820
it and realize that there may be a different way than how his business has been going as usual for you

291
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:24,200
and um and maybe you can hang a sign someday saying Under New Management

292
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:33,020
and um so I hope that this talk has been um

293
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:40,440
offered you something that you kind of some new approach new idea that perspires you to take a good deep look

294
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:46,320
at yourself and to kind of question and how business as usual is in your mind

295
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:53,399
and say was this really the way to go is this really how it has to be even though it's been this way for 50 years does

296
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:59,220
this really have to be this way and and so there was actually more to what I

297
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:04,799
want to say based on my retreat so I'll just say a little snippet maybe when I come back in a few weeks maybe if I

298
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:10,919
remember I can say talk about this other half and that is that it was wonderful at The

299
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:16,500
Retreat one of the wonderful things on this retreat was that at some point it

300
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:21,659
became fairly easy for me I I had the discursive thought operating at times

301
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:28,380
thinking mind and going and um this and I could just uh shut it

302
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:35,600
off I I wasn't I I wasn't in control how long it stayed off

303
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:43,200
but I could shut it off for a bit and um and that was fascinating

304
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:51,059
to then see what forms of knowing and what forms of thinking emerge kind

305
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:58,860
of spontaneously kind of almost like they weren't me it was just like they were just arising

306
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:04,740
um without the discursive thought kind of um filling this filling the room filling

307
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:10,200
the space you know you've probably all been in a group of people where one person dominates

308
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:17,399
and so no one else can speak and maybe you can speak well that's what's going on for you the

309
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:23,820
discursive one the Puppeteer has been filling the room and um and if you're

310
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:30,899
your your mental space you know your awareness space is re is actually a very

311
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:37,020
expensive real estate and you don't want to waste it on the discursive

312
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:44,940
filling it with the discursive mind there's other ways of knowing other ways of thinking that are have that you know

313
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:51,840
give them a chance and the discursive thoughts well that's nowhere that far away so it'll get its

314
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:57,600
turn but it might be time for just deeper voices other voices other ways of

315
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:03,179
knowing to surface so that was the other half of the talk but maybe that's another time to say more about that

316
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:09,059
maybe so I'm going to stop early 10 minutes

317
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:15,419
before the usual stopping and uh and what I'd like to so you're

318
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:21,240
welcome to leave if you'd like when a few minutes when a tough spot when I talked to talking I thank you for being here

319
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:27,299
some people come here just to be quiet and not to be in community and so I respect that a lot

320
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:36,360
or just sit here quietly but I would like to suggest since we have tea today is that you turn to uh

321
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:42,299
towards one or two people near you and just say hello and maybe offer your

322
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:47,940
name if you will or just something simple you want to say and maybe that's it and then you can go

323
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:55,679
or or you have a teeny conversation about uh what your thoughts are what

324
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:01,260
what happened to you listening to these ideas and these thoughts and is there anything useful here for you

325
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:07,679
in it and it might but but when you have this conversation with each other I mean

326
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:14,700
don't don't be careful how much you talk it's very easy Once people start talking

327
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:21,060
to not stop uh or feel like they have to say everything make your comments relatively

328
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:27,179
short don't tell long stories and so if you can go back and forth ping pong kind of thing I think that's really

329
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:32,760
nice and as you form your little groups of two or three just have a little bit of

330
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:38,099
mindfulness around you in case for someone near you it hasn't been easy to find someone because the way people turn

331
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:44,220
and they're sitting there kind of like alone so you look around and invite them into your your little group and

332
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:51,060
and um and then I'll ring the bell and now and maybe about six seven minutes and

333
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:57,300
so some of you can sit silent some people can go and then afterwards we'll have tea and then you've already broken the ice and met some people maybe you

334
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:03,740
want to stay say hello to each other
