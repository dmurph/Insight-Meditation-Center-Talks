1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:06,960
okay welcome sweet to um see all the names

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,440
warm uh wishes to uh each other to me

3
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:15,980
um

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,400
okay let's uh settle in

5
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,880
as we settle in

6
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:22,799
they're kind of gentle effort not to fit this moment into everything

7
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:31,080
we think we know everything we know about ourselves

8
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:37,220
that meditation about life

9
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,540
but instead

10
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,820
kind of stance of uh not knowing

11
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,780
openness

12
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:40,879
it's so easy to take up the

13
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:48,420
residents in the familiar place of self

14
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,519
this is what I do when I said

15
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,860
sort of occupy a place

16
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:06,620
and look and my breath my body

17
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:11,720
listen whatever we do

18
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:29,060
maybe the instruction as we begin something like

19
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:35,239
don't locate yourself

20
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,360
and don't try to re-establish

21
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,940
all the familiar reference points

22
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:08,060
who what where I am

23
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:17,480
we just open in this new way

24
00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:04,380
Gail sometimes says there's the what and how meditation

25
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:09,479
what we are attending to and how we're

26
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:12,080
attending

27
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:26,400
and sometimes we emphasize the what

28
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:37,099
so much the breath that we lose track of the how

29
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:45,500
and in the urgency of the what

30
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:55,079
get tight or incarnate

31
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,740
a certain kind of meditator self

32
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:12,980
some traditions really emphasize the what other meditative lineages

33
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,639
emphasize the how

34
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,100
maybe we can do both

35
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:47,120
foreign

36
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:24,019
we take good care of this moment

37
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:39,740
and let this moment take care of us

38
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:02,960
sense of being held by them

39
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,380
other ways we

40
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:23,840
locate the self

41
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:40,039
let's let it dissolve into openness of this moment

42
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:08,539
you don't need to know who you are to be awake

43
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,100
foreign

44
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,440
foreign

45
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:15,919
so we're we're exploring

46
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:22,020
uh this week how death can inform life they

47
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:27,480
the um implications for a Dharma practice

48
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:35,100
and yesterday was emphasizing neither over learning nor under learning

49
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:42,840
from mortality uh in some sense it's the most epic thing

50
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:49,760
in other where's not such a big deal

51
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:57,000
William James said uh the death is the worm at the core of the Human Condition

52
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:03,679
that turns us all into Melancholy metaphysicians

53
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:07,679
melancholy metaphysicians

54
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:15,299
um so I'm trying to to weave what you know

55
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:22,580
one of the core Buddhist teachings with this theme and

56
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:27,600
over the recent years really have become

57
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,640
acutely aware of the role

58
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,679
the future the sense of our future

59
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:44,658
plays in our inner life and

60
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:53,700
from the simple kind of recognition that so much of our thinking is essentially

61
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:59,039
the heart and mind coping with Anita

62
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:05,940
coping with Anita and a niche is usually usually

63
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:11,159
translated as impermanence but connotes unpredictability unreliability

64
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:19,220
uncertainty and were always trying to

65
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:27,240
predict the movements of uh an entropic world

66
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:32,940
right so much so many of the kind of movements of our mind

67
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:40,740
just abstracting away from this moment in order to understand

68
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:48,659
what's coming next and the Buddha said the world the world

69
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:55,020
trembles in all directions skills translation

70
00:32:55,020 --> 00:33:01,500
the world trembles in all directions and even when we're thinking about the

71
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:06,539
past it's often in service of learning something that will help us

72
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:11,360
predict control or future

73
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,658
so we settle down we take a breath right

74
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:24,360
but the impelling force of the future of the coming

75
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:29,519
is is called is strong and

76
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:35,880
it's almost hard to conceive what a moment would be

77
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:41,580
outside of the sense that's something

78
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:44,960
comes next

79
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:53,960
as I said something I just like pause because I wanted to feel

80
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:01,340
the sense of oh yeah

81
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:07,980
something comes next it sends woven so deeply into this

82
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:11,960
moment something comes next

83
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:21,358
and so I say all this because death is an invitation

84
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,858
to contemplate futurelessness

85
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,599
contemplate futurelessness

86
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:40,158
something comes next something comes next

87
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:49,800
and then it doesn't and if there were nothing coming or if

88
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:56,040
we maybe we could say if we didn't care about what did come

89
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:03,800
there would be nothing to do but be awake

90
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:12,560
we call this samadhi nothing to do but be awake

91
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:22,020
no the kind of um busyness and strategizing the vigilance

92
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:30,680
and fear and worry all of it involves a future

93
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:40,140
and in our preoccupations and our our tending and vigilance and strategizing

94
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:45,359
our energy is moving in all these different directions what we want

95
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:51,020
what we're avoiding and the sense of futurelessness

96
00:35:51,020 --> 00:36:00,200
simplifies everything right contemplating mortality helps us

97
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,500
sense this

98
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:12,180
and we do it as a kind of thought experiment okay this moment just this moment right in some ways that's what

99
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,980
every meditation instruction is

100
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:24,839
our mortality allows us to actually get a kind of visceral hit

101
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:30,260
of no future

102
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:39,920
and maybe you can actually sense intuitively how differently

103
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:49,280
the world might feel if we were not preoccupied with becoming

104
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:58,280
with uh just hope and that might be

105
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:07,279
then if if uh if all we had was this moment

106
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:14,579
however long this moment is all we had was this moment

107
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:21,920
I don't think any of us would doubt the Dharma

108
00:37:24,859 --> 00:37:31,099
awareness what matters so much

109
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:41,660
there would be nothing to do but be very very awake

110
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:52,700
the brain brain scientist um writing about

111
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:58,140
this theme a Halloween Slater

112
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:04,380
she says the essence of our theory is quite simple our main contention

113
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:10,940
is that meditation gradually brings the practitioner more and more into the present moment

114
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:20,520
thereby progressively updating temporally deep predictive processing in

115
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:25,820
the brain we contend this not only reduces

116
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:31,859
episodic future thinking and decision making but can also explain the more

117
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:39,359
unusual experiences reported by meditators including the loss of self-other Distinction and the cessation

118
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:46,380
of time if awareness rests in the here and now all mental processes that involve

119
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:51,420
abstract and temporally in deep processing

120
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:59,099
should logically Fall Away including a sense of self time space and body representation

121
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:06,240
we suggest that meditation Reigns in the mind's habitual tendency to abstract

122
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:14,400
away from the Here and Now until all phenomenological distinctions

123
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,859
stop metaphorically

124
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:27,900
we suggest that meditation prunes the counter factual tree

125
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:37,020
ruins the counter factual tree Coulda Shoulda Woulda

126
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:43,020
the sense of what could have been what might have

127
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:47,960
been the alternatives to this moment

128
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,119
the counter factual tree is pruned

129
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:06,300
all the kind of I remember I don't know what I'm talking about but I went from

130
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:14,040
when I was a kid in class like potential energy kinetic energy right

131
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:23,599
um it's almost like um the potential energy of the moment

132
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:29,660
dissolves and whatever is here is here

133
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:39,540
it says uh a contemplation of futurelessness we put

134
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:45,020
all of our hope into the present moment

135
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:54,619
and all of our hope into the present moment

136
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:01,460
and so we have to put down our life

137
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:10,160
to put down our life center our heart awareness what's here

138
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:18,140
very um early in uh in practice

139
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:24,540
I got the instruction to sit sit sit

140
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:31,400
like a dying person and uh

141
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:40,500
in a lot of ways uh to hear that right but um

142
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:46,079
one of the ways I heard it was sit like a person

143
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,400
without a future

144
00:41:53,579 --> 00:42:01,320
and nothing left to do but be awake in a

145
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:04,160
moment like that

146
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:17,880
and so the fragility of our body contemplation

147
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:25,680
of its end all of this can rather than frenzy our mind can

148
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,839
settle us invites the contemplation

149
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:38,900
of a futurelessness or to live this moment

150
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:45,680
is if it were all there is

151
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:53,420
office for consideration and uh

152
00:42:54,540 --> 00:43:00,560
of course when we when we do this when we sit in this way when we practice uh

153
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:07,500
contemplate futurelessness know it

154
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:15,619
um it also clarifies the kind of life we wish to lead

155
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:24,780
and so these different Realms these Realms of like very deep surrender and

156
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:31,859
then organizing a Dharma life they speak to one another

157
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:39,540
so we'll keep going tomorrow thank you thank you all sweet to uh to

158
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,960
be with you
