1
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,760
hello everyone welcome

2
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,440
it feels uh particularly hello everyone oh

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,820
it feels particularly

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:31,260
kind of um peaceful to be here

5
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:38,399
this morning uh biking down here in the dark and somehow with her

6
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:45,079
pre-dawn quiet

7
00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:50,760
it kind of adds to a sense of being peaceful and settled

8
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:59,460
and that is the part of the theme for today is to become aware of the contrast

9
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:08,159
between tension and peace and tension is I think of as a variety

10
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,939
of things but tension is something which tightens up Things become tight the muscles tighten

11
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:21,900
up and things are sometimes pulled in in a tight way and peace I think I think of as the

12
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:28,020
opposite of that over releasing allowing things to spread out to

13
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:34,020
be to open up peace is different than calm and at

14
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:40,500
least for me every everyone will have their own reference points to these words and some people won't see a difference between the two

15
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,259
but I think of calm as a I strongly associated with a settling

16
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:54,119
settling down a um and uh it's almost as if calm has a

17
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:59,399
little bit of weight that is kind of a settling like the the

18
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:10,619
mud in the pond settles full of gravity whereas peace is the broad widespread

19
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:17,040
of the Clear Water once the mud has settled and um

20
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:24,599
so the sense of openness wide wide so I think becoming wide becoming extend extended

21
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:30,900
in some way so we'll sit here with this contrast if

22
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:36,540
it's available to you and to respect them both

23
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:43,560
to not be at war with attention but rather to uh

24
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:51,300
hold it in awareness to hold it in attention

25
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,760
not intention I kind of delight in the word play of

26
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:04,560
the pronunciations of attention and attention and we practice our attention not like a

27
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,599
drill sergeant calling soldiers to tense up and be straight

28
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:16,140
but we call it attention to relieve the tension

29
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:22,739
to let it settle release the tension so that we can now become aware of

30
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:31,260
something which is peaceful and Broad open a peace that can hold the tension

31
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:39,120
and this is where the art of practice really gets interesting where we don't get rid of anything but

32
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,720
we know it in a context of peace

33
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:50,220
so to begin with taking an alert

34
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:56,220
not not a tense posture but a posture that has a certain kind of

35
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:01,700
healthy appropriate hotness in it there is some

36
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:08,280
energy that goes into the posture to hold ourselves in a way that the

37
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,459
there's an alertness even if you're laying in in bed and rather than sitting

38
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:22,680
upright um there's a way of laying in bed so that we're not just maximizing

39
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,020
comfort but we're laying there in a way that's supportive

40
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:35,340
for awareness maybe there's a kind of turning the shoulders

41
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:41,220
end it a little bit so that their shoulder blades can pull down the back a little bit

42
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:47,580
the lifting of the chest maybe a lifting of the knees so that

43
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,800
there's some effort there to hold the knees upright

44
00:04:52,800 --> 00:05:00,319
in any case to take the posture and to lower your gaze

45
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:10,800
perhaps to let your gaze be calm and cool coolness

46
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,560
and gently close the eyes

47
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:30,320
and become aware of any tension that's in your body

48
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,360
and rather than trying to relax it which we often do at the beginning of a

49
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:49,979
sitting hold it in whatever degree of peaceful awareness

50
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:56,039
that you can know it without conflict without

51
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:01,800
agitation without trying to do something to with

52
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:08,039
it allow it to be there in a peaceful

53
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:10,820
attention

54
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:23,699
and as you do that maybe the

55
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:30,380
sensations of breathing can find you

56
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:40,819
so you're not only aware of the tension but you're also aware of the rhythmic

57
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:45,080
sensations of the body breathing

58
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:07,740
and maybe just maybe the breathing offers an invitation to the tensioner

59
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:14,699
to relax almost as if we feel the tension

60
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:20,600
we can feel it's the tension itself wishes to relax

61
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:49,759
so then settling into the body breathing

62
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,460
and if there's any tension associated with breathing

63
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,960
let that be Let It Be

64
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,860
as part of what you know peacefully

65
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:54,180
if there are tensions in your body sometimes those tensions have a way of

66
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:59,899
calling attention to themselves

67
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:14,839
if that's the case Let There Be awareness of the tension

68
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:20,720
but from a place of being peaceful

69
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:34,620
form of peaceful attention that is more like clear water than muddy

70
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,800
water

71
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:14,040
whatever you're thinking whatever you're feeling whatever is happening for you

72
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:21,079
let it be happening in a peaceful awareness

73
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:29,540
awareness that's like clear water not muddy water

74
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:36,440
even if there's mud in the water know it

75
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:41,120
with whatever Clarity is present

76
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:12,080
to help be peaceful with the presence of tension

77
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:18,360
you might breathe through the tension

78
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:25,700
breathe with it and maybe the breathing

79
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,779
can support releasing

80
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:44,900
the attitudes and desires we have in real to the tension

81
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,778
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

82
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:10,620
to call on whatever sense you have of peaceful presence

83
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:19,400
peaceful awareness peaceful dwelling in your body

84
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:29,340
attention awareness Consciousness that's more like clear

85
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:37,039
water then muddy water or

86
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,460
agitated water

87
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,340
awareness is like clear water

88
00:27:55,020 --> 00:28:00,720
in which the people that we know and see and

89
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:08,279
think of are also held or felt to be inside or

90
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:14,059
within that peaceful attention

91
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,779
within the peace the clarity that might spread beyond our

92
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:28,640
body out into the room the lands the world

93
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,740
and with a peaceful heart

94
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:46,039
to appreciate other people

95
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:56,179
to place value and importance on every living being

96
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:06,539
and to gaze upon living beings kindly lovingly

97
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:14,400
so the peace that we feel the clear water in which we live

98
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:19,520
is a medium for our good will

99
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:29,760
May our good will spread through our peace to touch and benefit all beings

100
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:39,240
may all beings be happy may all beings be safe

101
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,399
may all beings be peaceful

102
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,620
and may all beings be free

103
00:29:49,580 --> 00:30:05,529
[Music]

104
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:11,360
thank you

105
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,340
foreign

106
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:52,398
so the shape form sense image

107
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:01,440
feeling we have for what Consciousness might be what the of the combined

108
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,480
aggregate totality of awareness might be for us

109
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:13,740
is related to different attitudes states of Mind activities that we have

110
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:21,419
and two which have a big impact on on it is tension on one hand and peace

111
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:27,360
peacefulness in the other these also exist on a spectrum and a range

112
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:33,980
where it doesn't have to be all one or all another but uh oftentimes

113
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:39,360
one is present with the other and the advantage of that of seeing that

114
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:45,600
discovering that is that we could tap into the peace the peacefulness

115
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:52,880
in order to be present for the tension and so if the tension predominates

116
00:31:52,880 --> 00:32:00,659
we can break out of the enchantment the Allure the strong maybe attachment to

117
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:06,720
uh do tension by by remembering there's also peace

118
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,880
here and knowing it peacefully a little bit sets us free from it

119
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:17,520
if there is a lot of peace then uh and it's easy to kind of not

120
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:24,779
notice any tension it's actually helpful to then from that peaceful place to

121
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:32,100
see if you can find where the attention Still Remains because if they're subtle maybe a very

122
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:38,520
slight tension that's still it remains if that's held also under this peaceful

123
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:43,620
gaze of attention then that also has a chance to dissolve

124
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:48,720
and be released and so that that peace can grow more and more at some point

125
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:57,179
with the greater the peace that we have rather than focusing on the peace sometimes it's helpful to notice in the

126
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:03,659
cracks of it all or in the somewhere in the subtle places there's still tension

127
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:12,140
and kind of began kind of working those edges and so the piece can kind of spread and grow more and more

128
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:19,440
then um so um enough intention is uh

129
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:27,360
part and parcel of life it comes and goes if it comes and goes it's fine but

130
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:32,460
the issue is when we hold on to the tension it's not just simply we're

131
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:38,279
driving and someone suddenly appears into our Lane in front of us and we

132
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:44,600
tense up in order to quickly kind of break the car or back up or do something to be safe

133
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:50,240
that kind of tension is a completely biologically important and but

134
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:57,539
when the when we're is driving is safe again to be able to let it all go

135
00:33:57,539 --> 00:34:04,140
um it's when we don't let go we hold on to it that um that becomes a problem

136
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:10,440
and there's many kind of uh causes for being tense

137
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:16,700
um you know we can we can but to hold on to the tension for the tensions become chronic and tight

138
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:24,960
there's a fewer reasons there has a lot to do with what goes on in our minds that there can be strong desire for

139
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:31,500
something strong aversion to something and what I'd like to emphasize today there can be fear

140
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:38,460
and and fear is uh one of the one one very powerful condition for becoming

141
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:46,618
tense and some people have chronic tension that goes on for a lifetime because of uh some some fear that was

142
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:52,800
kind of inflicted upon them that the experience that they remained afraid in

143
00:34:52,800 --> 00:35:00,000
some part of their psyche and that tension always is there bracing ourselves against life or something

144
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,720
and when there is uh tension especially attention of fear

145
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:12,300
if if we have a sense of being conscious or Consciousness itself that it tends to be shriveled and to be

146
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:17,579
contracted attention pulls in and so it makes something comes tight

147
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:22,980
yesterday's discussion about agitation tends to fragment the Consciousness make

148
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:28,440
it all kind of rough and jagged but the attention tends to shrink it and

149
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:34,800
sometimes the world shrinks to a very particular concern that we have maybe the particular thing we're afraid of or

150
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:40,680
upset with or that we want and and that shrinking of our attention to that one

151
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:45,839
concern um if you kind of open up and look at that

152
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:52,500
sense of the mind that's aware that way it just feels like it's tight and narrow

153
00:35:52,500 --> 00:36:00,060
when the mind is not preoccupied or caught they're holding on to anything that's when awareness can become Broad

154
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:06,780
and spaces become peaceful and a peaceful awareness is one that has

155
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:12,300
been released and because attention that localizes it in one place has been

156
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:17,940
released it can feel as if awareness or Consciousness now begins to spread out

157
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:23,700
it gets released and opened up whereas calm and the difference between

158
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:30,180
peace and calm at least for me and for everyone's going to be different I think some people the two are synonyms

159
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:37,619
but calm for me is a settling things relax and settle it's almost like uh the weight of calm

160
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:45,900
helps you to settle into the pull of gravity whereas peace comes from release

161
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:52,800
and so and it becomes things things open up and become wide and spread

162
00:36:52,800 --> 00:37:00,420
or to use a slightly different idea that um com is a settling of the mud in

163
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:06,599
water and the and peace is the clarity

164
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:13,140
that's left in that water and uh to be you know swimming underwater and have Clarity and just

165
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:18,839
kind of sense so that you can see so far it's quite lovely and that's what I've

166
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:26,160
swum in water which was you couldn't see for more than a foot in front of you and it's a whole different feeling very

167
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:33,660
different feeling when I was a kid I just like to go in places where there were waves

168
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:41,220
and the water was relatively clear and and very clear but it was waves coming into the rocky Shore and I'd love

169
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:47,760
to go dive underwater maybe about five or six feet and hold my breath turn

170
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:53,700
turn around on my back and look up at the waves and the turmoil above and I

171
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:59,760
felt so peaceful then below because everything was so quiet down there and peaceful and the contrast was so

172
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:06,420
wonderful so fear um if

173
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:13,800
the what's fascinating about fear and humbling and upsetting and irritating

174
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:19,380
and but also maybe hopefully um beneficial

175
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:24,900
is that um fear is its own Danger

176
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:31,020
if fear is fear of danger fear itself is a danger

177
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:36,359
when it's chronic when it tells it which conditions us to see the world the way

178
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:42,480
it's not to see danger at every corner and every location to always be looking

179
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:49,740
out for what's the the problems are and the danger is where that becomes a fixation of a fixated view

180
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:57,960
and we live only from that danger everything becomes something that's that's dangerous and in the way it does

181
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:04,099
because the fear is its own Danger and uh and so

182
00:39:04,099 --> 00:39:09,740
it's kind of self-fulfilling if it's chronic that yes we're in trouble

183
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:16,619
because of the tension the contraction the the the lens that we see through

184
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:22,560
with the lens of fear and um

185
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:31,160
uh so to be so then if fear is related to tension

186
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:36,560
fearlessness is related to peace and so peace is not just some kind of

187
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:42,480
bland state but it's a powerful wonderful place through which we can be

188
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:49,260
Fearless and um and we have nothing to fear and of course you know if the car pulls

189
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:54,660
in front of us in the freeway having some fear is appropriate and it makes helps us become safe so it isn't like we

190
00:39:54,660 --> 00:40:00,599
want to get rid of all fear but there's this way in which discover the value of peacefulness and

191
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:06,060
fearlessness that it does protect us because now we

192
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:14,820
become safe from ourselves so fear is a danger to ourselves

193
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:21,420
and fearlessness is how we become safe from ourselves where we're not going to

194
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:29,579
cause harm to ourselves we're not going to contract and hold attention and which can cause you know all kinds

195
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:36,359
of chronic physical and mental and emotional problems for people to be chronically

196
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:41,520
tense and held and so having something like meditation

197
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:49,920
made even something like exercise and other things that we do that allow us to relax deeply

198
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:56,460
to calm deeply to start experiencing kind of states of Peace where tensions

199
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:03,240
begin to dissolve where we're not living in tension and we have an experience

200
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:10,380
of being safe for ourselves and the Heart of fearlessness is to have

201
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:15,380
that kind of safety you become safe for yourself

202
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:20,760
and that sense of and then absence of fear

203
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:29,220
changes the nature of consciousness of how we feel we're aware it's so easy to be aware with such a

204
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:34,920
strong filter of fear and tension that that just seems like that's the nature

205
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:41,540
of certainly of Consciousness it's the truth but more powerfully is that

206
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:47,400
consciousness of awareness attention that is colored by fear

207
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:53,160
then sees fear in the world and we don't become necessarily

208
00:41:53,160 --> 00:42:01,320
objective clear Seer of what's actually out there because in a sense everything becomes dangerous because everything is

209
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:07,200
then now seen through that framework of fear

210
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:13,920
if everything is seen through the framework of fearlessness then a fearlessness where we're not

211
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:19,079
we're safe for ourselves then we're in a much better place to

212
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:26,900
track the inner wisdom the inner Clarity the perceptions the hunches the

213
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:33,780
the reactions we have that we need to be in touch with in order to be wise about

214
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:40,320
what's out there of course there's dangers out there some are more subtle than others but there's

215
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:45,780
probably less danger out in the world than you can ever imagine

216
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:52,619
and so if you you know have the wisdom Fearless wisdom

217
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:58,740
wisdom to ascertain really know and connect deep inside of yourself with all

218
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:04,020
the different sources of intelligence that operate then you can probably tune into the

219
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:09,300
difference between what is really a danger and what is projected danger not

220
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:14,880
really there they kind of projected danger that often if self often enough is self-fulfilling

221
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,180
it sometimes creates the very problem that we're trying to avoid

222
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:26,819
so so for the next 24 hours if you like

223
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:34,140
um you might say study how it is for you the range from tension to peace

224
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:42,119
and when you when you're tense where's the peace when you're peaceful where's the tension

225
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:48,599
and may that kind of clarity in the in the in the range of who you are and how

226
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:56,640
you are May that clarity help you to uh be less caught stuck in

227
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:05,460
the tension but more fluid and more more in touch with the peace

228
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:10,880
that's in our hearts so thank you
