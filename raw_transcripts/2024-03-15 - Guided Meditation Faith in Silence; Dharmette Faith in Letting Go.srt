1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:08,360
hi folks welcome [Music] um yeah nice to see your names there are

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:13,400
a couple Rogue live streams that were happening

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:19,279
that were set somehow I couldn't control it but set to private so you could maybe

4
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:24,359
see the video but um there wasn't a chat

5
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:30,279
and if you and I know we need our chat we need our emojis and our good morning

6
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:37,600
in the S and it makes YouTube actually pretty great I love uh

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,600
seeing all of that so if you're on a stream that doesn't have a chat just um

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:50,640
refresh or go back to the the the U IMC YouTube page and um should uh should be

9
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:58,920
able to get it um okay so uh so welcome welcome

10
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,920
all

11
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:14,040
okay so uh it's our Friday here and um sit in

12
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,720
a moment

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:29,040
um sometimes it's it's occurred to me that um excuse me it's occurred to me that

14
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:36,200
that um all all thinking is coping coping is maybe has a pajora of

15
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:44,680
kind of tone but it's like yeah we think to cope in one way or

16
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,240
another and very powerful that we can do that as

17
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:58,000
animals and and so it gets reinforced at such a

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,479
deep level and the Dharma is about doing something

19
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:09,360
a little new and uh

20
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:17,200
to actually release our coping strategies our kind of Moment by moment

21
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,640
coping strategies we uh need something like

22
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:30,480
faith and the faith we need is a faith in in

23
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,120
silence that it's safe to let go a faith in letting go a faith

24
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:44,239
in in love and uh a faith that it's it's okay

25
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:52,280
safe enough to uh stop reading the signals of our

26
00:02:52,280 --> 00:03:00,480
body the kind of affective stimulation the emotional activation the state of

27
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,319
arousal Valance to to cease reading that

28
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,200
as indicative of threat or

29
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,760
opportunity and to in a

30
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:24,480
sense all the feeling that we feel means the same

31
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:32,760
thing to uh to let go so well uh we'll practice and

32
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,080
um explore so finding a a posture that

33
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,040
feels uh

34
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,720
sustainable

35
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720
e

36
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,639
e

37
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:17,840
just bringing some some soothing to your body

38
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,639
mind

39
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:05,240
e everything looks different from the the

40
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,199
perspective of

41
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,639
Tranquility so maybe take some Fuller

42
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:40,720
breaths relax the jaw you're around the eyes

43
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,599
temples relax our

44
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
belly

45
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,160
soft

46
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
belly

47
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
e

48
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,440
some reassurance that uh

49
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:40,320
it's not neglectful to put down comple

50
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:50,160
complications the Loose Ends of our life the problems that need to be solved it's not can feel like neglect not to chew on

51
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,279
those at all moments it's

52
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:01,800
okay okay to put them down not

53
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
neglect

54
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
e

55
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

56
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

57
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:20,320
in the end our thinking cannot protect us from

58
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,920
life but our heart

59
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,680
training canot do so

60
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:05,480
much so we

61
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,959
nurture kind of faith in

62
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
silence

63
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
e

64
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
e

65
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

66
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:21,519
the present moment doesn't wish to hurt

67
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
you

68
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:43,600
let him go doesn't wish to cost

69
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
you

70
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

71
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

72
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

73
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:52,360
it is our deep Habit to

74
00:16:52,959 --> 00:17:00,839
overread all phenomena

75
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,798
to make them mean too

76
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:26,199
much it's maybe uh today maybe just for

77
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:30,840
a moment

78
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,519
we

79
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
stop

80
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

81
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

82
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

83
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,840
the the movements of our mind so uh so

84
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:56,559
innocent so innocent that we scramble and

85
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
cope

86
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:16,039
but uh if all we do is scramble and cope fa takes the

87
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:33,200
heart the silence doesn't care even a tiny bit

88
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,919
who we think we

89
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,880
are we come

90
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:11,400
to listen to The Silence take our cues from it trust

91
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,799
it keep letting go into

92
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
it

93
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

94
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

95
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

96
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

97
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

98
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

99
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

100
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

101
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

102
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

103
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

104
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
e

105
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,120
e

106
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,120
e

107
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,039
e

108
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,039
all

109
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,039
for

110
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,960
e

111
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:04,360
okay so

112
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:10,840
um was reading reading a book about um William

113
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:17,440
William James and um who is

114
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:23,559
yeah uh got the the potency of uh the

115
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:30,760
Dharma and um and this is uh from uh from his his

116
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:39,320
his dad actually kind of intense quote I saw so um James's dad says um

117
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:46,720
every every person who has reached even their intellectual teens begins to

118
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:55,000
suspect that life is no force that it is not Gentile

119
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,120
comedy that it flowers and fructifies on

120
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:07,080
the contrary out of the profoundest tragic depths of the essential

121
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:12,519
Dar in which its subject's roots are

122
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:19,200
plunged the natural inheritance of everyone who is capable of spiritual

123
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,279
life is in an unsubdued Forest where the wolf

124
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:31,200
howls and the obscene bird of night

125
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:38,000
Chatters it's a little Grim maybe but uh speaks to

126
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,399
something important life is no

127
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:52,919
farce it's no force great as uh the Zen folks say

128
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:59,399
great is the matter of life and death and

129
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:04,559
so uh what are we doing here what are we

130
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:12,720
doing here what what is actually on offer in this path what what

131
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:19,880
um what is the Buddha's uh promise

132
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:29,600
and to to meet the the kind of existential intensity of The Human

133
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:35,399
Condition with some modum of dignity to meet it with some modum of dignity that

134
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:42,840
takes training training not thinking but

135
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:52,880
training and it's easy for it to happen this way but we're not not here to graft the

136
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:59,559
Dharma into the infrastructure of our neurosis we're we're actually doing

137
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:07,399
something that is new like something that is different and new and takes

138
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:14,320
courage because it's unfamiliar to the kind of habit energies that that

139
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:20,079
run our lives so this is um

140
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:25,839
aaka she says on the spiritual path uh we have

141
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:32,280
to uh try TR something new in fact spiritual path takes quite a lot of

142
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:37,760
Courage because it means chucking out the old without knowing what the new one

143
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:45,919
is actually like if we don't have that courage we can't go on such a

144
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:53,440
path and so this path of relinquishment surrender

145
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,839
Letting Go all of that relinquishment

146
00:34:58,839 --> 00:35:04,200
surrender silence Letting Go all of that feels

147
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:13,680
like Risk feels like Risk a certain kind of sense of the the extra vulnerability we

148
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:19,400
encounter that's what I was alluding to when I said it feels like neglect almost

149
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:26,160
to put our thought down to put the knots of our life down to put our problems

150
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:32,160
down not to try to solve them in every moment feels like neglecting a loved one

151
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:38,359
or something it it feels like risk it leaves us feeling especially

152
00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:44,720
vulnerable and so we hold on in our lives we hold on in

153
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:52,200
our meditation we hang on to what's uh what's familiar and we just keep pinging

154
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:59,240
to all the familiar reference points but

155
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:04,720
there are uh many Dharma places to which we cannot

156
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:09,800
bring our knowing many Dharma places to which we

157
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:17,599
cannot bring our preferences many Dharma places to which

158
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:26,520
uh we cannot continue to hum the song of

159
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:33,720
self we're doing something new and to even get a taste of the

160
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:39,800
newness we have to relinquish something of what we've

161
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:45,119
always done

162
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:50,599
z um said the search for uh the search for reality is the most dangerous

163
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:56,520
undertaking for it it uh will destroy the world in which you

164
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:02,040
live search for reality is dangerous it destroys the world in which you live

165
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:08,720
we've sort of acclimatized to our own world of personal meetings over reading the

166
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:14,520
signals over reading our feeling and

167
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:20,040
thought over reading

168
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:29,520
and Dharma practice is uh relaxing all of that that energy of over reading

169
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:39,420
this um is hard it's hard to um it's hard to trust that we

170
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:44,520
[Music] actually find our power by opening

171
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:51,480
deeply to helplessness it's like very

172
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:58,640
counterintuitive for our system that we actually find our power our dignity

173
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:03,760
in opening to helplessness and maybe that that's the

174
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:11,359
kind of Faith required to let go that we we trust like yeah a trust in the

175
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:21,440
silence finding our our power entails like consciously

176
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:27,560
experiencing uh helplessness the helplessness of Dua of the first Noble

177
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:33,200
truth that there is suffering the helplessness of the the the dir into

178
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:38,800
which the the roots are plunged as James

179
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:47,000
said and so we uh we find our power in

180
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:56,440
this way we find our peace when we don't insist on it when we don't insist on it we find

181
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:04,599
ourselves by relinquishing ourselves so Letting Go U moves us

182
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:09,839
towards freedom but often hurts some often hurts

183
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:18,280
some and to trust that the suffering we encounter in practice is effective

184
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:24,800
suffering it's not the suffering that compounds suffering that leads to more suffering to trust that this is

185
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:32,760
effective suffering to trust that this hurts is not harming that takes some

186
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:39,960
faith and so we hold on to uh something we we

187
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:48,560
trust even though it um we're not sure it'll support us feels

188
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:55,720
like a a thin strand as U Ain Ain

189
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:03,880
suito says um Awakening is based on the process of Letting Go letting go is about carefully

190
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:09,640
revealing assumptions biases life messages and releasing

191
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:16,119
them you can liken the process to a gradual disent out of the tumult and

192
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:22,160
gridlock of your personal world into the free space of the

193
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:27,680
uncondition it's rather like lowering oneself down a rope to know how to do

194
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:33,839
that it's a matter of holding on to something you trust even though it seems like a thin

195
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:41,760
strand then Letting Go little by little trusting the downward

196
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:50,000
pull this is the trajectory of non engagement and

197
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:59,760
abandonment The Descent out of the gridlock of your person person Al

198
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:08,440
world we make that descent with uh with faith actually

199
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:14,280
Faith many of the kind of gateways that we get to thresholds in our Dharma

200
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:20,720
practice adore where we're letting go more

201
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:29,800
deeply understanding something in a fresh way when we get to that gate what what um what what opens that

202
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:37,079
door is not our willfulness but our faith our faith that whatever is on the

203
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:45,760
other side of that gate will not harm us so we trust that downward pull the

204
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:52,800
kind of uh this this kind of gravity maybe we say is

205
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:01,920
safe and into that

206
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:07,720
um that that kind of wondrous dark

207
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:14,560
open space of relinquishment yeah there are fewer and

208
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:21,720
fewer signpost fewer and fewer you know like we in some ways we

209
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:28,079
our life is just lived we keep like orienting orienting to this this this

210
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:34,920
this what happens when there are fewer and fewer signposts the signpost of preferences

211
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:41,400
the signpost of the story of self signpost of self

212
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:46,839
other past future it's like all the kind of

213
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:52,559
Accutron of self we just relax and trust that

214
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:58,079
downward pull and

215
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:08,200
to uh to care more about awareness than our

216
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:14,680
life more about this moment than my problems even if that's just for a

217
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:20,680
moment that that takes faith

218
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:29,119
and even if it's just for a moment that moment detonates something in the heart

219
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:43,559
and uh we um begin to inherit the

220
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:53,000
