1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:08,160
so welcome welcome a really warm welcome for all of you

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,160
it's so nice to be practicing together i was smiling underneath my mask a little bit

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:20,560
there when i was just thinking how great opportunity it is to

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:27,439
come together so a deep bow to all of you for coming

5
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,320
and to our friends on youtube who are here with us

6
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:43,840
so tonight i'd like to talk a little bit about you know we often we have these good

7
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,039
intentions these good ideas of things that we're going to do and

8
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,480
maybe they don't always come to fruition

9
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:01,039
don't always happen and we all know this right it's so much easier to have ideas about things to do

10
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,960
and then it's something completely different to actually do them

11
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,880
we all have this experience i'm sure and so one thing that i'd like to talk

12
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,640
about today is this i'm just distracted here for a moment

13
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,640
while i'm trying to sorry keep track of uh what's happening

14
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,399
on the other side of that camera okay so

15
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:37,040
one of the things i'd like to talk about today is one of these uh pyramids

16
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,960
and so parame is a word that often gets translated as perfection

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,799
but that doesn't feel quite um inspiring perfection just feels like

18
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:57,920
some idealistic or either worldly or something quality but

19
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:04,880
this idea of pyramid these are these ten qualities that are associated with awakening that

20
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,440
really support awakening so they're associated with this movement towards freedom towards

21
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:18,080
greater ease and this movement towards

22
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,599
freedom and the tradition holds that there are

23
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:29,440
10 of them and these are practices that are in our daily life not just on the cushion you

24
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:35,200
know so much of the buddhist teachings are about what happens you know with our eyes

25
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,440
closed but these are about what's happening in daily life as well as you know in our

26
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,959
meditation practice and i don't know how long ago it was but

27
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:53,040
some time ago i started on this list of paramis and so now i'd like to add one

28
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,360
and this is the parame of aditana aritana

29
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,720
it rhymes with satypatana some of you may know the sati patana the

30
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,959
four foundations of mindfulness aditona has that same ending tonic had

31
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:17,040
like foundation something that be something we can stand on it's derived from what we can stand

32
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:24,239
on an audi has this idea of fullness or completeness or maybe the next

33
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,480
next step or something so aritana often gets

34
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:37,920
translated as determination like this foundation which allows things to come to completion

35
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,319
so determination resolve resoluteness

36
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:51,360
tenacity stick-to-itiveness you know something like this

37
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,599
and resolve is the eighth in this list of permis quickly i'll just say what the

38
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:04,000
other ones are generosity ethical behavior

39
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,400
generation renunciation wisdom energy

40
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,079
patience truth and resolve is number eight

41
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,479
number nine is loving kindness and number ten is equanimity

42
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,759
so you can see that

43
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:35,520
resolve is kind of you know down there in the list it's uh number eight uh out of ten

44
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:43,680
and part of the reason why it's there later in the list is because it requires a mind

45
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:51,360
that has already has a little bit of experience with some of the

46
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,919
the peace some of the ease that can happen with this uh renunciation was

47
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,199
letting go with generosity with ethical behavior

48
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,560
working with truth there's allows this mind to say yes okay

49
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,240
this is the direction i want to go so resolve is a is

50
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:22,560
is a commitment that's combined with a sense of okay i i i want to stick to this find my

51
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:29,919
way with us so one way to think about resolve is that

52
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:35,680
it's like a gentle and persistent wind

53
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:43,360
that keeps blowing and is like supporting us in this particular direction

54
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,560
so we could has this we can feel it at our backs

55
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:55,520
just encouraging us to take the next step just the next step

56
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:04,720
and so for some people this idea of resolve or steadfastness persistence is

57
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,319
not something that really needs to be cultivated there are some people who this is the way that they move through

58
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:17,199
the world is they set a goal they start and they complete and they finish and that's just what they do

59
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,639
there's they have their life is filled with this so maybe

60
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:28,080
just the sticktuaness and completeness isn't part of the parmy for them

61
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,840
but might be with the prior me is for those types of individuals

62
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,600
is to be able to stay connected to others to stay connected to

63
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:47,120
themselves while they're completing a task instead of kind of like slipping into

64
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:53,199
some sheer doggedness that kind of has this mood of get out of my way i have

65
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:59,199
something to do or maybe like a type of a tunnel vision

66
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,960
of not paying attention to the impact it's

67
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:11,039
having on others or not being aware of the impact it's having on ourselves and

68
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:17,520
maybe not taking care of ourselves because we feel like we have to finish this thing

69
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:25,440
so resolve aditana resoluteness is not stubbornness

70
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:33,039
even though it shares from the outside it might look a little bit like that but stubbornness also has this kind of like

71
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:39,759
ignoring the concerns and welfare for ourselves and for others

72
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,400
but it is a different way than

73
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,120
often when we're thinking about um where we want we have a direction we want to

74
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:59,520
go we often have a focusing on what's getting in the way

75
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:05,520
and often that comes with replaying and rehearsing and resentment

76
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,960
and blaming and we can find ourselves in this

77
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,240
loop of uh just thinking like well if only that hadn't happened or i should have done

78
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:23,599
this i should have said that or you know something along these lines that takes a tremendous amount of energy

79
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:29,520
so resolve isn't about just um

80
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,279
pushing through no matter what it's associated with wisdom

81
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:43,279
of course it is right if it's part of this path of practice towards greater freedom it's gonna have freedom

82
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:49,120
and wisdom as part of the practice itself

83
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:56,240
right the means is not completely different than the goal of course not

84
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,320
so what one of the ways that makes aditana

85
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,000
this resolve a pyramid rather than just another wholesome quality

86
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,879
is that it's associated with freedom awakening enlightenment

87
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,480
so it points us in that direction and it also

88
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,680
uh expresses as as best we can as what's available to

89
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:35,040
us at that time these qualities of going towards awakening going towards greater freedom

90
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,839
with some compassion and warm-heartedness

91
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:46,399
so aritana it serves to it kind of like strengthens all the other pyramids

92
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,519
helps us to be generous and to refrain from being harm and

93
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:57,600
to be truthful when it's difficult and certainly all these other good qualities

94
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:05,040
but just to recognize that we need

95
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:12,480
resolve for this practice simply because it is not always easy

96
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:19,360
sometimes it's difficult i'm having a regular meditation practice

97
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,800
is difficult going on retreats is difficult organizing one's life so that you can go

98
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,959
and retreat is difficult or once you're on retreat that's difficult too

99
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:36,320
right so sometimes we need resolve just to be with

100
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,760
the difficulties that arise when the mind starts to quiet and settle down

101
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:48,079
this can be the time when some of these difficulties from earlier in our life maybe even decades

102
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,839
ago start to arise

103
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,680
so the purpose of this of this practice is to help us to see what we haven't seen before

104
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,519
to realize what we haven't realized before in order for us to

105
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:14,399
do this to be stretched a little bit beyond what we've seen before we need to

106
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:20,959
be stretched allow ourselves to be stretched so resolve determination is a way to

107
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:28,959
maybe stretch us just a little bit out of our comfort zone but not to the point of breaking

108
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:34,560
this is where wisdom comes in right of course we need wisdom with this

109
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:40,160
there can be a way this sheer doggedness that ends up

110
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:46,079
just being harmful and painful i certainly have um done this too with

111
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:52,959
uh being on a long retreat and having this feeling like okay you know i don't know exactly what's

112
00:11:52,959 --> 00:12:00,560
gonna happen but something better happened on this retreat and so just kind of like just the sense

113
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:06,000
of pushing and striving and not really noticing that at the same

114
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,440
time i was pushing and striving i was developing all this

115
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,480
um aversion and ill will towards everything else that i thought was like distracting

116
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,959
me and and including all this poor self-recrimination diana get it together

117
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:28,800
come on you have to go you know i was not noticing like how mean i was being to myself and

118
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:36,800
getting filled with irritation with everybody around me and week after week of this you know

119
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:43,519
it wasn't pretty and i after the end of that retreat i was a little bit of a mess

120
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:50,000
so there's so many different ways that this can show up this pushing and

121
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,760
striving in a way that's not helpful

122
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:02,639
so we need reserve resolve we need determination to stretch us

123
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,720
but not to break us and this is part of the art of practice

124
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:15,440
is to know what what is appropriate what is appropriate of stretching because this practice is about transformation

125
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,680
and of course for transformation to happen it requires a little bit of effort it requires

126
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,800
some sustained

127
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,720
effort some persistence

128
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,800
so what are some of the things that get in the way i'm not telling you something that you

129
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,839
anything that you don't already know we know that this takes some effort

130
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,760
sometimes we might have these underlying beliefs these ideas that okay my spiritual life is going to be about as

131
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,040
long as i i'm just nice and pleasant

132
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:03,240
and calm that should be enough

133
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,639
it's a it's certainly it is part of this practice but it's not enough

134
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:18,160
if we feel like we if there are times in our practice when that is perfectly sufficient and enough

135
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:24,160
and it's all we can do to get to the cushion it's all we can do to practice at all

136
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:30,079
but if we think the entire practice at all times under all situations

137
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:36,320
just have it's all about acceptance and i do teach a lot about this because

138
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:42,959
for me i this has been kind of a little bit of my edge just learning to accept and allow

139
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:50,320
but at the same time there are times when there needs to be a little bit of a warrior

140
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,000
spirit joseph goldstein

141
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,839
describes it as when you're noticing that there's some thoughts that are coming up that are just unhelpful and

142
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:08,959
you find yourself kind of ruminating or in this loop going around and around he describes it sometimes

143
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:15,040
it's helpful just to use his expression just chop off the head of the thoughts

144
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:21,839
you know kind of so maybe sometimes that's what's needed

145
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:28,240
like no this isn't helpful i'm not going to do it and so of course this is part of the art

146
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:36,240
of practice to know okay when is it's more about opening allowing and accepting and just watching things arise

147
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:42,399
and when is it time to a little bit more of that warrior spirit and to say nope i'm going to go a

148
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:49,199
different direction this isn't helpful my practice requires both

149
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:54,720
and for us to not think that it's only one way that could be a hindrance to our

150
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:01,199
practice to think that it's only one flavor only one way to meet all the different things

151
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,560
that arise during practice

152
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:15,440
so one thing i do want to say is so i'm talking about uh kind of like this tenacity stick to it

153
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:21,360
stick to it-ness but they don't want us to think that

154
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,959
when we don't follow through is a failure

155
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:34,800
instead this practice is about okay what can i learn here

156
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,160
what what what were the conditions that made it difficult for me to follow

157
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,440
through is there something that i can understand

158
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:51,360
here is there something that um can support me

159
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:57,360
for my other aspirations the other things that i want to do

160
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:04,400
so instead of you know completely giving up when we feel like oh okay i didn't follow through on

161
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:10,880
this resolve that i had made that i had intended okay

162
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:17,438
okay what can i learn here maybe to investigate

163
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,480
what what was what was happening maybe was the

164
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:28,240
resolution that i made was it maybe too vague

165
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:35,520
maybe too um made a resolve about something really

166
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:42,400
far in the future without also considering the steps that would get there it can be inspiring and beautiful to

167
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:50,799
have aspirations for our practice aspirations of greater freedom greater peace

168
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:58,720
but also an integral part of this is again so bring in some wisdom okay

169
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:07,679
so what what can i do today what can i do this moment that's moving in that direction

170
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,760
so maybe there wasn't follow-through because there wasn't a step it wasn't of thinking of okay what's the next step

171
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:22,320
instead of thinking i just want this or have this idea about some future state

172
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:28,840
without thinking about okay how can this moment right now contribute

173
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:38,720
and recently i've made this little

174
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,320
statement that i remind myself on occasion that

175
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:49,600
says physiology is paramount and

176
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:56,960
just to remind me that if i'm not feeling well haven't slept not eating well not

177
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,000
exercising you know all these types of things it has an impact that

178
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,840
sometimes just sitting on the cushion or whatever we're doing can't surmount that

179
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:14,080
we have to take care of ourselves as well as half of the human population

180
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,280
has hormones that are shifting on a regular basis and to just kind of honor

181
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:26,240
and respect that too and just kind of respect our physiology like okay this we can't pretend like

182
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:34,170
it's not there so maybe our resolutions our results have to be um

183
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:39,600
[Music] really honor and respect our physiology as well where

184
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:45,039
we are with that and maybe we learn like okay

185
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:52,799
if i haven't eaten i'm more likely to be grumpy and to say things that i wish i hadn't said

186
00:19:52,799 --> 00:20:00,559
we all know this i'm not saying anything we don't know but sometimes it's just helpful to say it out loud or to

187
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:07,840
have this idea that or to be reminded of it in some kind of way

188
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,559
so what do we make resolves on what do we

189
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:21,840
make aspirations with on

190
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:30,159
what is the aspiration that comes forth after we've been practicing a little bit

191
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,799
once we've tasted some of the fruits of practice

192
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:43,760
probably in a generic idea or in a uh maybe broad brush is that we want to

193
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,840
move away from suffering we want to have more freedom

194
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:58,799
but is there a way that we can make it more specific for us is there a way that we can make it more

195
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:07,039
relevant for us and this is part of the art of practice too is to have a grand aspiration

196
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:16,600
which for me i think is a beautiful thing to think about it is possible to have greater freedom it is possible

197
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,799
the buddha points to this we know individuals and teachers and

198
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:29,120
people that have found greater ease and freedom so

199
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,080
why not for us

200
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:41,200
why not but then to

201
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:47,919
to join with this kind of aspiration

202
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:55,039
it's okay so what can i do now it's related to this

203
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:03,440
and just to recognize that you know we don't all have to have the same aspiration and of course

204
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:10,159
um different times of our life different seasons of our life different seasons of our practice

205
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,840
we'll have different ones

206
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,960
and so can we make an aspiration and a resolve

207
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:31,679
something that's inspiring but also to do it in a way in which the

208
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,360
the resolve itself was a beautiful thing

209
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:46,480
as not harsh not this sense of hard obligation but the resolve itself was a

210
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,280
beautiful thing what would that be like

211
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,640
so the buddha taught that there were four

212
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,559
supports for resolves we could also call them four

213
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:11,600
resolves so four things that could support us and

214
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:18,159
reaching and making results the way this works kind of is that these

215
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:25,440
are supports for all our resolves and so because they're supports we can also like resolve on them and they will help

216
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:33,919
us with anything else we want to do so the first of these four is wisdom

217
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:41,600
and this makes perfect sense right we need to bring some wisdom to the aspirations we have to the results we

218
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:47,600
have the ones that are appropriate for us and help bring in some of this

219
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:54,880
quality of what's helpful what's not helpful what's skillful what's not skillful

220
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:02,000
help us to set aspirations that aim at something worthwhile

221
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:08,880
for our life energy to put our life energy towards and one as i said that's a stretch for

222
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,880
us but not up to the point of breaking as well as wisdom is needed for clearly

223
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:21,440
understanding what are the different things that would be required what are the different steps

224
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:29,520
how can how can i create the conditions for this aspiration to arise

225
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,080
so wisdom and to be sure all of us have enough

226
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:44,240
wisdom to know what the next step is it's not like we have to wait to have enough wisdom

227
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:51,600
the second one is truth part of bringing truth in with our

228
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:59,520
aspirations could be just asking ourselves what's needed here what are the conditions what's the next step

229
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:06,320
but then the truth part comes in and being honest with ourselves

230
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:16,320
if i want to have more settledness maybe i need to

231
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:22,399
spend less time on the internet for example

232
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:30,159
maybe i need to spend less time ruminating about my favorite thing to

233
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:35,600
ruminate about and sometimes it's

234
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:43,760
hard difficult to see what we might have this idea what's required of us and we might feel like no no i don't want to do that

235
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,080
but this honesty about what's required

236
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:59,320
and then the third one is relinquishment

237
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:06,320
of course this can be something some letting go that's going to be required some letting

238
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,760
go that's going to be needed we know this from the dhamma part

239
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:18,640
of this famous verse right if by giving up a lesser happiness

240
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:25,360
one could experience a greater happiness a wise person would renounce the lesser

241
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,640
to behold the greater so just recognizing that

242
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,039
some there'll be some letting go that has to happen

243
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:43,279
of course that does if we want to exercise more then we have to find

244
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:50,480
we have to do less of something else in our life just to fit the time in

245
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:57,200
four resolves wisdom truth relinquishment then the last one is

246
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,640
peace is there a way that we can keep the mind

247
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:09,120
calm while working towards an aspiration

248
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:14,960
there will be difficulties it wouldn't be an aspiration it wouldn't

249
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:20,880
require determination if there were no difficulties there will be difficulties

250
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:28,720
is there a way that as best we can we can keep some composure some ease

251
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:35,600
about okay this is hard this is hard

252
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:44,080
and maybe i don't feel like i can take the next step right now but i'm not gonna abandon myself

253
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:50,159
maybe it's not gonna look pretty maybe it's not gonna be in a straight line but to just

254
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:55,840
not abandon ourselves maybe it doesn't look the way that we

255
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:02,559
were expecting hoping imagining but to hang in there with our

256
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:08,000
aspirations to hang in there with ourselves

257
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:16,600
just one step at a time just one step at a time

258
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:31,840
resolve determination resoluteness tenacity

259
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:38,399
just this ability to begin again

260
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:46,799
and again and again not only for ourselves but for our

261
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:52,799
communities and our loved ones

262
00:28:52,799 --> 00:29:00,480
to hang in there with them to hang in there with ourselves when we

263
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,919
come across some difficulties in a way that

264
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:11,200
brings peace brings freedom and has that kind of that peace the freedom

265
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,559
the letting go the truth is integral parts of it

266
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:25,520
so that our practice is a benefit not only for ourselves but for those we come in contact with

267
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:30,559
and maybe they come in contact with others and this way

268
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:35,760
our practice can be for the benefit of all beings

269
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,679
everywhere thank you

270
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:57,760
so thank you all and

271
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:05,520

272
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:13,440
heart full of appreciation of our coming together practicing together
