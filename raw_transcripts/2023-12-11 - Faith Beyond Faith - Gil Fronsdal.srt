1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,160
so

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:17,680
um so today I want to talk about a topic which may or may not be

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:26,279
popular and uh that that topic is Faith and uh some people love this topic

4
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:31,840
some people just the word of it raises a raises alarm for them

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:38,680
and I do hope that in the course of the talk uh the talk will be inspiring

6
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,719
something in you and and there's a number of steps that we're going to go

7
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:49,440
through the first is going to be um something that maybe isn't so popular

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,879
but uh is linguistic what word are we talking about what do we mean when we use the

9
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:01,680
word faith and um but the important aspect of this is that part of Buddhism the

10
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,000
engagement for for people who don't speak poly didn't grw up with this ancient Buddhist

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,439
language part of the as we try to understand this tradition there's a part

12
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:20,400
of it that we get to make for ourselves we get to understand and construct the

13
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,520
part of Buddhism that's really personal personalize the religion some very deep and important way and there's a part of

14
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:34,079
it if you want to be engaged in Buddhism it's not something you you it's your personal opinion your personal whe you

15
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:40,840
know whatever you'd like it to be that's what you make it up there is something which has some Integrity to it which is

16
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,520
Buddhism but what is that so what is it that you get to make up personalize in

17
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:53,000
some very important way and what is it that you can't quite personalize and still call it Buddhism so that's part of

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,119
the Journey of this talk uh as we go into this word

19
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:05,240
faith so begin with a story that uh before when the Buddha

20
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:12,200
before he was Buddha when he was gotama in the seek out and is seeking for

21
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:20,040
awakening for the end of suffering he practiced with different teachers and uh he perfected what they

22
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:26,040
had to teach and they actually wanted him to be a teacher in their system and he said no this is not it

23
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,160
yet and but he made this very interesting statement he said um my

24
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,200
these teachers I have they have a certain Faith they have faith and I have

25
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:43,200
faith so I think I can go off and do it in myself by myself but he wasn't enlightened yet

26
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,239
there was no Buddha in the world yet to have faith in there was no Buddhist teachings to have faith in there was he

27
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:56,280
he used the word faith that's something he had and um and so it wasn't a belief in

28
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:02,720
something but it was a confidence in in something is it was it in himself was it

29
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,000
in something that wasn't quite himself what was it that he meant by the word

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,840
faith the the word he's using in P is Sada and srit some of you who Indian

31
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,560
background maybe know it more as Shada and um and so what is it that this

32
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,680
how is it how do we translate this word into English some translators do not use the

33
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:35,239
word faith often for good good reason and uh and the most common one

34
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:41,760
they use is confidence sometimes people use the word trust those are the three kind of

35
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:50,519
primary words but the word faith in English has a wide Rich uh range of meanings some of

36
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:57,599
them which have wonderfully evocative emotional qualities to it heartfelt qu qualities that the word confidence

37
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:04,120
doesn't have confidence as a as important as it is um I it from I think

38
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:10,799
for most people doesn't necessarily evoke some deep feeling of heartfelt trust or something really kind kind of

39
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:18,400
inspiring in the heart confidence is good but um and um so so the the other word

40
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:25,560
that's often associated with faith in English is belief now what's fascinating about the

41
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:32,840
word belief is that in its history it comes from it comes from the word to

42
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:40,560
love Leaf in Old English and in German me meant to love and Scholars of ancient

43
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,919
of middle age middle medieval religion say that there was no questioning

44
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:56,360
whether you believed or didn't believe in God in 10th Century 12th century Germany or

45
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:03,400
France or some place like that it was just taken for granted but when you said you believed in God

46
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:10,080
what you were saying you love God and you know there a different feeling there's here this is what this

47
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,280
is where I put my love and uh so to believe not as a Act

48
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,880
of just Credence like okay they I have to believe these in English you know I have to kind of now accept these

49
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:28,919
teachings as being true that's not the that's not maybe what the original idea of belief is but

50
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:34,919
this is where I put my love so if faith and belief are related

51
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:42,759
is there something about faith that this is what I this is where I put my love my this is where I put my heartfelt

52
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:48,280
feeling of value and appreciation and Delight is in

53
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:53,440
something we use the word faith in many fascinating ways I think in

54
00:05:53,440 --> 00:06:01,120
English uh uh keep the faith asso partly means that keep the

55
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,440
commitment keep your appreciation of something keep going with it being

56
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:13,400
faithful to something means don't betray it being faithful in marriage don't don't betray it be stay to the

57
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,680
commitment it's more than having confidence you you lose something if you

58
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:24,720
keep translating Sada as confidence you lose a sense of Love or commitment a

59
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,240
certain loyalty Fidelity uh is uh is a

60
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,479
related to the same Roots Latin roots as faith is related but it means that means

61
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:43,400
kind of a loyalty the faith that we keep Loyals they committed I uh the way that I all these

62
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:49,319
words have different meanings for every individual different associations there's an expression in

63
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:54,360
English uh a person of faith and for me that just makes me happy when I hear

64
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:00,280
that phrase for other of you probably it frightens you so so all depends on the

65
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:07,479
associations we have right and so for me the person of faith is someone who holds

66
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:13,479
certain fundamental values of goodness it is not about what they believe but

67
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:18,759
rather that they're ethical a person of faith I expect a certain high level of

68
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:25,560
of of moral goodness that the how they go through the world I think of them as someone who's more gentle not assertive

69
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:32,840
not domineering uh kind of a gentle kind of willingness to be of service from their

70
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:39,280
love so what does the what do these words mean for you and that's where you

71
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:47,479
get to make it up you get to take the word ancient word Sada very important word in Buddhism and

72
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:52,520
decide for yourself what is the word that you would like what English word

73
00:07:52,520 --> 00:08:00,759
works for you that inspires you that's meaningful for you that is useful for you to have if if you translating as

74
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:07,680
faith is not useful for you don't translate it that way if these you know

75
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:14,199
well-meaning Buddhist teachers use the word faith just code

76
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:19,759
switch and just okay you know that person said Faith so I'm going to use

77
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:26,840
confidence the teachers who like to use confidence for Sada want to really want to emphasize

78
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:32,039
practicing you want to have confidence that this is something you can do and so

79
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:39,360
just like learning any kind of skill you it helps to have confidence in learning that skill so Buddhist practice involves

80
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,240
developing skills and so emphasizing the confidence side means okay I can do it

81
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,480
I'm going to engage some people like trust there are

82
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:57,399
plenty of times in my Buddhist career where I prefer to translate sada's trust

83
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:05,040
there was something profound that I really really felt like I could rest in or rely on that really would support me

84
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,519
and one of the primary things that I trust fundamentally uh that's come from doing

85
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:17,399
this practice is mindfulness itself it's not a belief but it's a capacity that I

86
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:23,079
have it's a practice or a capacity a way of being that I just trust more than

87
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:31,040
anything else because it's it's proved reliable over and over again and then there's word belief and

88
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:37,680
now that you know that belief at least originally meant to love maybe you want to translate Faith as something to do

89
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,200
with love uh faith is where we put our heart

90
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,800
in so it's heartfelt or what we weren't willing to put our heart in and let our

91
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:55,399
heart rely on so in the ancient tradition in Buddha

92
00:09:55,399 --> 00:10:02,800
Faith was more a quality of personality of character more than a faculty that we

93
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:09,600
have more than an action that we do so again it's pointing to something deeper

94
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:17,240
than many of the ways we think about and we think about you know having faith in something but rather a fa a faculty that

95
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:23,399
we have that we can awaken and what is that what would it be for you so this is

96
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:28,839
a part of Buddhism you get to make up for yourself personalize and the meaning of these

97
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:34,680
words words and how we play with them and so some of you have been around my teachings long enough and probably more

98
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,480
than I should someone will ask a question and I'll say well that depends on what you mean by the

99
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,760
word and uh because then we want that's a way of being careful and respectful for people because otherwise we might

100
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:52,800
miss each other because we might have different definitions of the word and if we specify what we mean I think it's

101
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,040
much more we can find our way together so this word

102
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:04,959
Sada so um um so when the Buddha before he

103
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:11,399
awakened Saidi have S and that that g gave him the trust the

104
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:18,480
faith the confidence the love to go off and practice also another story that Buddha

105
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:25,399
tells before he was awakened was um uh how he dealt with

106
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:31,880
fear he had fear isn't that nice to know some some of you probably have occasional

107
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:39,240
fear anxiety and stuff and so the Buddha did it as well and he had to practice with his fear uh that's was something he

108
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,600
had to contend with and um and the

109
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,720
um many of the Buddhist practitioners in his time went off into the forest to

110
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:55,720
practice alone and some fell came along to the Buddha and said well it's frightening to go into the forest and

111
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:01,480
practice isn't it isn't too frightening to be able to practice you can't get concentrated in the forest and the

112
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:09,399
Buddha said well actually before I was awakened I went into the forest too and

113
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:15,880
practiced but before I did I checked check checked myself out to make sure

114
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:22,959
that I was prepared for that and he said do I have any sensual desire that's

115
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:28,480
going to make it difficult to be in the forest alone like if you're lusting after a person in the forest all the

116
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:37,279
time that's it's not you're not going to get concentrated so do I have any sensual desire no do I have any ill will any

117
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:43,760
resentments left over no do I have any resistance do I

118
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:51,720
have any uh uh ways in which I'm caught in my fear Frozen in my fear

119
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,800
no do I have any agitation or regrets

120
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:04,040
no do I have any doubt no anybody who anybody who has these

121
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:10,000
things would probably be afraid when they go into the forest then he makes interesting

122
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:19,399
statement um do I have any the word is uh in English um alarm or

123
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:24,680
Terror uh maybe you know he's not he's not an alarmist so you know some people

124
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:31,279
get alarmed by all kinds of things and um but he said no I don't I'm

125
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:36,880
not an alarmist and I don't get terrorized by things so what he means by that I don't

126
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:42,480
know it's kind of interesting so what he's doing is checking himself out and

127
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:51,160
maybe if he had those things he realized these have I have to work through these first so he'd go to a

128
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:57,560
therapist you know if he was in modern America who can be very helpful for some

129
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:02,720
of these things when they're really really difficult but you know work through it

130
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:10,199
or come and start basic meditation practice because that's a lot of what we're working through at some point he was ready to go

131
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:15,480
into the forest and in fact he was afraid it just

132
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,240
kind of a delightful little I think description of his

133
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:30,680
fear on on especially auspicious nights

134
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:38,360
I dwelt in awe inspiring horrifying abodes as Orchard shrines Woodland

135
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:43,720
shrines and tree shrines and while and while I dwelt

136
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:51,759
there a wild animal would come upon me or a peacock would knock off a

137
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:58,440
branch or a wind would rustle the leaves I remember sometimes backpacking

138
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:07,519
in this was here as by myself no one no one around for Miles dark in my little tent and there

139
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,160
were monsters walking crunching the leaves around what are

140
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:19,800
these monsters doing around here crunch crunch CL snap and um you know if I was

141
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:25,480
awake and it was daytime I I you know I would rustling of the leaves would not

142
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:30,639
do anything for me but when in the dark in the s there were times where I

143
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,000
couldn't sleep so uh but what he does list the

144
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,279
footnote in the talk so what he does how he deals with his fear in practicing alone in the dark in these frightening

145
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:49,240
places was whatever posture he was in he stayed in that posture and was mindful

146
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:56,040
present for that and somehow staying present for it not giving into it not running away not

147
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,079
collapsing around it staying with it and in a dignified way somehow he worked

148
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:08,079
through it he doesn't go into the details here but it's kind of that he was prepared he was ready at this point

149
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:13,759
in his life to sit or be really present for fear when it

150
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,959
arose but you saw he was prepared right so are we prepared for

151
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:24,199
it so uh so the that the that this was

152
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:29,519
important is not a coincidence that they checked himself out you saw what was uh

153
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:35,800
what he had worked through and what he didn't have is not a coincidence for what Buddhism is about the part of

154
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:42,279
Buddhism that you're not supposed to change the part of Buddhism if you want into Buddhism you have to kind of accept

155
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:52,680
as being very important and now we come to the topic of of Faith Sada again that

156
00:16:52,680 --> 00:17:00,399
um the the uh uh emotional qualities the Buddha

157
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:07,079
Associates with faith you get a sense of what it's about is

158
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:12,720
calmness Clarity and

159
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,558
um and confidence confidence Clarity and

160
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:25,959
confidence so those are kind of the associated terms it's it's not it's not to be

161
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:31,360
Zealot it's to be peaceful some it helps you be profoundly

162
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:38,320
peaceful so what is it that that does that and so to to to reach this level

163
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:44,240
and there's different levels of Faith but this level of Faith that's really

164
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:51,000
confident and now there's going to be a Fidelity to it there's a loyalty there's a commitment to something which is more

165
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:58,559
than a belief something in a sense that maybe even in a sense more than the usual me

166
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,679
that you identify with not transpersonal exactly but not

167
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:09,840
necessarily personal either something that maybe is in you but which is not who you think

168
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,840
you are what what could that be to have faith in that to have confidence in

169
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,760
that so um and this is the core confidence that uh you know the core

170
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:31,158
kind of confidence that the Buddha really is pointing that it's possible for us to experience and grow in this

171
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,440
practice so this is going to be a little bit

172
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:44,840
boring so you know you're forewarned but it's also going to be

173
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:49,919
phenomenally important and I hope by the time I

174
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:55,200
finish this talk this is going to inspire you to no end so be patient with

175
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,039
the boredom but listen to this listen to it as if it's a guided

176
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:07,600
meditation where the key words are pointing something deep inside of you a

177
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:14,000
possibility something that if you really could do this in a thorough way would be

178
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,919
transformative you don't have to believe anything there's no Creeds to have faith

179
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:27,520
in and some of you are going to think this has nothing to do with religion and I came to Buddhism it's a

180
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:35,080
religion and this is like what you you fill in the

181
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:41,919
blank and some of this language you're not going to like some of you so you're forward you know this is

182
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,760
like you know caution this is the caution

183
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:57,240
statement there are these imperfections that defile the

184
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:04,640
mind some of you don't like the word defile and uh but I remember you get to

185
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,960
make up parts of your Buddhism and what you can make up to some within certain

186
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:15,240
range is how you how you translate these words into

187
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:22,880
English and I wouldn't translate it as defile that's what this book this this

188
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:29,440
um but anyway there are these imperfections that defile the

189
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,960
mind ctiv and unrighteousness unrighteous

190
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:42,919
greed is an imperfection that soils the Mind ill will soils the Mind anger soils

191
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:51,679
the Mind resentment contempt insolence Envy avarice deceit fraud obstinacy

192
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:58,400
rivalry conceit uh arrogance vanity and negligence are

193
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,840
imperfections that defile the mind what a glist did you get

194
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,559
bored no no it's exciting edge of your

195
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:15,080
seats okay so there's a it's 17 things that he says soil the

196
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:24,080
mind so now imagine a world where humans didn't have

197
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:30,480
this imagine really knowing and trusting someone you know who has none of

198
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:37,760
this imagine that would that be like imagine if this was actually the

199
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:43,200
common denominator of all religions of all political

200
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:51,600
parties of all isms was let's not have let's not be

201
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:58,760
Covetous let's not have greed let's work through our ill will and our anger let's

202
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:08,039
not have resentment and contempt let's find a way not to be insolent Envy envious acious deceitful

203
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:13,600
fraud full obstinate uh

204
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:20,159
rivalry conceit arrogance vanity negligence wow what if that was the

205
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:26,679
common denominator we all shared wouldn't it be a different world I propose that there would be a

206
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:33,760
revolutionary change in our societies if we all agreed yes

207
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:40,039
we're not going to argue what you believe we're not going to be opposed to what your political stance you have all

208
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:45,520
those things provided we all agree on this

209
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:51,159
WOW wouldn't that be good so these are the things that soil

210
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:56,559
the mind the Buddha said but then and this is the exciting

211
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:03,919
part of the boredom um

212
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:12,640
knowing that Covetous covetousness and greed is an imperfection that soils the

213
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:20,559
mind a person abandons it knowing ill will one abandons it

214
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:25,919
knowing each of these Seven Things One abandons it so that's pretty

215
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:31,679
good but then comes even the better part once once it's been

216
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:39,200
abandoned then you have a mind you have a heart in which those things are not

217
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,880
present when a practitioner has known that

218
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:53,159
covetousness and greed has been abandoned when the practitioner knows

219
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:59,039
ill will has been abandoned anger knows the absence of these things

220
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:05,480
knows the absence of resentment and envy and hostility and rivalry and really

221
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:14,360
knows that absence but knowing is not an abstract cognitive idea that's gone what's the

222
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:20,120
heart experience what's the embodied experience what's the Mind experience of

223
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:26,600
not having that agitation the contraction the pressure of these kinds

224
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:32,600
of forces when they're operating in us what's that absent

225
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:41,520
like wow that is peaceful that's settled that's a relief

226
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:47,360
wow I've known people who've had resentments for years and years I've

227
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:54,799
known people who've Decades of their policy of how to live is to be angry They Carried with them the whole

228
00:24:54,799 --> 00:25:00,760
time I've known people who for decades have had desire greed be the driving

229
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:06,840
force of their life what a relief to finally have these kinds of powerful

230
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:13,679
forces not operating to know this possibility for

231
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:19,080
oneself to have experienced that kind of Peace

232
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:26,080
this is what provides an unshakable think this trans this translator calls

233
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:34,240
it this translator was con unwavering confidence some people did unshakable

234
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:40,120
confidence in that possibility the literal meaning in ply

235
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:48,559
again because remember you you get to have some there's some Choice here you how you translate it uh the uh the

236
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:54,120
English um the py uh literally means um

237
00:25:54,120 --> 00:26:02,240
confidence based on knowing so it's uh you you know something now

238
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:08,399
for yourself it's not based on trusting this book or trusting me but it's

239
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:14,640
trusting what you've all what you've really experienced is for yourself if you have

240
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:22,399
that then the Buddha says you can have real confidence in the

241
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:28,480
Buddha in the Dharma in the s in Buddhism

242
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,520
because what is Buddhism what is the essence and what the purpose of

243
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:39,600
Buddhism at the foundation it's not about a

244
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:45,320
belief but rather about doing this becoming free of these things that

245
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:51,480
soil the mind and whereas like before I said it' be great if this could be the common

246
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:57,399
denominator of all religions all isms not only is the common denominator

247
00:26:57,399 --> 00:27:03,640
of Buddhism Buddhist teachings it's the purpose of Buddhist

248
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:11,720
teachings this is what's ultimate in Buddhism it's not a glorious

249
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:19,120
ultimate it's not like you know you you go to a block party and your neighbors say what is your this

250
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:26,080
Buddhism you're doing what is the purpose of it and you pull out your list of 17 things oh the

251
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:32,559
purpose is to be free of covetous greed anger envy and by the time you finish

252
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:38,480
the 17 you know they've already gone off to someplace else or they're feeling sorry

253
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,760
for you because their their ultimate is Cosmic Consciousness their ultimate is

254
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:50,720
you know some Grand glorious sexy kind of kind of thing you know and um and you

255
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:57,760
know or even just something beautiful like their ultimate is love like they listen to all we hear all this like well

256
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:03,440
well okay I I guess it's okay for you but what about love what about

257
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:10,398
compassion what about beauty what about you know great spiritual

258
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:20,840
States these are great spiritual States these are beautiful States these are the

259
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:26,200
uh the doors that open so that we can have love and compassion and care for

260
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:32,679
each other these are profound things so we might not be we might not

261
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:38,399
make impression on our neighbors but that's actually a good

262
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:43,799
thing because I think we don't want to hold Buddhism up as being too

263
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:51,519
special because that's one of the ways of soiling the mind it's really special but let's not

264
00:28:51,519 --> 00:29:00,960
be too caught up in it because this is this is what it's about so so to have faith in this

265
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:06,880
possibility possibility of this kind of Freedom this kind of absence of these

266
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:12,760
these difficult states of Mind these painful states of mind and then to live in the world based

267
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:19,840
on them is this something we have faith in is it something we have confidence in is

268
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:26,159
something that we TR is it something you want to trust is this something that you want to have Fidelity

269
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:32,799
to it you want to have loyalty to this is this something that has so such great

270
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:39,360
value that you're going to be committed to it and not get not give it up too

271
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:44,559
lightly too easily you're not going to come along and and finally decide well

272
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:50,960
yes this non- anger thing is good but now I'm now I'm it's I'm Justified to be

273
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:57,960
angry greed is good you know non- greed is pretty good but yeah but this thing is so good it's okay okay for me to have

274
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:03,960
Greed for this you know or

275
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:12,159
uh Fidelity commitment to something that we know

276
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:18,159
we've known we've discovered for ourselves a feeling of being clean

277
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,880
inside a feeling of being uh uh cleansed

278
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:29,039
of these this these dirty these things that soil us that pressure us that hurt

279
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:35,279
us that you feel the beauty of it and the relief of it the goodness of it the

280
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:44,600
wonderfulness of it to feel the value of this this I'm not going to give this up

281
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:52,240
easily there are forces inside of me that want to give those up they're still the forces of anger and greed and envy

282
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,440
and all these things can be there but I've experienced the absence of it and

283
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:07,360
I'm committed to it I'm not going to give in easily to these other things not going to give myself give myself up for

284
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:12,880
them I'm not going to lose myself in these things and how am I going to how am I

285
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:19,440
going to do that not give myself up not lose myself to them I'm going to

286
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:25,960
practice I I have faith in this prati I Fai of practicing I I might not be a good

287
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:32,159
practitioner but at least I have a practice at least that's what I'm faithful to is to practice and try to

288
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:38,440
stay close to this this is what's important and how do we make it so

289
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:44,519
important that it becomes the most important thing in your life this this thing

290
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:50,960
here more important than your family for

291
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:58,120
example one way is to appreciate that with this as a foundation this kind of

292
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:03,320
Freedom your love and care for your family would be so much greater all

293
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:08,760
these things get in the way so you can safely tell your family I

294
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:14,039
have something that's more important than you because hopefully you tell it tell

295
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:19,799
it to them the right way um you they they've

296
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:25,200
understood because of it you actually have so much more

297
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,440
love available you could ever could have had if these states had stayed in

298
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,639
you isn't that nice what a nice trade-off no no I want you to be angry

299
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:42,880
and greedy because I want to be the most important person for

300
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:51,320
you no no so in Buddhism faith is important or

301
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:59,000
confidence or trust Fidelity is important commitment is important but you're asked to make to

302
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,799
know what that is for yourself it's some possibility and potential that you

303
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:13,960
have and um and I hope that you're inspired by that potential that you have

304
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:19,760
I hope that it gives you something that you really a basis upon which to

305
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:26,240
live a a a a foundation a common denominator of how we want to live in

306
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:33,960
this world and if we do it I propose that it's a revolutionary act to do it if we want a

307
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:42,120
world where we can that's going to be peaceful nowadays when there's so much war and horror horrific war going

308
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:49,000
on if we want peace to begin with us if peace is going

309
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,639
to start with you if you don't don't are only only

310
00:33:55,639 --> 00:34:04,039
expecting other people to create World Peace but if it's going to start with you this kind of teaching is pointing

311
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:09,480
the way may each of

312
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:15,200
us be Fe be free of covetousness

313
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,480
greed ill will anger

314
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:27,560
resentment contempt insolence Envy aition

315
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:33,520
ious deceit fraud obsy

316
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:40,960
rivalry conceit arrogance vanity and here it says

317
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:46,760
negligence I like to translate that word as

318
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:55,358
carelessness so you get to make up part of Buddhism for yourself but if it's

319
00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:01,240
Buddhist there's part you can't make up and that's your heart's

320
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:11,078
Freedom may you be free so thank you very much
