1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:08,160
all right let's get started then uh hello my name is May

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:15,080
Elliot and this week we're focusing on the theme of insight one of the conditions for

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:22,119
insight is samadi it's the Pali uh also known as concentration so today during the

4
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:27,519
meditation we'll do a somata practice uh a practice that helps calm and steady

5
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:33,480
the mind uh and uh the intention of doing it is that it supports the cultivation of

6
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:41,280
somebody it supports the mind to collect and gather uh so this will be a practice that's probably familiar to a lot of you

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:48,440
um because we'll just pay attention to the breath just a really simple breath meditation um uh and today we'll do this

8
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:54,399
by employing two of the jic factors vaka and varara sometimes these are

9
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,559
translated as aim and sustain or place and rub

10
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:07,000
so vaka is referring to um to placing the attention connecting the attention

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,280
with the object so it's kind of that moment of making contact with the breath becoming mindful of the felt sense of

12
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,720
breathing so that's vaka and then vichara is sustaining that contact you

13
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:23,240
know maintaining the contact almost like rubbing the breath with our

14
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:29,520
attention um so um so when we do this with a breath it's like we're attending

15
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,520
to the moment of breath starts and then really being with it for the full inhale and full

16
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:42,840
exhale I remember one uh one Retreat where I was really struggling to stay with the breath it was like I would like

17
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,719
touch the attention on the breath and then just like immediately slide off into thought um and uh during that

18
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:57,000
Retreat I heard this teaching on vaka and vichara and what it illuminated for me was that um I was just making contact

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,159
with the breath I was just practicing vaka um but I wasn't making any effort to sustain that contact to maintain the

20
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:10,560
contact with the breath so it was almost like um almost like stepping on a banana peel you know just like sliding right

21
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:17,760
off the breath as soon as I touched it so um hopefully as we do this practice this morning it will invite the mind

22
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:25,720
just to to um bring some continuity to your experience of breathing to help you uh help you stay

23
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:31,080
in contact uh one of the commentarial teachings talks about taka and vichara

24
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,080
as being a little bit like a bird in Flight you know a bird needs to exert a bit of effort to flap its wings before

25
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,800
it coasts in the air um so that flap uh is like making contact that's like the

26
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,879
vchart we make a little effort to be here to make contact with the breath um

27
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:54,720
and then we Coast right and then the the birds coasting in the air that's the vichara we Coast on the breath uh so

28
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,840
today we'll do some uh some flapping and coasting as we stay with the breath

29
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,200
making that initial effort uh and then gliding for the length of the inhale and

30
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,280
exhale um so that'll be our primary practice for the meditation um but

31
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,440
before we go there uh we'll start by cultivating a little contentment and

32
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:23,920
this is because contentment is a condition for sombody contentment can help the Mind naturally

33
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:30,000
settle so uh go ahead and find your meditation posture

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,840
a posture that helps you um feel both um upright um there's some energy in the

35
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,239
body also allows you to be relaxed without falling

36
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,560
asleep softening the

37
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:02,640
body relaxing the face and the

38
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,239
shoulders releasing the

39
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:23,880
belly and begin by connecting with the uh the attitude now can can you touch in to

40
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:30,240
even a slight bit of contentment as we get started

41
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:39,759
maybe connecting with a sense of this moment is enough as it

42
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:47,680
is no matter how pleasant or unpleasant this moment is can it be enough can it

43
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,160
be okay

44
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:09,160
even if there's a challenging mood present or emotion any discomfort in the mind or

45
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,280
body and there be an okayness with

46
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:24,720
it and even if there's a sense of discontent can you be

47
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,039
content with discontentment

48
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:39,400
so this contentment can be uh so subtle just a little okayness with

49
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,080
things as they are

50
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,400
when the mind is content uh it's less likely to chase the future uh it's less likely to try to

51
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:14,240
change the past so when the mind's content it can naturally

52
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:23,199
settle so touching into any sense that life is

53
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:32,880
okay and allowing whatever you can touch into here allowing it to settle and

54
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:40,360
soothe the system to soothe the mind and body

55
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:20,599
and from this place of contentment no matter how slight we'll connect with our anchor

56
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:25,879
with our home base whether that's the breath or the

57
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:31,960
body whatever works for you today I'll be offering instruction on the breath um

58
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:39,039
but if you use a different anchor a different home base you can translate the instruction for

59
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,960
yourself so Landing now sensing the breath sensing your home

60
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,960
base

61
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:24,479
and you might Begin by noticing the moment each breath

62
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:33,279
starts almost like catching the moment the Sun Co comes over the horizon at

63
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,479
dawn seeing if you can notice that moment that first moment the breath

64
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,479
begins

65
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:27,000
when you notice this moment this moment the breath begins you're making contact

66
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,959
with the breath this is

67
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,600
vaka aiming connecting the

68
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:04,279
attention and at any point if you lose track if you become lost in thought this

69
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:10,480
is fine just Begin Again connecting with that moment of

70
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,240
breath arising a beginning of the inhale

71
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:03,600
now we'll add the step of each Chara of sustaining

72
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:12,519
contact so connecting with that first arising of the inhale and then coasting

73
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:15,680
for the length of the

74
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:25,760
breath sensing feeling the sensations of breathing with that full inhale and

75
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,760
exhale

76
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:49,880
like a bird flapping its wings and

77
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:56,760
coasting making that little bit of effort to connect at the beginning of

78
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,240
each inhale and then Co

79
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,680
in flap and

80
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
Coast

81
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
e

82
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
e

83
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

84
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

85
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040

e

88
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,920
e e

89
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:14,038
connecting with the breath and sustaining

90
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:21,640
contact clap and glide

91
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:37,480
very little effort to sustain contact just receiving

92
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:44,400
Sensations for a bird to Glide they just need to

93
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:51,120
allow the air to keep them Aloft just keeping their WIS their wings

94
00:17:51,120 --> 00:18:00,400
out just keep your wings out keep your lungs receiving air

95
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:08,120
receiving [Music] sensation and connecting again at the

96
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,039
beginning of the inhale

97
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,440
if you find that you're frequently getting lost during the breath

98
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,720
cycle you might try adding another moment of

99
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:05,039
contact another moment of the taka in addition to noticing the moment

100
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:13,039
an inhale begins you might see if you can notice the moment the exhale

101
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:21,200
begins so connecting at the beginning of the breath coasting for the

102
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:27,760
inhale and connecting at the beginning of the exhale and coasting for the

103
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,720
exhale

104
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,480
adding this extra contact Point uh increases the

105
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:48,880
engagement sometimes just enough to be here just enough to support greater

106
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
continuity

107
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640

breath knowing you're breathing as you

121
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:05,080
breathe left and Coast gliding on the

122
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:31,159
breath e

123
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,159
for

124
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:49,080
welcome back everyone for those just arriving my name is May

125
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:55,200
Elliot and today we will be talking about samadi or

126
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:01,559
concentration as a condition for sight uh and I'd like to start by

127
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:08,640
acknowledging that there are many misconceptions about Sam when I first started meditating I

128
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,840
thought that the way to get concentrated was to turn the Mind into a narrow laser

129
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:20,399
beam kind of straining and focusing and bearing down to try to bring the Mind

130
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:25,960
into a unified Point um and many people have these sorts of

131
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:33,399
associations um uh even if it's on a much more subtle level concentration uh doesn't usually elicit

132
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:41,919
a sense of uh easy relaxed colle collecting um uh but turning the Mind

133
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:49,159
into a laser beam this is not exactly what the Buddha had in mind when he talked about samadi so even though

134
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:55,960
concentration uh is the most common translation uh for the word samati it really doesn't do justice to the full

135
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:02,120
meaning and Nuance of the word uh fortunately for us the Buddha offered

136
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:07,399
a variety of descriptors for somebody um that can help us kind of have like a

137
00:30:07,399 --> 00:30:12,919
more robust picture of what he was uh he was speaking about so here's a quote

138
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:20,720
from the Maj manikay he said my concentrated mind was thus

139
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:26,600
purified bright unblemished rid of

140
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:32,760
imperfection Mal able wieldy and

141
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:41,640
steady so the Buddha is giving us a description of a concentrated mind um so

142
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:47,080
this is a mind that's steady that's stable uh we could say it's obedient uh

143
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:53,880
you know it's responsive if it you know if we tell it to sit it sits if we tell it to stay it

144
00:30:53,880 --> 00:31:01,120
stays uh so this is a mind that's um very responsive and it's stable so today I'll be

145
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:08,080
focusing specifically on the steadiness that somebody provides this stability

146
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:14,240
that it provides and um the relevance of talking

147
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:21,559
about samadi today um is that this is what a lot of you are cultivating in your meditation practice already right

148
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:29,120
you may not feel like you're getting concentrated but the practice you're doing is training the mind to stabilize

149
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:34,320
so today uh one of my intentions is to show you the link between what you're

150
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:41,799
already doing and how this unfolds into Insight how what you're already doing um

151
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:49,919
can uh bear the fruit of insight in your practice and what I imagine is that most

152
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:55,240
of you or many of you are already doing a breath-based practice a breath-based

153
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,679
meditation uh where your breath is your anchor your home basee um so during the

154
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:05,960
meditation maybe you um you would direct attention to the breath and when the

155
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:12,120
mind gets lost you just reconnect with the breath this is you know really standard instruction it's a common and

156
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:19,000
skillful practice um and it's also it's a su practice a practice that cultivates

157
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,159
samadi and I should mention here um that there are other ways to cultivate

158
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:31,559
somebody too besides focusing on the breath you know some use the body as a whole or is the soundscape um metaphases

159
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:38,279
can be used to cultivate Som so these are there's many ways I'm just focusing on the breath because this is one very

160
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:44,840
common way um so I wanted to talk about samade um

161
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:50,360
because this is something uh you're already cultivating um and also to

162
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:58,279
clarify some of these misconceptions that ALS that that frequently go along with concentration practice um and one

163
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:04,960
of those misconceptions is that many people think that samade is the goal of practice that

164
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:10,559
you know kind of like I'm sitting meditation and I will have had a successful meditation if I get

165
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:15,600
concentrated if I don't get concentrated it's not successful and that's the goal

166
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:22,039
um so and a lot of people associate that with the thinking mind you know if I can get rid of thoughts uh then you know I

167
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:28,039
have achieved the goal of meditation um but that's actually not how it goes thinking is actually an important fun F

168
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:34,159
of the mind I couldn't be offering you these teachings without thinking we wouldn't have the for truths if we

169
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:39,279
couldn't articulate them so um the purpose is not to get rid of thoughts um

170
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:47,080
but to have a wise relationship with them and sometimes that means being able to put them down for a little

171
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:52,480
while so uh so yeah what I want to clarify here is that uh concentration is

172
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,840
not an end in and of itself we're not cultivating uh concentration just to get

173
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:04,039
concentrated but rather we're developing concentration so that we can see clearly

174
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:09,878
so that we can see the three characteristics uh and when we see the three

175
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:16,320
characteristics um uh impermanence unsatisfactoriness and not self when we

176
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:23,960
see these Insight is born and insight is how wisdom develops in other way words

177
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:31,158
um uh wisdom it's wisdom that liberates us it's wisdom that frees us from suff

178
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:36,440
suffering and it's wisdom that does the waking up uh so we're not just getting

179
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:43,040
concentrated to have a pleasant meditation State though that's very nice and nourishing um we're not getting

180
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:49,520
concentrated to get rid of thinking um but rather the far-reaching potential of the practice is that we can become

181
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:55,599
completely free of suffering from uh we can become free of discontent

182
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:01,400
um so um so this uprooting of greed hatred and delution is really powerful

183
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:08,520
like think of what a different world this would be um if everyone purified their heart and mind in this way that

184
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:15,400
would be a really beautiful thing um if everyone took the time to free themselves of greed and hatred this is a

185
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:22,880
powerful practice to transform our own heart and mind and a practice that benefits those around us so this this is

186
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:29,720
where our journey is taking us uh so knowing that samadi is supportive to our development on the

187
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:35,440
path um how does that work you know how does somebody function to support

188
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:41,440
Insight why is it a supportive condition for insight um so I'll use the analogy

189
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:47,040
of a snow globe to explain how this works so let's say we have a snow globe

190
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:52,880
um if we shake it uh there's going to be a little blizzard in there and you can't see anything but falling

191
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:58,319
snow but if you if you let that snow globe stabilize

192
00:35:58,319 --> 00:36:03,359
uh the snow begins to settle and over time uh the liquid in the snow globe it

193
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:09,200
becomes uh crystal clear so when we're lost in our mental

194
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,760
movies um it's a little bit like we're always shaking the snow globe and I'm

195
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:20,560
sure you know what I mean when I mention mental movies right um you know this is when we're lost in our inner dramas you

196
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:28,079
maybe we're playing an Adventure film or a romance or a suspense thriller you know the the inner um

197
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:34,920
uh the inner movies that we play these inner dramas that are so compelling for us that we get so lost in uh so when

198
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:41,440
we're lost in these narratives in these stories of the thinking mind it's a little bit like we're always lost in a

199
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:47,280
blizzard um and what's pretty pretty amazing is that the vast majority of

200
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:53,839
humans spend an entire lifetime never allowing the blizzard to

201
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:59,040
settle you know they've never stopped shaking the snow

202
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:05,960
globe and when that blizzard is flurrying we can't see clearly um so

203
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:12,119
when we do this practice of settling the mind of being with the breath um it's

204
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:18,520
like we put our little snow globe on a cushion or a chair and we let it stabilize it actually it has the

205
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:26,000
opportunity to settle and every time we come back to the present in our meditation it's a little bit like one

206
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,520
snowflake uh one snow snowflake settles in the snow globe and eventually after

207
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:37,480
we return to the present enough times one by one all of the snowflakes land

208
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:43,880
the Mind settles um and it's it's a little bit like all of those snowflakes in the snow

209
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:50,839
globe finally rest on the bottom the blizzard has settled and we can see

210
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:57,079
clearly I learned a term recently for um for that particular type of silence in a

211
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:03,960
landscape ese after a snowstorm the term is it's snow

212
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:10,400
quiet and you might sense that feeling um of what it's like to step outside

213
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:19,400
after a snowstorm you know stepping out into a maybe a freshly fallen field of

214
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:25,680
snow there's a certain magnitude of Silence kind of like the whole world is

215
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,800
hushed I like to think it is a a soft PA

216
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:38,640
of snow so this this Stillness this quiet

217
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:44,359
settled quality of um this sort of snow

218
00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:49,480
blanketed landscape Um this can be a flavor of

219
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:56,160
somat so by practicing mindfulness of breathing mindfulness of body letting go

220
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:03,480
of your mental movies you cultivate enough stability for the blizzard to settle you cultivate enough Sade for the

221
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:10,440
blizzard uh to rest and when all the snowflakes settle

222
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:15,720
uh what's hiding within the snow globe is revealed uh so some snow globes they

223
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:21,880
might have uh a quaint Village on the inside or maybe there's like a che a

224
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:28,280
Cheesy Christmas tree or something um but your snow globe is AAC ulous snow

225
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:35,440
globe because as your blizzard settles three wise sages are

226
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:41,839
revealed one is the sage of impermanence one is the sage of

227
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:47,560
unsatisfactoriness or suffering and one is not

228
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:54,599
self if the blizzard continued you would never see them but because of your

229
00:39:54,599 --> 00:40:01,280
stability because of your s you could see them clearly enough you know you could see clearly enough that the three

230
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,920
characteristics could come into

231
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:13,720
view the Buddha said when my concentration is limited then my vision

232
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:20,119
is limited in other words when I'm caught in a blizzard when I shake the snow snow

233
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:28,960
globe I can't see clearly when I'm lost in thought all the time I can't see clearly my vision is limited

234
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:34,839
and then the Buddha went on to say the purpose and benefit of concentration is

235
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:39,880
to see things as they really are he's saying this is he's saying this is what

236
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:46,599
concentration is all about it's to see things the way they really are and what's the way things really are things

237
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:52,160
are impermanent unable to provide lasting satisfaction and without a fixed

238
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:58,760
abiding self or as one teacher phrased the three marks the three characteristics nothing is permanent

239
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:08,119
nothing is perfect and nothing is personal so this is what we're seeing

240
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:15,480
clearly and um so now that you know the purpose and benefit of concentration um

241
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:22,960
it could be really tempting to strain and strive to make it happen but as you already know that doesn't work wholesome

242
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:30,000
somebody does not come about through straining and striving um so rather than thinking of Sade as something that you

243
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,560
huff and puff to get um or make happen um instead you might think of it as a

244
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:41,880
visitor that arrives on its own time uh when we've put the appropriate conditions in

245
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:47,760
place um and there are many conditions for concentration as I already mentioned

246
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:54,200
um but one of these one condition for concentration is contentment uh so this is why we started

247
00:41:54,200 --> 00:42:00,680
our meditation practice let's see if we could connect with with a little contentment

248
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:07,200
um and as as I share about this remember um that we're cultivating the Dharma to

249
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:14,440
grow in our heart and when we do that we can't we can't demand that it grows faster right we can't force we can't

250
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:20,160
force growth um and so in the same way that we can't force Insight we can't

251
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:25,319
force somebody either but we can provide these supportive conditions so so

252
00:42:25,319 --> 00:42:30,440
contentment um it's how translating the word Suka Suka is often translated as

253
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:36,119
happiness um um and I I mention contentment as a

254
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:41,240
condition for somebody because so often um we sit down to meditate and we think

255
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:47,000
we need to get concentrated in order to be happy in order to be content but

256
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:53,640
here's what's radical it's also the other way around it's contentment that

257
00:42:53,640 --> 00:43:00,280
conditions concentration so contentment is a condition for concentration and this makes so much

258
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:05,640
sense because the mind that's Happy the mind that's content it's not worried

259
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:10,920
about the future it's not spiraling and planning mind because it's so anxious uh

260
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:16,000
it's not ruminating about the past and regretting and uh filled with shame and

261
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,240
guilt you know it's not seeking sense Pleasures a mind that's content it can

262
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:27,000
naturally collect it can naturally settle you know it doesn't it doesn't have any reason to be flying around like

263
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,000
a a pinball it's content so uh what's the relevance for

264
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,640
you um what's the relevance of um knowing that contentment is a condition

265
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:45,319
for concentration so let's say um you're interested in cultivating

266
00:43:45,319 --> 00:43:51,359
somebody what would it be like to sit down to meditate and instead of trying

267
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:57,839
to get concentrated to start by cultivating contentment to see if you can connect

268
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:04,280
with a sense of contentment with whatever is happening for you even if there's a difficult mood or

269
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:10,760
emotion or a painful sensation in the body um can there be just like a thread

270
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:17,079
of contentment there a simple okayness with things as they are and like I said

271
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:24,240
in the meditation even if there's discontent can you be content with

272
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:30,160
discontentment so um so this is one condition for

273
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:35,920
samade um contentment and then our samade becomes a condition for

274
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:42,440
insight so tomorrow uh we'll begin our three-day exploration of the Three core

275
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:48,160
insights of the Buddha starting with anicha or impermanence so I will see you

276
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:53,559
tomorrow for an exploration of the changing nature of

277
00:44:53,559 --> 00:44:59,040
phenomena very glad to have you here take care
