16
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,880

17
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,680
silently with us for five minutes

18
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:21,990
[Music]

19
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:36,320
welcome hi Julie I'm Tanya

20
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:43,920
so this is week three in a five-week series on the hindrances

21
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:52,339
are you familiar with the hindrances Julie great and Susan I think you are too you're familiar with the hindrances

22
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:01,459
okay Sage you are yeah

23
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:09,660
yeah so the first week um The Twist of this class is

24
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:14,820
I'm talking about it kind of through at least partly the lens of The Wizard of

25
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:20,839
Oz so if you've seen the movie great if you haven't

26
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:27,060
maybe I'll give enough of information to be able to have a little taste of it

27
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:34,139
so the first week we just spent talking about what the five hindrances are and also I kind of laid the groundwork for

28
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:40,079
how the characters and the story fit into a Dharma context

29
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:45,720
last week we talked about um sensual desire or greed and aversion

30
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:51,180
and ill will and tonight we'll talk about restlessness and worry

31
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:56,519
so the next two hint you know weeks will be next week will be sloth and torpor

32
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:03,120
and the week after will be doubt that'll be the final and there are some things that Diana and

33
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:09,480
I who's not here tonight but we'll be back next week really want to kind of invoke invite

34
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:16,560
kind of bring to this exploration is some lightness some Joy

35
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,959
some humor to a topic that can be a little heavy

36
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:27,180
and that we can kind of have a oh no I'm having a hindrance you know response to

37
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:35,399
and they're really you know this is part of the human condition as far as we know it these were named by the Buddha

38
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:41,339
over 2500 years ago and really we see pretty much the same

39
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:47,399
you know issues today interfering with meditation nobody's come up with a new

40
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:54,199
list of hindrances you know it's these work well enough which is pretty remarkable

41
00:14:54,300 --> 00:15:01,860
the other thing that we are kind of inviting you to think about is that there actually can be thought of as

42
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:07,440
Energies so and the energies impact the physical

43
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,980
body and so in some ways you can start to tune into the body and if you

44
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:20,699
recognize one is a leaning toward a leaning in which you'll often find when

45
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:27,480
you have some sensual desire getting kicked in it doesn't have to be greed you know but if you want something you

46
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:34,620
tend to lean toward it you like what somebody's saying you know or there's just this natural movement

47
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:40,680
and in contrast the ill will the aversion is either a

48
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:46,560
pushing away of something or pulling back of oneself so there's really you

49
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,740
know if you just right now this posture That's a classic

50
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:58,740
example of ill will in somebody's body um

51
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:08,279
so energy that wants energy that doesn't want doesn't like right and then we have

52
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:13,980
um restlessness and worry which are essentially too much energy

53
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:20,699
too much energy restlessness in the body so there's an inability to be still oh

54
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:27,899
yeah you know when you sit down to meditate sometimes you just can't find a Still Point and the body is just

55
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:34,260
restless and agitated oh sometimes that's so uncomfortable right

56
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:39,860
and and then the energy in the mind is what is worry and worry is essentially

57
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:45,959
worrying we're worrying you know this the spinning energy the going around and

58
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:53,820
round there's a simile that talks about water ponds and for each hindrance there is a

59
00:16:53,820 --> 00:17:01,320
simile for the water for restlessness and worry it said it's like really intense wind going across

60
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:06,418
the surface of the water so there's impossible to see into the

61
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:11,938
pond the wind whips it all up there's no Stillness

62
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:18,660
so the absence of hindrance would be a clear Bond easily transparent you can

63
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:26,280
see everything going on in there it's said that greed is like adding

64
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:32,700
um like die to the water maybe a red colored dye so that the the water takes

65
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:38,220
on a kind of a it makes everything look different right the way that wanting

66
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:45,780
something sort of like the idea of rose-colored glasses right everything looks a little prettier somehow

67
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:52,500
and aversion or ill will is like water boiling bubbling you know boiling

68
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:58,020
broiling steam it's you can't look in it's hot it's dangerous you know there's

69
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:04,020
no Stillness so these are similes from the sutas from the Buddha that describe

70
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:11,400
also that kind of this energetic quality and the other kind of invitation we've

71
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:19,200
had is to see hindrances as something that is like a veil that you know if you pull the veil you

72
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,299
can't quite see through right so this is again this idea that it's covering

73
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:32,039
something it's hindering something so this is why in some ways actually

74
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:37,380
working with the hindrance is if you can recognize that it's there it's like

75
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:42,539
pulling the veil back it's like and and you know sort of

76
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:50,059
unhindering in a moment in a way it can be a direct path to clear seeing

77
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:56,640
so um last week we invited you guys to before

78
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:03,000
each meditation session to kind of reflect on the things that you came up with in your discussion group so there

79
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:10,559
was a discussion group which we'll have again tonight and they talked about like the things that helped them with working

80
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:15,799
with greed or Central desire and ill will and they they talked about

81
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:22,980
gratitude generosity Joy loving kindness doing going to see Arts sitting in the

82
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:29,640
park right so we invited you to just to reflect on those things and come on in

83
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:35,760
come sit with us come on in Jay um we invited people to you maybe didn't

84
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:42,720
even remember or didn't even process oh you did okay so um as a way to sort of help yourself

85
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:50,640
kind of Orient your mind in a useful kind of supportive Direction before meditating and what happened did you how

86
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,980
did it go Cassandra what did you notice do you mind sharing and we've got the

87
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:03,600
mic because we're if no before meditating this week to

88
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:09,059
reflect on these these things that you came up with last week did you did you reflect be every time you sat down to

89
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:15,600
meditate beforehand did you reflect in this way sort of great well it was raining like all week so I didn't really

90
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:21,480
so there was a lot of visualization going on that redirected me in my meditation

91
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:28,140
um in regards to all that okay and then I noted I did notice a lot of more hindrances the last week ah so

92
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:34,700
that's good I guess that is good that's great thank you Cassandra Gus do you want to say anything

93
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,720
I didn't quite do that and generally when I said uh when I start it's gonna

94
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,299
be kind of a surprise yeah I mean I just said as calm as I possibly can be and

95
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:54,900
start and we'll see right kind of like observing

96
00:20:54,900 --> 00:21:01,020
Arts we'll see yeah we'll see we'll see well I'll just say

97
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:08,280
um that it's a way to Incline the mind in a

98
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:15,000
particular you know Orient toward a particular state so

99
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:23,880
not that you're trying to it's like meta may I be happy may you be happy we're making a wish we're invoking inviting a

100
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:30,360
connection with a state or way of being so it can be a something to play with at

101
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:35,760
some point which is when you sit down to meditate to drop to kind of drop in

102
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:43,500
Reflections that have to do with either the um Brahma vaharas or the the

103
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:51,120
um ten paramis right the Perfections patience gratitude Joy all of those

104
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,760
things so it's just an invitation yeah did you

105
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:02,100
yeah yeah I wanted to add something so um I do choose to meditate

106
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:07,740
where I can see a picture of the Buddha oh yeah exactly always turn myself so

107
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:14,400
that I'm actually pointing towards the Buddha I can't sit Twisted it has to be pointing towards

108
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:22,080
the Buddha and that that seems to actually quite be quite helpful yeah and that is very much of the same idea yeah

109
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:29,179
you know that's one of the things you can do which is to reflect on the Buddha before you meditate it can really be

110
00:22:29,179 --> 00:22:35,240
profoundly uplifting for the heart in my experience yeah

111
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:40,799
all right so um does anybody you know have any questions

112
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:49,460
or want any clarification at this point before I move into Restless system worry more specifically

113
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:59,880
so I'm going to talk a little bit about The Wizard of Oz and how we might recognize the presence

114
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:05,700
of restlessness and worry in that context and I'm going to start by referencing

115
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:12,960
Dorothy while she was in Kansas so the way that the movie starts is it's

116
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,419
all around Dorothy and Toto her dog and um

117
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:23,940
there's this neighbor who's very angry because Toto goes and chases her cat the

118
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:29,100
neighbor's cat in the garden and so this neighbor um

119
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:35,880
gets is very angry and maybe mean and yeah I mean

120
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:42,000
um and so Dorothy's very preoccupied because she's afraid that this woman because she threatens to come take Toto

121
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:49,679
away in fact she does she comes and takes Toto away and so Dorothy goes back to the farm

122
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:55,440
um where her she lives with her Aunt Em and Uncle Henry and then the farm help

123
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:02,640
who all end up being characters in the movie and she's trying to get Aunt Em and

124
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,799
Uncle Henry to listen to her about her concerns that this neighbor is going to come take Toto away

125
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:14,039
but they are tending to some baby chicks and the the um and so they're

126
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:20,280
preoccupied with their worry about the baby chicks because the the warmer isn't

127
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:28,140
working and so they don't really stop to listen to Dorothy they dismiss her concerns

128
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:35,400
so their concerned and worried about the chicks and preoccupied Dorothy's worried about

129
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:42,000
Toto right and she feels like nobody's really listening to her and

130
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,059
um she doesn't you know it's like sort of this sense of I don't really belong here people aren't really listening to

131
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:54,960
me that grows in her and um and then the The Neighbor comes and

132
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:02,000
takes Toto away so she's going to take him I don't know just some

133
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:07,440
some place and so Dorothy gets very distraught Toto

134
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,539
escapes from the back of the basket of the bike of a neighbor and so Dorothy

135
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:19,080
actually runs away with Toto when Toto gets back so there's a lot of you know worry and

136
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:25,320
restlessness in all of this right and then when we get into The Wizard of

137
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:30,440
Oz into the Land of Oz the first

138
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:38,220
companion that Dorothy makes is the straw man and so the straw man if you it's really

139
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:44,820
interesting because you you wouldn't so much well you see him and he moved he's first

140
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:51,779
tied up so he can't move but he gets down and he's kind of like dancing and falling and all over the place like he

141
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:57,720
can't find a sense of stability in his body and

142
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:06,059
so there's a lot of physical restlessness and another interesting thing if you look at him is his emotional affect his

143
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:12,440
affect changes a lot he'll go from sort of like oh

144
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:20,580
like this you know there's just this too much energy like a huge swings of energy

145
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:26,520
so then they come you know strong man joins Dorothy they continue on the next

146
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:32,400
character that they meet is the Tin Man but after that they meet the lion

147
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,740
and the lion um you know he he pretends to be a bully

148
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:43,320
he jumps out from the forest we'll talk more about well actually we won't so he

149
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:49,860
he's he's um hiding he hears them come along and he

150
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:56,779
like does this massive like jump out like you know this big lion and he's like

151
00:26:56,779 --> 00:27:02,520
what are you doing here and he starts to bully the Tin Man and the straw man and

152
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:07,679
sort of try tries to start a fight and says come on hit me hit me you know and

153
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:13,260
he's doing all this stuff and but then you know they're like

154
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:18,360
cowering the Tin Man and the straw man and then Toto jumps out from behind a

155
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:25,200
tree Dorothy's kind of hiding the back of the tree with a dog the Toto jumps out and Barks and so then the line goes

156
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:31,380
after the Toto oh guess who confronts the lion Dorothy does right she's going

157
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:36,600
to come out and protect her little puppy so and she gets you know quite Fierce

158
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:41,640
and she kind of slaps a little and like hits his nose you know it's not exactly

159
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:47,100
a slap in the face but it's he should definitely hit his nose and

160
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:55,200
he crumbles the lion absolutely crumbles he starts to cry why would you do that

161
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:02,039
to me you know he's just and and then he grabs his tail and he's like right like

162
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:10,500
do you remember this like he's just becomes a melty sad mush and talks about he has no courage so he's hidden behind

163
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:16,980
bravado his fear his worry right so this is another way that we see you know

164
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:23,640
restlessness and worry and one thing I like about that is it's very often that people who are worried and uncomfortable

165
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:29,279
do present sort of overcompensate or try and you know project something other

166
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:35,039
than what they're really feeling or they swing because it's really none of it's

167
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:42,240
stable when we're overdoing anything so so that's some ways that we see

168
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:48,299
restlessness somewhere in the in The Wizard of Oz but anybody else have another example that they want to share

169
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:53,179
the thoughts about that

170
00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:03,539
great so I want to read you a little poem before I sort of talk from a dharmic

171
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:09,539
perspective about restlessness and worry from the thinking about these characters

172
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:16,740
right Dorothy is going to the Oz to get home she wants to find a way home

173
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:22,679
the straw man is going because he doesn't think he has a brain the Tin Man is going because he doesn't

174
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:29,399
think he has a heart and the lion is going because he doesn't have courage

175
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:35,100
so everyone is off to see the wizard to get something to be fixed because

176
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:40,260
they're not whole right okay

177
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:47,039
so for me this little moderate size poem talks about this

178
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:53,640
it's called the Grand predicament by Nick askew a fear of not belonging drives much of

179
00:29:53,640 --> 00:30:00,000
what we do and how we are unknowingly it can Define the experience

180
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:07,200
of a life most of us live with an underlying sense that we are not yet enough

181
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,659
and assume that until we are we cannot truly belong

182
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:17,760
we assume that we must become a better version of ourselves

183
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:23,940
but we're never quite enough in this resent Relentless pursuit of belonging

184
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:30,720
we are lost to a never-ending self-improvement might we have been looking out there

185
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:37,020
when all along it had been within might we already be the version we'd

186
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:43,260
been seeking beyond the endless game of fixing what is seemingly broken

187
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:48,840
there exists a profound experience of knowing that there is no one to fix it

188
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:54,360
that we are enough as we are and that we belong without condition

189
00:30:54,360 --> 00:31:00,960
yet we cannot seek and hope to find this it is nature it's as its nature is

190
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:07,380
defined us and to consume us I love us with no doubt

191
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:13,140
right it consumes Us by the lack or the absence of doubt

192
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:18,840
no one can teach us this we cannot learn this in a moment of surrender in a moment of

193
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:24,059
not seeking The Experience can be renowned nothing changes but everything

194
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:32,039
is somehow different and then everything begins its transformation Liberation peace and all that follows is the work

195
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:38,640
of interview so the way we see ourselves right

196
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:45,840
as lacking or enough so and I think that lacking drives a lot

197
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,158
of restlessness and worry

198
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,279
so in the Dharma and the teachings from the Buddha I already talked about the

199
00:31:56,279 --> 00:32:01,679
simile of the pond is one way he talks about and

200
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:07,440
so it's helpful to think about what are the conditions that contribute to restlessness and worry

201
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:14,100
and what are the things that lead to the stilling of it so you know one thing that can be

202
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:19,679
helpful also is to go back to the sense of the obvious and subtle manifestations

203
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:25,440
so the obvious right or the sense of agitation the restlessness the scatteredness

204
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:31,559
you know hard to settle Focus losing distracting dropping our keys you know

205
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:39,899
and a more subtle is the Mind slipping into thought you know which is kind of drifting off right and getting lost in

206
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:45,860
thought conditions for restlessness are really

207
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:52,020
unwise attention to the thinking not recognizing drifting off right not

208
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:57,240
staying mindful of the thoughts kind of letting them lead us instead of

209
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:02,840
are being aware as we're thinking

210
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:08,880
sometimes we actually a lot of times I think this you know there's a belief

211
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,980
that thinking itself will lead to wisdom if I just think about this of enough if

212
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:20,519
I just figure it out but this is not the kind of the wisdom the Buddha was teaching us about this is

213
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:25,980
not what he was encouraging this analytical sort of philosophical or you

214
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:31,320
know um kind of uh conceptual thinking is not

215
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:36,480
the wisdom the Buddha is pointing us toward the wisdom that Buddha is pointing us to

216
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:44,700
is about seeing causes the conditions or the conditioned nature and how ill will

217
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:51,000
energy leads to causing harm to soften others right and what way we are with

218
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,539
our experience will lead to more experience

219
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:03,179
another thing is like a lot of provocative talk you know a lot of excessive discussion

220
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:08,520
and rumination with others can be dwelling on past unskillful

221
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:16,138
actions actually so just thinking over and over and over again about what what we did and what we didn't do and how

222
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:21,240
embarrassing it was or you know that is going to stir up the Waters of the Mind

223
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,980
Right like that pond

224
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:34,020
so when we work with restlessness it's actually one of those qualities

225
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:39,720
where on a wide birth

226
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:46,020
if you think about when you feel Restless if you think about trying to tighten in and make yourself sit still

227
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:53,158
my experience in my body is that energy gets more pronounced it's like you know

228
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:58,859
like it's like a pressure cooker so in the mind you know and with

229
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:03,900
yourself it's sort of like broadening opening up around it letting the ball

230
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:09,359
have a huge room to bounce in right does that make sense it's a real small it's

231
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:16,940
got quick things to bounce against bigger space it's going to slow down right there's more more room

232
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:24,180
um you know and again this idea of non-identification right it's it's an

233
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:31,440
experience it's an energy it's not who I am it doesn't Define me it's an experience that comes and goes so it's

234
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,660
really helpful to watch yourself and how you're relating to it

235
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:41,280
um and

236
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:48,660
let's see um another significant thing is striving

237
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:55,140
when we're we're trying too hard we're trying too hard to have a certain

238
00:35:55,140 --> 00:36:00,599
experience or putting too much energy into our meditation practice right it

239
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:05,820
can build up or or we're not doing enough walking

240
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:10,859
meditation to balance out our sitting meditation if we're you know doing more

241
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:16,980
prolonged practice you know pent up feelings like desire

242
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:22,260
and aversion actually can lead to a feeling of restless and worry

243
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:28,440
so kind of paying attention you know in some ways I feel like so

244
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:34,500
much of our practices is about keeping ourselves in balance

245
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:41,820
you know it and there's a teacher ajan cha from and he used to kind of say to

246
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:46,980
you know students like okay they're all walking down the road and he goes to

247
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:52,920
this guy go left go left go left right and so then the person on the right starts oh I

248
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:59,280
better go no no no you go right you go right and you're right you're right it's like

249
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:04,680
we we need to be attending to our own self our own practice and what somebody

250
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:10,200
else needs to be doing at one moment is not necessarily what we need to be doing at my moment there's not always the same

251
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:16,200
answer so even if we've been told to be go left at one point actually maybe this time we

252
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:22,859
really need to go right so we have to attend to the energies in the body the

253
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:29,339
mind the heart are we you know getting enough exercise right for example did we have too much

254
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:35,700
caffeine right these can also contribute right as well as the kind of conversations in the way that we're

255
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,780
mindful or not

256
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:49,079
another thing that can trigger restlessness is pain and worry so it's important to kind of

257
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:54,119
know how to work wisely with physical discomfort in meditation and

258
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:59,579
um kind of you know if you're in pain and you start to get really restless it

259
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:06,720
can be really important to just kind of re um reset your posture get an extra pillow

260
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:12,240
do what you need to do you know or stand up you can stand up to meditate if that

261
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:18,900
is easier for you if that the energy is just too much so

262
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:25,640
how was that any questions too much not enough

263
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:37,680
so then here's a question normally right now what I would do is to

264
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:43,619
go into a guided meditation practice but I actually just had the thought maybe it'd be better to put you in two small

265
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:50,520
groups and let you talk a little bit first great I see heads nodding so if we could

266
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:57,060
you know it's usually kind of good to have three or four so maybe two groups um

267
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:03,540
so if you want to just turn your chairs and connect to introduce yourselves

268
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:10,200
maybe say if you've been to IMC before or been coming a long time or whatever you want to say

269
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:16,280
and then I'll give you more instructions in about a minute or two

270
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:20,400
okay you ready for the question all right so um

271
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:26,460
The Firm well I have two questions we'll start with one we'll see how it goes

272
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:32,460
um what I'd like you to do is give each person like a minute to a minute and a

273
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:38,040
half to answer the question so one person is speaking three three or

274
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:43,859
two people are listening while the person just gets to kind of talk about

275
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:48,900
the role that restlessness and worry have in their life

276
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:54,839
just how how does it show up for you how does it affect things for you and how

277
00:40:54,839 --> 00:41:00,540
does it operate for you right so that's the start so

278
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:06,300
um you guys should probably take more like a good full two minutes each because they have a group of four you

279
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:14,460
guys and I'll be tuning in so if you need extra time we'll just either not do the second question or we'll figure it

280
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:19,560
out okay so maybe the person is there anybody in

281
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:26,700
your group that wants to start first raise your hand if somebody knows they great do you guys have gr oh Sage you've

282
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:30,619
got to start they pointed at you so

283
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:40,200
are you okay starting okay so great so Julie will start and Sage will start and

284
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:46,820
then just go the next person to your left would follow you all right please begin

285
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:31,940
thank you just want to check in and see if you made it all the way around does it feel like a good point to shift

286
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:38,040
to the next question great so the second question is

287
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:43,200
you know and maybe just stop and pause I'll give you a minute to reflect on this one

288
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:49,920
what beliefs do you have that support your worry

289
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:55,140
what beliefs do you have that support your worry yeah

290
00:48:55,140 --> 00:49:00,359
okay so just breathe and let your mind offer whatever it wants to offer and

291
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:05,900
I'll ring the bell again in about 20 seconds and and you can begin

292
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:35,460
and just for the recording purpose I will repeat the question

293
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:40,560
what beliefs do you have that support your worry

294
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:47,819
what beliefs opinions views stories

295
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:51,619
are supporting your worry

296
00:58:07,099 --> 00:58:12,440
so I've one final little invitation

297
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:21,000
to as a group pick two or more things that you want to share

298
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:26,520
when we come back together from the Reflections in your group just as a group you can all pick one or you can

299
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:33,059
come up with two together whatever you want to do but just give some thought to what was useful about this what came up

300
00:58:33,059 --> 00:58:38,400
you know um and and then be hopefully somebody will

301
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:45,119
be willing to share for the rest of us so just take up a minute or two to to

302
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:51,558
brainstorm if there's anything you could do that to share

303
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,440
um

304
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,730
[Music]

305
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:58,520
oh right now

306
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:09,119
because I I used to think about things and then I one day I said

307
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:16,400
either get up and do something about it or go back to just couldn't get out again

308
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:23,179
[Music]

309
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:36,019
yeah it really is helpful because

310
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:43,380
yeah restlessness

311
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:57,420
right

312
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,640
organizations

313
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:50,339
that's about this yeah so you mentioned you if you look here

314
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:56,640
and sometimes but lately I haven't been checking in

315
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:59,058
with myself

316
01:02:02,359 --> 01:02:08,838
I think probably just caring and having them

317
01:02:12,059 --> 01:02:14,780
foreign

318
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:30,780
[Music] you feel ready okay

319
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:36,299
maybe think thank each other you can finish your sentence sage no no rush you

320
01:02:36,299 --> 01:02:42,859
just thank each other and just appreciate the energy the sharing

321
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:59,838
uh oh yeah yeah thank you

322
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:04,650
[Laughter]

323
01:03:07,310 --> 01:03:11,050
[Laughter]

324
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:19,440
that's right that's right so um we'll give these guys another minute

325
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:24,900
but uh I just have to say it's so delightful to hear you all connecting

326
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:31,920
and sharing and key you know you're really engaging with the Dharma right and you're discovering I can feel the

327
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:37,319
you know the sort of oh sometimes I would occasionally adhere like a thought

328
01:03:37,319 --> 01:03:44,640
or something about core beliefs or something that was you actually I think it just these great kind of insights

329
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:51,839
coming forward so there's people that will listen to this recording there's people that are watching on YouTube and

330
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:58,500
then there's each other the people that were in the other group and so I invite I invite a few shares about

331
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:03,960
sort of your takeaways what stood out for you and it doesn't have to be that

332
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:09,240
your group agreed for it with it it just was a way to get you to think and share so

333
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:13,099
if anybody's willing to pick up a mic

334
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:22,339
is it on Susan

335
01:04:26,339 --> 01:04:31,440
I feel very light thank you sweetheart so I think

336
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:36,920
what we came we talked about um

337
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:42,059
antidotes to worry nice do you want to share some of those

338
01:04:42,059 --> 01:04:49,140
antidotes can I share yours so if like I and Julie

339
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:55,500
talk about you know what and what should I should be an Entertainer

340
01:04:55,500 --> 01:05:01,920
and then I'll know how to use this um like not being able to sleep and what to

341
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:07,980
do when you wake up in the middle of the night and other than take CBD which is

342
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:13,319
one thing um putting paper and pencil next year

343
01:05:13,319 --> 01:05:18,900
bed so you can write it down and one of the things that I used to do when I worked um

344
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:25,380
if I would wake up in the middle of the night I would be thinking I'm worrying about this problem

345
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:30,720
and finally I got to the point where I decided that if I could do something

346
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:36,240
about it I would get up and do it and if not I would write it down and go back to

347
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:41,940
sleep nice beautiful and we all kind of talked a

348
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:48,599
little bit about that kind of thing beautiful Susan beautiful your group want to offer one

349
01:05:48,599 --> 01:05:53,880
Solutions you know but you got to use a mic

350
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:58,400
Sage you had something you wanted to share

351
01:06:05,099 --> 01:06:10,160
the one thing that really stuck out to me as part of our discussion is like we all talked about a kind of like

352
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:15,900
pervasive sense of uh worry and restlessness going throughout the life

353
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:22,260
um but I think all three of us also talked about moments of like Refuge

354
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:30,059
um and being able to like take stock of like what's actually going on and I think the takeaway for me there

355
01:06:30,059 --> 01:06:37,260
is like external conditions don't matter so much as the ability to like draw on like Buddha nature or like whatever you

356
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:44,400
want to call it right so that the the pausing in the middle of the storm can

357
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:49,440
help you find the eye of the storm the the calm in the middle of it is that

358
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:56,359
right yes great Jane do you want to add a slight uh

359
01:07:02,099 --> 01:07:09,180
foreign for the most part A lot of my

360
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:14,760
restlessness worries caught up with things that I think are practical

361
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:21,900
worries which on what level are true I have genuine you know really difficult situations going on

362
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:29,760
but I've had glimpses be it in Retreats or just Sunday sets or whatever where

363
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:35,280
I've Glimpse to the other side I've gotten to a place of equanimity no restlessness

364
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:40,619
and I've had raging problems I was still there yeah but have this calm like wait

365
01:07:40,619 --> 01:07:46,799
that doesn't make any sense I need to be worrying I am not right so I've had glimpses of

366
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:53,039
unhooking you know the condition from the state right usually I think oh yeah I should be worrying because I'm plenty

367
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:59,160
to worry about yes you know it feels Justified and right when it's going on

368
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:05,099
but you know I've seen you know not that many but many glimpses were

369
01:08:05,099 --> 01:08:12,799
regardless what's the outer state is you know I've been in a relatively uh peaceful State

370
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:18,560
thank you foreign

371
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:27,620
I was just saying that um

372
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:35,640
generally worrying seems to be kind of like a head thing right and for me I don't necessarily have a default

373
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:42,238
worrying state but stuff will have to start to happen in my body like I start to get a touch somewhere or it gets

374
01:08:42,239 --> 01:08:50,640
really tense over here and that becomes my indicator to start to

375
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:56,160
become aware of there's something somewhere beautiful that is getting your

376
01:08:56,160 --> 01:09:03,060
attention it hasn't gotten into your conscious brain yet but maybe you want to help it kind of arise

377
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:10,140
so that you can look at it right and um I connect that also to my practice when

378
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:16,500
I'm when I'm meditating I actually am because I put attention on the parts of

379
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:21,540
my body that are currently trying to tell me something and just try

380
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:27,480
to calm them down a little bit but generally it's

381
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:32,880
I think one can't forget the role of the body yeah in this

382
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:38,160
because generally the worrying part tends to have to be happening mostly up here yeah

383
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:43,580
yeah thank you so much yeah

384
01:09:45,299 --> 01:09:53,120
so just just give yourself a quiet minute and see if anything else pops up that wants to be named or shared

385
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:59,699
just uh there's something that can be reinforcing about insights or

386
01:09:59,699 --> 01:10:05,100
Reflections if you speak them so just uh you know there's something

387
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:14,480
there that's valuable to you that wants to be spoken even if you've already spoken feel free to pick up the mic

388
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:28,980
um I think one thing I'm reflecting on is uh kind of like uh

389
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:33,620
worry and restlessness around um

390
01:10:34,739 --> 01:10:42,600
like work and and not really or just a typical day I think is a theme

391
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:48,540
that we all talked about in our group of um contributing on a typical day

392
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:53,000
and not knowing if we're doing good enough

393
01:10:54,300 --> 01:11:00,960
yeah that's that's so important there's like um what do you believe about yourself or what you're supposed to be

394
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:08,460
doing that contributes to restlessness worry like I heard the word Perfection or being good enough

395
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:14,580
all right that it's not okay to make mistakes or you know that it's it's not

396
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:21,260
productive to be quiet and still and not do anything for periods of time you know these are all beliefs that can

397
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:26,940
impact the experience also what you're doing for work

398
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:32,760
you know sometimes what you have to be doing is is busy Restless worry work in

399
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:40,560
a way and so by doing that work you start to condition that energy in your body

400
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:46,640
does that make sense Stephen and is that speaking to what you're talking about

401
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:53,400
I also heard you say um you know it's okay for me to say this that you know we need to be productive

402
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:58,980
right did you say something about that also like it's good too I found the

403
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:05,159
whole conversation very uh I feel very harmonious after having the

404
01:12:05,159 --> 01:12:10,980
conversation because I feel like yes there is that urge are we are we

405
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:17,100
doing that but then um while I was sitting and talking with them I just was thinking about

406
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:23,580
um it's just human nature yeah and it didn't feel like that big of a deal oh I

407
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:29,159
love it so I feel like I have some insight around uh

408
01:12:29,159 --> 01:12:34,199
you know I mean even if you're unemployed or or

409
01:12:34,199 --> 01:12:41,600
going through it it just yeah I yeah

410
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:51,840
it's beautiful thank you so shall we do a guided raft meditation

411
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:57,300
great so to start

412
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:04,140
I'll walk you through the raft process which is our recognize a allow

413
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:11,640
f feel it T tease it apart and and the less Double

414
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:17,219
T is Trust so I'll guide you through that but that's the step by step it's sort of

415
01:13:17,219 --> 01:13:25,320
it's just walking through a you know mindfulness really a way to help yourself with it and

416
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:32,040
at any point in the process you may be done whatever you identify it may resolve and

417
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:39,060
you just don't have a lot more to think about and that's fine so don't feel like you have to make

418
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:44,460
things up or or figure things out right so

419
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:49,620
um so the the way we'll start

420
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:55,199
is I'm going to drop in a question or invite you to drop in a question into

421
01:13:55,199 --> 01:14:01,380
your being and just open up to see what what

422
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:09,659
happens what what kind of a response do you get and the practice the invitation is to

423
01:14:09,659 --> 01:14:17,340
connect with something connected to restlessness and worry in your experience but you know you don't have to if

424
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:22,440
something else comes up it's okay to work with that too

425
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:28,140
but please make sure whatever you choose to practice with is not something that will

426
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:33,239
be overwhelming it's kind of too big

427
01:14:33,239 --> 01:14:38,340
for you to do in this setting or at this time and

428
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:45,480
so look for something that's you know okay okay to be with and and if you think it's going to be

429
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:50,880
okay and it turns out not to be it's okay to stop it's okay to stand up it's

430
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:56,880
okay to restart right so giving yourself permission to not be

431
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:04,140
trapped in some practice and pushing yourself through something but keep tuning in to what's happening

432
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:10,820
for you okay so here's your here's the little question to drop in

433
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:17,760
it's kind of a funny question in a way what what should I be worried about

434
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:24,060
right now what should I be worried about right now

435
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:30,659
so just let let some things Bubble Up and like notice what's there

436
01:15:30,659 --> 01:15:36,060
and see if there's something that that again feels right size

437
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:43,219
that you might be able to recognize and allow and feel right

438
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:48,920
I'll just give you about a minute of Silence to kind of settle

439
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:57,540
and bring to mind whatever this thing is that you you quote unquote should be worrying about

440
01:15:57,540 --> 01:16:00,140
right now

441
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:50,820
so the first part of the practice is this recognition

442
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:55,880
and I imagine this is a little bit like um

443
01:16:57,060 --> 01:17:04,860
being able to stop and acknowledge something or a person or a situation

444
01:17:04,860 --> 01:17:12,060
like being able to turn toward it and name it in some way like

445
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:17,900
okay I recognize this

446
01:17:18,739 --> 01:17:25,940
situation this feeling this fear

447
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:36,380
sort of in a way that it knows it's being seen it's the Turning toward

448
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:42,420
so much of you know the difficulties in life we leave even some of the joys kind

449
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:48,179
of shove off to the side right and so what is it to turn right

450
01:17:48,179 --> 01:17:56,780
toward it and as you name it and recognize it

451
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:05,520
and you can sense it feels seen we move to a which is the invitation to

452
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:10,760
see if we can allow it to be in our presence

453
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:18,480
I'm just noticing if there is permission an ability to allow it to exist it's

454
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:24,620
already here can we give it some space

455
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:30,980
not for it not against it just kind of allowing

456
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:37,679
and if that feels impossible and there's a lot of resistance

457
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:44,580
recognize the resistance say oh okay the resistance is more

458
01:18:44,580 --> 01:18:50,159
dominant right now not wanting this so name the resistance and then shift and

459
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:55,400
focus on the resistance and allowing it to be there

460
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:11,040
and maybe you can't be completely allowing but is there enough allowance

461
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:16,860
to move and follow whatever this is into the body

462
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:25,380
to sort of say okay this is the idea this is the experience this is the thing I'm recognizing now can I follow the

463
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:30,659
vibrations into the body and feel where

464
01:19:30,659 --> 01:19:35,360
this situation lives in my body

465
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:41,119
how it affects my body

466
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:48,060
and you may be a very uh sensory somatic person so you're very

467
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:54,360
strong sense of the sensations the pressure the spaciousness or the

468
01:19:54,360 --> 01:20:00,540
vibratory and you also might be more of a visual person so it might be more like

469
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:05,880
oh it feels big it's black it has a color it has a shape

470
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:12,540
in whatever way you can find it and feel it and describe it and be with it so

471
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:18,600
find and feel in the body in whatever way your mind

472
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:25,080
can find and feel it but it's connected to your direct experience

473
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:32,780
it's not a conceptual thing in the body it's a felt thing

474
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:45,780
being curious noticing how does it respond to being

475
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:48,260
felt

476
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:58,440
and how am I feeling it you know there's this energy of

477
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:04,980
firmness or forcefulness and then there's an energy of receptivity

478
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:13,440
so if we're too forceful it's like a string that's too tight on a harp and it

479
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:18,719
doesn't really sing and if we're overly slack it doesn't

480
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:25,158
really even vibrate depending that right way

481
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:32,239
of feeling tuning in and being with

482
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:40,340
at some point whenever you're ready

483
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:49,739
will move to the teasing apart and there's no rush here you take your

484
01:21:49,739 --> 01:21:54,140
time or you move on whatever you're ready for

485
01:21:55,140 --> 01:22:03,300
for me when we move to teasing apart find it very useful to imagine

486
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:06,980
a very large round table

487
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:16,820
but your table could be small too if you want it to be small with as many chairs as are needed

488
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:23,600
as space as big as it needs to be

489
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:33,140
and we want to invite each thing connected to this whatever we're recognizing

490
01:22:33,179 --> 01:22:38,900
the thing itself what we've named to have a seat

491
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:45,360
and then if we had resistance we could let that have a seat at this

492
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,840
table too

493
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:58,320
if we connected with sadness or other emotions we can invite the emotions to have their

494
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:01,340
own seat at the table

495
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:12,679
and the chairs can be relative to the weight or size or need of each piece

496
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:19,500
our experience is a composite many things coming together

497
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:25,739
memories expectations fears hopes

498
01:23:25,739 --> 01:23:31,920
beliefs so without digging

499
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:39,179
more like just softening and allowing whatever pieces are clear

500
01:23:39,179 --> 01:23:44,178
to you to have a seat

501
01:24:05,219 --> 01:24:12,420
notice if you need more space in your room allowing a bigger perspective more

502
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:20,520
distance sort of looking over all of this

503
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:26,840
and as you see it what stands out to you

504
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:32,120
what are you noticing

505
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:40,560
one practitioner recently said to me I realized

506
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:46,260
the things that had the biggest seed at the table were really from her past her

507
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:52,920
memories her history and the thing that she named that was going on was really quite small and

508
01:24:52,920 --> 01:25:00,719
insignificant in relationship to the history that all that past energy and Karma was

509
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:06,678
getting transferred onto What's Happening Here and Now

510
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:18,179
and you could continue or if you're ready the next part of the practice

511
01:25:18,179 --> 01:25:22,699
is to connect with a feeling of trust

512
01:25:23,219 --> 01:25:32,840
what does trust feel like for me there's a sense of letting go

513
01:25:33,179 --> 01:25:36,739
there's nothing to protect

514
01:25:38,699 --> 01:25:44,219
I feel like I can trust mindfulness wisdom

515
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:50,880
sometimes if it's a difficult thing I trust that it will change

516
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:57,600
so what about the situation or your practice can help you find a

517
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:03,860
sense of trust in relationship to what's going on for you

518
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:16,679
there's something quite nourishing about resting in this way

519
01:26:16,679 --> 01:26:21,860
so if you can connect with a little more ease

520
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:28,380
a little bit more sense of letting go a little more understanding that wow

521
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:35,059
this is really not me this is doesn't Define me

522
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:43,520
this is about much more than just me it's a history it's a story

523
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:47,300
it's imagination

524
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:58,739
and like like you would lay back on a cozy raft in a warm body of water on a

525
01:26:58,739 --> 01:27:05,460
calm day with a warm sun let's see if you can allow yourself to

526
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:08,239
be nourished

527
01:29:54,960 --> 01:30:02,940
so we start with recognizing and then we invite ourselves to allow

528
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:09,360
the experience to be there it's already here

529
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:16,340
we feel it in our body we move out of conceptual into the direct experience

530
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:25,980
we could return to sort of the whole thing and try and imagine letting each part have its own

531
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:32,520
place teasing it apart and if it's accessible

532
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:39,360
moving into a space of trusting trusting awareness trusting the practice trusting

533
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:43,340
whatever insights have been revealed

534
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:53,340
this is you know this raft practice is a way to be with restlessness and worry

535
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:58,699
without trying to fix it right just to be with it see it for what it is

536
01:30:58,699 --> 01:31:03,260
for anything really the raft works

537
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:19,638
there's a lot of Stillness here so I hesitate to keep talking you know

538
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:27,000
but um if someone wants to share or ask a

539
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:34,739
question this is a good time to do it if not you can stay kind of Stillness

540
01:31:34,739 --> 01:31:39,780
and I'll just say a few more things as we come to a close

541
01:31:39,780 --> 01:31:45,179
but if there's any area you're confused about with the practice or

542
01:31:45,179 --> 01:31:53,480
anything that like stood out to you about how it was a practice in this way

543
01:31:53,940 --> 01:31:57,320
be happy to hear from you

544
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:26,780
great thank you Gus I was just thinking that for me

545
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:33,239
it's not going to happen sequentially very quickly it happens over time and just

546
01:32:33,239 --> 01:32:38,760
it's the how long does it take till you get to recognize the recognize this for a while

547
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:45,380
and so on and so forth right it's beautiful yeah yeah so there's no time crunch here yeah

548
01:32:45,380 --> 01:32:51,480
thank you and it doesn't have to go you know it might just be enough just

549
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:57,620
recognizing sometimes is all we can do or all that's needed

550
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:05,360
um I'd say that I've been meditating off and on for I don't know 15 years I've never gotten

551
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:13,739
intentionally gotten past allow maybe maybe I have gone through

552
01:33:13,739 --> 01:33:19,860
all of these but not with intention um I've I've always been trained or I

553
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:25,739
believe that you're supposed to recognize it and like you were just saying Let It Go um

554
01:33:25,739 --> 01:33:33,420
so I've been skipping steps this is like mind-blowing to me so I

555
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:39,480
just really appreciate this thank you yeah so you know there is a

556
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:45,719
lot of emphasis on just kind of allowing but if something is stuck

557
01:33:45,719 --> 01:33:52,380
if something keeps coming up there's it's asking to be understood to be seen

558
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:57,719
there's a message there's something there so there's a real delicate balance

559
01:33:57,719 --> 01:34:05,159
between kind of meeting seeing and meeting what's happening allowing its space

560
01:34:05,159 --> 01:34:10,980
and really in a way can we do this that its own unfolding happens I just had

561
01:34:10,980 --> 01:34:17,760
this image of you know the the tea that you put in the water that's like a flower you know you don't pull the

562
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:24,480
leaves apart the petals apart you gotta let it open like the story of somebody trying to help the butterfly out of a

563
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:31,440
cocoon so there is this process of whole sustaining attention long enough

564
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:38,940
and allowing something to unfold and and to not get re-immeshed with it

565
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:46,800
and also to like see it with Wonder like oh wow there's all these components and

566
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:52,620
they're maybe they're shy maybe some of the pieces don't stand out right away

567
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:59,820
maybe it takes a while for them to be willing maybe you just know there's something else but you don't know what it is so you just have a chair for it

568
01:34:59,820 --> 01:35:05,520
right so there is a balance with this overdoing

569
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:13,280
and under doing thank you so much

570
01:35:16,260 --> 01:35:21,719
anybody else wanna okay so I'll just um

571
01:35:21,719 --> 01:35:26,178
share just a couple little quickie things

572
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:33,420
it can be helpful to reflect on your purpose for practice Inspire and support continuing to

573
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:39,600
practice what's the purpose of recognizing the hindrances for you

574
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:47,780
you know not just to get rid of them but to learn to see

575
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:53,460
notice when restlessness and worry is not

576
01:35:53,460 --> 01:36:00,560
present is not present notice when it's not there too

577
01:36:00,780 --> 01:36:07,980
and that's something to be equally curious about what are the conditions that supported

578
01:36:07,980 --> 01:36:15,239
your being at ease and I said this in the meditation but

579
01:36:15,239 --> 01:36:22,320
with the trust part right calm and Tranquility can be so nourishing

580
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:28,579
so deeply nourishing and it's very easy

581
01:36:28,739 --> 01:36:36,480
to dismiss them because there's something more important I need to worry about or do

582
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:42,679
so be curious about the moments and and spaces where there is calm Tranquility

583
01:36:42,679 --> 01:36:50,460
ease trust faith and let it let it too and like on you

584
01:36:50,460 --> 01:36:56,360
know open up its blossoms be nourished by it

585
01:36:56,820 --> 01:37:03,780
so homework invitations the the handouts aren't numbered in the order we're using

586
01:37:03,780 --> 01:37:09,900
them but you know it's all there and they're also on Audio Dharma they're

587
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:16,500
they're posted there as well this week kind of the invitation is to

588
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:22,159
experiment with the ways you can live your life that lessen

589
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:27,780
restlessness and worry from arising you know what helps lessen it

590
01:37:27,780 --> 01:37:34,159
might be how you're talking to yourself it might be you know how much

591
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:42,179
Doom scrolling you do and look at things like exercise sleep

592
01:37:42,179 --> 01:37:49,620
caffeine nutrition right and living an ethical life

593
01:37:49,620 --> 01:37:55,320
that's huge but what what can you find what can you

594
01:37:55,320 --> 01:38:04,260
discover about what leads to more ease less restlessness and less worry

595
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:11,178
thank you for your practice maybe be a benefit for many beings everywhere

596
01:38:13,739 --> 01:38:19,820
have a good night thank you
