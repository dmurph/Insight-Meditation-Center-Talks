1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:07,500
so welcome here in San Francisco it's Tuesday

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:14,940
morning and we are discussing the the 10 Perfections the 10 paramis and my

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:22,619
name is kodo let's take a few minutes to

4
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:28,560
arrive and then we will gently begin with a

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:36,120
meditation something uh something you'll hear me say quite a lot this week is

6
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,540
um one of the features of the practice of the Perfections the practices

7
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:50,460
of the paramese is that they apply on the cushion when we're meditating and off the cushion

8
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:57,300
in what we call the rest of our life though we we know well that that line is arbitrary

9
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:03,780
um what we do on the cushion follows us off and what we do in the rest of our lives

10
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,360
follows us to the cushion there's no real line there

11
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:16,680
but these parties are deliberate ways we can reflect on and approach experience and bring the bring the possibility and

12
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:23,520
the beauty of the Dharma into everything that we do so for now let's let's do that in the

13
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,298
form of meditation

14
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,040
[Music]

15
00:01:52,619 --> 00:02:01,040
so settling yourself in the way that you know best

16
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:18,120
could be that it's time to take a few deep breaths as you feel and

17
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,819
roll yourself into your body

18
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,280
tuning into sensing

19
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,540
this sensing that's happening all the time

20
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,379
to support our arriving

21
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:24,680
or sensing our sensing our way to the sitting base

22
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:33,200
feeling the connection with the seed or whatever is supporting us

23
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:02,959
and then sensing our way through the spine

24
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,080
feeling upright

25
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:24,199
feeling relaxed and alert

26
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,360
for this morning we're going to

27
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,520
turn our attention deliberately

28
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,520
to each of our senses one at a time

29
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:23,300
turn our attention there sense for any attention

30
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:31,699
and then relax so let's begin with the eyes

31
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,259
directing attention to the eyes

32
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:49,259
before making any adjustments just feeling

33
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,919
any tension or discomfort and letting that register

34
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:12,120
and then with our breathing and time with our breathing just gently relax

35
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,919
letting go what can let go

36
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,319
then registering any ease

37
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,620
pleasure relief

38
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,740
keeping our attention here with the eyes

39
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:59,540
if more tension

40
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,040
coagulates in the area

41
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,500
just repeating

42
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:18,060
to register that discomfort

43
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:26,720
we gently release and know the relief

44
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:02,600
then when the moment feels right turning to the area of the ears

45
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:15,120
maybe not the ears themselves any tensions in the area

46
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,480
but maybe you have a sense or linked to hearing

47
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,760
gently release

48
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:08,240
now letting go of the ears turning to the nose

49
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,200
in the area of the nose

50
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:24,500
sensitive to any tensions

51
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,500
gently release

52
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,019
foreign

53
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:52,860
the eyes ears now letting go

54
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:59,840
of attention to the nose turning to the tongue

55
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:07,260
and not only the tongue maybe there's tension in the

56
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:15,260
the jaw chin even the guns

57
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:22,020
for the upper throat if it feels okay for you to sense into

58
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,679
these things

59
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,759
just long enough

60
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,220
and gently relaxing

61
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:46,880
and registering really registering the relief

62
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:15,019
relaxing the tongue the mouth

63
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:21,500
turning our attention to the

64
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:29,659
attack time sense of the body

65
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,100
with a gentle touch

66
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:47,700
registering anywhere anywhere that tension

67
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,799
is calling for attention

68
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:11,299
and first coming to know it I'm not doing anything

69
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:23,658
bringing the attention into the area that's being called for

70
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:38,539
and then gently relaxing whatever can be easily relaxed

71
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:12,620
then another area may call and so on

72
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,480
foreign

73
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:29,120
and finally the mind

74
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:45,860
feeling any tension in mind ill sometimes calls the thinking muscle

75
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:52,940
the head the temples maybe you're on the eyes

76
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,279
sensing relaxing

77
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:05,900
and registering the relief

78
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,240
foreign

79
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:40,500
eyes ears

80
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:46,039
the moments um

81
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:51,740
body and mind

82
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,440
released

83
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:08,039
near our practice ring relief and release

84
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:15,600
to all beings foreign

85
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:24,380
[Music]

86
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:30,380
so hello again

87
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:39,000
after this meditation on releasing relaxing the sense bases I wonder how

88
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,539
you're doing you've just participated I would be interested or open if you have any

89
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:50,580
comments in the chat so we'll proceed today with our

90
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:56,760
discussion of the Perfections the parties and part of what we just did was a was an

91
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:02,940
experiential way of introducing the practice of what we call renunciation

92
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:09,360
you'll see as we go so these uh these 10 Perfections we're talking about is

93
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:16,980
10 Noble qualities that can apply in all sorts of areas of

94
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:23,840
our life and importantly each of these qualities and practices are accompanied by

95
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:29,460
compassion and skillful means they're accompanied by compassion

96
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:35,059
something heartful and skillful means which is the wisdom aspect

97
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:40,140
the 10 as you might remember giving

98
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:45,720
virtue renunciation

99
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:51,539
wisdom or discernment energy is fifth

100
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:57,080
patients sixth truthfulness

101
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,340
resolve Goodwill and equanimity

102
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:09,059
these are the ten and today we'll focus on renunciation and wisdom or discernment

103
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:17,039
we've been talking about the Pyrenees in pairs um as both practices that we can do and

104
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:24,840
the qualities that arise based on those practices so as we said yesterday the practice of giving supports our

105
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:32,940
quality of generosity and as we'll see the practice of Letting Go supports our quality of wise

106
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:39,360
renunciation we're talking about these parmes as mutually supportive

107
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:49,020
and with the potential not only to apply everywhere in our life but also to bring about a thorough going

108
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:54,380
freedom for the benefit of both ourselves and for others

109
00:32:56,539 --> 00:33:01,679
so we practice these primaries step by step sort of in the way that it's taught

110
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:07,799
in this text uh we practice we practice them in order so

111
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:14,279
um we practice giving and then that is followed on and complemented by uh virtue ethical

112
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:19,380
conduct Selah and it's interesting how these two work together that it said that giving

113
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:26,580
benefits other people sort of obvious ways and then virtue or ethical Behavior

114
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:32,940
prevents the Affliction of the other people so we're benefiting them with our giving and then we're preventing harm

115
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:39,840
with our ethical Behavior so in a way we could say that establishing

116
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:46,799
ourselves in in a conduct that's compassionate and wise means that we we turn the potential for

117
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:52,740
harm into the potential for benefit for ourselves and for others through our

118
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:58,320
words and our Deeds as Gil will sometimes teach

119
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,779
through this practice of mindfulness just sort of sort of by nature of the

120
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:09,500
practice of mindfulness we start to develop what he calls an ethical sensitivity

121
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:17,580
um and that is we become sensitive to identifying what our what our actions

122
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:23,040
that we do that cause an ouch and those actions that we do that cause

123
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:29,820
an ah sense the difference and we'll see that this naturally sets

124
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:35,760
the stage for pronunciation so let's pick up the thread there first of the quote from the Google body

125
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:42,658
the well-known translator and teacher who tends to put things in such a clear way

126
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:51,000
so bikubody talks about renunciation this way the tool that the Buddha holds out to

127
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,520
free the Mind From Desire is understanding

128
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:02,760
real renunciation he says is not a matter of compelling ourselves to give

129
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:09,780
up things still and really cherished I'm going to repeat that

130
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:15,060
not a matter of compelling ourselves to give up things still inwardly cherished

131
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:23,520
but he goes on of changing our perspective on them so that they no longer bind us

132
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:30,720
he concludes when we understand the nature of Desire when we investigate it closely with Keen

133
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:38,838
attention desire Falls away by itself without need for struggle

134
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:45,420
isn't that wonderful that the the potential for freedom is right there with the desire

135
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:53,460
through our clear investigation this is the power of the practice of mindfulness I also want to highlight how uh in in

136
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:58,560
talking about renunciation sensual desire since objects the the difficulty

137
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:05,099
is not necessarily in the thing what we're studying in this Buddhist practice is the glue

138
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:11,400
that we call craving and clinging so I want to share a

139
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:17,339
personal story to illustrate this which is just before

140
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:23,460
uh oh wait it's a personal story that really well illustrates how the mind will let go of itself

141
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:29,579
at the discovery that something will know will no longer be serving me actually something that I'm Desiring is

142
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:35,400
causing me harm so just before my my 30th birthday

143
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:42,900
um I received a surprise diagnosis that switched the way that I relate to food

144
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:48,660
so um yeah I was 29 and a surprise to me I

145
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:56,760
became a late onset type 1 diabetic and as is obvious that has all sorts of

146
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:02,820
implications for what what can be eaten so right after the diagnosis I can't eat

147
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:08,880
um let's just say sugar anymore I'd go to the grocery store and I would

148
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:14,700
just Pine I would wish for sweets um

149
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:24,599
the uh at this point though the ice cream aisle let's say it's just a it's just a a location of suffering for me

150
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:32,240
at the time I remember getting very very interested in sugar-free anything sugar-free Jello or whatever

151
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:38,099
what I had along with this suffering was some really hard data about cause and effect

152
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:45,180
eating such and such a food would lead to such and such a consequence and this this sort of tracking that I

153
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:51,300
was doing throughout the day and the experience of my illness along with a very

154
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:56,940
clear potential for bodily harm um

155
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:02,220
it yielded a relatively Swift change in understanding and way of relating and

156
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:07,680
after a pretty short time sugar no longer registered as a food item for me

157
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:13,680
it may as well be paper so it was it's with a sensitivity to the

158
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:19,619
drawbacks um that's what really changed the change

159
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:24,780
the landscape for me and the the desire for let's say cake

160
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:30,000
just kind of faded out and really to to emphasize this point it

161
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,060
wasn't it wasn't that I drove out the thing that I loved

162
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:42,180
but um that the mind was no longer bound by it So within a couple of months I could I

163
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:46,940
could walk down the ice cream aisle no problem whatsoever

164
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:54,900
Suites may be a sort of simple low stakes example but the logic applies to many of our compulsive desires

165
00:38:54,900 --> 00:39:02,480
so some of them may seem harmless enough um but yet that process of compulsion

166
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:09,420
re-conditions a process that's at work during some of our most intense difficulties in life

167
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:14,700
ice cream is one thing but craving and clinging conditions conditions things like

168
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:21,560
conflict and quarrel um can think of think of its influence on robbery and

169
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:28,619
theft or harm and then all the ways that all the ways that craving and clinging

170
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:34,740
that have that energy of craving and clinging supports Us in indulging our

171
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:40,020
in the text what we might call misconduct of body speech and mind

172
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:45,359
or ways that we we our actions support harm for ourselves and others rather

173
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:52,859
than benefit so this is one really good reason for

174
00:39:52,859 --> 00:39:59,460
seeing the connection between these practices and qualities because you hear right there how renunciation and the

175
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:05,940
practice of ethical conduct and Sila work together and as we said earlier as we practice as

176
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:12,240
we practice virtue as we practice ethical conduct our sensitivity to the

177
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:21,420
harm or benefit we call this others comes more subtle and this is this sort of observation how

178
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:28,040
we help and how we hurt this is right where where renunciation practice belongs

179
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:36,660
so it's one thing to say that it's one thing to say oh you know just think about the drawbacks but these these

180
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:44,579
cravings and clings that we have relative to sensual Pleasures they're often so well ingrained well practiced

181
00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:51,599
uh we we have I can sort of playfully say we have perfected the art of craving

182
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:56,940
and clinging over many many many years so um

183
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:02,040
this uh this teaching suggest employing some other means to

184
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:07,079
help shift the perspective really thinking about the nature of

185
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:12,119
desire and what we actually get out of it so

186
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:19,260
um some of the some of the metaphors that acharya damapala uses in this treaties

187
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:25,260
on the palmies helps us to shift our perspective from thinking and thinking and experience the

188
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:31,560
way we normally do which is sensual Pleasures are long lasting ultimately satisfying

189
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:37,160
um they're only Pleasant not at all painful and instead encourages Us in this reflection

190
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:42,480
using these pretty dramatic metaphors first of all emphasizing their brevity

191
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,880
like a flash of lightning um encourages a reappraisal of the mix

192
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:53,220
of Pleasure and Pain out of sensual desire maybe maybe like a drop of honey

193
00:41:53,220 --> 00:42:00,359
that smeared over a blade or their promise of satisfaction but

194
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:07,320
that they can't ultimately deliver um like needing a drink of water but only having that little thin bit of dew

195
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:12,359
on your fingertips maybe um

196
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:19,640
maybe even uh thinking that a sensual desire and

197
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:25,320
embracing it is going to satisfy us but in fact it makes the situation worse it

198
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:31,200
actually intensifies the craving and the image here is so apt it is addressing

199
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:37,200
our thirst with by drinking salt water and feeling like that's going to solve

200
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:44,460
solve the solve the issue diminish the craving but in fact exacerbates

201
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:54,720
so just one final thought about renunciation and that is in this um in this reappraisal of sensual desire

202
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:00,300
and our relationship to them uh it doesn't mean we need to stop enjoying life

203
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:06,599
as big Cabot said at the beginning it's not that we push out the things that that we enjoy

204
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:12,240
but we learn to shift our relationships to them I think of food as a great example and there was a monastic who

205
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:18,839
trained trained his monks to really pay attention to how long in fact does food

206
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:27,380
stay Pleasant in the mouth after starting to chew it compared to how long we obsess over food

207
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:33,980
how long does that pleasure actually last once a morsel of food is in the mouth

208
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:42,380
so renunciation has the consequence of being a strong support or settling

209
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:48,300
unification concentration and this is where renunciation and wisdom come

210
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:53,339
together as Dawn so beautifully covered last week

211
00:43:53,339 --> 00:44:00,420
um in the in the tradition discernment or wisdom is associated with the ability to

212
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:06,839
make distinctions and particularly the ability to make distinctions that are supportive of

213
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:13,440
freedom and liberation the image here is of uh of an Archer who

214
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:19,819
shoots an arrow at the Target and penetrates and I like how in that image the target is um

215
00:44:19,819 --> 00:44:24,619
split in two we made a distinction

216
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:32,040
and there are sort of three modes of developing these distinctions developing this sort of discernment and wisdom one

217
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:38,880
is simple hearing and learning the second is reflection what we call reflective acquiescence it's a fun

218
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,980
phrase where you sort of chew on turn over and start to have these aha moments

219
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:51,000
about how the practice lives in your life and then the third is through meditation

220
00:44:51,000 --> 00:45:00,800
and whether we deliberately bring our study or reflection into our meditation or not it's it's in there working on us

221
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:08,160
it's the manifestation of wisdom is non-confusion and its proximate cause is the

222
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:14,819
concentration associated with renunciation so to close I want to I want to suggest

223
00:45:14,819 --> 00:45:23,040
uh as we did yesterday for bringing this into your day of practice the the um that same mode of practice of

224
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:31,200
observing and reflecting on um how does renunciation show up in my day

225
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:37,440
and how does its opposite show up in my day no just to know and then how does wisdom how does

226
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:43,920
discernment show up in my day and how does its opposite show up delusion and again we're not we're not trying to

227
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:49,800
just do it right 100 of the time but we really want to know this whole range the quality

228
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:56,220
and it's opposite so we'll pick up here tomorrow with energy and patience

229
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:03,000
thanks so much have a beautiful day of practice may all beings be happy peaceful and

230
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,300
well
