1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:09,120
so hello a warm hello from Redwood

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,559
City warm hello from

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:23,760
this maybe in certain kind of way at the center of this wonderful online community for

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:32,679
these this gathering for meditation and teaching thank thank you for being

5
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,239
here and

6
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:49,280
um so today I'd like to uh make a very important distinction for in mindfulness

7
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:56,239
practice and that is that um there is an important

8
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:02,199
distinction between what we

9
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:08,880
see and how we see so to take it literally with seeing with our

10
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:15,119
eyes that um you know we what we see we could see any object at all a mountain

11
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:22,320
in the distance a person um some delicious food that's in front of us

12
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:29,000
that seems appetizing whatever it might be something unpleasant something pleasant

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,439
something neutral there's the object and then there's a wide range of

14
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:42,159
ways that we the ways we could see it the what comes along with

15
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:48,640
seeing uh there could be seeing That's goes comes along with fear and so the

16
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,439
eyes are part of the scanning for safety scanning for where the danger is and that's the

17
00:01:54,439 --> 00:02:02,159
orientation there could be seeing that's uh oriented towards what we want our desire and looking for what's good and

18
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,399
wonderful and what's in it for me there's the we can see through the

19
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,840
lens of what we don't like aversion what we want to say no to what we want to

20
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,720
pull away what we want to resist we can see through skepticism and

21
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:28,920
cynicism we can see through hatred we can see through uh intense infatuation

22
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,480
and and uh craving and so the way the eyes work

23
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:41,239
varies and what the eyes see how the ey sees varies we could be uh staring at

24
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:50,200
something intensely with anger and people feel the the heat of our the daggers in the eye

25
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,720
we can uh gaze at something lovingly and kindly and people feel the warmth and

26
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:03,040
the kindness so there's all these different ways that we can see in mindfulness practice we want to

27
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,640
recognize how we're seeing and learn to

28
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:17,360
see uh in a way that's free seeing that's free seeing that's

29
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:24,680
freeing that liberates seeing from all this extra baggage that goes on and so

30
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:31,120
we can see clearly directly open

31
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,760
ly where we free the

32
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:42,879
seeing from entanglement with what's being

33
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:51,519
seen so that's kind of I'm talking about it more literally but there's also seeing with the Mind's Eye there's

34
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:59,920
knowing we all the same thing applies to how we know how we're mindful

35
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,079
H and and uh and as important as sensing

36
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:11,840
is really being embodied really being embodied feeling sensing what's going on there is also a

37
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:19,600
distinction between what is being sensed and how we know it how we see

38
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,560
that and so in that it's in the how that we find our

39
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,600
freedom not in the what so whatever you know whatever you

40
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:41,960
see that can answer the question what is it that's not where freedom is founded

41
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:49,199
so it's not in a particular experience a particular understanding a

42
00:04:49,960 --> 00:05:00,240
particular something that we see but rather it's how we see

43
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,400
and this means that if something is uncomfortable difficult if we're

44
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,639
suffering there's the art of where we find our freedom is not by getting rid

45
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:17,280
of the suffering per se but rather learning how

46
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:23,039
to see it freely see it so we're not for and

47
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:31,280
against it caught in it and um and then we see better as long

48
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:38,080
as we're caught in something we don't see it really as it is if something is really wonderful and

49
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:45,000
where it brings us happiness that's wonderful but the art of mindfulness is

50
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,240
to see it in a better way a more satisfying way than seeing it with the

51
00:05:52,240 --> 00:06:02,680
happiness it's seeing it with Clarity and openness there's a higher level of happiness that comes when the seeing is

52
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,759
free so if this makes sense to you then we'll we'll do maybe you can follow

53
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:16,800
along in this guided meditation today so to assume a meditation

54
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:27,000
posture and to kind of just maybe Rock back and

55
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:34,520
forth sway the body a bit in order to kind of feel the moving body

56
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:42,479
as a invitation to feel your body to be in your

57
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:50,639
body and then gently to let your body become still a soft

58
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,560
Stillness not held or

59
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:02,430
tight maybe do the same thing with head just let the head rotate

60
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:07,800
[Music] around move back and forth gently not

61
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:14,560
too much but feeling little bit loosening in the

62
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:25,440
neck and lowering your gaze so that you may be feeling a little

63
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,919
bit softening and relaxing in the eyes

64
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,720
and softly closing the

65
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:56,080
eyes and without doing anything

66
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,080
else Softly

67
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:09,759
Let the Body let your body feel the movements of

68
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,879
breathing how does your

69
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:30,599
body how does your body experience breathing

70
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,360
and then gently not too much just a little bit

71
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,440
deeper breaths so there can be a little bit more

72
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:09,600
Fuller sensing of your body on the in breath and a little bit

73
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:16,079
more opportunity to relax the body on the

74
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:19,600
exhale without

75
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:28,079
ambition content to do this in small little

76
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,360
ways for

77
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:25,240
and then letting your breathing return to normal and then in the rhythm of

78
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:33,440
breathing in and breathing out kind of riding on in breaths and out

79
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:40,560
breaths movements of the body feel the body and relax the

80
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,600
body softening the

81
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,279
body e

82
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,600
and if there's any way that you can also soften the thinking

83
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:01,240
mind without a lot of ambition small little micro

84
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:09,800
relaxations on the exhale Relax The Thinking

85
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:19,800
mind maybe imagining that the Mind expands and spreads out

86
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:28,160
horizontally like a lake that spreads wide and the waves quieting

87
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
down

88
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
for

89
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,120
e for

90
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:22,560
and then to Center yourself again on the

91
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:32,079
breathing the body is experience of breathing for

92
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:13,600
and then become aware

93
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:20,160
notice how you're mindful of breathing

94
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:57,600
is there any strain in being mindful

95
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:04,720
any attitude that comes with being

96
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:30,920
mindful any belief that's coming along with being mindful of your breathing

97
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,480
on one hand there can be a straining and a trying

98
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:56,199
hard and another hand there can be a complacency or boredom

99
00:16:56,199 --> 00:17:00,199
or indifference

100
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:09,280
that's being added both are being added to the Simplicity of being

101
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:26,480
aware there can be tension with being mindful

102
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,880
there can be a for and against the

103
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:50,840
experience and if mindfulness is a kind of mental seeing knowing of

104
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:58,080
experience can you experiment to see if the knowing the

105
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:05,840
seeing p simple clear

106
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:15,080
open just mindful just aware of what is of

107
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:23,240
breathing without a for and against without an attitude

108
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,440
maybe you can have this simple clear

109
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:51,360
awareness in one part of the cycle of breathing where you can see and

110
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:59,200
recognize that there's no interference nothing extra just the experience Maybe the

111
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,080
transition from in and out breath out and in

112
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:18,400
breath maybe at the beginning of in breath beginning of our

113
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:32,120
breath so the how you're

114
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:39,320
aware is not adding anything more than just being

115
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:49,840
aware that in the how you're aware there is some simple maybe

116
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,600
humble feeling of

117
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:02,200
freedom freedom from what is being

118
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:15,919
experienced awareness independent of the breathing but that knows the breathing

119
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:52,039
knowing or a seeing which is radically

120
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:59,360
simple free of ideas of what it means to be seeing

121
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:07,039
or be knowing just whatever

122
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:16,039
way it simply occurs on its own if you're present

123
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:58,320
if you allow breathing to be present in awareness

124
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,158
how simple can The Knowing

125
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:18,278
be and knowing or seeing a

126
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,360
mindfulness or a how we

127
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:34,960
are is free knowing freely

128
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:42,080
knowing freedom in The Knowing

129
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
itself

130
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

131
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
for

132
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
for

133
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
for

134
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,320
e for

135
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:24,520
and then as we come to the end of this sitting can you imagine or

136
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:29,480
visualize someone that you trust

137
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:35,640
seeing you looking at you being with

138
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,799
you without any projections without

139
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:51,240
any for and against without any a agendas or desires or

140
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:59,039
aversions but the person sees you as you are and it and in being being seen

141
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:05,480
completely as you are the warts and

142
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:14,039
all you feel that the person accepts you as you

143
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:19,080
are but an acceptance which is not a thing to

144
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:25,880
do an acceptance is like how the Wide Open

145
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:30,760
Sky accepts a bird flying through

146
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:49,398
it and can you imagine yourself gazing upon someone

147
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:57,279
else kindly gently friendly with an awareness that

148
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:02,559
otherwise is not for or

149
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:10,880
against an awareness that sees clearly and accepts the

150
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:19,240
other with an acceptance which not a thing to do an active acceptance but rather an

151
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:27,039
acceptance like the vast Sky accepting the bird that flies

152
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,120
through it

153
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:45,399
may it be that our ability to see and know

154
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:54,559
others where the how we know and how we see has an element of

155
00:28:54,919 --> 00:29:02,000
Freedom we know with freedom knowing is not burdened

156
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,440
by beliefs and attitudes and

157
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:13,760
judgments to see clearly

158
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:22,159
freely and out of that seeing May there be

159
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:29,640
born kindness love care

160
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:35,840
so from the depths of our being we wish may

161
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:41,080
others be happy May

162
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:49,080
others be safe may others be

163
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:53,559
peaceful May others be

164
00:29:56,279 --> 00:30:02,200
free and the how how we know them how we're with

165
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:11,720
them offers some of that may all beings be happy

166
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,890

00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,080
thank you

168
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:43,760
so hello and welcome to this fourth talk that's focused

169
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:51,679
on the I I believe the very significant practice of not making it

170
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:57,960
worse if um if that's all we do

171
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:03,480
we be make a much better world and

172
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:09,000
um so and how we're talking about it is with taking the word worse and turning

173
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,639
it into an acronym and so if you want to practice

174
00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:22,080
not making it worse then there's these five different ways of steps to how you

175
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:30,039
can do that besides just doing nothing so this way not making it worse

176
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:35,919
actually makes it better actually enhances something and allows something

177
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:42,000
more significant or profound have a chance to arise and happen in the

178
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:49,559
situation that couldn't happen if we just Barrel ahead and just do the thing that makes it worse that expresses the

179
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:55,399
anger or um acts on the greed or acts on

180
00:32:55,399 --> 00:32:59,840
um bias and

181
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:08,200
so uh so first is to wait if you feel that okay I I don't I'm going to about

182
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:15,960
now to make it worse I'm going to create more division separation divisiveness I'm going to uh give this person a piece

183
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:22,240
of my mind so that they feel lousy and belittled or I'm going to you know uh do

184
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:28,039
something that I know in the past um makes me feel lousy afterwards

185
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:33,840
um and so I know I know this make make it worse and

186
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:39,960
and yes I know an alternative I know something something to do in this

187
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:47,559
circumstance I know the specialness the wonderfulness of pausing and

188
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:55,279
waiting wait wait just wait a little bit a sacred weit a momentary

189
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:02,919
Sabbath a generative waiting let's let wait make room for something to happen

190
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:08,240
here and be known and then um to organize to orient

191
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:16,000
yourself to bring yourself together pull yourself together because generally if we're going to make the situation worse

192
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,960
we're probably not all of us present we're probably caught in some desire

193
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:29,878
some aversion some fantasy some thought construct and so wait so you can then

194
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:35,800
feel and bring yourself together open up to feel your body and give Time by

195
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:43,599
feeling your body for different parts of your body to come together and contribute to the whole to settle

196
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:50,679
down and then um uh rest

197
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:56,878
relax find a place of rest find a place to relax to pause in a deeper way where

198
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:02,000
the bodies are kind of at ease so you're not struggling to hold

199
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:10,760
back from blurting out the thing that's will make it worse and then uh now we come to the

200
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:19,240
S and uh the S uh has two things as well uh first is to

201
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:26,359
sense take time and this is like where the where you harvest the benefits from

202
00:35:26,359 --> 00:35:32,560
waiting getting organized and resting or relaxing is now

203
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:38,320
you're going to be now you have greater capacity to tune into all the different

204
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:45,160
ways in which the body your physical body um can sense and feel what's

205
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:50,520
happening there's a tremendous amount of information in the body that reveals

206
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:57,240
what we're feeling what uh what's what we understand what's happening around us

207
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:02,359
um the body helps us to understand our environment helps us to understand the

208
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:09,480
people we're with and what we're doing the the body sometimes has will understand and feel the tension in the

209
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:14,920
room maybe sometimes faster than um the thinking mind so if we're caught up in

210
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:24,079
our thoughts and ideas and what we want to say we might not really sense and feel the tension in the room or the or

211
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:32,200
the or the suffering that someone has or or the the uh nervousness that's there

212
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:39,160
or the joy that's there or the all kinds of things that we start becoming aware

213
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:45,640
of so to sense and we sense what's happening with ourselves more deeply the

214
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:51,920
um the um um you know uh that there's a depths

215
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:58,319
of attitudes of response of emotionality of of um

216
00:36:58,319 --> 00:37:04,200
layers and layers of how we're responding and reacting based on our history and our experience and our

217
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:09,480
deeper beliefs and so a lot of that information is starts becoming more

218
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:15,480
available if we take the time to sense and feel and the more we practice

219
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:22,040
embodied mindfulness slowly slowly sometimes over years the the deeper the

220
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:28,119
sensitivity is in the body deep to sense and feel so much of what is carried in

221
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:36,200
the body um if we think the body is senseless it's senseless it has

222
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:42,640
no sense to be in the body um then it's true then we're not there to pick it up

223
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:48,359
the sensations but the body does have sense both in the sense that it has

224
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:56,560
Sensations and we can sense things but it has sense in terms of it has meaning it has purpose it has information it has

225
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:04,960
all kinds of things that's there that we can discover so take time to sense What's

226
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:11,359
Happening Here what feel your way into it what's happening you can overdo this

227
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:17,680
sensing uh and only be in your body and and then not get and that also can be

228
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:24,800
limiting to the the whole and that's why the other s for uh uh for This Acronym

229
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:31,680
is to see uh and see with the Mind's Eye and this is a little bit more active than

230
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:37,319
just sensing perhaps there's an intentionality to let me look here let

231
00:38:37,319 --> 00:38:43,760
me look more closely What's Happening Here uh now that I've paused and gotten

232
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:51,520
more present and have sensed and um and relaxed um let me look at the situation

233
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:57,079
let me take a new look a fresh look at the situation that I'm in uh take a look

234
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:02,119
at my myself maybe I need to really pause for a moment and step aside and

235
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:09,040
understand myself more deeply what do I see what's going on here what can be named

236
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:17,720
seeing clearly is closely connected to being able to name something sensing can

237
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:23,680
happen without you know the the words or the naming or or uh cognitive

238
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:29,319
understanding but the seeing at least in uh mindfulness practice is closely

239
00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:34,480
aligned with close to a kind of cognitive clarity about what is

240
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:40,880
happening it doesn't have to be words it could be a kind of wordless knowing

241
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:48,520
cognition but there is a kind of clarity so we start looking and seeing where's the what's happening here and that could

242
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:54,240
be the situation around us we we choose to okay let me look at this these people

243
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:59,680
are talking very loudly and now that I've kind of settled down and not

244
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:05,400
yelling at them or not overwhelmed by it all uh now I'm in a position what's

245
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:12,280
happening here and we're looking and we're seeing what's happening here what's going

246
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:17,720
on and um and the um said take time to

247
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:23,040
take take time to see I'm just what's coming to mind repeatedly as I say this

248
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:28,200
is uh the example of my one of my sons

249
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:33,319
when he went to uh kindergarten he went in and a lot

250
00:40:33,319 --> 00:40:40,800
of the kids in the kindergarten already knew themselves but he didn't know anyone and as far as we know what he

251
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:47,440
what how he responded to being in kindergarten the first I think a couple of weeks or three weeks um we don't know

252
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:53,960
think he was afraid or nervous or or uh challenged to be there but he did

253
00:40:53,960 --> 00:41:02,319
something very unusual um he got one of a teeny little kids chair that they had there and he

254
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:10,040
put it right in the middle where all the action was in the school in the classroom and he just sat there for you

255
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:16,720
know two three weeks just watching all the kids watching what was going on and uh and then eventually he got off

256
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:22,480
the chair and then he started participating and engaging and but uh he just first want to take a good look

257
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:28,040
what's happening here and understand it I guess and understand the people and who they were and

258
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:34,359
and that was kind of so to see to really take a deep look and see what's

259
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:39,720
happening here and um and then that gives the

260
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:45,640
opportunity especially if you're a mindfulness practitioner to see how we

261
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:52,560
see to be aware of how we're tuning into the situation are we tense are we

262
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:58,560
reactive do we have attitudes do we have biases do we have preferen do we have

263
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:06,480
agendas what do we bring with us and in what way does that prevent clear seeing

264
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:17,040
clear seeing of ourselves and clear seeing of others so um wait or get yourself

265
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:24,280
organized relax rest in the situation so that now you can take a good look at

266
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:31,520
what's going on sense and see the situation and what do you discover what

267
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:40,720
becomes richer and Fuller uh what is what are you missing what becomes more dynamic or

268
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:48,319
or uh more connected and better understanding by taking time to sense

269
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:53,520
and see rather than making it a situation worse and one of the things

270
00:42:53,520 --> 00:43:00,200
that you might see is that you might see that the s that the people you're with the

271
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:06,720
situation you're in even yourself you'll see that there's layers

272
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:13,720
of of beauty layers of value layers of things that you can respect layers of

273
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:19,800
suffering that need to be addressed need to be seen uh we start seeing life in a

274
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:25,559
deeper Fuller more valuable way when we're not riding on the

275
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:31,119
tip of let let's make it worse let's make it worse let's attack let's

276
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:37,359
complain let's criticize let's be cynical let's be skeptical just let's

277
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:42,640
just just let's pause so for today if you're at all

278
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:50,480
interested and you like the idea of an assignment uh the assignment is to in the situations where it's

279
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:57,720
appropriate um take more time than you normally would to sense the situation

280
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:04,760
sense yourself sense what's information that's coming in and all the different see you know uh all the different ways

281
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:10,119
that the body can be tuned in to the heart can be tuned

282
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:15,720
in and then uh practice seeing ask your you know even with a

283
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:21,079
question what's Happening Here let me take a deeper look let me look again and

284
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:28,440
then see what you learn so thank you very much and um and

285
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:34,079
I hope all of us as a collective in not making it worse for others this week is

286
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:38,480
making this a world a better place
