2
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,240
so good morning everyone and welcome

3
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:35,120
nice to have you all here in person and nice to have everyone who's on youtube

4
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:42,720
present as well i have the chat open thank you and uh

5
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,519
so one of the hallmarks of

6
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,320
of this practice of ours is simplicity

7
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:03,839
and you might want to keep that word close by when you do this kind of practice simple keep it simple

8
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:10,399
stay simple if it's not simple it's probably not mindfulness

9
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:17,600
and that's not meant to be a big complicated engineering job of mindfulness

10
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:24,880
complicated thing to figure out or to follow and make or make our way

11
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,480
certainly we enter into a complex world sometimes with mindfulness

12
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,560
complex inner lives and one way that i've made that simple

13
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:43,040
is i use the label chaos it's just chaos

14
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:49,279
i'm sitting in chaos and that's like the big overview kind of label that

15
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,480
then i'm not lost in the details trying to figure it out just oh it's just

16
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:01,760
another big wonderful label is confusion whoa that's all that's all it is simple i'm

17
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,399
i'm confused

18
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,240
so okay okay and then you can hopefully oh now that i know it's confusion

19
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:20,160
i'll just sit with confusion i don't it doesn't keep it simple maybe i don't have to be

20
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,440
unconfused maybe it's okay to be confused just just confusion

21
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,720
and and as soon as i make those labels like that you know chaos or confusion

22
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,880
i've kind of begun to make sense of it or just kind of beginning to kind of find my bearings or

23
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:43,120
like a toehold or a landing place for it and then it's not quite chaos or

24
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,320
confusion anymore and because now like with confusion

25
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,639
i'm not confused but being confused i know i know i'm confused

26
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:00,480
so it's like it's beginning to shift and then what would be simple way of

27
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,560
being with confusion or chaos let's be let's be embodiedly present so

28
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:13,600
let's be present in the body with it and then what is like it for the body for this chaos or this body to be

29
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:20,959
confused and suppose energy and agitation and so it's getting narrower and kind of more defined where the attention goes no

30
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:27,200
i'm not not confused about this now i'm not confused that my body's agitated

31
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,480
is my little toe agitated no it's mostly in my torso

32
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:38,320
it's mostly in the front of my torso so it's just because it started to get kind of more and more

33
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,800
you know like sense or clarity of what's happening

34
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:51,040
but the principle for doing so is to be simple keep it simple

35
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,120
so ideally you would take a simple posture

36
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:05,199
and sitting upright literally or metaphorically

37
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:10,279
and gently closing your eyes

38
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:23,120
and if it seems too too complicated take some deep breaths and you don't you don't have to but

39
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:30,399
if you can take some deeper breath in a simple way that's appropriate for you and your body

40
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:36,959
your lungs partly as a ritual of

41
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:44,759
simplification just being here for this body this place

42
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:51,199
maybe a longer exhale can partly be

43
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,800
letting go of the complexity of

44
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:03,760
there and then past and future exhaling into now

45
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,760
here

46
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,600
letting the breathing return to normal

47
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:36,800
there can be a continued simplification process that as you exhale

48
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,839
to relax your body

49
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,759
relaxing the body sometimes relax the mind

50
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,839
relaxing the body sometimes relax the heart

51
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,880
relax the muscles of the face

52
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,800
softening in the belly

53
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,839
softening the shoulders

54
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,079
and then the question for each of you is

55
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,320
what would it be like for you to be simply here

56
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,839
that kind of simplicity doesn't need anything to change

57
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,959
but you're simple with how things are for you

58
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:15,558
and maybe it has a process of simplifying

59
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:22,959
maybe it's enough just to breathe with what's happening

60
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,558
breathing in and breathing out

61
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,919
so

62
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,760
having it be the question of the meditation session

63
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:02,799
or the word simple simply being with what is

64
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,600
simply breathing with what is

65
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:15,840
simply breathing allowing yourself to be simple

66
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,919
allowing yourself to allowing things to simplify

67
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,559
here and now

68
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,339
[Music]

69
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,008
[Music]

70
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,059
[Music]

71
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:16,680
and then coming to the end

72
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,318
coming to the end of this sitting

73
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:34,079
to let the world come back in

74
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:42,160
allow yourself to remember

75
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:49,200
the rest of your life today people in your life

76
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:53,680
in your community and your neighbors and

77
00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:01,839
family and circles of connection that we have to people that we know and

78
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:04,319
don't know

79
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:16,000
and to imagine that the simplicity of your

80
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,119
kindness simplicity of your care

81
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:27,880
travels in unseen ways out into the world

82
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:33,760
and then it begins with looking upon others

83
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,760
kindly

84
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:50,559
to see if you can look now onto your world kindly

85
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:59,920
and wish that in the scene in unseen ways that your kindness can travel

86
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:06,000
that your well-wishing follows those channels

87
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:13,520
those currents and wish well-being for this wider world

88
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:20,240
that we live in wish it and also

89
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:25,800
offer a little bit of yourself behind that wish

90
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,558
that you yourself will offer

91
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:41,760
some way to contribute to the welfare and happiness of others even if it's the smallest possible way

92
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:55,440
may all beings be happy may all beings be peaceful

93
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:01,039
may all beings be safe

94
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:07,839
may all beings everywhere be free

95
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:35,319
okay

96
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:22,240
so hello everyone and welcome nice to have you here

97
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:29,359
and uh hopefully it's also nice for these those of you who are here that it's nice nice to be with people

98
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:37,839
and uh some of us it's been an unusual thing to do to welcome and for those of you on youtube

99
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:43,119
i hope that someday we could be together someday you'll have maybe

100
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:48,559
far away you'll visit come here time see we have people who do that periodically

101
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:55,119
they it used to be before the pandemic seemed like almost every sunday someone would come up and say i'm visiting i've been

102
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:59,838
listening for a long time so it's not very nice

103
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:08,359
so the topic for today is

104
00:50:08,359 --> 00:50:14,960
a little bit following up in a talk i gave maybe four or five weeks ago on sunday

105
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:20,800
that was in preparation for the seven a.m sittings i was doing which was uh

106
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:25,920
focusing on these different asp basic aspects of instructions for

107
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:32,319
mindfulness meditation that we teach here and

108
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:37,040
at that time i said that uh something like that

109
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:42,480
that the basic instructions are not only basic for beginners

110
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:49,680
but they're also basic for people who would like to consider themselves advanced

111
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:56,160
and for those who are in between the two that the basic instructions of the

112
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:02,079
practice is the same in fact the buddha when he talked about

113
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:08,880
this kind of thing he said that before the first

114
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:15,520
level of first experience of realization the first level of awakening that people can experience

115
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:22,079
and after the practice is the same that what what we're doing the basic practice

116
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:27,359
doesn't change and so in a sense if in order doing the

117
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:32,400
practice it doesn't matter whether you're enlightened or not

118
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:39,280
uh it's still the same practice and he even goes so far as to say when people become fully enlightened even

119
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:45,920
buddhas they still do the same practice

120
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:52,480
for their in order to be able to be at ease in this world call it a pleasant abiding here and now

121
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:59,599
and also to encourage other people to practice

122
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:06,240
so the practice is the same before and after enlightenment isn't that kind of nice so you don't have to worry about

123
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:14,480
enlightenment when you're practicing because you know what god is going to do you you have to do the practice anyway

124
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:21,200
be warned after you do it and uh but it does you just it does some some

125
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:26,319
good at the practice and uh uh

126
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:31,520
when when when someone has a certain degree

127
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:36,880
clarity of letting go of releasing is something that's been

128
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:42,160
they've been attached to for a long time and it's clear enough and strong enough

129
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:47,359
then after that they have a reference point for the practice that's different so the

130
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:52,400
practice is the same but the reference point for the practice changes

131
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:59,599
and then the ancient language the language is um well now uh what the practice is based

132
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:04,880
on this reference point and there are three reference points

133
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:11,040
that they talk about that can happen and uh and this is where the difficulty of

134
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:16,160
translating words from an indic language to english

135
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:21,520
because the words in india are really rich i mean there's a long

136
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:28,079
history of it and and i think there are inspiring words in not just in indian buddhism but in

137
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:32,960
indian language even to the modern world sometimes

138
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:41,119
they're rich in association whereas when you take and translate it literally into english

139
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:46,800
most of people who only know english are not going to feel oh wow yeah this is

140
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:51,839
cool this is wonderful they're going to go what what

141
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:59,599
you know sometimes at the best of it right it could be different so um i'll tell you the words in pali

142
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:05,200
the indic language first and you most of you won't have any mean any sense of this but some of you might have an

143
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:10,640
indian background so um it's um

144
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:16,240
v becca v raga

145
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:22,000
and niroda so the practice becomes based on those

146
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:28,000
three viveka v raga niroda

147
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:35,520
so uh so the way that they translated usually into english that does not come to inspire you i think maybe maybe you will

148
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:43,040
i shouldn't be speaking for you so maybe you'll be really jazzed to hear this

149
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:50,799
seclusion dispassion and cessation

150
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,680
is that kind of okay or is that like wow you know you're paying attention like this is like fantastic

151
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:03,599
seclusion i can't wait more seclusion the pandemic has been

152
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:08,720
good not good you know that hasn't been long long enough let's go really do it

153
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:16,079
it just justifies you know the pandemic seclusion so so so um

154
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:21,599
so i don't think it really works in english to get a sense of how inspiring this is

155
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:28,000
and to hear that after some level of spiritual maturity in buddhism your practice gets based on those three

156
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:33,200
i think in english speakers doesn't really work but i think that what might work that i

157
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:39,760
think is not a literal translation but i think is a fair translation for these three terms

158
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:47,200
is independence

159
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:53,200
freedom and peace that i think in english has some people

160
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:58,960
have some people even have emotional relationship to those two those three and that they speak a little bit more to

161
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:04,240
people you know in english speaking maybe grew up in an english-speaking culture

162
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:09,839
and uh and some of those words you know they're quite powerful united states

163
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:16,559
and then when i when i was growing up there was a party i think it still exists right the peace and freedom party

164
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:22,160
and uh and then independence i mean maybe there's problems sometimes because

165
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:27,599
it lends itself to uh you know sometimes it aligns itself with the kind of

166
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:34,240
individualism that is that is selfish whereas you know to be too independent

167
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:40,880
from everything else and just be myself and mine so uh but independent you know this

168
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:47,760
country is like the united states is kind of you know it's like one of the

169
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:55,119
almost religiously politically religiously political ideals you know in my independence also

170
00:56:55,119 --> 00:57:00,160
it has it but it you know it's a beautiful thing sometimes i've thought that this word

171
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:07,119
viveka that i'm translating here as you know the seclusion i'm translating as independence i've also i like the term

172
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:12,799
english word autonomy and in sometimes

173
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:18,240
to give people the autonomy to make their own medical decisions in this country is a really i mean it's a

174
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:23,280
central feature of medical ethics and

175
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:28,880
so the seclusion is to be secluded

176
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:34,400
from attachments from being uh

177
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:40,799
enmeshed in the world of things and people and experiences and feelings

178
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:47,760
then we might have the thoughts and ideals and judgments we have and so we're secluded from that

179
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:54,400
entanglement but another way of saying is we become independent from it

180
00:57:54,400 --> 00:58:00,400
or something inside of us is independent from it something inside of us has become autonomous

181
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:06,319
autonomous from us there's an autonomy so

182
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:14,558
say you have a thought that goes through your mind and maybe it's not a wonderful thought

183
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:21,359
and then you judge yourself oh i'm a bad person i shouldn't have done that i hope there's no one mind reading here at imc

184
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:26,798
because that'd be rather embarrassing that i had that thought

185
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:33,680
that reaction is an entanglement we're caught in its web we're involved in it and reacting to it

186
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:40,160
and having preferences around it to be autonomous or to be independent

187
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:46,799
from our thinking is to see that thought arise and just see it arise and

188
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:53,200
wave as it goes by you know or not wave just let it just have no reaction to it

189
00:58:53,200 --> 00:59:00,000
because there's some place inside the place of knowing of recognition of awareness

190
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:06,319
that clearly is aware that this is happening but it doesn't pick it up it doesn't

191
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:13,520
react to it it does it's not for or against it doesn't use it to re to

192
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:19,359
define oneself oh there was a there was this terrible thought that i

193
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:25,599
am a lousy person because i had that thought as opposed to the simplicity of

194
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:33,280
look there was a that was a lousy thought wow okay lousy thoughts come lousy thoughts go

195
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:38,720
and there's no attachment so there's a seclusion there's a autonomy there's an independence from

196
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:45,200
those kinds of things that kind of thought same thing with feelings

197
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:50,720
and uh this time we'll use a positive thing just to challenge you some more

198
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:56,799
and that is um maybe there's a really happy feeling coming up

199
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:03,920
now who wants to be independent of that but they but a happy feeling comes up

200
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:10,480
and there's an autonomy we're aware of it we're present for it but there's an autonomy and independence

201
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:16,160
from the happy feeling the happy feeling is allowed to be there but we don't define ourselves by it

202
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:23,280
look at me i got it made you know i hope they notice how happy i am because now i'm a good buddhist or

203
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:29,119
something and um because heaven forbid that you're depressed because then how can you be a

204
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:34,880
good buddhist it doesn't matter what feelings are depressed happy

205
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:40,559
in this place of autonomy independence and it has a lot to do with the autonomy

206
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:46,880
independence of knowing being aware we know we there's a place inside almost

207
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:53,040
almost like a place inside where we know what's happening and i want to stress

208
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:59,838
this idea of knowing that there's not there's not shutting out the world we know

209
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:06,240
and the knowing is free the knowing is independent

210
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:12,240
so that comes to the second quality which is i translate as uh or render it

211
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:20,000
as as freedom so independence is the first one or autonomy and the second one is freedom

212
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:27,119
which is usually translated as dispassion but what a dispassion means in the ancient language is no longer

213
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:33,599
having attachments and uh the clinging and uh

214
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:41,119
and uh it's kind of the word raga which translates as passion here has some of the negative connotations

215
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:48,480
that we can have sometimes in english around the word passion um you know there's sometimes having too

216
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:54,480
much passion you know you have passion for his anger whoa please

217
01:01:54,480 --> 01:02:00,240
that's not good or passion for money or passion for status or wealth we might talk that way sometimes

218
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:05,920
in california maybe i don't know where else in english-speaking world and the passion is kind of considered all good

219
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:11,760
you're supposed to have on your passion for life so to talk about this passion it kind of

220
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:17,359
doesn't quite work in this kind of in in the new fashion used to mean suffering in the

221
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:24,720
old days that's from latins suffer that the passion of christ was the suffering of christ

222
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:29,920
so uh but so but freedom and its freedom from uh

223
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:35,839
from uh clinging from grasping greed it's freedom from

224
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:41,520
ill will and hatred and it's freedom from delusion

225
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:46,960
and delusion has a lot to do with the projections we put on the world

226
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:54,240
and then we believe those projections and we you know there's human beings are kind of projecting machines

227
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:59,839
people you know walking and talking projectors you know we have all these ideas that we

228
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:06,240
overlay onto the world and and others so some of those are diluted

229
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:12,880
and so as we develop this independent way of knowing this autonomy of seeing of being aware

230
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:18,559
and we're no longer so enmeshed in the experience we can actually see

231
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:25,200
thoughts interpretations projections arise in the mind and we say oh that's just a projection

232
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:30,799
that's just you know who knows what that is so you guys are all wearing masks

233
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:37,119
and i can you know i bet you all have nice mustaches

234
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:44,480
yeah that's you know that's what it's you know so i would love to see your mustaches and probably some more handlebar mustaches and who knows

235
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:51,039
and i'm just seeing mustaches on you know all your faces you know because i can't see you know so

236
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:56,480
i'm making up a story so i can see mustache story arising

237
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:02,079
and it's just a story it's just an idea and i don't know you know it's so easy

238
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:08,240
to live in that story and assume that i'm seeing accurately so the more more independent we become

239
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:15,520
from this aware place that we have fantastic vantage point to see the birth the arising

240
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:22,240
of an idea and we can put a question mark behind it is it true

241
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:28,319
so this dispassion is this uh they're fading away or becoming free

242
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:33,599
from clinging so some people would say it's a little

243
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:39,440
bit you know a different way of talking about the first one but here we're talking we really feel

244
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:44,480
the freedom when we feel kind of independent

245
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:50,640
and now we feel there's freedom oh what a relief it's so great to have this freedom so great to not be caught

246
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:57,680
there's a joy there's a delight there's a sense of well-being there's an appreciation of how great that is

247
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:03,920
and the third one the nirona translated as usually technically

248
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:11,440
translated as cessation means the stopping of something it's a stopping of the agitation

249
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:18,960
so calling it peace kind of works there's a place of peace that we have because we know something about peace

250
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:24,079
in fact peace is always present

251
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:30,880
believe it or not it's just that if we're agitated we can't notice it

252
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:36,799
there's more peace in this world than there is agitation

253
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:41,920
but we don't notice it because we're caught up in our swirls and thoughts and fears and

254
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:47,039
you know ways and so when someone has reached deep

255
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:53,599
enough letting go let go something let go of their

256
01:05:53,599 --> 01:06:01,280
their self-preoccupation and let go of their clingings and attachments

257
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:06,319
uh let go enough so that agitation has abated

258
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:13,440
and they have an experience of themselves being unagitated when it's been strong enough

259
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:20,240
uh that they that it becomes ever available it's always there if you turn towards it

260
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:26,240
and see it oh it's there i might be agitated but there's also peace i might still be entangled but there's

261
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:31,280
also a place of independence where i see it that i'm entangled

262
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:38,720
i still have these these passions these attachments but i'm seeing it from a place that's not attached

263
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:45,200
so they kind of the two work together as opposed to just being completely immersed in the world of attachment

264
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:50,960
immerse the world of self definition and selfing and all that

265
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:56,960
and so at that so so the um so the practice is the same

266
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:02,960
it's a spirit mindfulness practice is very simple it's just to be present clearly for

267
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:09,440
what's happening in the moment and i like to think that this mindfulness practice has a light touch

268
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:14,880
to it there's a it's a light practice it has no weight

269
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:20,880
but i certainly add weight to it i bear down i'm trying hard i'm trying to desperately make it work i'm

270
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:27,920
trying to kind of sometimes i have to have the the bazooka approach to mindfulness you

271
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:35,920
know you know i don't like what's happening and i'm going to just blast it out of existence

272
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:41,280
i used to do that with knee pain you know like i sneak paid if i just get really concentrated i could just kind of

273
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:46,400
like go beyond it i blasted away or something i could bear down

274
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:52,799
and uh or you know his mind is so agitated like you know this is terrible i should meet this way and okay i'm

275
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:58,799
gonna really kind of be mindful of my agitated mind and not just gonna

276
01:07:58,799 --> 01:08:03,920
make it go away or blast it away so that's when there's a lot of weight a

277
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:11,839
lot of intensity and tension but the mindfulness has this very light touch that has no weight it clearly sees

278
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:18,960
clearly knows but it's not reacting but doing so learning that

279
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:24,560
i like to think that mindfulness practice is very simple we always try to keep to keep things simple

280
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:30,960
so being aware thinking i'm thinking just thinking

281
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:37,679
and then we do it again thinking thinking really see it and then we might see that we're tense

282
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:44,640
around our thoughts we see tense we see we have preferences around thinking preference

283
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:50,560
see that we're recoiling from our thoughts oh rick this is recoiling

284
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:55,758
and and then we say you know then then we notice oh i'm breathing you know

285
01:08:55,759 --> 01:09:01,679
in addition to all these thoughts i'm having oh it's just breathing and then there might be a choice i think

286
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:07,359
that rather than thinking about these things what if i just stay with my breath

287
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:14,080
and just stay and you can stay two or three breaths that was nice and then my mind wanders off

288
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:20,520
at some point you notice that the mind wanders off and then it's just a wandering of mind

289
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:26,880
and then there's breathing again breathing in and breathing out breathing in and bringing out and then now i can

290
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:33,199
stay longer with their breath and and then it occurs to me you know if i kind of relax in my torso and my belly

291
01:09:33,199 --> 01:09:39,040
i think i can stay with the breath longer and so we stay longer and longer and so

292
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:46,838
slowly things kind of come together and at some point this process of

293
01:09:46,839 --> 01:09:52,719
simplification comes to a place where something releases something let's go enough

294
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:58,640
something quiet enough or stills enough that we discover this place or is no no

295
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:05,199
that place is not really the right language we discover something that feels

296
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:10,960
independent free and peaceful

297
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:18,800
wow now one option then is to cling to that i want that more of that i'll hold on to

298
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:26,719
this so then you then the simple practice of mindfulness you notice wanting

299
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:33,600
tension headache arising because of peace and freedom

300
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:38,880
you know then um you know how much loss of peace that happens as we cling

301
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:44,000
and want more of the peace and try to make it come back or something so we learned how to learn all these

302
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:50,400
tricks of the mind we learn what the mind does to all this that makes it more complicated than it needs to be

303
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:57,360
but you know if we come together and we practice and so so someone who has some

304
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:02,480
level of maturity in buddhism the practice is the same as someone

305
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:09,360
who's a beginner but they have this reference point they can kind of feel or sense or know

306
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:14,960
or remember that there's this

307
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:21,760
potential this capacity to know well well the in the knowing there's

308
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:27,158
this independence freedom in this piece

309
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:32,239
and it's and so the practice with the practice of mindfulness is the same it's just a

310
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:38,000
reference point for it the support for it the context for doing it shifts so

311
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:43,920
that's that's the big change and so sometimes it said that um

312
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:50,719
and when you do mindfulness practice little slogan that says it's not seeing something new but seeing

313
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:56,960
in a new way so it's not necessarily that we live in a world and see the world differently

314
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:04,239
but we see with these eyes or with perception that doesn't um cling

315
01:12:04,239 --> 01:12:09,520
we see with these eyes that it feels independent it's not enmeshed

316
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:14,880
with or tangled with so it's independent we see with perceived with a capacity

317
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:20,480
that's there's just freedom in the being being with something not caught in it

318
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:26,960
and there's peace rather than agitation as we see the eyes that see are calm

319
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:34,239
as opposed to darting around and you know being afraid or something or wanting

320
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:39,280
and so uh and so that's a that's that's the big

321
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:46,320
shift and um and then you have you begin you have some hint of that

322
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:53,040
it feels traces of that and and then this is to be appreciated and valued

323
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:58,239
some people don't hear that message and so they just think it's always the same practice

324
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:03,280
and so they will keep focusing on what's happening in the moment

325
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:08,719
not in understanding that how they focus how they're aware

326
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:14,640
is actually more important than what they're aware of you have to be aware of something

327
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:22,880
in this world of ours usually as we go about our life but how we're aware of it and how we are

328
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:28,400
be independent free and and peaceful

329
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:35,679
and if it can't be which it often isn't can hell you know that

330
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:40,800
be independent free and peaceful and you keep stepping back you keep

331
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:48,320
saying where can i find that place where can i can i step back and just see okay this is how it is

332
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:56,159
so in terms of mindfulness meditation then it's always like when we actually do meditation it's always the same

333
01:13:56,159 --> 01:14:02,239
practice but the practice what we're aware of also shifts as we practice

334
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:07,440
if there's a simplification process that goes on and the buddha talked about this

335
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:14,080
simplification process that leads us to simpler and simpler and simpler and

336
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:19,199
then we get turned inside out and this is my language inside out

337
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:24,400
so that we can when we come back into the world we're back

338
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:32,320
in the world in a simply this simple way uh but we're free

339
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:39,840
and so again it's not a rejection of the world it's a kind of a learning how to be in the world in a whole different way

340
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:46,159
so this there's a one there's one uh discourse that's called the lesser discourse on emptiness

341
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:51,280
which i think i should be trying to translate the lesser discourse on emptying

342
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:56,400
because there is a process of simplifying simplifying that goes on so i wanted to

343
01:14:56,400 --> 01:15:02,560
give you a little try to do a little example of this so this morning before i came down to

344
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:06,639
imc um

345
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:14,400
my mind was thinking about being here at imc this morning you know we had this covet protocol and

346
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:19,760
i'm going off to teach retreat today and so i had to get some things from here i had to want to be here early enough just

347
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:26,560
make sure that everything was in place there was some my responsibilities here had to be fulfilled take care of things before i

348
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:32,480
left and um and then there was this uh talk i was supposed to give and

349
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:39,040
who's going to come and do i have the right mask and you know and it's a i was a kind of it was i was comfortable

350
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:44,719
and peaceful enough about it but my mind was in this complicated world thinking ahead planning ahead what i have to do

351
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:50,880
with a list of things and and that was the complicated world i was living in kind of a little bit coming down here

352
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:56,800
once i came here i didn't have to be thinking about what am i going to do tonight when i get to imc

353
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:02,960
i was at imc and so now i just went around started taking care of the things i had to do

354
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:08,320
and i still was thinking ahead a little bit you know what's next and i have time to do everything and

355
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:13,760
and so but i was you know then it was much it was simpler just doing them i was here and

356
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:20,320
and just you know it was just a simpler world than the complicated projections of that

357
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:27,520
and so i was taking care of things it was nice and then uh at some point i could meditate with all of you

358
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:34,000
and then you know then okay things a lot of things were taken care of and yeah there are things to do afterwards as well but

359
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:40,800
now i don't have to think about that anymore and now i could feel that i'm still the momentum of having all those thinking

360
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:47,920
was still going on but that momentum just feels like energy a little agitation little tightness someplace in my chest

361
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:54,480
it's okay i'll just breathe with it and be with it and feel it and and then i could feel there started

362
01:16:54,480 --> 01:17:00,560
to be a shift and my thinking got quieter and i started i stopped thinking about

363
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:05,840
imc and the tasks i had to do and i started in fact even after the eyes closed the

364
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:12,000
fact that i was even sitting in imc in this building kind of receded occasionally had thoughts about when do

365
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:17,760
i have to ring the bell should i look at the clock

366
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:24,320
i finally did and i was late and um

367
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:30,320
and so um you know so a little bit things came through but things got simpler and simpler and then and then

368
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:35,600
after a while i could feel the shift inside and and uh there it came i kind of dropped

369
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:40,719
into my body and it was more with my body and the simplicity of just breathing and there

370
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:46,719
was very little thought going on just breathing and simple and that process if it continued it

371
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:51,920
could get more and more simple and you know after a while i've had you know something maybe the breathing would have

372
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:57,280
kind of got quieter and calmer that i couldn't even feel the breathing and it was just more feeling sensations

373
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:02,320
in my body after a while sometimes when i meditate the sense of the boundaries of the body

374
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:10,239
the sense of it being in a body as a bounded thing it disappears and the body just feels porous to the environment or

375
01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:17,199
you know boundary-less almost there were times when i've my body's disappeared in meditation and

376
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:23,760
i i kind of felt so much like i didn't i was i was invisible and i when the first times it happened i

377
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:30,800
opened my eyes to make sure i was still here yep it hadn't gone anywhere

378
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:36,080
but there's simplification simplifications implication that goes on

379
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:42,000
and one of the and then it's not valuable just to have it that simple except that it's kind of relaxed

380
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:49,840
and calm what's valuable is what it teaches us about non-clinging he said oh because if i was cl you know

381
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:56,800
when it's more complicated it tends to be more clinging more attachment and stuff but you kind of all those get shed and get quieter quieter

382
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:03,360
and it takes a lot to trust have this deep trust that it's okay to let go the things we're attached to let

383
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:11,360
go in terms of meditation let go of thinking about it being concerned about it it takes a lot of uh

384
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:17,600
love and care not to criticize yourself if you can't let go

385
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:23,760
and you know your mind is just taking swirling and whirling by itself and probably that's a time we probably need

386
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:29,280
a lot of compassion and care and love and kindness and generosity and

387
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:35,600
and trust it's okay and that trusting it's okay to be agitated

388
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:42,560
is a great help for getting calm so this trusting in finding finding finding ourselves

389
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:49,199
and so there as ways to trust and relax and just trust the present moment just this enough just to be alive in the present

390
01:19:49,199 --> 01:19:55,280
moment breathing and being at some point you get a sense of

391
01:19:55,280 --> 01:20:01,360
independence we get a sense of freedom we get a sense

392
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:08,239
of peace and if that experience is uh impactful enough strong enough

393
01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:14,159
some remnant of it some traces of it some memory of it remains there

394
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:19,520
so we so and then the buddha said this is when this this course lesser discourse and

395
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:24,639
emptiness you go through this whole process of emptying simplifying becoming less

396
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:29,840
and then he takes us back into the world and he it's as if

397
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:35,199
it seems like he's going to more and more reified sublime kind of meditation

398
01:20:35,199 --> 01:20:41,040
states but then he says that it kind of basically says and the most

399
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:46,560
ultimate the really the most ultimate thing is to

400
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:53,040
be back in the world with hearing seeing tasting and touching

401
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:59,840
being aware of your thoughts what goes on in the mind just being in the world

402
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:05,840
any clinging and then you're just aware that your

403
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:12,159
practice is the same aware of your thoughts your what you see what you hear what you feel what you sense what you

404
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:17,760
taste what you're thinking what you're feeling you know all these things are still there

405
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:22,079
but then there's a different reference point

406
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:30,719
so it's possible that some of you already have a reference point for that

407
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:37,199
maybe something happened for you time in your life there was independent outside of meditation

408
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:44,159
maybe you were in some setting some situation where you had some profound experience of

409
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:49,760
being at peace being at home being at ease some people have it

410
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:54,800
in a natural setting in a park or by the ocean or in the mountains or something

411
01:21:54,800 --> 01:22:01,920
some people have it with other people sometimes in lovemaking some people will have that without experience

412
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:10,320
some people's listening to music you know in some kind of nice way maybe at home alone or some people it's through

413
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:15,440
playing music or dance or exercise or or

414
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:20,960
having a good nap and waking up a peaceful setting

415
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:26,800
so you know i i you know so many different ways but maybe if you've had some kind of maybe you've had some

416
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:32,719
experience an experience that i had a number of experience a few experiences as a child

417
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:38,000
growing up that kind of remained for me kind of like as a touchstone

418
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:43,040
and one of them was it was um we had this i guess a relatively small

419
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:49,120
dining room table and sometimes i would take these white bed sheets that we have

420
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:56,239
and put it over the the table and then i was little kid so i would crawl underneath inside

421
01:22:56,239 --> 01:23:02,080
and the light from the sun would be coming into the kitchen and the light was so sublime beautiful

422
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:09,760
and clear and kind of i don't know clean or something coming through the white sheet and i'd feel so cozy and

423
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:14,480
safe from the world protected secluded

424
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:22,080
and and it's such a nice way and i just like to spend i still feel it

425
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:28,560
in my body this physical sense of kind of well-being that came from that kind of

426
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:34,480
way of being and the buddha also had a childhood

427
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:39,840
story like that that wasn't under the kitchen table but it was a

428
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:45,199
similar kind of childhood experience that became his reference point

429
01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:52,320
for how he then followed followed the path to his awakening

430
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:59,840
so maybe you have a reference point already maybe something happened to you maybe something from when you were five

431
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:04,880
i think that's how old i was maybe with the kitchen thing

432
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:11,679
and uh some some reference point for what we're talking about here so that when you practice you that reference

433
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:16,800
point is close by it's kind of like a little reminder or a little

434
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:23,920
uh you know pointer to oh that's possible that's a way of being with this

435
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:29,840
as opposed to when i was in japan and the zen monasteries

436
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:35,360
sometimes the abbot would bark like a drill sergeant

437
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:42,719
concentrate concentrate concentrate as if your head's on fire

438
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:47,760
die die now

439
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:53,920
you know if i took that as the only reference point for the attitude for how

440
01:24:53,920 --> 01:25:00,480
to sit and meditate i probably would have given myself a headache

441
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:06,560
and so you know some people grew up with taskmasters teachers or parents or somebody that kind of

442
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:11,600
imbued a certain kind of attitude that became became the reference point

443
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:17,440
for how to be that not so not so healthy so

444
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:22,960
i think what buddhism is suggesting is that there is a way a

445
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:29,360
healthy way to have reference points of experiences

446
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:36,000
we've had in life that are really healthy and wholesome and good

447
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:41,280
and not try to desperately have it again engineer it again

448
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:48,000
but to kind of um intuit it or kind of remember the quality of the mind the

449
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:53,199
attention the heart so that when you start doing mindfulness practice

450
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:58,320
you that's kind of the tone that's the feeling that's the way

451
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:04,719
that we this light touch in which we use mindfulness that the mindfulness the attention is

452
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:10,400
somehow somehow you know oriented a little bit

453
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:16,320
to be that way or oh it's like a north star where it's like a reminder

454
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:23,840
you don't have to be so tense you don't have to be trying so hard you don't have to be so

455
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:29,840
confused to confuse mindfulness with uh judgments

456
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:35,679
with preferences just because it's okay to be simple

457
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:42,159
it's okay to be really simple and i think it's good and then i'll end

458
01:26:42,159 --> 01:26:47,760
by saying that it's a beautiful thing to

459
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:53,840
be be independent free and peaceful

460
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:59,840
because then there's generosity in our way of being with the world

461
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:07,120
a particular generosity and that is the generosity of uh granting everything else its

462
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:14,560
freedom so they were with someone we're not meeting them with

463
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:22,880
them you know being entangled with them or them needing them to be a certain way or wanting them to be a certain way or

464
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:28,960
or imposing upon them our agitation or our agendas

465
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:34,719
we can do being able to be with someone fully and kindly and presently

466
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:42,000
with the degree of independence so they can be independent

467
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:47,840
with freedom our inner freedom so that we we're not

468
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:53,120
complicating their life and taking their freedom away so that we are

469
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:58,880
uh peaceful so that there's a possibility for them to be peaceful our agitation is not necessarily

470
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:05,600
agitating them and that's true with people it's true with things and animals and beings and

471
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:13,040
everything we grant everything it's freedom isn't that nice

472
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:18,719
in the end maybe you don't get liberated maybe you've liberated everything from

473
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:24,719
you and that's your gift

474
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:31,120
so thank you all very much for today and uh

475
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:37,679
and then we will so next week max erdstein is coming to speak

476
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:43,280
and uh very happy to have him come and

477
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:50,400
be here and i'll be back the following week and uh and then the week after that

478
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:56,639
matthew bryn silver will come and give the talk here in person so i don't know if any of you will sign up but to come for that

479
01:28:56,639 --> 01:29:02,960
but and then and then i want to say that um

480
01:29:03,679 --> 01:29:08,800
depending on what direction this uh covet infections go

481
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:14,560
if it goes in a good direction then we'll probably start we'll change a little bit the registration

482
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:20,320
what we do here maybe have a few more people come on sundays or or

483
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:26,480
we might change something we might change the sunday schedule a little bit so that the first sitting starts at 8 30 rather than

484
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:32,320
at eight so some people might want to come then because it's a little bit later

485
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:37,760
and so you have to be sure you read you all get the announcement i guess to sign up

486
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:43,199
and so you have to be sure you you read that that's where we'll explain how it changes i think the beginning of each

487
01:29:43,199 --> 01:29:47,679
month will probably change what we're doing

488
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:54,080
and then those of you on youtube if you live locally in order to get that email with instructions about how to come here

489
01:29:54,080 --> 01:30:00,400
in person you have to register your covet card to show us that you're vaccinated and you'll find that information on the

490
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:09,320
what's new on imc website so thank you very much everyone
