1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,439
so

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,519
the topic for this week is uh

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,280
what in pali is called

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,039
chitta sankara c-i-t-t-a

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,439
s-a-n-k-h-a-r-a

6
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,980
and it's often translated as mental

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,199
[Music]

8
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,960
formations sometimes mental dispositions

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,640
sometimes mental constructs

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,559
for this week i kind of been using the

11
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,520
expression mental activities

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,239
and it's those activities of the mind

13
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:44,960
which are

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,800
planning creating uh

15
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,320
imagining actively thinking about things

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,079
so a simple perception of

17
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,280
something uh seeing a wall across the

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:00:59,920
hall

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,559
the room here that wouldn't necessarily

20
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:03,760
be called an activity

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,240
that's just uh it is an activity but

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,040
it's

23
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,920
not a uh one of the formations or

24
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,680
constructions that we

25
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,119
make and what's fascinating the number

26
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,400
of things that are fascinating about

27
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,400
this idea of

28
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,799
mental formations mental constructions

29
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,720
sankaras

30
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,000
and is that one

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,200
is that many things that we

32
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,159
take to be kind of inherent or just the

33
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,600
way things are

34
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,240
turn out to be an activity of the mind

35
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,479
and so to give you one example

36
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,280
boredom when we're bored it can feel

37
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,079
like just

38
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,840
the thing that we're doing is boring

39
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,640
just this event the situation is boring

40
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,399
it is boring but in fact it's the mind's

41
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,439
activity that

42
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,320
creates the feeling the sense of boredom

43
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,000
it's a

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,640
kind of maybe even a subliminal judgment

45
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,320
evaluation

46
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,159
it's a holding oneself apart from

47
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,520
experience

48
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,640
it's uh it can be a resistance

49
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,280
it can be a loss of intimacy with

50
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,360
experience

51
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,280
and so there's all these things going on

52
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,480
in the mind

53
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,160
that construct that activate this

54
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,319
feeling the idea of boredom

55
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,400
and the idea that we're constructing it

56
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,680
where it's an where

57
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,400
we're kind of forming it making it in

58
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,920
the mind

59
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,239
uh gives us a very different orientation

60
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,440
to boredom

61
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,239
than if the situation is boredom because

62
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,319
the situation is boring the situation

63
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,519
is to blame and so we better just get

64
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,280
away or change it

65
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,440
but if we're responsible because it's an

66
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,360
activity of the mind

67
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,519
then we can practice with it and that's

68
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,560
one of the things we learn

69
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,720
through meditation is how to practice

70
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,160
with these mental formations these

71
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,800
mental

72
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,280
activities so that we're not caught in

73
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,400
them and not

74
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,519
pulled around by the nose by them but we

75
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,599
learn how to settle them or

76
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,760
become more expensive of them or freer

77
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,440
of them free of them even when they're

78
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,640
there

79
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,159
so with boredom one would turn around

80
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,120
the attention 180 degrees from the

81
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,560
situation that's boring

82
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,239
whatever it might be it's internal

83
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,599
external

84
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,840
and have the attention really look at

85
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,840
the boredom itself

86
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,599
and look it right in the eye and say

87
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,360
boredom i see you

88
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,120
and feel it and be with it and

89
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,440
experience it

90
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,879
and to learn how to kind of dissipate

91
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,560
the boredom because we really

92
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,640
see it clearly is very empowering

93
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,400
because it shows us that we don't have

94
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,840
to be the victim

95
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,720
of our own mental activities and that's

96
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,159
one of the great good news

97
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,040
of this buddhist teaching is that so

98
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,720
much of our suffering

99
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,200
has a relationship to the activity of

100
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,720
our mind

101
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,040
and and whereas we can't necessarily

102
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,080
change

103
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,879
always the situation in the world we can

104
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,439
we have some care and attention to

105
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,000
shifting how the mind is constructing

106
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,080
these ideas and concepts and

107
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,560
even constructing ideas of self that we

108
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,319
have

109
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,959
so it's a phenomenally good news if we

110
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,479
have the mindfulness and attention

111
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:17,919
stability to really see

112
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,840
how this works and um

113
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,720
and so mental activities to really see

114
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,080
it that way and learning

115
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,600
to tranquilize it calm them relax them

116
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,960
and now this tranquil mind

117
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,639
is considered in the buddhist tradition

118
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,199
to be a beautiful quality

119
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,040
so tranquilizing the mind is not just

120
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,320
becoming numb

121
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,880
not just it's not becoming numb at all

122
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,960
it's not becoming kind of less than

123
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,360
it actually begins tapping into

124
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,160
something that's uh really wondrous

125
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,360
amazing uh about what's available

126
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,199
inside that can arise with

127
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,080
this idea of a mind that's very tranquil

128
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,199
clean

129
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,880
transparent smooth easy

130
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,160
and and this points to uh

131
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,400
one of the problems in the english

132
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,000
language translating

133
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,680
the word sankara as formations or even

134
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,039
other activities

135
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,960
because uh some of those are just

136
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,320
uninspired

137
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,240
mental formations is like what is that

138
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,400
and it's kind of uninspired translation

139
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,000
mental activities maybe means a little

140
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,160
bit more but i don't think it has too

141
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,560
much

142
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,759
inspiration value in it i believe that

143
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,240
in the

144
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,240
in the indian context ancient indian

145
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,759
context the word

146
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,520
sankara that we're translating as

147
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,880
formations

148
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,800
had very positive associations

149
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,039
and and one of the early indian

150
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,240
associations

151
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,560
was it's a word that was used in the

152
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,440
pre-buddhist

153
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,000
brahmanical traditions to describe

154
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
sacred rituals

155
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,039
and in fact sankara sometimes is

156
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,800
it means to make something sacred

157
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,639
and at least that's what the dictionary

158
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,039
definition sometimes has

159
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,639
and and so this idea of of

160
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,240
of something sacred uh a ritual which is

161
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,160
uh maybe for some people very

162
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,639
heartwarming and a deep connection

163
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,759
has a very different idea than um

164
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,199
than just you know mental activities

165
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,440
because this inner this mental

166
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,520
activities of the mind

167
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,960
it um it's also it's it's a it's the

168
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,720
quality of the mind that makes things

169
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,120
and prepares things or constructs kind

170
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,759
of our

171
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,319
sense of self and universe and ideas and

172
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,120
all that

173
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,240
but as that gets quieter that movement

174
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,560
of activity mental activities

175
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,680
can have a quality of sacredness

176
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,479
reverence

177
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,599
wonder but also my favorite word is

178
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:52,720
beauty

179
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,160
which is a translation of a word in pali

180
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,680
kaliyana that is often translated as

181
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,039
good

182
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,720
and one of the places where it's

183
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,479
translated as good

184
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,919
is in discussions about karma karma

185
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,280
means action and the primary action that

186
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,160
we're dealing with

187
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,479
in meditation is the mental action so

188
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,400
mental karma

189
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,000
and and sometimes it's translated that

190
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,520
there's three kinds of

191
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,039
there's two kinds of karma there's good

192
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,039
karma and

193
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,520
bad karma and but the word for good

194
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,120
is kaliana which its primary meaning is

195
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,400
beautiful

196
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,919
and you get a very different feeling

197
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,520
about actions

198
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,759
if you refer to them as being either

199
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,319
beautiful or not beautiful

200
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,360
and and so this idea that

201
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,400
we can have the potential in the mind

202
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,400
or having the mental activity become

203
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,160
beautiful

204
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,039
as it is much more inspiring than simply

205
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,039
calming the mental formations or being

206
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,400
are experiencing the mental formations

207
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,360
so the mental formations the the seventh

208
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:03,759
step

209
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,319
of anapanasati breathing in experiencing

210
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,120
the mental formations mental activity

211
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,879
breathing out experiencing mental

212
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,240
activity

213
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,360
happens after

214
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,840
experiencing some modicum of joy

215
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,960
well-being and happiness and meditation

216
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,039
and that's important to remember that

217
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,800
all these things are situationals

218
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,520
contextual these steps of meditation

219
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,800
and we're not we're not supposed to be

220
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,800
in a hurry to get past it

221
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,719
and if you hear instructions that you're

222
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,000
not there yet

223
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,640
just take it in and and file it away for

224
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,479
the future

225
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,719
no need to feel bad that you're not

226
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:43,919
there

227
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,680
we're all going to be cycling through

228
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,000
these 8 16 steps and be at different

229
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,440
stages at different days

230
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,680
different minutes different weeks

231
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,360
because of what's happening in our life

232
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,120
and all kinds of situations

233
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,160
so the 16 steps are always um

234
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,000
you know we're some it's kind of good to

235
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,200
think that we're always beginning in

236
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,560
step one

237
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,480
and not be in a hurry not feel like you

238
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,080
have to always be

239
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,720
following this these steps that i'm

240
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,519
going through

241
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,279
i'm going through it linearly but um

242
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,880
the trap of that is assumed that you're

243
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,279
supposed to be right coming along

244
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,680
and i'm trying my best to kind of make

245
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,440
it come alive for you but

246
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,399
i've got to trust where you are and that

247
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,480
trusting where you are

248
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,000
is part of the beauty that we're

249
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,240
developing in this practice

250
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,200
that trust and trust appreciation

251
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,480
reverence

252
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,760
care love for oneself that i can just be

253
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,240
where i

254
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,880
am and practice there and trust that

255
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,440
this

256
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,600
process will unfold this anapanasati

257
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
process is a natural process

258
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,959
in its own way will unfold for you

259
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,800
no need to be in a rush or hurry through

260
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,680
it and so this trust is part of the

261
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,880
beauty of the mind and so

262
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,720
rather than seeing mental activity

263
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,399
mental formations

264
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,000
um as neutral uninspired kind of you

265
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,880
know

266
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,079
just stuff in the mind we're touching

267
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,560
into a capacity of the mind

268
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,880
to be beautiful to be wondrous

269
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,000
to be something that's maybe borders on

270
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,839
or feels sacred and uh this is the great

271
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,480
value of this practice is to really

272
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,160
discover a rich wondrous beautiful

273
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,839
uh inner life that really can

274
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,200
inform how we live in the world

275
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,920
um i'd like to think that as we discover

276
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,399
this wondrous inner life

277
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,680
we we get turned inside out and what was

278
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,839
inside is no longer inside but something

279
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,680
that

280
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,600
that we share with the world around us

281
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,600
so mental formations so as we continue

282
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,959
next week maybe you'll keep

283
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,120
this in mind that uh we're working with

284
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,880
a capacity we have for inner beauty

285
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,000
and inner something that's wondrous

286
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,200
that lives in us for sure

287
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,720
even though some of your mental

288
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,040
activities that you're living by

289
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,040
and that kind of are you're caught in

290
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,480
the grip of and you don't even know

291
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,680
you're in the grip of some of these

292
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,920
mental activities

293
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,519
might be standing in the way for now

294
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,279
of seeing how wondrous it is on the

295
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,600
inside for you the beauty that you have

296
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,160
so thank you for today and i look

297
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,800
forward to

298
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:44,000
continuing next week you
