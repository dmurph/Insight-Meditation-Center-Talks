1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:10,040
hello and on this Monday and uh happy to be sitting here

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:17,240
and considering some Dharma topics to share with

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,119
you and uh sometimes when people sit down to

4
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:29,679
meditate they're supported by the idea that how lucky they lucky they are to

5
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:36,079
not have to do anything for a few moments that maybe life is f filled with

6
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:42,600
respon responsibilities things to do places to

7
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,920
go and for a few minutes to be able to sit and not be so

8
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:54,440
busy and it can be a phenomenal thing just to appreciate that to take that in

9
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:02,840
and the appreciation of that can be enough for some people to settle them and help them just relax let go of

10
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:09,159
everything I'd like to offer you maybe another understanding of sitting down to

11
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:14,840
meditate that I'm hoping might do have a similar effect on you maybe even a

12
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,880
better effect and that is uh that uh similar to

13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,680
the idea of forest bathing you know that now is fair it's a common enough exp uh idea that coming

14
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,880
from Japan this idea originally that would spent time in the forest to be

15
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,399
nourished to be uh by the atmosphere of the

16
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:46,920
forest uh all the different qualities that come through the forest that we almost can take in as a as a bath be

17
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:54,360
nourish us so meditation it can be

18
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:01,200
a ethics ba bath a very traditional idea in Buddhism

19
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:08,399
is that to appreciate being ethical when we

20
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,800
are and when we're sitting and meditating even if you live an unethical

21
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:22,959
life at other times and they maybe even troubled by that that when you sit down to

22
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:30,599
meditate it's a time when we are ethical we are adhering to whether we

23
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:36,440
know it or not to the five ethical precepts while we're

24
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:42,680
meditating we're not killing anyone hurting

25
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:48,239
anyone we're not

26
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:55,319
stealing we're not engaged in sexual misconduct we're not lying to others at

27
00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:01,840
least and we're not uh taking in intoxication

28
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:09,599
toxicant and I think most people don't Orient themselves that way when

29
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:15,640
they meditate if a person is unethical they might be carrying with them the guilt

30
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,799
and the heaviness and the fear and preoccupation that and the

31
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:27,519
self-criticism that that might entail but the encouragement in Buddhism

32
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:35,080
is to appreciate for these minutes that we are living a good

33
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,439
life my teacher in Burma love to talk a number of teachers in Asia talk about

34
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:45,680
how sitting and meditation fulfilled the

35
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:55,200
precepts and um so as we sit today you might consider your good

36
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:02,840
fortune that for these minutes you you are being

37
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:08,879
ethical even if it's just a pause in a more difficult

38
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:15,760
life consider yourself so fortunate that for these

39
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:23,320
minutes you're not going to actively intentionally be involved in harming

40
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:32,280
anyone and let that be a forest bathing there's something that's possible to take in in and appreciate and feel some

41
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:38,240
Joy or something that's very settling ah this is

42
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,800
good so to assume a meditation

43
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,120
posture one way I like I like to think of of the posture and

44
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,720
meditation whether's walking standing sitting or

45
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:15,600
lying down is one way or the other to assume a posture of

46
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:22,840
dignity or a posture that you're allowed to exist you're

47
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,440
allowed to show up you're allowed to be here in a full

48
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:34,680
way and certainly there's no need for these minutes to diminish

49
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:53,560
yourself gently closing your eyes and taking some long slow deep

50
00:05:53,560 --> 00:06:01,000
breaths to appreciate this moment this time

51
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,639
this opportunity to be here and present and to become

52
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,240
settled with a good fortune being able to

53
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:20,160
meditate of spending these minutes being ethical even if you're not even

54
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,720
intending to

55
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:34,199
relaxing as you

56
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,840
exhale relaxing the

57
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,520
body relaxing the

58
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,120
heart relaxing the mind

59
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:21,000
letting your breathing be normal

60
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,960
simple and relaxing the thinking mind

61
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,759
relaxing that part of the

62
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:43,120
mind that has any force in

63
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,560
it to be involved in the past or the

64
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,680
future to keep you in your thoughts

65
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,599
relaxing the thinking

66
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:28,560
mind and like Forest bathing where we're not thinking and analyzing

67
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,159
and justifying the effect that the forest has on our

68
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:40,560
all our senses we just taking in as a

69
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:48,399
paath maybe there's a way for you to do ethics

70
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:54,839
bathing where there's no need to justify it or question it

71
00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:00,240
or just the radical Simplicity of sitting meditating

72
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,279
fulfills the

73
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:16,320
precepts and to let that bathe you let that fill

74
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,240
you do let let that settle something in

75
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,240
you settling

76
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,800
any doubts or criticism you have of

77
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:50,760
yourself we are phenomenally lucky to have these

78
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:58,079
minutes of not involved in any intentional forms of harm

79
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:08,720
breathing sitting with our ethics in order for

80
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:15,720
these minutes and appreciating that bathing in

81
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
that

meditate that you're not allowing yourself to

90
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:21,120
bathe in harmful thoughts in thinking that it does not

91
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:31,040
have a good effect on you relax the thinking mind

92
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:55,399
and instead bathe in the

93
00:14:55,399 --> 00:15:01,040

00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:50,000
as we come to the end of this sitting to be able to better

117
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:58,399
appreciate the ethics the ethical good ethics of sitting and meditating

118
00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:04,320
it's good to remember or to know that the five

119
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:13,600
precepts are as ethical precepts concern Behavior how we behave the actions that

120
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,640
we do with body and mou and

121
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:29,200
speech it's easy enough to conclude that some of our thoughts might be unethical

122
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:36,919
maybe we we harm ourselves with them but that's not seen as so much as

123
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:43,960
an ethical issue as an issue of the lack of

124
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:55,200
wisdom for Behavior we want to change the behavior to stop

125
00:27:55,399 --> 00:28:03,519
harming for thoughts in the mind we want to see it with

126
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,960
wisdom and one way to see with

127
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:19,158
wisdom is to see understand have

128
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:29,960
confidence at least our behavior is not causing harm

129
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:38,440
and may it be that meditation this meditation

130
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,640
session reveals to us

131
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:53,840
how to live with ethical Behavior how ethical

132
00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:00,039
Behavior nourishes us and maybe nourishes others

133
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:10,559
and maybe that behavior supports us then to cultivate

134
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:18,399
wisdom about ourselves may all beings

135
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:25,720
benefit from our ethical Behavior may all

136
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:33,000
beings be happier safer more peaceful and

137
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:40,398
Freer that we behave according to the five

138
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:47,039
precepts and meditation teaches us

139
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:55,640
that there's freedom for

140
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:04,840
us and not picking up and engaging in unethical

141
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,039
Behavior it's not so much we have to do something it's

142
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:20,480
mostly we don't do something may all beings be happy

143

[Music]

144
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:36,278
thank

145
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:00,960
you e

146
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:39,039
so hello on this Monday and to do a new series new theme for

147
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:47,320
this uh week and maybe for the first days of next week as well that um one of the activities I've

148
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:54,799
been involved in for this month of August is um continuing with the ongoing

149
00:31:54,799 --> 00:32:00,760
project I have uh of translating and then writing

150
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:07,399
commentary or introduction to the ancient verses of the nuns poly it's

151
00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:15,200
called the terata and um people say it's uh it's

152
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,639
might be the earliest poetry that we know religious

153
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:28,639
poetry by women and uh it's reported to be the

154
00:32:28,639 --> 00:32:34,200
the verses the not the Poetry of the direct Disciples of the Buddha though I

155
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:42,639
think some of them were written later maybe by nuns in the centuries after the Buddha as well and it's a remarkable collection of

156
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:49,919
poems Buddhist poems for many reasons one of them is that uh the tremendous

157
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:55,159
confidence of these women they go through they describe some

158
00:32:55,159 --> 00:33:00,639
of them tremendous difficulties that they go through through uh the life

159
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:07,440
difficulties uh the death of their children their death of their family and

160
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:13,919
the challenges of abusive marriages and all kinds of challenges that they have

161
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:20,799
and somehow they make their way through it they become uh they practice they become nuns and they

162
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:27,279
confidently live in the world and they confidently live uh recognizing and and

163
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:32,360
uh proclaiming their full Awakening that

164
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:39,200
they the full Awakening is possible and um and uh I think this uh

165
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:46,480
this text is a celebration of people who are celebrating their the not only their

166
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:52,679
potential for awakening but their actually attainment of it and as a and

167
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:57,880
it makes has greater value when the contrast to uh the very difficult Liv so

168
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:03,200
of them lived before they became nuns so I've translated this some years

169
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:09,878
ago and uh and U it's been sitting on the shelf for some time and now I'm

170
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:18,320
writing introductions to it so hope hope to have some point be able to publish it as a book but I'm I Delight in these

171
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:25,720
some of these poems and so I wanted to share some of them with you and talk with you about some of them and uh and

172
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:31,398
this one that I'll read uh is um you'll see that there's a connection to the

173
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:40,040
guided meditation we just did those of you who are there for it and um this one uh there's nothing in

174
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:46,638
the poem that the that the person the woman is a nun it's a story earlier in

175
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:52,480
her life and um probably she became a nun later and it's it's also not clear

176
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:58,200
that she's the one who wrote it um but uh it's a dialogue between

177
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:07,960
um a woman I think a young woman here named uh pun Puna and punna is a uh is a

178
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:15,040
servant of uh a mistress who is maybe quite abusive or seemingly uh quite

179
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:22,480
ready for to punish her for not doing her job well and uh as a servant what she does

180
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:29,160
is she's a water carrier and uh there was no running water and so if there was a need for a

181
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:35,000
household especially a wealthy household maybe with to have a lot of water um it

182
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:42,079
was someone's job to go down to the river and uh pick up the water and carry it back and and maybe that had to do

183
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:50,000
happen many times during the day and it's not clear how far she had to carry it and in this poem she's going down to

184
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:56,440
the river at a time of the year when the water is quite cold and even then she had to kind of

185
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:06,359
Step into the water the cold cold water and to scoop up the cold water water and carry it back and uh she um she runs

186
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:13,119
into a Brahman who is down there a Brahman is a kind of like a

187
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:20,400
um uh a priest of the brahmanical religion and one of the central rituals

188
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:28,520
of Brahman priests is to go down to the river and uh sacred rivers and bathe and

189
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:33,960
the ritual bathing in the river was understood to be a purification right

190
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:39,520
that uh all the bad karma that they' built up uh that somehow if you go into

191
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,920
a sacred River and bathe in it that you can uh you're you're purifying yourself

192
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:53,640
of that bad karma so that's kind of the background for this poem and um

193
00:36:53,640 --> 00:37:04,160
so uh so she's speaking uh to this Brahman she says I am a water

194
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:12,560
carrier when it is cold I always have to go down to get

195
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:18,319
water I am terrified of punishment from my

196
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:25,359
mistress I am terrified of angry words but

197
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:31,280
Brahman what do you feel fear that you always go down to the

198
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:38,680
water with limbs trembling experiencing sharp

199
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:44,560
cold the Brahman replies to her somewhat politely

200
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:51,599
certainly lady punna you know the answer to what you're

201
00:37:51,599 --> 00:38:00,599
asking I am doing wholesome Karma and preventing the con consquences of evil

202
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:09,040
Deeds whether young or old whoever does evil karma is freed of evil

203
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:17,078
karma uh uh through purification by

204
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:25,280
water so then punna replies to the Brahman and this is where I the poem

205
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:30,920
becomes for me quite delightful and uh expression of a woman of confidence

206
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:38,680
speaking to a Brahman she's a servant woman um and there's a ancient India there was a quite uh uh status

207
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:45,400
differentiation more than just status there was almost like the servants were all often considered almost impure by

208
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:54,720
the natures of being servants and shouldn't interact with brahmans who are trying to be pure and um and so uh but she speaks

209
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,400
confidently and clearly and and directly to this man this Brahman and uh so these

210
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:06,520
are her words so he just told her you know what he's doing going to the river to purify

211
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:15,680
his evil Karma's evil actions she says what know nothing told and know

212
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:22,119
nothing that one is freed of evil karma through purification and

213
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:29,079
water frogs and turtles water snakes crocodiles and other water dwellers will

214
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:34,119
they go to heaven those who butcher sheep and pigs

215
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:39,800
those who fish and Hunt thieves executioners and others who do evil

216
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:45,960
would they also be freed of evil karma through purification and

217
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:53,160
water if this River carries away the evil you have done then it would also

218
00:39:53,160 --> 00:40:01,039
carry away your good Merit and you would then be out of

219
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:06,839
both what you do that brings you fear

220
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:12,000
that brings you down to the water for purification

221
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:20,040
brahen don't do it then cold water won't shock your

222
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:27,520
skin so this is the I love this this verse just don't do it so whatever you

223
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:34,560
need to be purified from if you do that you feel you have to be purified uh because of doing this evil thing don't

224
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,800
do it then you don't have to purify yourself in the river and the Brahman

225
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:47,359
replies because now he's seeing the light I entered a bad path you've led me

226
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:54,319
to the Noble Path dear lady I offer you my purification

227
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:59,960
cloak and she says keep it for your self I do not want the

228
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:09,720
cloak if you fear suffering if you dislike suffering don't do evil actions

229
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:15,960
either openly or secretly if you've done or will do an

230
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:22,440
evil action there will be no Liberation even if you run

231
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:29,680
away if you fear suffering if you dislike suffering go for Refuge to the

232
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:37,319
Buddha the dhama and the Sana and keep the ethical precepts this

233
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:43,680
will be for your benefit and the Brahman says I go for

234
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:51,280
Refuge to the Buddha dhama and S I will keep the ethical precepts this will be

235
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:56,960
for my benefit formerly I was a descendant of

236
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:05,319
the God Brahma this is a belief of brahans that they are direct descendants of this the highest God in

237
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:10,520
heaven but today I have become a true

238
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:16,440
Brahman I am now a person of wisdom learning and the three

239
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:25,359
knowledges now I have truly bathed so um uh he's saying now he

240
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:31,319
didn't become a real Brahman by learning the three brahmanical knowledges and a lot of brahmanical

241
00:42:31,319 --> 00:42:38,400
learning uh and he didn't become a true Brahman by bathing in the river physically but by going for refuge and

242
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:45,440
living ethically and that was the message of Buna to the Brahman uh living

243
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:53,440
ethically and not giving cause to needing to do purification this is the way and this is

244
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,680
the way to be bathed he understands that he takes them he takes his bathing in

245
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:06,200
the river that he does and metaphorically applies this idea to uh bathing in

246
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:14,280
ethics so uh it's a wonderful little story maybe a little Fable of um but one

247
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:20,920
of of uh I just love this directness in which buha talks to him just don't do

248
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:28,920
it and may that uh inspire all of you to to uh

249
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:34,400
bathe in the ethics good ethics of don't

250
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:42,640
do it don't be involved in Breaking the precepts and um nourish yourself bathe

251
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:50,079
yourself feed yourself bathe yourself in um your ethical

252
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:56,280
behavior and uh partly because we live in a in a western culture that's so

253
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:02,000
deeply affected by uh Freud and Yung and Psychotherapy

254
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:09,559
where we keep looking and studying at our analizing ourselves so much internally that uh it's a almost second

255
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:14,760
nature for people in the west sometimes to then apply the precepts to their

256
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:20,760
minds to what they're thinking and find that they're unethical there too and um

257
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:27,280
I think that that's isn't the orientation of Buddhism that uh that the ethics has to

258
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:34,040
with the behavior in the world we do and speak um and uh and there's not looking

259
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:39,760
at ourselves our mind in this kind of unethical way we're rather looking at it

260
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:46,680
uh through the lens of wisdom and sometimes recognizing that uh maybe

261
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:52,160
we're a bit foolish in the mind there's not enough wisdom there sometimes and

262
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:58,240
the issue there is to become wise about our thoughts our beliefs Bel how we see

263
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:03,839
ourselves and uh and rather than undermining ourselves or criticizing

264
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:11,200
ourselves or have caused to feel like we're a bad person just because of the thoughts we have and um they might be

265
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:18,680
foolish thoughts but let's become wise and then we can also bathe in

266
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:25,520
wisdom so uh this is the first poem uh commentary about it for this uh this

267
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:31,960
week and I hope that you enjoy appreciate uh these poems that I have um

268
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:41,400
given myself over to for a good number of years I've been living in these poems and thinking about them translating them

269
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,279
so thank you very much
