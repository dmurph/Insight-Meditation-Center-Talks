00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,799
so hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,560
and here the our youtube meditation begins

3
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:27,760
in the language of buddhism it arises it appears

4
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,880
and it'll be here for a period of time and then it will disappear it will

5
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:40,719
cease it'll come to an end it'll only to begin again probably tomorrow

6
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,840
and already this week the 7 am has appeared

7
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,079
and disappeared and appeared and disappeared and here appearing again

8
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:59,760
and when we hold our the hand of our mind open the mind open

9
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,240
then we can the idea is to just let the comings and goings

10
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:13,600
come and go to not prioritize one over the other

11
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,960
but prioritize the lack of clinging to any of it

12
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,880
the lack of getting caught up in any of it and so

13
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:32,240
the capacity to let go becomes the capacity to let be

14
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,000
when we don't stay involved and stay stuck we just let everything be and

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,280
and everything comes and goes in some way so

16
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:50,880
when we sit in meditation i often teach that using the breathing

17
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,159
as a default as the guide to support and they keep coming back to the

18
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,640
breathing the breathing itself is a uh

19
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,759
repeats itself the in-breath and the out breath the coming and going of inhale and exhale

20
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,959
each inhale begins it persists for a while and then it

21
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,840
disappears it's replaced by the exhale which begins

22
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,120
disappears and passes away and

23
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,519
so so one of the things we're learning and doing with breathing

24
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,959
is beginning starting to become attuned to the mind's ability to

25
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,959
receive and allow and to the comings and goings of something here

26
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,239
the breathing and at some point it isn't the mindfulness of breathing that's so

27
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:57,680
important the breathing itself though that's part of it it's uh it's the mind's ability

28
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:05,360
to just stay open and and receive the waves coming and going the arising and passing

29
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,959
of the breathings and of course what a rise in passing passes

30
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,400
are particular sensations so that how the body experiences the breathing

31
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,720
but at some point we start appreciating the inconstancy the con the constant and

32
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,959
constancy constant change of the breathing and it's getting centered on the

33
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:35,120
breathing then at some point we become more more sensitive to how

34
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,599
uh all experiences all things that we perceive all perceptions

35
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:48,879
are of the same nature they arise and they pass they come and they go they appear and they disappear

36
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:55,360
and and it isn't it isn't so much that it isn't that particular objects that we're looking at

37
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,439
for example we see the horizon pass but the perception of it

38
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:07,840
comes and goes i perceive something for a moment and then my mind goes into my thoughts thinking about it

39
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,480
i perceive something for a little while and then i'm aware of the sound outside and so we'll see this a constant moving

40
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:21,199
of perception in the mind that perception of things of everything has this nature

41
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,800
of coming and going coming and going and just as we get attuned to the coming and

42
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,320
goings or breathing in and breathing out as practice deepens we become attuned

43
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:38,000
to how perceptions of anything everything is also arising and passing sometimes

44
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,120
because the object arises in passing the sound comes and goes some thought comes and goes and

45
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:51,199
sometimes because our perception of it our focus on it arises and passes

46
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:58,800
the exception is when we get attached to something especially a thought or a feeling we get stuck on something

47
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:06,880
and we're holding on to it then that holding on obscures the nature of

48
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:13,520
anita impermanence nature of inconstancy and so if we take mindfulness and look

49
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,400
carefully at the holding the way we're stuck where we'll start seeing

50
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:27,039
that that too has a nature of inconstancy the perception of that and then it begins to loosen up the grip

51
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:33,840
of attachments begin loosening up and more and more as the grip of attachment loosens loosens up the more and more

52
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,960
the perception is open to the flow the river of change the flow

53
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,960
of things coming and going and this is the the deeper art

54
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:51,360
of sati patana so taking a assuming a

55
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,198
comfortable upright posture

56
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,400
and gently closing your eyes

57
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,919
and as you're sitting here now as your with your eyes closed

58
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:21,840
what you notice comes and goes what experiences

59
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,160
arises and passes changes

60
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:35,600
there might be things that stay for now and don't seem to change but what is changing

61
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:43,199
in your experience the coming and going of my voice

62
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,840
maybe there are sounds ambient sounds for you

63
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,080
maybe as you settle into your body

64
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:07,520
you're you perceive you're aware of different parts of your body and your perception your awareness moves around

65
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:14,639
through individual moments of knowing this and that perception in the buddhist language

66
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:21,520
is unique for everything that is perceived and so individual acts of perceptions

67
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,479
come and go depending on what we're focusing on

68
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:45,840
and settling into this more deeply taking a few long slow deep breaths

69
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,240
and relaxing on the exhale

70
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,639
softening the belly

71
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:18,080
letting your breathing return to normal and if there are there are other simple

72
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:25,319
ways that you can relax your body maybe as you exhale

73
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,160
and then settling into breathing

74
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,839
perhaps being aware of how the body experiences breathing

75
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,000
or knowing with very simple thoughts

76
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:48,480
the coming and going of breathing in the body coming and going of inhale

77
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,639
of exhale

78
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:04,399
maybe where the appearing and disappearing of the inhale the appearing and disappearing the exhale

79
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,440
massages the mind's tendency to hold on or be to

80
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:18,399
be attached to anything allowing the mind to relax and loosen up

81
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:26,440
in that rhythm of being aware of inhale and exhale

82
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,040
imagine you're sitting on a boulder

83
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:02,240
it's sticking up out of a river and the water is flowing by

84
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,839
and you sit there and let everything flow by

85
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:16,959
everything comes and goes appears and disappears everything is floating down this

86
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:25,120
large majestic river you safe on your boulder sitting

87
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:33,560
allowing things to flow by everything flows

88
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,360
so

89
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:25,760
if you look thoughts look at thoughts directly you'll see they're made up of comings

90
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:32,640
and goings get out of the way for the comings and

91
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,880
goings without being involved in thought

92
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,159
if you're not aware of things coming and going

93
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:17,200
maybe you can be aware of the way the mind is stuck on something

94
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:25,480
the way the mind is preoccupied or

95
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:34,320
holding itself at a distance from experience direct experience

96
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:44,799
and breathe with that feel that sense it sense the way that sense what gets in

97
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,399
the way of seeing change

98
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,080
maybe it's a belief

99
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:31,640
in the river of change changing experiences perceptions

100
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,720
let's go into it let yourself

101
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:47,400
become the change everything is changing everything

102
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:53,360
appears and disappears flows on and on

103
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,559
even anything that you can identify as yourself

104
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:03,519
it appears and disappears in perception

105
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:15,480
let go let go into the river of change

106
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,880
then as we come to the end of the sitting

107
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:04,278
might there be something within something tender

108
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:13,039
that is touched by the changing nature of reality

109
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,640
maybe it's some

110
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:24,960
apprehension maybe it's some joy

111
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:34,440
maybe it's some kinship feeling of this is

112
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,960
deeply connected to what's most

113
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:51,278
at home here in this world this is true

114
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:59,120
the changing nature [Music] of everything comes and goes

115
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:08,158
we share this with others some change is painful some is joyful

116
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,398
some involve sadness some involves joy

117
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:21,679
some involve relief some come with new stresses

118
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,360
we all share living in this world of change

119
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,840
and may we gaze upon the world kindly

120
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:43,360
in a friendly way offering our support our companionship

121
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:50,159
for others as they go on their journey through this difficult world

122
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:55,600
life of change may we

123
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:03,760
tap into good will wishing people well

124
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,480
may everyone be happy

125
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,320
may everyone be safe

126
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,159
may everyone be peaceful

127
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,320
may everyone be free

128
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:33,840
and may whatever we learn about freedom

129
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:41,600
help us to better support the welfare and happiness

130
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:47,720
of others may all beings be happy

131
00:29:48,700 --> 00:30:01,080
[Music]

132
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,600
uh

133
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:40,320
so today i want to offer an alternative

134
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:47,840
interpretation of the second noble truth the one that

135
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:54,480
is how this truth is taught in the ancient teachings of the buddha

136
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:01,840
the more modern one is that craving is the cause of suffering

137
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:07,120
that's the second noble truth the more common one in the ancient texts

138
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,679
is that

139
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:17,919
that the second noble truth involves seeing

140
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:23,600
the arising of suffering seeing the appearance of it

141
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:29,120
without any explanation for why it's there

142
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:36,320
the search for reasons for causes is little bit challenging at times and

143
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:43,519
sometimes we'll leave it lead us astray and it takes us away from the simplicity

144
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:49,600
of our experience in the moment there's certainly a time and place to look for causes

145
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:55,120
for why things happen it's a wise life that understands conditionality and causes

146
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:01,519
but it's also one that lends itself to thinking a lot and reflecting and analyzing

147
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:09,360
the satipatana practice moves us towards more and more really abiding and direct experience

148
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:16,320
and in direct experience the idea of cause becomes less important you can still see it sometimes in the

149
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,760
moment see oh there i was grasping at something in the moment and i saw they were suffering in

150
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:28,000
that grasping so you can see there the causality but there's another way of seeing

151
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:35,120
and that is simply to see that suffering arises and that suffering ceases it appears and

152
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:41,679
disappears and um and and the suit does emphasize this and

153
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:48,880
this insight into a rising and passing of many many things and not just suffering suffering's like the umbrella

154
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:55,200
term perhaps for all the things we become aware of we see the arising and passing of the aggregates

155
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:01,039
rising and passing of the faculties rising a passing of perceptions um

156
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:07,760
rising a passing of thoughts and um feelings

157
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:14,398
so it emphasizes arising the rising and passing of things rising and ceasing of it

158
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:21,440
and the simplicity of that experience is particularly valuable

159
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:28,079
in deep concentrated practice of sati patana in ordinary states of consciousness the

160
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:35,440
world of cause cause and effect thinking about things is an all very common phenomenon as the mind gets quieter and

161
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:42,158
quieter and quieter more more focused clearer and clearer it's not inclined to look at experience

162
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:47,599
through the lens of analyzing it and reasons and cause and

163
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,800
why and what's going to happen but become just a simple simple

164
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,760
experience of the moment of the river of change flowing by

165
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:05,119
so i want to say again what i've said before that coming at the as the last exercise of

166
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:11,119
the satyapatana sutta i think we can assume that this

167
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:17,119
exercise on the four noble truths is represents a deep level of practice

168
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:23,760
a mature level of practice it's not easy to come into this as a beginner this level of seeing this kind

169
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:31,200
of insight and we get a sense of that from the refrain that we've looked at the refrain for each exercise

170
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:38,560
talks about this very thing seeing each of the things we're looking at the phenomena of the body phenomena

171
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:44,320
feelings phenomena associated with the mind and see it arise and pass

172
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:50,079
and um and the the aggregates the the

173
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:56,720
the hindrances the fetters the seven factors of awakening all those at some point what we're

174
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:02,640
seeing is they're rising and passing that's what's emphasized in the refrain

175
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:09,440
and um and sometimes you start seeing it so quickly that the text talks about first it says

176
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:17,200
seeing arising seeing ceasing and then it talks about seeing arising and ceasing all the where

177
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:24,240
rising and ceasing happens very fast in deep subtle practice the moment-to-moment experience of

178
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:30,240
direct experience comes and goes and so when we when suffering arises in

179
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:36,000
that kind of context it's not overwhelming it's not so difficult because

180
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,359
um it doesn't persist it comes and it goes it might we appear

181
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:49,119
quickly there might be disorientation that happens when we live in a world where every we expect things to be constant we

182
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:55,839
want to hold on to certain things for it be oriented and know ourselves and know the world around us know we're safe by

183
00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:01,480
knowing like certain ideas are settled and so there might be a period of

184
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:06,839
disorientation that some people feel as the mind gets quieter and quieter in

185
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:12,000
meditation and the usual ideas usual ideas of self the things we're holding

186
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,480
on to depending on are no longer available because they had to be constant

187
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:24,079
some level of constancy in order to hold on to them but when things come and go there's a

188
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:31,599
whole different way that we're asked to relate to it so to see the arising of suffering

189
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:38,320
is to see its contingent nature see it's not permanent it's not solid

190
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:44,000
we can see that it arose from a time and place situation where it wasn't didn't

191
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,119
exist before it arose and if you see it cease

192
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:55,520
we know that it comes a time where it's no longer to be there and that begins to loosen up the grip of

193
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:03,040
the mind or the resistance of the mind the fear of the mind that we have about we just start appreciating that

194
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:10,000
there's the emptiness of it all the freedom of it all the the lack of um that this is not something to be

195
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,800
worried about or or upset about or cling to and this deeper deeper seeing of things

196
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,920
arise and ceasing the inc constant and constancy

197
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:27,839
begins to loosen up the grip of our attachments some of the deepest

198
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:33,200
attachments we have we had to let go of a lot of attachments to get to this level of meditation

199
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:38,320
a lot of preoccupations are fall away as we're getting concentrated and settled

200
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,760
and what's left is some of the deepest attachments attachment to self

201
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:52,320
even attachment to life itself and um those are all ways of interfering

202
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:58,480
with the flow of change it's becoming the flow of change and so as things begin to loosen up

203
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:05,680
massaged relaxed let go of then um then there is more then

204
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:12,320
then at some point there can be a more something in the mind gives away

205
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:17,839
it's uh maybe a little bit like say you're standing in the river at a

206
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:24,160
real river and the river is just flowing and you're walking deeper and deeper in the river and you can it's not dangerous

207
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:30,560
this the current you know how to swim and and you can just feel more and more the

208
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,480
river flowing against your body as you go d walk out into the river deeper and deeper and deeper

209
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,680
and then um and uh and just feel like more like you're very light you're floating it

210
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:47,599
feels very comfortable but it gets deeper and deeper until you get to a place where it's deep enough

211
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:54,560
that you're not touching the bottom and suddenly the current the gentle current picks you up and starts carrying

212
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:00,240
you down the river as we let go into more and more the flow of

213
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:05,599
change there comes a time where the bottom's not there

214
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:10,800
and we can start becoming carried in the current carried in the stream and that's

215
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:19,359
the meaning of the the the the buddhist idea of of stream entry

216
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:25,520
the word for stream sota means current it's entering the current

217
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:30,560
and it can be seen the current of change that's always here i'd like to

218
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:37,200
think of it the current of non-clinging non-grasping not holding on to anything

219
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:42,240
but then beginning to flow in a dharma current the dharma flow

220
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,920
that starts flowing through us because it's the f it's the dharma current that we're in

221
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:54,480
is the current of non-clinging non-grasping and this begins to carry us in on a

222
00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:01,920
dharmic path to dharmic life and so uh this uh the third noble truth

223
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:09,200
is a truth of this ceasing of suffering and it means both the the seeing

224
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:16,640
together the arising and ceasing the inconstant change and coming and going but it also represents at some point

225
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:22,319
uh when the when the bottom of the river is out of reach falls away

226
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:29,359
it there's a more dramatic ceasing that goes on and um and now it's a ceasing that changes

227
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:34,880
things so for example in the analogy of going in the river when you're no longer

228
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:40,960
touching the bottom and no longer keeps you kind of stationary then the current has a chance

229
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:46,240
to carry you and so it marks a very important change

230
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:53,920
in going across the river and so going into the river and so the third noble truth involves

231
00:41:53,920 --> 00:42:01,440
not just seeing the arising of ceasing of things the constant coming and going but it's when we really become the

232
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:07,839
coming and going relax into it that um there's a a more

233
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:14,960
complete ceasing that is more than just the particulars of the moment but a seizing that feels

234
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:21,280
just much more holistic more inclusive and

235
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:28,960
and this you know is uh is uh changes

236
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:36,240
kind of the whole flow the whole current the whole understanding of what satti-patana practice is

237
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:41,599
and i'll talk more about that tomorrow so

238
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:46,640
so the second noble truth has two meanings and both of them are good

239
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:53,280
they're in they have their value in different contexts

240
00:42:53,280 --> 00:43:00,720
often much more ordinary states of mind seeing cause for suffering is very helpful

241
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,560
in deep meditative states of mind looking for a cause it just keeps the mind busy

242
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:12,319
and there we want to deep meditative we want to just kind of rest in the current the rising and fasting of direct

243
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:18,160
experience that's only possible if we have some level of stability and concentration

244
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:24,960
that we can we can we're not distracted we don't wander off in thought we're really here

245
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:30,079
and then we see the we're living in a rising and ceasing

246
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:36,960
and now the second noble truth is the rising seeing they're rising and the third noble truth is really

247
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:43,200
appreciating the ceasing the passing first initially kind of just as it comes

248
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:51,040
and goes the ceasing comes and goes until finally the seizing becomes much more comprehensive

249
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:57,440
and then that opens the door understanding for the fourth noble truth

250
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:03,440
the eightfold path and that will be the topic for tomorrow

251
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:08,119
so thank you very much
