1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:08,960
well good evening everyone my name is Jim padowski I'm

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,518
filling in for Diana today she's away this

3
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,800
week uh for those of you who have uh been tuning in for the last month or so

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:33,040
over the last three weeks she's given a series of talks about um asking questions questions in

5
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,680
practice and I think she covered the material very

6
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,600
well um

7
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:54,760
so it did um spark me to think more about why I do and don't ask

8
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,960
questions I started uh formal education I guess when I was

9
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,600
three years old going to preschool and I finished graduate school when I was 29

10
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:15,280
so I had a lot of years of being in um institutional settings where there was

11
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,479
teaching going on and there were also opportunities to ask

12
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,720
questions and I think during that time you you

13
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,920
know mostly I avoided asking question questions you that's absolutely

14
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:41,600
necessary um I was kind of shy uh kind of um

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,119
introverted uh I like to figure out things on my own

16
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:53,960
um and also I had judgments um about myself and also

17
00:01:53,960 --> 00:02:00,360
judgments about the other students you know like there was a saying that some along

18
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,000
the line I I probably heard it a number of times was there's no such thing as a

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,319
dumb question I didn't really believe that I

20
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:17,760
heard a lot of questions that I personally judged as dumb

21
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:25,120
um including my own um it wasn't until I was in graduate

22
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,959
school that I had a professor uh George Pim tell he was a

23
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:38,200
world class uh chemist at Berkeley and you know he invented the

24
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,440
chemical laser he sent a infrared spectrometer to Mars to study the

25
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,720
atmosphere he was very involved in um developing teaching methods for U

26
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,959
teaching in chemistry so he was quite an accomplished

27
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:01,519
person and I often would get to sit in seminars with him you know the physical

28
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:07,400
chemistry seminar and graduate student seminars and he seemed to have no qualms

29
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:13,680
about asking what I thought were pretty basic questions you know pretty simple

30
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,080
questions and I thought well he can get away with

31
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,280
that because he's already got this wonderful reputation I can't ask a simple question

32
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:33,760
like that as a grad student I have I have too much to lose right um but he was a wonderful example for me

33
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:40,680
you know of if you don't understand something you can ask a

34
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:47,080
question and I suspect

35
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:54,120
that um at least some of the time some of the questions he asked maybe ones

36
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:00,879
that he already knew the answer to but he may have um realized that there were people

37
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,920
in the audience that didn't understand this and that he was willing to ask the

38
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,200
question that no one else was so

39
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:17,639
um I always carried him around as a Exemplar

40
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:26,320
of um being willing to

41
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:34,160
ask being willing to let your curi osity lead as opposed to Your

42
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,639
Ego um some years later in the next decade I

43
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:47,520
was on a campaign to uh South America we in

44
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,280
Pinas Chile and making the first Airborne measurements of the Antarctic

45
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:00,960
ozone hole and so there's a big science meeting room probably twice as big as

46
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:08,440
this full of scientists who you know had been selected to to study this um brand

47
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:14,400
new phenomenon and the speaker was the

48
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:22,880
person in charge of this whole group and he kept talking about the Antarctic Vortex and they draw sort of cartoonish

49
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:29,720
pictures of what it looked like and at some point I realized I don't I don't really get this I don't

50
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:36,000
you know there's something missing so I raised my hand and I asked this very simple question about this Antarctic

51
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,280
Vortex which everyone had been talking about and it really just stopped his

52
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:49,400
talk you know he said oh yeah that's right yeah you know we we draw these simple pictures but let me give you more

53
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:56,720
detail and um it looked like everybody sort of woke up in the room when they started getting

54
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:03,080
this getting the answer to this question so that's

55
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,960
um encouraged me to keep asking those kind of qu you know to to being willing

56
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:15,960
to um admit that I don't know it

57
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,680
all

58
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:32,039
um I was also thinking about Diana's talks she did talk

59
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:38,840
about um not just the important of asking questions like any old

60
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,880
question but she also talked about

61
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:50,280
um how not all questions are created equal you know there are some

62
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:55,520
questions that will help you along you know kind of help you through

63
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:04,039
the uh I don't know the fog or the mud or ever leading on to a place of Greater

64
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:10,080
freedom and some questions don't some questions can just lead you either into

65
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,639
diversions or into kind of um getting trapped in

66
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:24,039
Cycles uh when I first learned computer programming in the

67
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:32,479
1970s uh languages allowed you to make a a lot of mistakes and so you could you could

68
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:37,840
write computer code that would go into an infinite Loop it would just keep

69
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,680
going on and on and on and there'd be it would never meet the Criterion to get

70
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:50,400
out um you know eventually your allotted time would run out and the thing would

71
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,680
stop having just sat there spinning for a long time and so I think the same

72
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:02,440
thing can happen in practice as well you know you can you can get caught in these uh

73
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:10,159
Loops um one of one of the ones that Diana talked about I think it was last week was you know

74
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:17,599
about rebirth you know like who was I before I was born who am I going to become things

75
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:24,240
like that that you could spend all sorts of time speculating about but wouldn't

76
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,440
really get you any closer to seeing through the things that need to be seen

77
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:37,039
you know kind of seeing through delusion seeing through greed seeing through

78
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:46,760
hatred um yeah

79
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:54,959
so after hearing her talks I started to do a little bit more examination

80
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:01,440
of first of all things that

81
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:09,000
uh keep me from asking questions you know the

82
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,399
impediments and most of them they're all internal of course right so the first

83
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:22,760
one is um not being clear about what the

84
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:30,760
question is that I have you know sometimes there'll be a teaching and you go well yeah I don't what that that

85
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:36,399
seems contradictory or it seems to contradict something I've heard before

86
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:42,040
or it's maybe some kind of a paradox

87
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:50,279
um uh or just you know defies

88
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:59,000
logic and so sometimes either in a in a session

89
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,279
like this tonight or maybe in a dayong class or something

90
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:10,320
um I would know that there was something that I didn't understand but I didn't

91
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,560
know how to articulate it I didn't know how to put it into words to to be able

92
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:22,360
to ask it and sometimes I wouldn't the question

93
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:30,040
wouldn't gel until I got home at night or the next day or something like that

94
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:35,360
now if I was a teacher that I saw regularly like Gil at that time I would

95
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:42,880
have another opportunity to ask a question um but sometimes like in a day

96
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:49,399
long if I didn't formulate the question that came up in the morning until the

97
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:54,839
afternoon kind of the the the most

98
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:02,639
um the time had kind of come and gone I missed I missed my chance to ask the question so that's one of one of the

99
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:08,240
things that um I find has has been

100
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,480
a an issue is being able to have clarity

101
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:19,480
about what is it that I don't understand is there some way that I can um put that

102
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,959
into words in a way that doesn't

103
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,240
um that doesn't lead me into even less

104
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:40,399
Clarity uh and and you know and that's it's part of being human right we don't you

105
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:47,880
know uh I like to watch old Sherlock Holmes movies you know and of course he's always like he looks around and he

106
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:55,040
right away you know knows exactly what's going on uh I'm much more like His companion

107
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,200
Dr Watson you know he's sort of fumbling around

108
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:08,040
um let's see the the second I I'll call it impediment

109
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:14,480
is um related to Ego which is not wanting

110
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,760
to look bad not wanting to look

111
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:26,920
uh I don't know unintelligent uninformed

112
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:34,880
uh you know like I've I've heard talks about uh not self for

113
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:41,079
years and years and years and yet at this point I'd be a little bit

114
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:47,480
um shy about asking a teacher you know I've heard about this for 20 some years

115
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:55,959
you know can can you try can you try explaining to it it to me again uh you know so you know I I think

116
00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:03,839
it's it's a common human thing I'm just not you know you got a certain sense of

117
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,800
uh oh wanting to look good you know wanting wanting to appear like you've

118
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:15,800
you've got it together that's one of the things that

119
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:22,399
that professor professor pimel helped me with is

120
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:28,120
that he didn't seem to have that operating you know he could just ask a

121
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:35,040
simple question and um there didn't seem to be any kind of

122
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:41,399
egoic um impediment to asking a question that you'd think he would have known the

123
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:46,440
answer to

124
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:57,440
um let's see then the third one that came to me um besides looking good

125
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,759
is more of a self Judgment

126
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:08,199
of how good of a question is this you know like particularly like found there

127
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:14,920
a room full of people and there's other people asking questions should I should I even be

128
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,880
asking this question is this is this

129
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:27,120
um time worthy

130
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:35,040
um and that's often underneath that is uh there's often doubt operating you

131
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:41,160
know doubt about is this

132
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:51,800
um you know is it is this is this going to be valuable not just to me but to the

133
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:59,759
whole group or at Le part of the group so these are all things that may

134
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:07,880
or may not strike a resonance with you um the fourth

135
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:16,079
one uh has to do

136
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:24,759
with wanting praise when I first started with IMC in

137
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:31,839
the in the late 90s back in Redwood City um um Gil was the main Monday night

138
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:38,920
teacher he's he taught maybe 50 to 70% of the time and often he

139
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:46,759
would leave time for questions at the end and when I was knew I felt pretty

140
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:51,040
confident about raising my hand and asking a

141
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:58,279
question and what felt the best at that time was when he would when he he'd

142
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:05,279
react with with that's a great question that's a really good question you know that's

143
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:12,600
insightful that's important you know uh he might even respond with asking me for

144
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:19,680
more input and that

145
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:27,040
was well I'll say it was both a stroke to my ego but it was also

146
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:37,440
there was some element of feeling validated you know that that what I had to contribute was

147
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,880
um appreciated and and

148
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:49,560
recognized and then after a while I noticed like I would ask a question and I might get just a very perfunctory

149
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:58,600
response he might just nod his head or he might just you know he he he he you know or

150
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:04,880
just maybe say a few words but I'd never get the that's a good question that I

151
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:11,880
was looking for and so after I stopped getting those little strokes that I

152
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:19,280
wanted I got less interested in asking him questions um you know I wasn't I wasn't

153
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:27,918
getting the uh I'll say egoic lift that I would in the first

154
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,840
part

155
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,720
and then the fifth one the F fifth impediment that I've

156
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,399
been able to identify um

157
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:54,720
was that you never know what you're going to get you know like I'd ask him a question

158
00:17:55,559 --> 00:18:03,520
and in formulating the question I knew knew what it was that I was willing to say and what I wasn't willing to say but

159
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,880
then once I asked the question he might ask me a question back like why are you

160
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:15,480
asking that what you know like how does that work in your life and it's like

161
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:21,400
well no I I I don't want to go there I just I want I just want you to answer my

162
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:29,480
question uh so he might answer uh

163
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,760
he might do like the Buddha he might he might what Diana had said earlier was

164
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:42,679
the Buddha sometimes sometimes he just respond to a question directly somebody would ask a question he' just respond to

165
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:47,840
it sometimes he would reformulate the question a little

166
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:54,799
bit and then answer that reformulated question like he thought the question that was asked

167
00:18:54,799 --> 00:19:02,000
was pretty on the mark but you know was straying a little bit sometimes he'd

168
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:10,080
answer a question with a question um which is what I found Gil

169
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:17,799
starting to do and sometimes he wouldn't respond at all he just like he he just said you

170
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:22,960
know like however I respond to that

171
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:30,720
question won't be helpful so he just wouldn't wouldn't respond

172
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:36,799
um I've only seen that happen here once that was there was one time there was a

173
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:43,120
guy sitting up on the stage he raised his hand and he asked Gil

174
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,480
um a question about he wanted to go into a conversation about

175
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:55,720
rebirth now Gil didn't just not respond at all he just said we're not going to

176
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:01,919
go there we're just not going to talk about that and the person got really upset and said

177
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,880
some unskillful things

178
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:14,600
um but you never know what you're going to get you might get a direct response you might get a

179
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:20,679
slightly a response to a slightly different question you you might get an a question in

180
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:27,559
return and you might get you know sort of

181
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:37,679
the some somewhat gracious Blank Stare like yeah that so uh th those are

182
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:44,400
the five things that have come to my mind about what has what have proved to

183
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:50,799
be impediments for myself over the years for asking

184
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:57,200
questions and um I deci well I better not stop there

185
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:04,000
there must there must be things that encourage you to ask questions right there must there must be reasons that to

186
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,279
uh I mean I do want to encourage you all to ask questions so the first thing that came

187
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:16,679
to me is it may bring Clarity it might be

188
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:23,640
that a teacher may say something or a teacher or one of your peers may say

189
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:29,760
something to you that brings

190
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,120
Clarity um you might need to hear the same thing

191
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:41,840
over and over again a number of times before it clicks

192
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:55,440
um there's cases where hearing it from one some teachers

193
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:01,039
just may connect with you better than others some may just be able to say things in

194
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:07,679
words and with uh analogies that click for you that um

195
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:16,120
other teachers don't and it doesn't mean that one is better than the other it's just that one is is you know kind of

196
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:22,320
has um there's just some

197
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:30,519
resonance so asking questions so that you can get clarity number one

198
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:36,919
um well and sometimes I found that even as I'm

199
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:42,480
asking the question the question

200
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:50,159
might either become clear or it may um transmute somewhat you know it might be

201
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,279
like oh yeah well that isn't really the you know it's like you might have some

202
00:22:55,279 --> 00:23:01,440
insight even as you're asking the question so that verbalization process can be

203
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:07,679
very helpful in ways that you might not even see if you're just sitting there

204
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,840
thinking about it

205
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:18,159
um number two asking the

206
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:25,440
question may take you deeper you know both in the process of

207
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,400
asking the question you may go deep er um the teacher may ask a

208
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:38,640
question of you that can take you deeper um in a way that you wouldn't

209
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,840
have even thought uh before you asked the

210
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,840
question

211
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:54,919
um the third value of asking questions

212
00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:58,919
is that

213
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:07,880
the more you ask questions it's kind of like a muscle the better the more you ask the

214
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:15,279
better you can become at asking questions you know that it's

215
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:23,960
um yeah so you know you can get better

216
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:29,080
by by asking questions even if it seems kind of awkward and you're not quite

217
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:35,760
sure what's going on there is some learning that goes on by asking

218
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:42,559
questions um and then the final two have to do

219
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:48,399
with connection

220
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,000
um when I first came to this practice I really thought that this was sort of a

221
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,399
do-it-yourself practice you know you came and you heard talks

222
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:07,679
and then you went home and thought about it or meditated uh over time I started

223
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,720
joining uh camita groups

224
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,480
so where there were other people that you could ask questions of so the the

225
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:24,520
final two that I was thinking of number one is by asking a teacher a question

226
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:30,840
you can start building a bond with them you know a

227
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,039
connection

228
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:42,799
um so that when when times get really tough you've

229
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:49,799
got you've got an ally that you can go to and say look this is just things are just breaking

230
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:56,640
down so you know building a connection with the teacher and then the last one is

231
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:03,399
building connections with other people so you know like if you were

232
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:09,200
um if you were to ask a question you might find during the night you might

233
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:15,000
find that afterwards someone might come up to you and say well yeah you know I was thinking the same thing you know I

234
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,600
had that same question um we don't have so much time

235
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:27,559
to interact with each other uh on Monday nights but they they

236
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:34,840
do a lot more that on Thursday nights and day longs Sunday mornings so uh

237
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:42,679
asking questions will um not only benefit you but it it can

238
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:48,919
benefit many other people in the room that hear the question because they may have the they may have the same question

239
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:54,799
and not even know it or they may have the question and not be willing to say it

240
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:59,120
so it's not

241
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:07,240
the the the benefits of our practice aren't for us alone they're for

242
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:13,080
everyone so asking questions um about things that are

243
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:20,760
unclear to you may help others so those are the those are the

244
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:25,960
five uh impediments that I found and the five

245
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,960
benefits and

246
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:43,360
I hope you you'll contemplate those and we now have about 15 minutes

247
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,760
to uh if you want to ask questions or make

248
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,760
comments

249
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,919
um yeah

250
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:05,880
no no I don't I don't well for the folks U there's people online

251
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:11,080
online anyway uh there's many more people you can benefit with your

252
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:17,840
question by online well these are just comments what I really hate is when somebody I ask a question and then they

253
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:25,320
ask me a question in return it's like they're avoiding answering it and that to me is very irritating uh you follow

254
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:30,880
what I'm saying I ask a question question he or she responds with a question and it's

255
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,519
like he avoids he or she avoids answering the question ah no well I

256
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:43,600
thought everybody knew that experienced that and the other thing is when a politician gets up there

257
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:52,399
and he says that's a really good question and then he or she does not answer the question I mean

258
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:58,440
yeah well next no well thank you for that

259
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:03,640
that thank you for that I I suspect sometimes a teacher may be avoiding

260
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:09,440
answering the question no no I'm not talking about a teacher I'm talking about just a normal human oh no I see oh

261
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:15,360
okay yeah because I don't think a teacher would do that politician yes an

262
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:21,440
unfriend yes yeah there's

263
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:29,360
something thank you um very interesting discussion um so I I was drawn to sort

264
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:36,480
of three things um the first is um I I too am a Scientist and whenever I go to

265
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,600
a scientific meeting and either give a lecture or I'm in the audience uh many

266
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:49,360
of the questions actually F fall into a couple of interesting categories the first is

267
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:55,159
uh not really there to clarify something about the talk but actually to add

268
00:29:55,159 --> 00:30:00,720
something that is often to Your Ego Point well well you forgot something that I've done that isn't in your

269
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:07,039
lecture right that's a probably you know 30% of the you know the questions and

270
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:14,320
then there are uh and that's not really a question it's a comment then then there are questions

271
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:19,440
that have nothing to do with the talk and have something to do with something else that they felt should have been in

272
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:25,240
the talk and those are sometimes useful right uh and and so often very few of

273
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:32,600
the actual questions are relevant to the talk like your point about the vortex right actually please explain something

274
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:41,720
uh and and partly because they're not in that student mode they're in the let me show off what

275
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:49,480
others you know are going to need to know about me rather than about the topic at hand and and to your point

276
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:55,519
about the professor having taught for a long time too you often want to take the

277
00:30:55,519 --> 00:31:03,039
socratic position which is to ask a question that is often seemingly simple

278
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:10,519
but opens up what is an important topic that has confused the group or that you

279
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:16,440
want the group to kind of steer at leasts to sort of the second set of questions that I was thinking about which are those kind of Socratic

280
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:24,279
questions right and the socratic dialogue which are really a bit of a back and forth and a way to probe a

281
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:31,720
topic by you know the the kind of tennis of back and forth questions that often

282
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:37,360
illuminate in other ways right um and then the last

283
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:42,519
is legal questions and if you've ever been deposed or part of a

284
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:48,080
deposition um it's a very structured way of going through and

285
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:54,960
inquiring uh but when done right it's actually quite interesting as a way of probing and getting information out that

286
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,799
you wouldn't want otherwise be able to get out so in the law you only allowed to ask questions you can't you know the

287
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:06,799
lawyers are to ask the questions to get information out so anyway that you know may maybe three unrelated things but to

288
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:13,320
me that's where my mind went and and so in my own meditation you know which of these do I want do I want to actually

289
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:20,000
impress myself as I sit there because I often do that in meditation right you know or do I really want to kind of

290
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:28,399
probe and get at some really difficult thing that I'm grappling with and spend that time you know focused on it

291
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:34,559
and what's the best way to do that is it a kind of structured way because sometimes I do sort of resolve math

292
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:41,039
problems in that way right you know you go and you sort of sit there and just by thinking about it and asking yourself the questions you're able to to kind of

293
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:47,679
Whittle through anyway just my my thoughts on it yeah well thank you thank

294
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:03,639
you I can definitely say I have never thought so deeply I've been so mindful

295
00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:09,639
of the whole process of asking questions as I have been through these recent discussions and it's been really

296
00:33:09,639 --> 00:33:16,639
interesting to think about all the topics that have been raised in connection and um I thought it was funny

297
00:33:16,639 --> 00:33:22,200
that you raised one of my current questions which is like the proper

298
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:30,399
balance of self not self and I guess that's probably a question that a lot of us have which just ongoing because it's

299
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:37,480
complicated right but um I just uh I appreciate the conversation because as

300
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:42,559
we've delved in it's become more and more interesting to me as we've gone

301
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:47,760
along yeah yeah thank you thank you for your

302
00:33:49,399 --> 00:33:58,960
input this is kind of a group question uh I've noticed I I do a lot of

303
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,320
visualization things from the practice stick with me if I have a visual or some

304
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:10,560
little memory about it so lately I used to think of my thoughts

305
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:17,320
kind of like a a untrained puppy that I would try to be kind to the

306
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:25,839
puppy and you know that I was kind of on that image for a while and lately uh the

307
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:34,679
image that came to mind was for a few weeks is that it's like the junk drawer in my kitchen my mind and so

308
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:42,158
different stuff pops up and circulates around and anyway so my question is do

309
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:48,760
other people have these kind of um

310
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:55,560
visualizations or ideas about the practice it could be your mind state it

311
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:02,440
could be anything but do do other people have these ideas and do they shift

312
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:11,160
through time to different visualizations y I

313
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,960
can um yeah like you I have like uh I also like do visualizations and it

314
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:24,880
shifts from time to time for sure um one that really was very powerful for me um

315
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,800
and I did this for like a a month where every night I would just like imagine as

316
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:37,800
if I'm basking in the sun which is kind of funny cuz like it's at night so there's no sun um but like kind of just

317
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:44,720
like Imagining the warmth just like pouring over me um it really helps me kind of just like really calm down and

318
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,839
um it really Mellows like all the thoughts um which makes you know like uh

319
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:57,119
meditation and reflection on the different things especially the hard things like a bit more approachable um

320
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:03,040
cuz it Mellows it down and kind of softens it um so that's that's one um

321
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:11,200
visualization that I think was very helpful for me yeah thank

322
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:21,800
you was gonna say I was thinking right right brain

323
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:30,240
left brain or something but that is possible yes so I was listening to your five uh

324
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:36,040
ways of avoiding questions and I of course could identify with all five of

325
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:41,599
them especially number four because um when I had this brilliant question in my

326
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:46,800
mind and I said okay I'm going to ask it and it will be good and I I will look

327
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,480
great asking a question that I don't ask the question so that's but I would like

328
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:58,319
to offer a six one which I think if if you mentioned it I missed it

329
00:36:58,319 --> 00:37:08,640
and that is a sort of laziness and what I mean is that uh during uh my practice I it never

330
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:14,680
happened that I asked the question and in the after I got an answer there was a

331
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:22,040
shift that I was always looking for shift in Clarity shift in Insight shift

332
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:29,079
in knowing myself better that never happened immediately but it does happen

333
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:35,839
uh but it doesn't happen immediately it happens as you said when others are questions when when you read the same

334
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:41,760
text over and over over again and suddenly out of nowhere that shift comes

335
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,880
so but but it doesn't come from a question so I

336
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:54,480
don't I don't have the um the desire to to ask a question I just hang out and

337
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:00,920
wait and that's I I see it of laziness because as many people pointed out

338
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:07,480
asking questions is a good thing not just for yourself but everybody

339
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:14,680
so yeah thank you yeah I think one something that occurred to me is

340
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:21,000
um years ago when Gil would talk about doing

341
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:29,240
um noting practice in meditation you know where you'd make silent mental

342
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:35,760
notes about what's happening right now in some ways that's kind of a

343
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:42,920
question right like well what's happening and that can get fairly complicated you

344
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:48,560
can come up with very you know elaborate descriptions of what you're experiencing at the

345
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:55,079
moment but one of the questions that was helpful for me is just like sitting

346
00:38:55,079 --> 00:39:01,680
there paying attention to your breath and going going what is

347
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:09,480
this you know what's happening right now what what is this and it isn't

348
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:15,680
that the answer is important but it's the

349
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:21,839
continually continually looking you know continually asking what what's going on

350
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:29,599
right now you know what is what is this um and that sense of curiosity I

351
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:37,000
mean that can help build the sense of curiosity at least for some people may maybe for you it's not the same and it's

352
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:43,560
a different process but you know just you

353
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:52,240
know years ago I used to be involved uh with with a group and um there was

354
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:58,520
a mytho poet Michael me and he said

355
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:04,359
it's not about getting better answers it's about getting better and better

356
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:11,200
questions you know so finding better and better questions about what's going on

357
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:17,040
so I'll leave you with that and but thank

358
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,960
you for your uh your share

359
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:39,480
I don't want to leave you out SP do you do you have anything that you want to say maybe I just have have

360
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:47,119
one I have a just a comment um I really enjoyed it Jim thank you so

361
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:52,319
much for sharing this 10 like five five

362
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:58,000
um thoughts and I'm just thinking right now now like

363
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,400
I am really I've always been very shy uh when when it came to asking

364
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:10,280
questions and basically I'm avoiding all my life I'm avoiding and I was thinking

365
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:17,079
you know the kind of the the two things that I think it's

366
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:25,040
it's a very cultural thing uh it uh like the combination of like what you called

367
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:33,480
expecting praise or you know and on the other hand um this is very like

368
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:40,319
the given my background like it's kind of like that that that's what it all was

369
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:45,359
about you know you ask questions in order to to

370
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:53,319
shine and not to and and then at the same time um asking questions was considered

371
00:41:53,319 --> 00:42:01,119
to be like you basically reveal yourself as an uninformed you know unknowing

372
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:07,520
person so it's kind of I'm I was listening to you and I felt like wow a little bit of

373
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:15,359
a relief that I'm seeing this clearly and um kind of it's not yeah so it's not

374
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:21,160
it's not just me I'm so like you know never know what to ask or how to do that

375
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:27,319
there's a lot of that like deep conditioning and heavy conditioning and

376
00:42:27,319 --> 00:42:32,720
I'm very very also want to say I'm very inspired by your last idea by your last

377
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:40,000
but what you said about how it's it's connecting us you know I'm asking not

378
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:46,800
just because I want to know because I kind of also want this connection to happen so thank you so much I really

379
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,599
enjoyed it very much yeah thank you thank you
