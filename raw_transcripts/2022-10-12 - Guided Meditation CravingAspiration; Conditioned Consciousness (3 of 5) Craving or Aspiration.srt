1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:09,140
good morning or good day everyone and welcome

2
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,060
an English word that I'm fond of is the word aspiration

3
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:27,480
to Aspire and I think part of the reason I like it is that um

4
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,140
it uh from the Latin roots French Roots it means to breathe

5
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:40,680
Aspire is uh like respiration um and just like inspiration as well

6
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:47,280
they all come from this root word uh for breathing and uh pointing to the profundity of

7
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,239
breathing how it's deeply connected to so many things and to connect our aspiration our

8
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,539
desires to something that's so deep and integral and deeply connected to

9
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:06,479
ourselves as the breathing contributes to this idea for me that

10
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:14,460
aspiration is a positive word for desire it's a kind of Desire that is not

11
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,500
um uh

12
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:25,380
treated as somehow wrong in Buddhism there's a kind of simplistic

13
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:31,439
understanding the Buddhism that all desires are somehow wrong or should be transcended in some way

14
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:39,840
but there's a very important place for a healthy skillful desires and aspiration

15
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,880
to have the wish the

16
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:51,600
to direct oneself towards a particular purpose and goal that comes out of the

17
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,659
heart the heart's wish the heart's aspiration the hearts

18
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:03,780
calling may be your stirring that it wants something it like

19
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:10,619
it wants something but it's a wanting it's a desire that because it comes from breathing

20
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:16,080
comes from a place of feeling full it comes from a place of being content

21
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:23,580
and settled it doesn't come from a sense of lack that I don't have enough I need more it

22
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,800
rather comes from if anything from a sense of contentment fullness like I

23
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,879
have enough and what seems to emerge in this very settled Place peaceful place is an

24
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:42,360
aspiration and there are many that can be together or in the same

25
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,400
person certainly the aspiration to um

26
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,040
to somehow do good in the world it's a beautiful thing

27
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,819
the aspiration to become free ourselves to become free of our

28
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:06,620
the ways in which we're limited the heart is Shackled or contained

29
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:13,260
to become free from our attachments or preoccupations and

30
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:21,239
Neurosis Around Me Myself and mine this is a phenomenally beautiful thing

31
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:28,680
and so sitting in meditation can be motivated by this aspiration if

32
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,019
we get settled enough quiet enough maybe to feel and sense

33
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:40,260
that maybe at the root of where breathing begins that there there seems

34
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:46,560
to be almost like a natural desire or wish or or inclination towards something

35
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:54,140
profound so to uh

36
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,400
if you like this kind of language if you don't you can ignore it hear what I'm about to say

37
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:11,220
to take uh as you take your meditation posture make your body your temple

38
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,440
make your body The Meditation Center

39
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:23,120
let your body become the sacred grove in which you go to meditate

40
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:36,259
let this body be appreciated

41
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:44,599
is what as the field as a territory is the

42
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:47,660
the location

43
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:57,259
for a deep connection to life to oneself

44
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:08,900
to the depths of our stirring depth of our aspiration about how to live this life

45
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:19,280
and too gently close your eyes

46
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:28,880
and gently on the exhales relax your body

47
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:38,539
might start to the top your head and your face

48
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:42,539
relaxing softening

49
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:52,080
sometimes the face face of muscle muscles can hold a lot of discontent

50
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,819
wanting things to be different

51
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:03,800
than to relax those muscles of discontent

52
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,880
muscles of anxiety

53
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:19,400
and letting the relaxation send into your shoulders

54
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:26,300
softening gentling the shoulders

55
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:38,120
into then moving down to the chest

56
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:47,100
heart and the solar plexor plexal area relax soften

57
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,000
sensing deep inside the Torso

58
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,560
to what can be relaxed and softened there

59
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:21,440
and moving the relaxation down into the belly

60
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:29,539
softening in the belly

61
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:45,840
down into the hips and the legs softening

62
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:18,620
and perhaps a final relaxation is global throughout the body

63
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:25,879
releasing any holding in your body

64
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:51,180
and then feeling your way into your body deep inside to maybe where

65
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:58,100
breathing begins or where

66
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:09,320
aspiration arises from the depth of fear

67
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:20,940
letting there be an aspiration connecting to whatever your aspiration is here and now

68
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,459
about how to be present

69
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:34,140
aspiration of what to actualize in terms of

70
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,940
being present directly

71
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:46,220
being free of attachments fear

72
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:56,300
the aspiration to let the hearts be free the mind at peace Here and Now

73
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:07,380
and with the word aspiration meaning and

74
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:14,660
etymologically to breathe perhaps you can allow

75
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:23,300
a gentle aspiration to be present

76
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,680
to be free to let go

77
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:35,540
to be there with every breath breathing in and breathing out

78
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:58,460
as you're here in the present moment the best you can

79
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:07,760
being mindful being present for what is your breathing in and breathing out

80
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,559
let there be an aspiration

81
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:24,440
to be present connect to find and aspiration

82
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:32,840
that supports you in wanting to be present here and now

83
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:40,260
perhaps who you can be connected to something that takes you to the depths of your

84
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,500
life

85
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:12,019
foreign

86
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:28,400
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

87
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:36,840
to imagine that as you exhale

88
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:43,519
your exhale the exhaling breath carries with it

89
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:52,039
whatever wishes you have for the world

90
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:59,960
and if those wishes or wishes of ill will

91
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:07,940
you'll spread seeds of ill will that will Sprout all over

92
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,559
but if you breathe out good will

93
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:18,980
those will be the seeds that you'll spread across this world

94
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:29,580
perhaps in some deep place inside below all the layers of challenging

95
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:34,100
feelings and experiences you've had

96
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:41,940
maybe there's a place that you have good will for this world

97
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:47,039
will you aspire to spread Good Will around everywhere

98
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:55,278
perhaps as seeds so as you exhale

99
00:28:56,299 --> 00:29:00,559
May these words that I speak

100
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:10,860
as I speak these words may your Exile exhale

101
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:19,400
carry your good will your aspiration for goodness in this world

102
00:29:23,539 --> 00:29:28,398
may all beings be happy

103
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,860
may all beings be peaceful

104
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:46,039
may all beings be safe

105
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,539
may all beings be free

106
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:07,500
and and may everything your breath touch touches

107
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:13,100
may it receive your well-wishing

108
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:28,230
[Music]

109
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,179
thank you

110
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:45,260
thank you foreign

111
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:57,779
come to the fourth third talk that's the series called conditioned

112
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:04,860
consciousness and the idea that our the way that we

113
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:11,279
perceive or experience or construct the sense of consciousness

114
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:18,539
is something that is conditioned it's uh constructed or or influenced by all

115
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:23,580
kinds of other factors and and uh in our minds and our hearts and

116
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:30,299
in our life and that um as we start understanding some of these

117
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:36,179
conditions some of these influences for our how we put together the idea of

118
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:41,220
consciousness that we can appreciate how much uh

119
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:46,919
some some conditions created Consciousness which doesn't feel so good

120
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:52,340
and others help produce one that feels wonderful

121
00:32:52,919 --> 00:33:00,140
and then so today I want to talk about the range or the distinction between

122
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:07,620
craving and aspiring craving is considered to be a form of

123
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:13,080
suffering in Buddhism it's a craving it has a compulsion to it the kind of kind

124
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:18,480
of if it's strong has Us by the throat to by the nose pulling us around and

125
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,760
we're not very free the only Freedom we can find with intense compulsion there's

126
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:31,080
two kinds of freedoms you can find but with the with the craving itself there can be a sense of of Freedom when we

127
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:38,399
give into it but uh it's kind of just going going along giving in to attachments so it has

128
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:45,000
free reign it's not a real freedom the second kind of Freedom we can discover

129
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,640
is uh we can have craving but we don't succumb to it don't give in to it we

130
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:58,100
have the ability to see that we're craving and not pick it up not get involved

131
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:03,179
enough so that we have a broader sense of awareness of presence of attention to

132
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:11,460
it and part of the effect of craving it tends to like other tensions it tends to

133
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:19,200
narrow the range of of consciousness attention tends to be focused now on the

134
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:25,800
object of the craving and so it could be a laser focus it could be a narrowing of

135
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:32,720
the field that can be things get smaller and tight and kind of

136
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:38,040
both tense both and agitated sometimes

137
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:44,820
hot sometimes there's a feeling of pressure that comes with craving

138
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:50,940
kind of like it's uh saying it has to be now and um

139
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:58,140
and uh but craving it's a real relatively shallow as powerful as it can

140
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:05,099
be is a kind of a shallow uh segment or level layer of the Mind

141
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:10,740
that keeps us somehow alienated from ourselves disconnected partly because

142
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:16,859
we're constantly looking outside for the object of craving and and so we can't

143
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:22,260
settle back into ourselves as we settle back and relax and really

144
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:27,660
find a place to rest inside where we're free of craving free of that

145
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:33,780
compulsion and agitation contraction with time we can then start discovering

146
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:41,339
that there are well Springs of Desire of wishes of aspiration that arise from end

147
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:49,020
that it can occur without any compulsion and that those because a kind of a

148
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:55,619
Wellspring that Wells up the influence they have on our sense of awareness is to support it just to boy

149
00:35:55,619 --> 00:36:00,780
it it's almost like it can uh if you're a practitioner knows something about

150
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:08,040
being present and mindful the underlying welling up of this aspiration to be free to be

151
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:13,500
compassionate to be you know whatever it is that comes from the depth of Who We

152
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:18,900
Are that it's almost like it spreads and expands the sense of Consciousness the

153
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:25,980
sense of awareness rather than contracts it and narrows it where this aspiration has to be

154
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:31,020
expectation free it has to be um

155
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:36,540
free of a certain kind of conceit all of which kind of tighten up again and

156
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:43,380
narrow the scope and aspiration that a wish that is not

157
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:49,140
compulsive doesn't need to be fulfilled even it's just like this is what the

158
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:55,500
heart's wish is and if it's possible great if not it Just arises and like the

159
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:01,500
exhale it just kind of can just flow out and you don't necessarily lose

160
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:07,619
aspirations like that if they don't get fulfilled or don't get acted on any more

161
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:13,440
that you lose your exhales just because you exhaled once another exhale will

162
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,480
come another the aspiration if it's a sincere deep aspiration it'll be there and come

163
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:25,859
as well and um and so part of the advantage of sitting

164
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:32,880
in meditation being Mindful and really kind of learning to settle below the layers of agitation layers of tension

165
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:41,400
layers of craving is to come to a place where we are have these deeper

166
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:47,000
Wellsprings of compulsive free desires

167
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,200
expectation free with expert expectation doesn't have to

168
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:59,359
come with sense of need this needs to happen and so this idea of

169
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:05,160
noticing that the difference between craving and aspiration is a very

170
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:10,980
significant exercise I think some people don't have much sense of what an aspiration is and the

171
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:19,380
way I'm talking about maybe they've never kind of been pointed to it and for me I was never I grew up without

172
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:25,500
ever having any sense of what that might be but it was through doing this Buddhist

173
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:32,760
practice that I I came to appreciate that there's this kind of I called it

174
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:39,200
sometimes biological a biological Drive sometimes a

175
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:46,980
biological and kind of desire

176
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:54,119
because it didn't seem to be connected to the ordinary cognitions of the Mind the ordinary kind of surface thinking

177
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:59,220
and concerns or the surface emotions they seem to be kind of more built into

178
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:05,880
kind of the depth of the whole operating system here and so biological if I use that word in

179
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:11,339
a sense that it um it uh

180
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:19,920
um you know it's deeper than than cognition and thinking and those things

181
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,619
this kind of aspiration can feed into our cognitions our desires our dreams

182
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:30,720
our imaginations are all kinds of things

183
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:36,359
and um and uh they can really enrich a person's life

184
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:42,060
phenomenally to come from this place so to begin noticing a difference

185
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:47,220
between craving and aspiration and noticing that the different way in which

186
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:54,540
it affects you physically emotionally and conscious wise how does it switch

187
00:39:54,540 --> 00:40:01,760
and change the sense of being aware depending which one you're operating from

188
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:09,780
one of the things that I believe is often the case is that with craving there's often a feeling of discontent

189
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:17,099
that craving can often come from a sense of lack and so that sense of lack we're trying to Crave to fill it return to

190
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:23,400
assuage it we're trying to soothe ourselves or distract ourselves

191
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:33,000
or entertain ourselves so we don't have to feel the pain of Defense sense of lacked emptiness that we might have

192
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,000
in with aspiration there's a there's a contentment

193
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:45,420
there's a sense of No Lack a sense of fullness because we've learned to take whatever

194
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:51,540
lack discontent there might be and bring our attention right into it and kind of

195
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:56,700
massage it from the inside out turn it inside out and fill it with something

196
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:01,800
that's profound fill it with ourselves fill it with awareness

197
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:09,800
fill it so that the tension of lack the tension inherent in in this kind of

198
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:15,320
feeling of vacuity or pain or loneliness

199
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:20,839
begins to relax and soften and begins to settle

200
00:41:20,839 --> 00:41:27,980
and um so I associate craving with discontent

201
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:34,320
and aspiration with contentment and the

202
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:41,720
and the funny thing about uh discontent is that um

203
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:47,280
the when we're discontented we're kind of

204
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:54,900
the mind is kind of content full discontent churns up thoughts and ideas

205
00:41:54,900 --> 00:42:00,599
and desires and aversions and projections and

206
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:06,900
fantasies and all kinds of things so discontent actually it was kind of busy

207
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:14,040
agitated mind so it's content discontent is a mind that's contentful

208
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:20,280
contentment on the other hand allows for settling and quieting of the mind and

209
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:28,380
the heart and in a certain kind of way contentment is content free

210
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:34,619
there's space and room for inputs for things to arise and be

211
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:41,700
there and feel deeper more deeply what's going on in this world craving tends to create very little room

212
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:46,859
because it's so content full of all kinds of churning stuff

213
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:52,619
contentment tends to be content free in that there's a room for us to feel not

214
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:58,980
only the world be aware of the world in a significant way but also to be aware of ourselves

215
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:06,180
and be aware really what's going on to be able to be be sensitive enough to start living from

216
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:11,960
and feeling something that's more the depth of who we are the fullness of Who We Are

217
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:19,560
rather than than uh this funny thing of lack which tends to

218
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:26,640
be yes there's sense of lack that feels empty but then becomes kind of contentful or something

219
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:32,839
so I hope that this word play Within you know lack and fullness and

220
00:43:32,839 --> 00:43:37,859
contentful and content free is points you to something that's possible that

221
00:43:37,859 --> 00:43:44,640
allows you to begin seeing more clearly the difference between a world live from

222
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:51,480
craving and a world live from the from aspiration

223
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:56,700
and so may aspiration be your your Guiding Light

224
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:05,180
that supports you in living with desires in a way that's phenomenally free

225
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:12,540
compulsive free so thank you very much and

226
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:17,060
I look forward to being here again with you tomorrow
