1
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:16,400
hello my friends and it's uh special for me and maybe all

2
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,600
of us to gather for this meditation thank you for being

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,760
here so today I would like to associate

4
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,840
meditation with something that perhaps is seldom seldom associated with but I

5
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,079
think that uh we many of us at times will

6
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:44,680
definitely bring this quality to it and that is

7
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:53,039
courage meditation sometimes needs courage it's often associated with meditation about being calm relaxed

8
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,320
unassertive being um quiet

9
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:05,720
peaceful uh and so so and maybe also with associated with being

10
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:12,720
um um

11
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,759
um maybe even kind of dsel or something but uh sometimes we need to

12
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:25,040
have courage and sometimes a lot of courage and

13
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,000
uh certainly the courage takes a lot of courage in life

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,040
to sometimes be ethical sometimes they take courage to

15
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,600
not give in expressions of hostility or

16
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,719
anger not give into strong compulsive desires that we

17
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:56,759
might have and that can play out in meditation as well that uh we take our

18
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:05,240
place and show up to be be here in a clear and courageous way so we

19
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:11,720
don't give in to distractions we don't give

20
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:18,959
into um the distractions that keep us from recognizing what's really happening

21
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,120
here in important ways that we don't uh give in

22
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,080
to um uh avoid the difficult emotions that

23
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:38,480
we have but to show up to our grief our fears our even our

24
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:45,200
angers to really be honest about them and show up and take our place in the middle of them sometimes we talk about

25
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,519
sitting in the fire when meditating so we have I have behind me a

26
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:57,480
statue of the Buddha the night of his Awakening and his posture that's

27
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:04,319
dignified and upright is a posture Ure that represents taking one's place in a

28
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,720
dignified clear complete way that you're allowed to inhabit the place where

29
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:18,599
you're practicing like you can be there you don't have to diminish yourself or apologize for yourself or and to and to

30
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:24,440
show up and uh the part of the uh imagery

31
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:30,239
symbolic imagery that you see there is that he's touching his um uh the Earth

32
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,280
he's touching the spot in which he's sitting and so for you to touch the spot

33
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:42,680
where you're meditating yes here you will be and you'll show up courageously for what's

34
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:50,159
here and not the kind of Courage that makes you agitated makes you tense but

35
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:56,840
actually the opposite sometimes it takes tremendous courage to be relaxed be at

36
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:06,079
ease in the fire with the difficulties courage to stay in your place stay

37
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:12,720
present stay here not giving in not collapsing not

38
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:20,199
running away but staying here with what is and sometimes it takes courage to do

39
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:30,440
that even when things are going really well in meditation because of the strong desire to to enjoy it to like go into it

40
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:36,800
in a way that we're not really that

41
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:44,160
present so to take a

42
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:52,720
posture that for you is a posture of relaxed

43
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,560
courage a certain kind of relaxed strength

44
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,840
yes this is not a casual thing to sit down

45
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:11,560
to meditate it's a heroic act in a world

46
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:18,080
where people succumb to Greed hate and delusion all the

47
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:24,800
time and to assume a posture that for

48
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:32,800
you allows you to have a heroic stance in showing up here really showing

49
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:39,520
up here for your experience mindfully with clear

50
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:48,720
awareness and closing your eyes and feeling that

51

breath relaxing relaxing but not giving away

animosity divisiveness

100
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,278
greed it takes

101
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:49,760
courage to be compassionate to be generous to be

102
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:57,200
kind to be honest it takes courage to stand in the

103
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:05,559
midst of of Injustice and name it as

104
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:17,600
Injustice what how is it or in what way might the courage to

105
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:23,440
meditate translate or be applied to the

106
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,679
courage to live in our life

107
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:33,720

other person may all beings be

126
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:59,399
[Music] happy

127
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:08,919
thank

128
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,320
you

129
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:20,799
so welcome this is the second talk on the five

130
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:28,600
faculties and when we translate this word poly word indria as faculties we

131
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:35,679
are kind of um diminishing

132
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:42,600
or hiding the power of the word indria the

133
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:48,519
strength of the word word The Faculty just seems like oh it's just like a

134
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:58,720
potential that we have maybe we have a faculty we could use it the word um means of Indra Indra was

135
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:06,799
in the time of the Buddha the the head god of the pantheon of go

136
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:12,480
of gods and maybe in ancient Greece it would you would say like you know

137
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:19,679
qualities of Zeus or in Norway qualities of of uh of

138
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:26,159
um Odin or some great God and

139
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:31,960
um the um and so these are qualities and

140
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:41,120
the and the reason then they qualities that of of um that uh can take charge

141
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:47,480
can really guide and help us to take control in a certain kind of way of our

142
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:52,519
life in in American Buddhism it's the controlling controlling ourself has

143
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:58,360
often seem as as not appropriate but there is a way of it's

144
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:07,519
very appropriate to show up and really take charge of our practice in a in a in

145
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:13,919
a certain way we have these faculties we have these capacities that really Infuse

146
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:19,760
and enliven and give strength to the practices we do and there's nothing

147
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:26,760
wrong with doing Buddhist practice strongly calling upon a capacity for

148
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:35,159
inner strength maybe even a capacity for inner power and it's uh strength and power

149
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:41,080
that can support us to live without hate

150
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:47,159
without greed without conceit without asserting

151
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:52,760
ourselves or wanting to dominate other people or be

152
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:58,799
aggressive not but a power that also keeps us from being being weak or

153
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:05,799
succumbing or collapsing or running away and so this word indria is a

154
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:10,960
powerful word as is the word that's usually transferred as effort the second

155
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:17,360
faculty Viria but viia also is a powerful word and that effort kind of

156
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:25,639
just uh domesticates it in some way or or temps it down just makes it kind of too ordinary and doesn't really uh carry

157
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:32,799
with it that uh in the Indian context is a word of power or strength and um and

158
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:39,080
so in the ancient India and Tibet uh this word sometimes is associated with

159
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:46,519
being heroic heroic effort and for today I was associating with courageous

160
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:53,320
effort and there was a time in American Buddhism when I was growing up in Buddhism where and my when I first

161
00:33:53,320 --> 00:34:01,200
started teaching that um uh chances are I would have been criticized as a man

162
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:07,399
using languages like courage and hero her heroism because it's would seem like

163
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:13,320
too masculine or too something and certainly there can be problems with it

164
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:19,919
huge problems with it but also it's a gift it's it's a necessary part of life

165
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:28,240
is to have a certain degree of heroic effort so that we don't give in to

166
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:37,839
our own personal Tendencies to be weak or to be complacent or to be to eques to

167
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:44,919
our attachments and our clinging and our um

168
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:51,240
aversions the courage to not give into the five

169
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:57,880
hindrances and so this severia again translated as effort heroic effort

170
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:05,960
uh uh is the uh is the corollary to uh the second hindrance

171
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:14,000
which is ill will hostility aversion and um and and then uh the

172
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:21,520
connection between the two where they the bridge or the meeting ground of the two why they're Associated is that um uh

173
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:27,200
ill will has energy in it has power in it anger especially has tremendous this

174
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:34,920
power uh uh that's kind of bubble up sometimes I can feel a volcanic the way that anger is moving through

175
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:43,520
us and um but if anger has ill will with it then um uh it takes a kind of hero

176
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:51,000
heroic effort to not give into that volcano uh in a way that causes harm the

177
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,400
heroic effort to avoid any causing of harm that's the heart of what this her

178
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:02,480
heroic effort courageous effort is in Buddhism Not to cause any harm

179
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:09,920
whatsoever to oneself or to others and so the um so with uh the the

180
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:16,000
energy of anger the idea is to uh have

181
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,200
the to channel that energy don't don't give up the energy of anger unless it's

182
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:29,640
just over the top uh energy engagement that Vitality that's there um is part of

183
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:37,079
the reason some people like their anger they can make them feel alive but if we could take that sense of

184
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:45,280
alive energy and let go of the hostility but keep the energy of anger

185
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:53,560
then it's available for heroic effort powerful like yes let's not yell at

186
00:36:53,560 --> 00:37:00,240
anyone let's show up let's be present but and not be hostile with our body our

187
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:06,520
speech or our mind and uh and to do that towards ourselves not to have any hostility

188
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:13,960
towards ourselves uh not to succumb to these forces inside that uh debilitate us uh

189
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:23,760
deprive us um harm ourselves so to have faith the first

190
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:30,480
um uh of the five faculty or confidence is sets us on the course

191
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:39,160
of practice we know something about practic this is what I want to do this is important and the second effort heroic

192
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:45,480
effort is like be serious like this is what I'm going to do this is not like

193
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:50,680
you know with the faith there's no doubt with faith there's Clarity

194
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:57,880
confidence yes I want to do this it doesn't mean that we are in a hurry or

195
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:03,720
that we strain or that we put ourselves in a situation where we're going to be

196
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:09,280
discouraged by our you know that we can't we're not making

197
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:17,160
progress but an embodied way of saying yes I can give myself to this these

198
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:22,599
values this way of living this approach to life that I'm going to avoid any

199
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:29,359
causing of harm and to do that heroically with

200
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:34,400
courage and um and sometimes the forces of distraction that we're practicing

201
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:42,040
with in meditation are themselves a running away it's a comforting avoiding

202
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:47,720
of what's really happening here for us and it's kind of harmful to do that to

203
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:54,200
avoid not show up honestly for ourselves and sometimes meditation practice is

204
00:38:54,200 --> 00:39:01,839
sitting in the fire is showing up for what's very difficult here with us and learning how

205
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:10,240
to metaphorically stay still take our seat be in the middle of it and not be

206
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:18,440
overcome find in a sense uh some Inner Strength Stillness inner

207
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:23,839
capacity to stay with what is very difficult rather

208
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:29,599
than getting distracted and if uh Things become uh

209
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:35,319
quite peaceful and wonderful in meditation and uh it seems like that

210
00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:41,920
kind of heroic effort is too much probably that's true that

211
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:47,599
effortful heroic effort maybe it's no longer needed maybe it's still

212
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:53,079
heroic um I've been in medit I've had experiences of meditation where I became

213
00:39:53,079 --> 00:40:00,560
very very peaceful and coming out of meditation I had to had uh courage and a lot of

214
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:06,599
confidence or faith that it was okay to stay peaceful when all the people around

215
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:13,560
me were kind of insisting that I should join them in their anger join them in

216
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:20,319
their uh condemning people joining them in gossiping joining them in greed and

217
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:26,800
and um Behavior which you know is not uh harmonious with this deep settled

218
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:34,160
feeling of peace and so it's kind of a heroic thing to say this is where I'm going to

219
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:39,920
maintain this peaceful inner life and be present for what's happening here but

220
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:45,319
I'm not going to uh succumb I'm not going to give in I'm not going to give

221
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:54,280
it up and so to uh so faith is what begins

222
00:40:54,280 --> 00:41:01,359
the practice confidence we have confidence confidence this is a Way Forward even if we're going to experiment even if we're unsure where

223
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:06,880
this Dharma practice goes but we are willing to give it a try there that's

224
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:13,720
some indication of some degree of confidence and what follows that then is

225
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:18,880
uh is really kind of if you're going to do it you know do it with some

226
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:25,640
commitment do it with some strength do it with some courage uh not anything that causes you

227
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:30,720
to be tense it's a the courage to not be tense the

228
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:36,520
courage to engage in a peaceful way and as I keep saying the courage to

229
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:42,680
be nonharming but to show up with

230
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:47,960
embodied energy an embodied Vitality where we take our

231
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:53,520
place the Buddha took his place the night of his Awakening and the classic

232
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,640
statue that uh as I just that just like behind me the Buddha Knight of his

233
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:04,079
Enlightenment is touching the very ground upon which he is sitting in a

234
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:11,119
sense asserting this is my place doesn't have to give in to his

235
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:20,800
forces of greated hatred and delusion that assailed him on the night of his Awakening but he stayed upright still

236
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:26,599
courageous unwilling to give into it unwilling to collapse unwilling to run

237
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:35,359
away but to sit there and be present really present here and

238
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:43,839
now so I hope that uh this talk on courageous effort has hit the right spot

239
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:49,160
that it encourages you to

240
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:56,240
um to be encouraged you know the word encouraged has the word courage in it so

241
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:03,559
it encourages you to have some courage some strength some give yourself uh to

242
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:09,839
not necessarily kind of what you know the practice in terms of meditating and

243
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:15,520
what you do but rather the courage of how you

244
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:22,480
are certainly practice but practice be courageous in how you

245
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:31,880
practice um and in such a way that um it helps you to take refuge in Your

246
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:38,200
Capacity to be peaceful at peace and a

247
