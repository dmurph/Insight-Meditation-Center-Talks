1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,199
so

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,960
sangha

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,960
community

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,760
it is something that you know as we

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,320
start

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,640
coming back

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,599
or

8
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,480
starting to

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,160
engage more

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,760
in communal activities

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,719
it's a reflection it's a reflection for

12
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,000
me to see how it is that you know in

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,520
as conditions change

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,320
there are some aspects of the practice

15
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,718
that

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,960
that still we can

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,719
access that that that are available to

18
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,280
us

19
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,600
and that

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,559
yeah the form may change conditions may

21
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,119
change and still sangha community is

22
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,960
possible

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,920
sangha is here wherever we go we can

24
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,400
find it

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,439
i know you know

26
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,040
the imc community has expanded

27
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,960
to include now so many beings everywhere

28
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,840
wherever you are so happy so happy we're

29
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,560
connected in this way i know you were

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,960
there

31
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,960
i knew you were there

32
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,000
but now you know we have a name or we

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,159
have more voices sharing or

34
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,119
and so it makes me reflect

35
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,399
how this refuge is one of the refuges in

36
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,320
our tradition

37
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,240
in this tradition in buddhism

38
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,200
one of the three jewels buddha dharma

39
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,520
sangha community

40
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,280
how it has evolved how it has grown how

41
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,440
the significance and importance of it

42
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,920
has unfolded more

43
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,040
more clarity in how important has been

44
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,280
and pivotal has been for me in the

45
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,879
practice

46
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,879
i just even like wow bruno you're

47
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,239
talking about sangha like

48
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,720
in the early 90s it was something

49
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,720
completely

50
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,680
something i will not connect with you

51
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,280
know i will come here i remember

52
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,920
coming here and other centers and other

53
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,239
places to practice where i will go and

54
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,920
i will go just to meditate that was it

55
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,159
and

56
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,040
that was like the the main goal you know

57
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,840
and

58
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,000
it's just amazing to see how the

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,879
practice evolves in a way that

60
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,800
make us realize that there are some

61
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,879
fruits of the practice

62
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,920
that then start showing up for us and

63
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,400
that if we are

64
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,599
aware and mindful and we start seeing

65
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,560
you know how it is that this practice

66
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,159
impact us

67
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,000
and in some ways um

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,040
in some ways changes us

69
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,680
yeah in some ways

70
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,440
there are some things that

71
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,720
become more clear

72
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,640
and so

73
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,319
one aspect of sangha one aspect of

74
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,200
community um

75
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,680
that has become more clear

76
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,840
for me has been

77
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,560
something that tina han i started

78
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,080
my the beginning years of the practice

79
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,640
i started practicing in the tignahan

80
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,280
tradition

81
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,239
and

82
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,879
thai would emphasize very much you know

83
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,920
it's like the community how how sangha

84
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,479
is kind of a foundation also for the

85
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,079
cultivation of practice

86
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,440
to a point that

87
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,320
they were moments in which he would say

88
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,960
you know my triage the next buddha would

89
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,840
be the community

90
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,280
and that it is also in community in

91
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,920
sangha where also we can find

92
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,160
[Music]

93
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,720
buddha and dharma

94
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,880
buddha dharma and sangha buddha the

95
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,400
capacity

96
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,040
is like us becoming a word that we have

97
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,080
a capacity to be awakened

98
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,160
that this is not something that is not

99
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,400
accessible to us or

100
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,160
that is like a privileged

101
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,720
way of being or to achieve or but that

102
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,039
is accessible to all of us as human

103
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,000
beings just as

104
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,520
just as the buddha

105
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,639
was able to awaken with

106
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,039
you know the dedication and vision

107
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,199
that he had

108
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,600
that we it is possible it is possible to

109
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,280
be awakened

110
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,160
to be to to see things as they really

111
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,320
are

112
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,120
and so the dharma how it is that many of

113
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,280
us also become the dharma

114
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,000
and that we can see the dharma in each

115
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,280
of us

116
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,000
that we can learn from each other

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,560
wow

118
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,880
that we can learn from each other no

119
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,120
matter where we come from no matter who

120
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,880
we are

121
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,960
that we can definitely

122
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,520
support each other in seeing the

123
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,319
teachings in engaging in the teachings

124
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,639
so yes i'm very inspired and very

125
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,400
inspired by sangha by community

126
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,720
just to see throughout the years

127
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,000
you know there is something as

128
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,840
you know

129
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,680
things change the rising and passing of

130
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,560
circumstances and things and

131
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,120
how it is also that there are changes

132
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,160
within

133
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,360
the sangha and

134
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,440
there's also steady and reliable aspect

135
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,840
of it that we can come back to it that

136
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,440
we can

137
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,319
just remember it

138
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,479
there is this aspect also of the sangha

139
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,120
even sometimes even within

140
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,000
other traditions you know

141
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,440
we may

142
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,720
have a practice within buddhism

143
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,199
and we also may have other practices

144
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,720
other traditions other kinds of ways to

145
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,639
to practice

146
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,800
being fully present

147
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,599
and that could be also part of sangha it

148
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,960
doesn't have to be contained also only

149
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,599
within this you know this way of being

150
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,919
here

151
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,800
and so there is something that we can

152
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,319
take with us

153
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,360
to any any community that were part of

154
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,240
us and it's this aspect of

155
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,080
um

156
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,840
creating

157
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,800
you know companionship and camaraderie

158
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,479
and sharing in how it is for us to to

159
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,120
live this life in a way that

160
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,400
that creates assurance and safety for

161
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,120
each of us

162
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,160
asanga that we know like i said even

163
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,759
though i don't know many of you

164
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,919
that there's an acknowledgement that we

165
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,839
are interconnected that we are connected

166
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,399
and that we care that care grows

167
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,279
that care towards each other

168
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,120
and it touches my heart

169
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,440
it touches my heart especially during

170
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,920
these times

171
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,080
you know these times that you know we

172
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,760
are

173
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,800
again re-engaging and not only because

174
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,519
of you know what is what are we as

175
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,720
part of

176
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,720
the

177
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,560
the community that you know is within

178
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,959
the planet

179
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,880
but also at a personal level

180
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,839
just to see the commitment and

181
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,640
dedication

182
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,839
that we

183
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,240
each of us may have in finding

184

well-being and finding

185
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,600
a sense of

186
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,519
how it is that we can be in this world

187
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,360
and

188
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,000
caring caring for each other at the same

189
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,240
time that we care for others

190
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,160

us so it reminds me it reminds me just

193
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,000

that safety as i'd say cultivating and

221
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,560
creating safety is very powerful for

222
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,760
each other

223
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,480

we learn we learn from others by just

231
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,720
being in the presence of others

232
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,920

233
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,959

261
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,959
this was taken so

262
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,880
you know i i learned from or learned

263
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,320
from other you know other moments other

264
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,240
moments in which i've been you know in

265
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,160
groups or different communities

266
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,680
so we cultivate virtue

267
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,760
you know this aspect of

268
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,279
caring about each other

269
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,040
there's there's

270
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,680
a layer there there's some aspects there

271
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,120
that have to do with

272
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,240
with virtue

273
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,279
with integrity

274
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,839
we support each other

275
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,600
we support each other when we

276
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,319
practice

277
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,720
embodied compassion as we

278
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,480
are with each other too

279
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,600
you know just seeing some things that we

280
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,160
may not like about ourselves and other

281
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,880
things that we are like oh this is this

282
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,720
is part of the

283
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,880
you know beautiful qualities of mine

284
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,880
heart

285
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,639
and these other

286
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,000
other qualities it's okay

287
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,279
it's okay

288
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,959
and maybe we'll learn that

289
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,720
when seeing how it is that we are

290
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,800
treated

291
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,320
by others within our communities these

292
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,160
compassion this kindness

293
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,000
the sincerity

294
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,199
the sincerity the presence how each of

295
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,959
us

296
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,160
embody

297
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,279
this practice also

298
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,040
so as we go deeper in the practice and

299
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,560
we realize

300
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,279
we acknowledge we recognize we give

301
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,120
space respect

302
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,279
to all of us including ourselves

303
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,360
what an amazing support and foundation

304
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,720
we have to cultivate the hateful path

305
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,000
the hateful path in community

306
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,160
because there is a

307
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,320
there is an aspect

308
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,519
there is an aspect of the practice that

309
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,519
you know we start with ourselves we

310
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,399
brought

311
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,440
ourselves here right

312
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,839
so we start with ourselves and there's

313
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,519
you know we start seeing what is the

314
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,839
inner community that we have within us

315
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,560
and

316
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,199
then there's this other aspect of what

317
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,680
is the relational when we are out there

318
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,079
how it is that we relate how it is that

319
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,440
these practices becomes alive in other

320
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,759
ways and the hateful paths

321
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,399
support us not only for our inner

322
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,759
community

323
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,000
the inner sangha but also for the

324
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,120
cultivation of the external sangha you

325
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,839
know

326
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,000
i feel very grateful to sangha during

327
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,640
this time

328
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,678
just to remind me

329
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,120
just to remind me oh you're not alone

330
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,120
or just you have your you know we have

331
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,120
your back

332
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,038
or yeah i've been going through what

333
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,520
you're going through

334
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,120
or just to talk about sangha

335
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,960
to talk what do you think of this

336
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,440
teaching

337
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,360
and suddenly you know we're seeing each

338
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,679
other like ah i see it i said and it's

339
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,840
so great to celebrate to celebrate

340
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,720
so this relational aspect of the hateful

341
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,120
path

342
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,559
this fourth novel truth

343
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,480
that there is a path where that we can

344
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,880
cultivate to be free to

345
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,160
to be at peace

346
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,200
a wise view

347
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,440
the understanding that you know our

348
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,320
actions have consequences our actions of

349
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,759
body speech and mind

350
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,880
and the perspective

351
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,559
of these four insights practices

352
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,600
just seeing how it is that we relate to

353
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,440
our lives in different aspects

354
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,039
remembering the wise intention

355
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,039
wise intention of cultivating

356
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,559
kindness and compassion

357
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,039
and letting go

358
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,080
letting go into more freedom

359
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,240
letting go into

360
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,360
wow

361
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,960
this is not to my service

362
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,760
i okay i see it now

363
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,360
and just

364
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,320
okay thank you

365
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,720
and shifting it's like suddenly we just

366
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,200
don't realize that we have let go of

367
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,120
many things

368
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,919
they're not here anymore many many times

369
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,600
happen it's like

370
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,080
they're not here anymore i'm like how

371
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,039
did this happen

372
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,760
and in some ways it may not be at that

373
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,320
point very important to see

374
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,520
when did it happen how did it happen

375
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,360
but there are some things that are very

376
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,919
evident

377
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,320
and is

378
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,200
how it is that we have cultivating this

379
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,760
path who has been on the path

380
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,280
what has been the steady

381
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,200
steady aspects of the path

382
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,880
and one of those

383
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,159
aspects is you

384
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,640
is the sangha

385
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,200
is your intention is your humanity

386
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,480
no matter you know if we see each other

387
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,960
zoom in person once in a while

388
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,600
but just to have that recognition that

389
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,600
we are here that we are connected

390
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,799
that is enough

391
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,919
so

392
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,880
and then we have this relational aspects

393
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,080
with people that are not

394
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,440
directly practicing

395
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,880
you know within the tradition but

396
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,640
but my gosh

397
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,720
in some ways they're practicing with us

398
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,440
and we're practicing with them

399
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,480
why speech

400
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,919
why speech

401
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,480
wise action

402
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,880
how it is that we create again this

403
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,159
safety

404
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,559
how it is that we engage in the precepts

405
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,960
and how that changes

406
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,200
as we go deeper in the practice we can

407
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,480
we find we find our way in how what it

408
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,280
means to us

409
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,559
and how it is that it offers it offers

410
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,120
safety and connection and support for

411
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,559
continuing on the path to everyone

412
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,600
and now during these times you know this

413
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,159
aspect of wise livelihood comes more

414
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,840
into play for many people

415
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,760
because we are engaging

416
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,039
so many things have changed and we're

417
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,440
engaging back in so many ways and in

418
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,240
different aspects of our lives how it is

419
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,960
that we appreciate or

420
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,000
value you know different ways

421
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,480
of how we use resources how we

422
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,240
live our lives

423
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,720
and this effort

424
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,039
the effort of dedicating touching base

425
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:35,039
coming into contact with the practice

426
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,799
coming into contact with what is

427
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,600
important to us

428
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,400
and so how it is that wise mindfulness

429
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,679
includes all these factors all these

430
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,039
aspects of the hateful path

431
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,200
how it is that when we remember oh

432
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,399
there's a body here

433
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,679
it may be a moment oh this is how yeah

434
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,159
this is how we are

435
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,159
this is this is where we're living right

436
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,039
here right now

437
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,280
and mindfulness a feeling tone how it is

438
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:20,640
that feeling tone can be an entry door

439
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,400
to see how it is that

440
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,960
we relate to what is pleasant and what

441
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,200
is unpleasant

442
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,960
to see how what is pleasant my condition

443
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,960
qualities in the mind that may be

444
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,279
not

445
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,360
beneficial or beneficial

446
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,240
for us

447
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,360
and just you know getting to know our

448
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,480
minds

449
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,799
these sometimes i call it you know this

450
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,360
mind this collective mind

451
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,760
because we are in relation and there is

452
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,400
a you know there's another flavor and

453
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,840
tone to it

454
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,919
mindfulness

455
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,640
and so sangha community

456
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,159
you know for me

457
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,200
in

458
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,880
remembering

459
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,440
remembering sangha or

460
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,840
remembering to be a word to be mindful

461
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,720
when

462
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,080
sangha arises

463
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,640
i can see that it has had

464
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,799
such an impact in how this body and mind

465
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,039
has been able to find some

466
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,000
some some moments of peace some moments

467
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,919
of calm and clarity and discernment

468
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,919
from

469
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,159
the moment in which i started practicing

470
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,039
to now wow

471
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,799
is

472
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,158
a whole different thing

473
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:08,799
just

474
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,600
being able to sometimes see myself fully

475
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,240
and see you fully

476
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,760
and been here

477
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,760
being here for the benefit of

478
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,480
oneself for others and everyone

479
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,200
so i just want to plant the seed for you

480
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,919
to reflect on what what is sangha for

481
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,679
you community

482
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,559
how it is that we cultivate it how it is

483
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:41,000
that we um

484
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,559
cultivate sangha in a way that support

485
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,320
us supports the world

486
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,159
and how it is that you know there is

487
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,000
also this

488
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,880
it's almost like a mirror too

489
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,120
that there is an inner sangha that

490
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,960
connects with these external sangha

491
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,279
all the beautiful qualities

492
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:13,760
of this body-mind heart that we manifest

493
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,559
we manifest through our actions of body

494
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,120
space and mind

495
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,480
