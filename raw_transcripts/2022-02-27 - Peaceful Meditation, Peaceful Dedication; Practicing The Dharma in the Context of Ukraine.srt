1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:08,240
so good morning everyone and those of you here welcome to imc and

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:14,639
for some of you it might be one of the largest gatherings you've even been to in the last two years

3
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:23,680
and if that if that's the case welcome and i appreciate maybe that it's a big deal for your heart to do this

4
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,599
and for those of you who are online welcome and uh appreciate that

5
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:35,840
we have a such a wide ranging community coming together to

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,360
meditate this this day

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,120
so i'll do this uh meditation what i offer in two parts but i'll say a few

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,320
words now and then i'll follow up with that with the dedication of merit

9
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,719
and to begin with i'd like to say that it's a little bit is that hard to hear

10
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:05,680
is a little bit soft should i increase the volume a little bit so let's see

11
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:13,040
so if i listen in silence to see if it got louder it doesn't work is that louder now

12
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,200
you could also use the hearing system devices they they they work still

13
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,960
so so i would like to say to start

14
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,040
is

15
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,159
one of the principles especially in meditation that may be easier to understand here

16
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,439
than anywhere else but it applies in many other places in our life

17
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:52,799
and that is that peace begins in our own hearts

18
00:01:52,799 --> 00:02:00,320
that peace begins for each individual it starts here in ourselves rather than

19
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:07,719
looking for it in the world around us and uh

20
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,800
and uh and in meditation if you can't do

21
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,239
start with peace in your own heart then we have peace

22
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:27,280
in our speech at least out loud we're not speaking

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,440
if uh and ideally we have uh

24
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,560
peaceful speech in our own minds where how we talk about ourselves or

25
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,800
talk about what's going on we try to do it in a way that's coming from a place of peace

26
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,120
of compassion of care generosity

27
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,560
if we can't do that then in meditation we're doing it with our body

28
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,000
we're sitting in a peaceful posture a posture in which we're

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,360
you know we're not going to move particularly unless you have to

30
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,519
make yourself more comfortable so it's not a posture in which you're going to punch someone out

31
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:20,720
to this time this is a peaceful posture and to take refuge in the posture

32
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,879
take refuge and inspiration that for these minutes that this is a place of peace

33
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:32,000
this body take refuge in whatever way in which

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,599
your mind can speak peacefully take refuge in that

35
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,280
interest intention desire to do so

36
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:52,400
and it might be more important take refuge in the desire to do so than our ability to do so

37
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,720
it might be more inspiring and meaningful to be with people and be oneself who has this wish to work and go

38
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:05,680
in this direction and perhaps in your hearts

39
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:12,560
maybe take refuge in your heart's capacity to sit in such a way that

40
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,400
it's peaceful and peaceful means that

41
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:24,960
my understanding is that it's a heart that wishes to do no harm

42
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,800
it wants to avoid causing harm anywhere to self or others

43
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,919
and this is one of the great things to do in this world and that kind of peace begins with

44
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:43,680
ourselves so to assume this posture meditation a posture

45
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,280
that's meant to be a peaceful posture

46
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,879
and to gently close your eyes

47
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,759
and it's possible you don't feel particularly peaceful and that's okay

48
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,400
as you start meditation

49
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,400
the it's okay beginning of meditation

50
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,800
is the beginning of being at peace with what is so for agitated or

51
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,240
angry upset it's okay

52
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,720
because here we're gonna meet everything that is occurring

53
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,560
with an openness with a willingness to be present and see it

54
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:51,039
without condemning anything for these minutes just to be present for

55
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,080
how it goes in us

56
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,840
taking a few minutes to feel your body how's your body now

57
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:23,120
and then within this body is the breathing and from this place within where

58
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:31,120
breathing the in-breath begins take a long slow deep inhale

59
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,960
and as you exhale relax your body

60
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,960
relax into here now the present moment

61
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,440
and then letting your breathing return to normal

62
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:18,639
with a normal breathing for a few rounds of

63
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:26,080
exhales continue to relax your body

64
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,560
and relaxing is a movement towards peace

65
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,919
towards being peaceful calm

66
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:21,520
and then letting go of relaxing

67
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:30,240
the body instead for a few rounds of breathing

68
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,200
if it's possible relax your breathing

69
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:43,440
kind of a lightening up softening and breathing it

70
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,600
allowing the body to breathe itself

71
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:27,200
not trying to use your breathing or influence or to affect your breathing

72
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:33,040
you do the breathing but kind of getting out of the way of

73
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:39,519
breathing and accompany it with your

74
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,160
attention

75
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,120
maybe the idea of being side by side with your breathing

76
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,880
in whatever way that you can easily do so

77
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:18,600
accompany your breathing peacefully with a peaceful attention

78
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,560
as if peace is your offering

79
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,680
what you offer your breathing

80
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,720
so

81
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,680
so

82
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,279
so

83
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,400
okay

84
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,919
you

85
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,679
so

86
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,120
and then as we come to the end of the sinning

87
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:15,120
the dedication of merit of care for the world

88
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:21,120
is not an addendum to meditation

89
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:29,679
it's an expression a peaceful expression that arises

90
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:36,399
out of a peaceful heart it's not a duty

91
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:44,000
obligation but rather continuation

92
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,840
of the care that we offer to ourselves as we meditate

93
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,518
i care that then spreads outwards into the world

94
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,559
it's also a wise thing to do for oneself

95
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,360
if you want to be peaceful

96
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,878
offer peace to others

97
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:22,720
if you want safety be a safe person

98
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:30,960
for others if you want to see heal your sadness or

99
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:38,480
your anger be a healing presence

100
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,040
for the sadness and anger of others

101
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:52,320
if you want to be understood understand others take the time to know

102
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,040
them in their challenges

103
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:06,880
we could offer ourselves in our presence the way we are the way we attend and are aware of

104
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:13,440
others we can offer so much and may it be that as we end this

105
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,440
meditation

106
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:28,160
that we offer our concern and care and kind regard for others

107
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,838
may all beings be happy

108
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,400
may all beings be safe

109
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,720
may all beings be peaceful

110
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:54,599
and may all beings be free

111
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,040
may everyone has been affected by the

112
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:15,359
fighting and crisis of ukraine may they find a way

113
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:20,160
to peace into happiness into freedom

114
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:28,800
may all the forces of goodness in this world

115
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:36,800
come forth at this point to offer this goodness to the world

116
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:45,720
may we offer our goodness may it spread from us into the world

117
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:56,170
[Music]

118
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:05,240
[Music] so

119
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,200
okay

120
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:45,119
so good morning all of you are here thank you for being here

121
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,119
and

122
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:58,160
hello to everyone attending online happy to have you

123
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:06,160
so uh from time to time

124
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,960
all too often there are

125
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:16,960
current events which are so big that it feels that

126
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:25,920
to not address them as part of the dharma talk it shouldn't be done i can't ignore them

127
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:32,640
that this dharma practice that we do is a practice to be present for what's happening in the world to be witnesses

128
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:39,599
and to care and some things are so big that they should be named and

129
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,960
see where we go and so the

130
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:52,480
fighting in the ukraine i think of has affected me this way i i don't think

131
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:59,119
i could not talk about it in some way but what do we say what do we under how

132
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:07,359
we understand this you know there was a earthquake in haiti last summer

133
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:12,560
and that was such a clear event that

134
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:17,839
you know we through the youtube channel and that else here at imc we raised over thirty

135
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:24,720
thousand dollars to dedicate to a wonderful non-profit partners in health

136
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:30,079
and uh and that was seemed clear but with ukraine it

137
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:36,720
it's just there's so much not known yet that's so unknown how this is evolving

138
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:44,000
and what's going to be needed and what's happening so in terms of responding

139
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:51,359
to the what needed there from people like us that's obvious to me

140
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:59,839
but i think being caring and concerned for the people of ukraine and people of russia and a lot of the ordinary people

141
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:08,000
in russia are going to suffer and maybe much of the suffering the world's going to suffer we don't know how

142
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:14,560
this is going to expand and will it spill out beyond the borders of the ukraine

143
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:21,119
and uh so we're kind of just you know at least

144
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:27,920
watching now and seeing and hoping that the people who have some role

145
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:34,000
in addressing this are doing it wisely and carefully and

146
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,640
for the long term and it's hard it's hard to know that it's hard easy to second-guess it's easy to have opinions

147
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:46,079
but it's hard to really know what's going on and what what what is consequential

148
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:53,200
what's going to make a difference 911 happened and as a community we

149
00:40:53,200 --> 00:41:00,000
actually had a special meeting i think on a tuesday evening or wednesday evening

150
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,960
so we could just meet and process it as a community and then uh the second invasion of iraq

151
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:13,839
and the invasion of afghanistan and and these kinds of things go on and on

152
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:20,560
uh you know they've gone down through history there's been war and people attacking each other and

153
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:26,720
and it seems like most times when it happens people say it's different this time

154
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:34,800
and this time ukraine is different because it's always different it's always the same

155
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,720
in some ways it's not news that these things happen it's olds

156
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:46,000
and uh in a bigger perspective this is what human life is about this is the time of

157
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,480
the buddha there was a war the buddha died

158
00:41:52,480 --> 00:42:00,880
you know around him as he as he was getting old and close to his death he was cognizant of that

159
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:07,200
the countries of his area were getting ready to fight and go to war to each other for each other and he witnessed

160
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:14,240
fortifications being built and on his last travels before he died

161
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:21,680
so what is it like to be a one of the great champions of peace in a peaceful way and

162
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:27,920
ethical way of living a non-violent way of living and dedicated his life to that and then

163
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:33,200
to watch around amazing oh to watch that

164
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,440
violence or you know getting ready to start

165
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:44,800
so here we are with this and uh you know and i don't know what to say do

166
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:51,599
you don't know what to say if i could offer opinions but you're not here for my opinions

167
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:58,720
exactly so what did we say one of the things that uh i'd like to

168
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,839
say is that uh this is a time

169
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:11,119
as if there's ever not a time but this is a time to stay close to the dharma

170
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:17,359
and the word dharma includes much more than buddhism to call say to go close to buddhism i think

171
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:22,560
would be almost be a i don't know i was going to say an

172
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:30,720
insult to buddhism because that's buddhism is not about itself the buddhism the dharma is about

173
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,359
the the

174
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:42,240
discovery and expression

175
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:50,240
of a heart that has no conflict a heart which is at peace with itself

176
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:57,440
a heart which doesn't cause any self-harm then one of the ways that self-harm is

177
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:03,720
caused is by harming others

178
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,560
i can't get away from it

179
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:22,560
the one of the definitions for evil a word

180
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:28,880
which i seldom use but many buddhist texts in english

181
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:35,280
translations of the suttos use the word evil as if it's whether it is or not is a

182
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:42,640
scholarly question whether it's appropriate to translate that way but one of the definitions of evil

183
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:48,000
is evil is when the mind turns on itself

184
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:55,200
to harm others the mind turns on itself to harm others

185
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:00,720
and what this implies is certain actions of evil

186
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:06,400
harms the person who's evil certain expressions of hostility

187
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:12,960
harms the person who's hostile and

188
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:19,040
there's a jataka tale these old fables

189
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:25,280
buddhist fables that were composed at some point and

190
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:33,520
there was a donkey who is being led to slaughter

191
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:40,160
i guess for meat or something and uh when the donkey realizes

192
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:47,838
it's going to be slaughtered the donkey's first reaction is to laugh

193
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:53,520
but then after laughing for a while then it starts crying

194
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:58,960
and after it cries for a while the slaughterer says to the donkey what's going on with

195
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:06,319
you i'm about to kill you but first you laugh and then you cry explain yourself

196
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:14,160
and the donkey said well for 500 lifetimes

197
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:21,040
i was reborn as a donkey and this will be the last time

198
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:26,160
it's so great i'm so happy that i'm done with it like he exhausted his karma of

199
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:33,040
being reborn 500 times to the donkey so he's laughing apparently he's happy

200
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:40,640
and then but why were you crying well the reason i was reborn as a donkey for

201
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:46,079
500 times was i slaughtered a donkey

202
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:51,680
500 lifetimes ago and then and now you are going to

203
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:57,640
slaughter me and you will be reborn as a donkey for 500 lives

204
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:06,640
so so you know the car and the teachings of karma is

205
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:11,680
that what you do comes back to you in some form or other

206
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:18,240
and this self-harm is a deeply you know we harm others we harm

207
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:26,720
ourselves so who's harming each other right now

208
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:34,400
and what how are they harming themselves so looking at ukraine and russia i i

209
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:40,880
almost don't want to answer that question i have that principle in my mind and concern

210
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:46,000
but the place i want to apply it the most is to ourselves

211
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,799
how do we respond to all this

212
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:59,680
because unless we can do something directly and if we can please help

213
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:07,359
but unless you can do something directly perhaps peace begins with yourself

214
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:13,839
perhaps that's the person that you can have the most impact on and if you can't if you don't know how

215
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:19,520
to be peaceful is there any hope for the ukraine

216
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:26,400
if we don't know how to resolve our own inner conflict and challenges who can

217
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:33,280
we expecting other people to do it friends of mine just went to spirit rock

218
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:38,319
to participate in the month-long retreat there

219
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:43,760
and and one person was concerned that it was the wrong time to go because what's

220
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:49,440
happening in the world is an international stage is so big and such a big concern and this seemed to be

221
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:56,079
maybe a person didn't say this but be selfish to go off and do meditation like this you know

222
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:03,760
and i said it's the opposite unless you can you know do something for for the

223
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:11,920
world directly this is actually meditating is actually one of the greatest responses you can do

224
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:18,000
because this path of meditation that we're offering in buddhism is a path to get into the bottom of our

225
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,200
own peace

226
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:29,040
to discover our capacity for living in non-conflict in a wise and

227
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:34,480
generous and supportive way how not to hate how not to get angry how

228
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:40,559
not to be hostile how not to be greedy how not to have

229
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:46,000
lust for power and money in such a way they were harming

230
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:53,119
people around how not to live in delusion it's a powerful path that's of really

231
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:58,720
uprooting the attachments the clinging the grasping the fears

232
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:04,240
that are kind of like barbs in the heart or close down the heart or

233
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:11,520
constricted or you know limited it creates a kind of heart that

234
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:17,599
the heart or the good heart we have is lost

235
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:24,558
and when we're not connected deeply to ourselves then it's our surface

236
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:31,599
reactivity which gets the upper hand and surface reactivity

237
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:39,680
is usually not so wise reactivity that you know anger for example reacting angrily to the world

238
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:46,800
it is usually not that wise the consequences are not that good sometimes they are

239
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:53,200
they accomplish what we want in the short term but in the long term do they really help

240
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:59,359
us live in a better world or better situation and i've said this story before but i

241
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:05,040
say yo please allow me to say it again because such a powerful for me lesson

242
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:11,040
that you know i try to live wisely that parent wisely with my

243
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:16,880
sons when they were young and sometimes they were challenging for me

244
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:22,079
with my parenting skills and i felt like you know it was hopeless

245
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:28,720
unless i kind of used my strong voice so i never hit them or anything but i

246
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:35,200
never was in danger of it but uh sometimes i use a strong voice which was done consciously

247
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:43,920
carefully because i didn't know what else to do and like you have to stop what you're doing that you cannot do that anymore

248
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:51,680
and it was effective but then one day i heard my older son

249
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:59,119
use the same voice to his one and a half year old brother

250
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:06,000
and i said what have i done i accomplished what i wanted to do in stopping the behavior but what was the

251
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:12,640
influence what a what a horrible conditioning influence example

252
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:19,520
i gave to a small child that it's okay to do this so he could turn around and do it to his son his brother

253
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:25,119
what does his brother learn and then it goes on right from one

254
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:30,160
person to another one generation to the other and they learn somehow at their early age

255
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:37,359
this is okay but what are the consequences

256
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:44,720
what are the consequences of invading another country the consequences of certainly the people

257
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:52,480
who kill get killed and died when i when i think of war and people getting killed i not only think about

258
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:59,440
the people who get killed but their ripple of their family and their friends and their neighborhood and

259
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:06,960
it goes out and on and on and some of this suffering goes on for decades and decades

260
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:12,880
in my family that i've in i mean i grew up

261
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:18,800
very much uh under the influence i was born after world war ii

262
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:25,839
but i grew up with it as a very strong presence in my family life

263
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:32,240
my parents my grandparents my parents-in-law

264
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:38,880
and their parents all were kind of deeply affected by world war ii and the

265
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:44,079
violence so much so that uh it still affects me

266
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:51,200
to this day i mean uh the uh some of the some of the horrible things

267
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:57,680
that happen to some of them it touches me very very deeply

268
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:04,640
especially because i have two sons the older one who knows firsthand that firsthand knows

269
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:12,000
has first-hand conversations with his grandfather actually um when he was 14 he interviewed my

270
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:18,240
grandfather and did a little video of interviewing him about his my grandfa my father-in-law's

271
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:26,240
experiences in the concentration camps in germany where he was a prisoner

272
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:32,800
and you know it's 70 years ago now or so and uh

273
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:39,680
more and so it's still alive so these things go on and on

274
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:45,920
the uh things that happen in around world war ii still are alive and communities

275
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:51,680
things that happen in civil war still alive in this country and communities

276
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:57,760
so and i would argue that if i may that the violence of the american

277
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:04,720
revolutionary war is still rippling affecting this country

278
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:11,599
coursing through it in a way that we maybe we don't directly see but i think that the violence of that time

279
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:18,799
is still an effect here so it goes on and on these things

280
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:24,720
and uh and so i think about that ripple effect of violence and

281
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:31,520
and what causes does it do so in buddhism there is a very strong in

282
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:36,960
the teachings of the buddha a very strong repeated emphasis

283
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:42,799
on non-harming non-violence on not killing the first precept is not

284
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:48,240
to kill and you don't have to go very far in the

285
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:55,200
teachings of the buddha to find all kinds of direct teachings about the value of

286
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:01,680
radical non-harming radical non-violence even to the extent that

287
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:08,319
if someone's harming you he says do not give in to harm

288
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:14,720
he does say that you can you can strike back

289
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:20,559
if someone attacks you in order to escape so you don't just stand there and

290
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:27,440
passively be beat up but uh but there is this radical strong idea of

291
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:32,480
non-violence and so some people some uh kings in ancient india

292
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:39,200
interpreted this to that they were going to have their army stand down and not

293
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:45,640
by violence not to have capital punishment and all these kinds of things

294
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:50,880
and uh and i have i've had an adult life where

295
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:56,400
i've i felt ever since i was about probably 18 dedicated to

296
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:02,079
non-violence and it was irrelevant for me because when i was 18

297
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:08,640
i was of the age that could be drafted for the vietnam war so it was very alive that i would be

298
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:14,960
called up and had to go and fight the war across the pacific

299
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:21,440
and uh so i had to kind of contend with that you know so war was really a live and present and what do i do if i

300
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:28,400
get drafted and uh and so i was not going to fight

301
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:35,359
i knew that i would not go uh i'm from norway

302
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:40,400
and originally and i went back there a few times and

303
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:46,880
i wasn't drafted because my draft number was so low at that point so i never didn't have to

304
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:52,880
go but a few years later a couple of years later i went to live in norway go back for a year

305
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:59,520
and there i was uh uh surprised to discover that there was a movement

306
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:04,799
of that you could you could be a conscientious objector in norway's mandatory military service for men back

307
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:11,359
then but you could be a conscientious objector and if you were you you didn't have to do the one-year

308
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:17,359
military service that all males had to do but you had you had to do two years

309
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:25,119
of public service a friend of mine spent two years almost two years working in a hospital

310
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:31,839
in order to do the you know the equivalent to support the country i guess but some of the conscientious of

311
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:37,839
objectors in norway protested and they said that um they knew about

312
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:43,040
russia being right nearby and russia you know within that time was still kind of

313
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:49,440
pushing the edges of the border going to see you know testing things i guess and so people

314
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:54,839
were worried about russia and norway in the mid-1970s

315
00:58:55,440 --> 00:59:01,440
and and so some of the conscious objectors who didn't want to become soldiers and fight

316
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:06,480
uh waters wanted to be able to defend the country if it was attacked

317
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:13,200
and they were asking for a training in civil disobedience

318
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:19,440
training and non-violent resistance uh and they were lobbying

319
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:25,359
trying to get that to happen i don't know if it ever happened in norway but it has happened now in sweden and

320
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:30,640
finland they have trainings now i don't know how extensive it is but they train some

321
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:36,480
people there in the techniques of non-violent civil disobedience and non-violent

322
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:43,040
resistance and the reason i can bring it up in the following up talking about how important

323
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:49,520
non-violence is in the teachings of the buddha non-harming that very too often and when people hear

324
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:56,720
that they say well that just means we have to passively allow people to attack us

325
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:03,280
and there no self-defense is allowed you're not supposed to allow to fight back and down through the centuries

326
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:12,000
buddhist kings and buddhist countries have justified standing armies and fighting defensively

327
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,680
because defending yourself is allowed in the dharma they say just not attacking people they're not

328
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:23,119
being the aggressor but how do you know who's the aggressor and

329
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:28,880
who's the defender i mean right now i think the president of russia putin

330
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:35,359
thinks of his himself as a defender that's at least that's what he says and he keeps referring to me being

331
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:40,400
defensive but you know for many of us it looks like he's the aggressor but so where do

332
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:47,440
you decide that so if the if the justification for war

333
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:53,040
is that it's the you know that that's the only way to defend yourself

334
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:58,880
then the buddhist principle of non-violence is is conditional it's situational

335
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:04,079
and then which situations do we live by it and which don't we live by it

336
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:09,520
when i was also around 19 or so i came under very much under the influence of a

337
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:16,960
particular scholar in the united states academic named jean sharp

338
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:23,440
and jean sharp wrote these wonderful he was a scholar of non-violent

339
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:30,480
civil disobedience efforts around the world the non-violent way and resistance by which

340
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:36,880
people resisted successfully

341
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:42,799
dictators and authoritarian regimes and things like that and he has a he had a he has a

342
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:48,799
three-volume book on non-violence that goes through it was kind of

343
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:55,200
eye-opening for me to see ecosmart chronicles and lists all the different techniques

344
01:01:55,200 --> 01:02:00,640
sophisticated techniques that are used by people who engage in this kind of work

345
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:07,359
and and how so many times it's been successful and sometimes it hasn't

346
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:14,079
uh it was interesting he points out that you know mahatma gandhi is the great exemplar

347
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:18,880
of non-violence civil disobedience

348
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:25,920
uh he was inspired by civil disobedience in this in russia in

349
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:31,119
1905. nicholas ii was the tsar of russia at

350
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:37,200
that time there were massive public strikes and

351
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:42,720
demonstrations non-violent ones on the part of the demonstrators

352
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:48,640
that eventually forced caused the nick that mother

353
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:53,760
terzar to create the first uh parliament in russia the duma

354
01:02:53,760 --> 01:03:00,319
and then he had to contend with the members of parliament they shared the power and you know they continue that

355
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:05,359
way but so mahatma gandhi saw that and he said wow that can be done

356
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:10,960
and that inspired him in his work so it's interesting that how important russia would have been in russia as an

357
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:16,400
example given what's happening now in the ukraine

358
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:22,000
there was the orange revolution and you know about that 2004

359
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:27,599
and that was a student-led movement of non-violence that uh brought down the

360
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:32,960
the uh the the russian supported president of ukraine

361
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:38,319
who it probably was uh rigged elections and a lot of corruption

362
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:43,520
but the those students in the orange revolution 2004

363
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:49,920
they were reading gene sharpe he hit because he he was one of the

364
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:55,200
people i know who spent a lot of time as an academic writing and describing

365
01:03:55,200 --> 01:04:00,400
the techniques and the methods of non-violent civil disobedience

366
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:08,160
and he says people will die with non-violent civil disobedience

367
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:15,599
some people say well it doesn't work because if you put yourself on the front line you know they'll just kill you

368
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:21,839
they will maybe but if you put soldiers on the front

369
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:26,920
lines they'll die too

370
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:36,319
fewer people his argument fewer people die with civil disobedience than with armed armed armed struggle

371
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:42,880
so when i say all this that

372
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:47,920
in buddhism this central uh ethical tenet is non-violence

373
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:54,839
non-harming not killing it it's possible

374
01:04:55,280 --> 01:05:02,799
that that strategy that way of living should not be done naively

375
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:09,039
that this is something we bring our wisdom to our intelligence to our reflections to

376
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:16,960
to really engage and think about how can do this what's the practical way what's the wise way what's the active way

377
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:22,559
to do this too many people want to defend

378
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:28,720
themselves and their first strategy is to get a gun in this country

379
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:36,960
are they really safer is that the the instinct is that's how you make yourself safe but is that a really safe way

380
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:42,640
what about doing the research the reflection they look at all the alternative ways to become safe

381
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:49,599
are there other ways to become safe than having a gun are there better ways of becoming safe than having a gun

382
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:56,000
however it takes research and intelligence and engagement in this process

383
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:02,319
and not many people want to do that there's some you know that we want to do

384
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:08,720
the instinctual so i can get on with our lives so here we are with

385
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:14,400
the ukraine and this major event in this world the world and there's so much stress these

386
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:20,799
days with the pandemic and all kinds of other things and politics it's almost like the more stress there

387
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:26,160
is the more stress it produces the more people feel the stress of it

388
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:31,680
all the worry of it all the fear of it all the more they take on stress and then

389
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:39,039
when we're stressed it's a recipe for more reactivity it's a recipe for anger and for fear and

390
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:44,079
for dysfunctional ways of responding

391
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:49,359
with too much stress if we don't not careful with our stress

392
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:58,960
we add to the stress in the world so this practice that we do

393
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:06,960
is a revolutionary thing it's a radical thing to do it's not it's finding a way

394
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:13,119
to not contribute to the stress of the societies of the

395
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:19,599
world it's a radical way of being someone who does the opposite

396
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:26,079
someone who's almost like a a healthy a sink

397
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:31,359
where the stresses of the world can come into us you know we experience it and know it in

398
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:36,480
a present for it and somehow we can process it and empty it and

399
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:41,680
de-stress ourselves from it we can go through the world

400
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:46,720
committed to not adding to this stress of the world

401
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:52,960
not committed not to add to the violence of the world to the anger of the world

402
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:59,760
to do our work is such an important thing what we're doing someone has to do it

403
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:07,200
some people have to show everyone else that it's possible to become free

404
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:13,039
of these instinctual forces that one way the other contribute to causing more

405
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:19,278
harm and more harm and responds to harm with more harm and passes it on from generation to

406
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:24,798
generation someone has to do this work

407
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:30,880
and there are people who are doing it all over the world we're not alone in doing it

408
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:36,798
but i think this is what this practice we're doing is about most importantly

409
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:42,400
and i would say that the reason i'm here today

410
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:49,120
and because i'm here you're here today

411
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:54,480
imc is here in edward city today wonderful one of the

412
01:08:54,480 --> 01:09:02,238
causes for why this whole youtube thing is happening and we have video camera on it happening today

413
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:09,120
one of the conditions for all this is because

414
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:14,640
i believe i believed when i was quite young

415
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:19,758
that this work of finding peace in oneself

416
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:25,838
becoming free and oneself of clinging and reactivity

417
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:31,798
is a way of responding to war in this world

418
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:41,040
my whole first interest in buddhism was as a response to the vietnam war

419
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:49,199
my whole reason to become to dedicate my life to buddhism was because of witnessing

420
01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:54,640
from a distance the violence of war in the early 80s and

421
01:09:54,640 --> 01:10:00,719
being deeply impacted by it war has been part of my life and the you

422
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:07,199
know something i'm conscious of and aware of without ever i never had the misfortune of being in the presence of

423
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:14,400
it really hardly at all but it's been it's part of my my whole

424
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:21,600
life experience that it's influenced me and it's part of the reason why i'm dedicated to be a dharma teacher and to

425
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:28,080
do all this for me this is not only

426
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:33,120
stress reduction so we can go back to work and live stress for you at work

427
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:39,040
this is a revolutionary activity if we go to the depths of our heart and really

428
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:45,520
find a way to uproot the deepest attachments we have

429
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:51,199
and we become peacemakers for this world

430
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:58,280
and maybe just locally maybe it's just for our neighbors

431
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:04,880
but uh how does it ripple out from your neighbors

432
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:11,040
who do you know who you don't know who you touch and how this goes out and out and out into

433
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:19,120
the world peace begins with ourselves if you want a peaceful world

434
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:26,400
start with yourself find out how you can

435
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:32,560
be at peace find out how you can walk in peace

436
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:38,800
how you can speak in peaceful ways how you can relate to others in ways that they don't

437
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:44,320
feel that they feel safe and feel like there's another way

438
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:48,560
and learn how to be in conflict

439
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:55,840
wisely and this is you know we're not going to not be in conflict

440
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:01,040
with people i think that's that's not part of what life is about

441
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:07,120
but can we be in conflict peacefully with them can we be in conflict or in a sense

442
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:12,880
where the the motivation for how we are with the conflict

443
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:18,320
is cooperation not competition

444
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:25,040
not not to win and they lose

445
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:32,000
but can the motivation be how can we both win there will be conflict conflict doesn't

446
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:41,120
betray peace it does not mean the absence of conflict to have peace is the absence of harm

447
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:51,120
so that's what not knowing what to do for the ukraine at this juncture

448
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:57,360
i feel like we do the the other great thing

449
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:03,120
for the ukraine at least let's do our practice

450
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:09,840
stay close to the dharma stay close to the practice let what's happening in the world to be

451
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:16,000
an inspiration and to evoke a wonderful aspiration

452
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,640
that this practice is so important so valuable

453
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:26,880
you know it's it is a way of responding to the world to happily know you have

454
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:33,120
something precious in this practice maybe there's ways you can give

455
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:39,679
yourself to this practice a little bit more that will feel like a reason that you

456
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:44,719
know is a response to what's happening in the world you're not ignoring it

457
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:52,800
you're responding in this powerful way by becoming a person

458
01:13:52,800 --> 01:14:00,600
who's a beacon for peace wouldn't that be great for all of us to deal with

459
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:06,560
so those are my thoughts today and uh wouldn't it be great if this is

460
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:13,199
the last time i give a talk and responding to war in this world

461
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:18,480
i have i have hope that that's the case though that's probably naive

462
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:24,960
and one of the reasons i have some hope is that as much as we're seeing fighting

463
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:30,640
going on in the ukraine we're seeing right currently at least the international community

464
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:36,080
responding nonviolently and economically

465
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:41,679
who knows maybe it'll teach us that war is old-fashioned

466
01:14:41,679 --> 01:14:46,960
and war doesn't really work and we have to find other ways

467
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:54,159
to work through our conflicts than through war so hoping so i have high hopes for

468
01:14:54,159 --> 01:14:59,679
the sanctions the economic debate that this will be seen as a non-violent

469
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:07,199
way of responding to aggression and will make a difference

470
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:13,760
so may we all find ways to be non-violent in our lives

471
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:21,840
and support that in the world around us and if you want to learn more i read some of the works of gene sharp

472
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:28,920
thank you so thank you
