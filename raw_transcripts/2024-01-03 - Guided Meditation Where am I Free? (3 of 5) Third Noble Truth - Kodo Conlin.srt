1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:08,000
so good day welcome welcome

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,678
welcome so today we'll continue with our our discussion of the Four Noble

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:26,720
Truths I'm taking nourishment from this um chat that I see going

4
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:33,600
along all these different cities countries time

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:41,239
zones morning afternoon evening here it's just uh just about

6
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:48,399
Dawn and there's a there's a gentle rain that I can hear on the roof perfect sounds for

7
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,600
meditating so let's uh let's start

8
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,280
there our meditation this morning will be a simple

9
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,840
one

10
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:44,070
and we'll begin the settling process then once um once the bodies are

11
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:49,479
[Music] still and the breathing begins to regulate

12
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:55,679
then I'll just offer a one question for

13
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,840
reflection

14
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,879
let's begin by inviting Stillness from the inside

15
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,760
out

16
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:53,040
it helps to be settled squarely on your seat or

17
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,760
support

18
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,560
arranging the hands so the shoulders aren't pulled

19
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,680
forward

20
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:44,560
and for a few times breathing breathing in such a way that you bring breathe all the way

21
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:51,319
down the Torso as far as the breathing will

22
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:01,680
go and all the way out

23
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:47,720
allowing the breathing to return to normal when you're ready

24
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,720
self-regulating and letting go of any any extra tension in the

25
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:10,919
limbs arms and hands

26
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:17,280
hips thighs

27
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:24,960
Knees Down to the heel and the

28
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,479
toes

29
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,479
settling

30
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,800
[Music]

31
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
for

32
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:36,059
you [Music]

33
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200

[Music]

35
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:21,800
staying here with what's more

36
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,160
simple simple breathing

37
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,959
simple

38
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:45,800
sensation in a way that's

39
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
peaceful

40
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
for

41
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,649

[Music]

47
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:18,160
meditating for these minutes degree of settledness may

48
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:25,560
have increased maybe from a one to a

49
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:32,040
two maybe a five to a and

50
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:43,299
[Music]

51
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:53,120
eight to offer this question into our meditation not for

52
00:14:53,639 --> 00:15:00,680
pondering just to see what responds

53
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,729
right [Music]

for

57

for

58
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,678

in a moment I will ring the bell to end the

76
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:59,780
sitting what would it be or how might it be

77
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:05,919
[Music] possible to

78
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,320
extend any sense of peace or

79
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:18,559
Freedom beyond the sitting extending

80
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,080
any sense of

81
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,880
Freedom Beyond this this

82
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:35,640
meeting into the activities of the

83
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:50,880
day May all beings keep Freedom

84
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,320
close

85
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:22,710
[Music]

86
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,240
that

87
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:09,440
so welcome again and this morning continuing with the discussion of the Four Noble

88
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:18,200
Truths some Reflections on the third the third Noble Truth the sensation of

89
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:24,279
suffering um part of what I am want to emphasize this morning is uh a

90
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:30,679
reflection for us and that is how to or Orient ourselves and our practice toward

91
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:36,279
a radical freedom in a way that inspires inspires

92
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:41,639
us Keeps Us encouraged so as we've been talking

93
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:48,720
about the last couple of days the task of the first Noble Truth is to

94
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:56,080
understand understand the nature of suffering and to observe it in our direct

95
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:02,480
experience task of the second Noble Truth is um to abandon that craving that

96
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:09,240
leads on to suffering to becoming and suffering to abandon it the way we might

97
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:14,000
abandon a sinking ship for our own

98
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:22,279
well-being and then we come to the third Noble Truth which has the task of uh the third Noble Truth is to be

99
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:30,799
realized it's to be made real it's to be known known and seen

100
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:39,360
directly so in the classic suta on this topic the setting in motion the wheel of

101
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:44,519
the dma the Buddha puts it this way he says

102
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:50,840
now this buus is the noble truth of the cessation

103
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:59,600
of suffering it is the remainder fading away and sess of that same craving the

104
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:05,200
craving of the second Noble Truth The Giving Up and relinquishing of

105
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:11,519
it freedom from it non-reliance on

106
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:17,440
it remainder fading cessation giving

107
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:25,159
up relinquishing freedom

108
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:34,360
non-reliance I wonder what you hear but I I hear I hear a certain kind of

109
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:39,880
Independence uh a certain kind of agency something

110
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:45,679
powerful uh about in a in a certain sense being being

111
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:53,600
um being freed from the influence of this craving in our lives not relying on

112
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:59,960
it it it sounds so refreshing just to say the that set of

113
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:09,000
words so Gil in writing about nibana uh the ending of suffering uh

114
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:16,398
puts it this way he says a nibana which we could say is the one-word definition of the third Nal truth says it's the

115
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:22,679
good news of terraa Buddhism I like that keeps us

116
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:29,638
encouraged so he puts it this way niana literally means to go out like a fire or

117
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:35,200
to cool and applied to the mind it refers to the extinguishing of the

118
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:40,800
fevers of greed hate and delusion the three roots of

119
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,480
suffering the Buddhist choice of this term Nana was intimately tied to the

120
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:55,440
imagery of his famous fire sermon where he describes all the senses as on fire on fire with greed hatred and

121
00:34:55,879 --> 00:35:02,760
delusion it's a really interesting choice to use uh fire imagery to talk

122
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:08,640
about nibana because in uh in what we've seen uh one of the conditions for the

123
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:15,040
arising of suffering is clinging sense contact conditions a

124
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:20,359
certain kind of craving conditions clinging identity and so on to

125
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:25,640
suffering and there's this really interesting point about the poly word

126
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:31,079
the Buddha's word for clinging aana is the same as the word for

127
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:40,240
fuel and if you take the fuel away then the fire can't burn and suffering is

128
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:47,760
extinguished Gil sums it up by saying understanding how deep rooted and subtle

129
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:54,319
this clinging is in our own minds our own unliberated minds we come to appreciate the mind of nibana as

130
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:58,800
refreshingly cool and peaceful

131
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:10,000
so something about the third Noble Truth a sensation of that very craving the sort of breaking of the

132
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,720
chains of conditions that lead from ignorance to craving to Dua to

133
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:23,839
suffering something about it is that it's it's utterly radical in the extent

134
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:29,280
to how free one can be if you look at the Buddhist teaching the Buddha

135
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:35,599
describes uh the possibility of a freedom that is complete totally extinguished free from

136
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:42,960
suffering a radical Freedom uh the the old image is like um

137
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:50,280
one's ignorance is made like a palm stump if you you can imagine a a palm tree that's been cut down for some

138
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:57,240
reason and then uh no tree will grow from that stump or root again

139
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:02,760
it's that final so is so is the ending of suffering that's possible in the

140
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:09,480
Buddhist teaching and this points us right to the what I want to say about the the art of

141
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:15,480
relating to the third Noble Truth and that is how can we do so in a way that's

142
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:22,200
encouraging and inspiring for us and for others um without getting discouraged

143
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:29,760
actually one of the one of the things that can come up when thinking about such a radical possibility of Freedom

144
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:35,480
one is great inspiration and energy another thing that could happen is the

145
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:43,400
the um there's a sort of measuring stick that comes up in the mind and measures the the metaphorical miles from oh this

146
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:50,680
is my mind now to oh that's that's a A Million Miles Away freedom is a

147
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:57,240
million miles away from here and people can get discouraged from that so so part of the

148
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:05,240
art is how to stay encouraged how to how to relate to a radical ideal and stay

149
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:10,359
encouraged we have a lot of help with this in the tradition um one of the

150
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:15,960
first things is a a frame of mind that that is that um in just the

151
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:22,599
way that Dua suffering is not abstract it's right here so too can we look right

152
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:29,119
here for Freedom we can look right here in what's here for uh freedom to this

153
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:34,880
extent it's not an abstract thing when the Buddha monks were described as the happy

154
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,880
ones and it um in a conversation with saruta one of the Buddhist Chief

155
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:46,319
disciples we learn that it's it's visible it's evident his freedom is uh

156
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:52,920
can be seen with our own eyes not abstract but something right

157
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:58,520
here something tangible

158
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:06,040
so some of the ways to stay encouraged these are the things these are the things I want to I want to offer

159
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:11,760
one uh is uh first this principle recognizing that there are Pleasures all

160
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:18,720
along the way of the path there's nourishment all along the way like we're very well well supported along the path

161
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:26,160
from here to the final goal of Dharma practice one is a a sort of nourishment

162
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:31,200
we know well and that those are the pleasures of mindfulness

163
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:36,480
practice the nourishments of mindfulness practice others might be the joys of

164
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:42,920
Sana Community I think now of this uh this community that's that's here on

165
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:50,200
these weekday mornings sitting and reflecting together they're the sort of nourishments of the well-being of

166
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:56,880
receiving of compassion and of giving it there's the the Beauty and

167
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:03,160
encouragement and insight also of uh the sort of discoveries the energy that comes from the discoveries and insights

168
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:08,359
that we have in our meditation and then how those affect us

169
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:15,079
off the cushion so to speak maybe the sort of lightness and peace that extend into our

170
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:20,800
day and then of course the happiness of concentration and what they call the

171
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:28,560
Bliss of blamelessness the the nourishment of a mind free of

172
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:35,200
regret so many joys so many joys to keep us encouraged along the way from here to

173
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:40,760
the end of the path one I'd like to talk just a little

174
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:47,839
bit about are called the the rendered temporary liberations of the

175
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:55,319
Mind chto Viti chetto is like chto is mind Viti is a

176
00:40:55,319 --> 00:41:00,880
liberation and it's so interesting looking in the looking in the old um the

177
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:07,560
old texts that there are there are a number of liberations of the mind that actually aren't all the way at the end

178
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:14,640
of the path like they don't they don't wait for us to arrive however many miles away before experiencing them and being

179
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:21,800
nourished by them one is related to the practice of loving kindness I mean we get a sense of this

180
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:29,920
when we practice meta just a just in a moment wishing Wishing Well cultivating an

181
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:38,560
intention of Good Will brings so much Beauty and lightness into the heart just just a a moment of it feels so good can

182
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:44,119
feel so good and then that that um that practice

183
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:49,160
of meta becomes a liberation of the mind when it's when it's cultivated to such

184
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:55,319
an extent that the heart and mind is sort of suffused with loving kindness and the

185
00:41:55,319 --> 00:42:00,440
mind becomes quite unified without without an experience of

186
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:08,319
a boundary between inside and outside it's a very beautiful St and a a sort of and qualified as a

187
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:14,760
temporary liberation of mind uh the same process is held for

188
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:19,800
compassion and this this is really interesting because it it keeps us in

189
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:25,280
contact it keeps us related uh with the suffering of the

190
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:33,000
world our practice our practice happens right here right here with with all

191
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,599
this and the practice of compassion keeps our keeps our our heart alive

192
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:44,319
awake beautiful and we know that suffering is right

193
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:49,599
here but there's a way of cultivating cultivating compassion to the extent and

194
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:54,839
just just as just as with meta that compassion suffuses the heart and the

195
00:42:54,839 --> 00:43:00,160
mind and the mind UNIF ifies in such a way that we have a sort of temporary

196
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:06,119
liberation of the Mind One of These encouragements one of these encouragements that's available to

197
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:11,680
us so I I describe these I describe these um just so we know that say we're

198
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:17,760
say we're walking along quite a long path um you can trust that you're going

199
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:23,680
to find nourishment you need as you go I'd like to wrap all this up with the

200
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:31,400
image of a sailing the sailboat uh you can imagine in say say

201
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:37,480
you're going to Embark uh in one of two ways uh so you can embark on the

202
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:42,880
sailboat one with this attitude of oh how I wish for the shore the shore is so

203
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:48,520
far away from me I'm pining I'm pining now do you do we hear the craving

204
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:55,079
and the clinging and the becoming and the dukka that uh that attitude hurts right

205
00:43:55,079 --> 00:44:00,480
away and then we can turn our mindfulness to that if that's the attitude that comes

206
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:07,400
up so that's that's the first attitude with which we can Embark and then the other is an attitude that knows that we

207
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:14,839
have the provisions for the the journey we have the faculties we have the patience we've got the resources and the

208
00:44:14,839 --> 00:44:21,520
resourcefulness we can trust our Ingenuity and our energy we have a map and compass and rope and enough

209
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:27,319
food and we have this attitude of setting out

210
00:44:27,319 --> 00:44:33,760
that uh we can do this I can um I can set out on my boat I can tack this way

211
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:40,559
and that I know how to stay safe on the path and I can treasure the

212
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:49,200
sea yeah which of these two attitudes can we can we take out which one do we

213
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,480
prefer and which one uh which one enjoys the

214
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:00,240
sea and arrives at a shore of

215
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:07,400
Peace so may we all be oriented and encouraged prepared and Endeavor

216
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:13,599
together on this path of the third Noble Truth the final ending of

217
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:20,400
suffering and tomorrow we'll turn to the fourth Noble Truth and look at some of uh how we put the conditions in place

218
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:26,839
for the arising of this liberating wisdom take care may all

219
00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:32,280
beings be free and treasure the

220
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,880
path
