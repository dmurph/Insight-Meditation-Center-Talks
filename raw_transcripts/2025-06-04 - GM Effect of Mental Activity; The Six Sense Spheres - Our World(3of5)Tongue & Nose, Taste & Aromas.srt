1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:10,080
okay it's the top of the hour many different hours depending on

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,440
where you are in the world wherever it is i hope you're having a good

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:24,400
day and welcome welcome to our uh weekday morning sit and darmat and today

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,679
is the um third day of uh this week's investigation of

5
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:36,239
what the Buddha called the world the six internal sense spaces and uh their

6
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:43,160
objects the avenues through which we come to perceive and conceive the world

7
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:50,559
that's language from Ananda um a monk one of the Buddha's disciples

8
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:56,239
his his cousin and attendant so we perceive that is we take

9
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:03,720
in through our senses and we conceive we develop ideas and concepts about what is

10
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:11,280
perceived and our experience of our world comes into being through the interaction of these

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,320
so I talked about the I talked about the sense of sight on Monday and then

12
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:23,720
yesterday about hearing and today I'm going to talk about two senses that are very closely

13
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:30,759
related taste and smell and we know now because of

14
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:36,479
science that um the sense of taste is really dependent upon the sense of smell

15
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:43,200
that it's difficult to detect flavor if our sense of smell is not operating i

16
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,000
don't know if that was common knowledge in the Buddhist time you know those those two uh senses are always spoken of

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,759
separately as far as I know in the in the sutras in the texts but I'll talk

18
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:01,759
about them both today and often together in concert and of course if I didn't

19
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,360
conflate two senses sometime during this week five days wouldn't be long enough

20
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,879
to talk about all six of them so there's a practical reason for it but it makes

21
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:19,760
absolute sense so yesterday I mentioned um a story that

22
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,280
Ajan Cha used to tell about practicing outside a village where there was a

23
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,000
festival going on and he was getting irritated by the loud music that was

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,160
playing and uh and how he finally came to realize that it wasn't the sound that

25
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,640
was bothering him it was him bothering the sound and uh yesterday my husband

26
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,160
commented that he's always been a little bothered by that language because sound

27
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:56,400
itself can't be bothered no but which of course is true but my sense is that what Ajan Cha

28
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:04,400
was pointing to was that all the bothering that was being generated was being generated by his own reactivity to

29
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,560
the sound he was blaming the sound for his discomfort and maybe blaming is a

30
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,319
kind of uh bothering and there's a really important

31
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,319
lesson in that story that I want to be more specific about today um I mentioned

32
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:28,080
yesterday that people often have a tendency to uh to blame the object of

33
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:36,480
their sense perception for their discomfort for their stress for the desire or craving that arises in them um

34
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,400
when we see something we don't like the tendency is for us to focus on what we

35
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,159
see as the source of our discomfort we conflate our reaction to the sense

36
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:54,560
contact with the actual sensing of it we forget uh the difference between nama

37
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,920
and rupa that Gil talked about last week appearances and mental

38
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:08,560
activity when we hear a sound that we don't like we tend to blame the sound for bothering us just like John Shaw did

39
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:16,479
but the sense contact did not cause the the discomfort that our reaction did did

40
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,919
that our action was actually the discomfort the problem is the way in

41
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:27,440
which we're conceiving in reaction to the perception and that's that's what's

42
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,639
called in the sutas a fetter that arises in the mind in the chitta in the

43
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:42,960
heart and there's a teaching about this in the sutras that I want to just quote from um another monk uh comes to sit by

44
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,199
Sara who is the Buddha's foremost disciple in wisdom always often called

45
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:53,198
that and here's Here's a here's a quote from the

46
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:59,520
suta after an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies this other monk

47
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,680
sat to one side and as he was sitting there he said to venerable Sar Puta "Now

48
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,759
tell me friend Sar Puta is the eye the feder of forms or are forms the feder of

49
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:18,880
the eye is the ear the feder of sounds or our sounds the feder of the ear is

50
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,160
the nose the feder of aromomas or are aromomas the feder of the nose and same

51
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,199
with the other senses he went on concluding with the mind is the mind the

52
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,639
feder of mental activities or are mental activities the feder of the mind and

53
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:41,680
sorry responded no my friend the eye is not the feder of forms nor are forms the

54
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:48,080
feder of the eye whatever desire and passion arises independence on the two

55
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,639
of them that is the feder there the ear is not the feder of sounds

56
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,560
nor are the sounds the feder of the ear whatever desire and passion arises in

57
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,160
dependence on the two of them that is the fetter there and he goes on with

58
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:13,280
each of the other senses concluding with the with the mind again the mind is not the feder of

59
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:21,120
mental activities nor are mental activities the feder of the mind whatever desire and passion arises in

60
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:28,240
dependence on the two of them that is the feder there and of course desire and uh

61
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,759
passion that just that's a kind of shorthand for all the kinds of uh mental

62
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:40,080
complications that arise out of uh out of greed hatred and delusion that that

63
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,400
can arise in that space so the feather lies in how how we

64
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,400
are relating to what is happening just as as we did with sight and hearing in

65
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:59,919
the past two days we want to make the distinction between the tastes and smells that we sense and then the mental

66
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:05,639
activity that that comes along with them to see where that activity might be

67
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:11,919
creating some kind of knot you know some obstacle to to really feeling free to

68
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:19,240
being at ease so with that uh with

69
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:25,919
that uh intro we'll uh we'll sit now let's sit let's

70
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,919
meditate

71
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,960
so finding your your good meditation

72
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,919
posture a way of sitting or lying down or standing whatever posture you happen to

73
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,880
be in whatever posture works for you that allows you to feel awake and

74
00:07:51,880 --> 00:08:01,479
aware alert to what's going on in your experience and also relaxed

75
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,560
and again I'll I'll invite you

76
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:27,280
to do a a brief body scan just letting your attention move through the

77
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,640
body touching any places where there's

78
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:38,800
tension and just maybe using the

79
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:49,480
breath as a kind of massager to let those areas ease

80
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:55,720
up them soften as much as they're ready to go

81
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,279
let the chest and belly be open and soft so that the the breath can move in and

82
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,920
out really freely

83
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,640
let the belly be soft so that it can just expand on the inb breath and and

84
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,240
gently fall on the outreath

85
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:36,120
if you like to spend a little bit of time with sound um that can be a nice way of

86
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:43,320
settling just attending to the the sounds in in the room where you

87
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:50,920
are the sound of my voice in a very receptive useful way just receiving the

88
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:58,800
sound not reaching out for it as we've uh we explored

89
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:11,880
yesterday just inviting a sense of receptivity into the awareness into the

90
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,360
mind and the body

91
00:11:53,279 --> 00:12:00,079
and moving moving the attention to the breath tending to the rhythm of the

92
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:05,880
breath maybe in and out like a like gentle

93
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:12,959
waves just climbing up a beach and slowly

94
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:20,040
receding over and over again little bit different each

95
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,600
time never the

96
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:29,839
same

97
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:46,160
inviting the rhythm of the breath to calm the body and the

98
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:01,639
mind in and out rising and falling

99
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:21,199
and as you as you sit just attending to your breathing or maybe being open to

100
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:26,760
other experiences sometimes thoughts will

101
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:32,839
arise maybe in response or reaction to what's happening in your

102
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:38,320
meditation maybe due to uh you know triggered by memory of something

103
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,560
something in the past or some anticipation of

104
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:51,480
something to come something in the future and just note just

105
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,720
notice the ways that thinking complicates the inner landscape the way

106
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,759
it's different from just receiving the sensations of

107
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:08,000
breathing other sensations that you're

108
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:14,880
experiencing just notice that notice the effect in your

109
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:21,519
body is there tension associated with

110
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,639
with thinking when it arises

111
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,839
constriction in the mind

112
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:05,400
and then as you sit you know just know that it's possible to

113
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:13,600
recognize the difference between what is happening in the body as we sit here and

114
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:21,760
the mental activity that accompanies It comments on it reacts to it analyzes

115
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:28,200
whatever the activity is can be done in a very simple

116
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,280
way just noticing and then see if you can just

117
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:41,799
let it go let it all [Music] go soften into a simple receptive

118
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:48,320
presence sensing the breath sensing other

119
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:58,360
sensations maybe sensing the metal activity in the same receptive way not

120
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:05,039
getting involved in it not taking part in

121
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:12,679
it just be simple

122
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:11,120
any any kind of calm or ease that you feel as a result of sitting this this

123
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:18,440
half hour any sense of rightness

124
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:30,360
appreciation and you turn that outward and offer it

125
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:37,480
to those around you those farther out to the

126
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,960
world to all beings

127
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:50,120
with a wish that all beings may be

128
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:55,039
safe that all beings may be

129
00:29:57,399 --> 00:30:02,600
happy that they have the strength to meet what comes in their

130
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:11,080
lives and that all beings everywhere may be free

131
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:44,419
[Music]

132
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:20,919
noah welcome again hope the bell wasn't too

133
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:26,200
loud seems quite loud to me

134
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:36,399
so there was a reaction to that the sound in my mind the sense oh I did

135
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,640
something wrong made it too

136
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:47,279
loud so um in that teaching that Saruta offered

137
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:54,640
the other monk that I was uh uh talking about before the sit um he continued to

138
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:01,440
ex to he continued with a a simile to explain what he meant by a feder arising

139
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,960
in uh in dependence on the

140
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:13,440
two the sense space and its object it he

141
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:21,279
said uh excuse me he said suppose that a black ox and a white ox were joined with

142
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:27,279
a single collar or yolk if someone were to say the black ox is the feather of

143
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:32,320
the white ox or the white ox is the feather of the black speaking this way

144
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:42,320
would they be speaking rightly and the other monk said "No my friend the the the black ox

145
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:50,640
is not is not the feder of the white ox nor is the white ox the feder of the black the single collar or yoke by which

146
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:59,360
they are joined that is the feder there what lies between them the single

147
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:05,360
collar or yolk and then Saruta goes on to say that if the sense organs were

148
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,640
actually the feathers of their objects or vice versa there wouldn't be the

149
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:18,000
possibility of liberation because if that were the case there would always be a feder present

150
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,440
they would be fettered to each other as long as we are alive and our senses are

151
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:29,760
operating there would be no escape you know it would be like being tied to a a

152
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:35,960
perch like the falconer's hawk not allowed to fly

153
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:42,640
free but because the feder arises independence on both because it is a

154
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,760
knot sort of between them that complicates their relationship we have

155
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:55,600
the potential to uh to untie that knot to that fetter and to and to be free to

156
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:01,360
fly and at the end of uh of this suta Sar

157
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,640
Puta describes how the sense bases and their objects are all still operating in

158
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:12,960
the Buddha but he isn't fettered by any of them no reactivity arises in him in

159
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,638
relation to the sense spheres he sees and hears and tastes and smells and has

160
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:25,440
thoughts but his relationships to those uh sense activities is not complicated

161
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:31,839
by unhealthy desire or aversion or a need to take possession of the activity

162
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:37,679
you know to create a self around it i think this is so important to

163
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:44,000
remember you know the end of the world in the Buddhist sense doesn't come

164
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:52,000
because we've uh we no longer have the use of our senses that would mean we'd be dead it

165
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,520
comes when the senses are allowed to operate as they naturally do and no

166
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:06,280
fedters arise instead what is present is clear seeing equinimity generosity care

167
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:12,320
meta qualities that arise from deep within that become our natural way of

168
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:20,320
relating to what's happening once we've thoroughly thoroughly let go it's a gradual process

169
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:25,920
of course so when we're attending to what's coming

170
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,440
in through our senses dealing with some habitual reactivity that's creating

171
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,560
stress in our lives whether um it's a craving that's really pervasive or

172
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:45,079
something uh that's something that's more on the aversive side that's that's pervasive anger or irritation or

173
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:51,119
disapproval judgment that seems to arise maybe in particular situations whatever

174
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:58,720
it is It's really useful it's really useful to remind ourselves that that reactivity is

175
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:04,880
something we actually have some power over it isn't hardwired it isn't built

176
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:10,400
into the activity of the senses in some permanent way it's really what our

177
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:18,160
practice is about but I think we probably all know that recognizing uh what is uh

178
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:26,079
obstructing us and seeing you know can it be let go what good is it doing us

179
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:32,160
the feathers that arise they might be you know really deeply ingrained conditioned from a really early time in

180
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:37,200
our lives but they're still something that we can work with something to come

181
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:43,680
to know with with deep sensitivity great sensitivity and eventually we can let go

182
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:50,079
of them and the beginning of becoming free beginning of becoming free of

183
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:56,280
anything is recognizing that it's there knowing that uh whatever it is is

184
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:04,680
conditioned and conditioning is changing all the time and we have a role in that

185
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:13,280
process so today I'm going to focus on on smell and taste and uh boy these two sens these

186
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:20,240
two senses are really a big part I think of what drives many people's uh sense desires you know food and drink of

187
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:25,440
course and and that's what mostly fills this realm I imagine food and drink what

188
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:32,640
comes in to our mouths and what we smell actually odors there have other other

189
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,839
sources um but what we All the flavor of food um

190
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:44,000
scientists tell us is made up of both taste and aroma um and you know a lot of

191
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,400
people uh during the COVID pandemic and also as a result of other illnesses have

192
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:56,320
lost their sense of smell and um and many are still affected by that and and

193
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:02,400
uh uh I know I've heard just many people several people say that when uh when

194
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:08,160
their their sense of smell came back they were uh so grateful when it

195
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:17,119
returned because when when their when it wasn't operating they just lost all interest in in food and uh in eating and

196
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:24,320
in cooking for their for their friends and families all that the tongue can taste

197
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:30,359
without the sense of smell is the very basic tastes of sweet salty sour and

198
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:36,280
bitter all the nuance is lost all the things that delight

199
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:41,800
us that maybe give rise to feathers

200
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,680
there are aromomas smells odors you know that give rise to a a big variety of

201
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:57,079
reactions in people and you know conditioned on past experience mostly conditioned on past

202
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:02,320
experience cultural conditioning you know plays a plays a really big uh part

203
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:09,839
in this uh in this area tastes and odors that are considered uh really foul in

204
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:16,320
some cultures are highly regarded in in others both personal and cultural um

205
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:21,760
conditioning affect how we relate to all the things that we smell and taste you

206
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,960
know just as a really simple example you know you might notice how one person can

207
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:33,520
find the aroma of beef on a barbecue you know just really delightful enticing

208
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:38,640
while someone else is just disgusted by it so you know we know the reaction is

209
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:45,760
not inherent in the smell itself it arises dependent on our relationship and

210
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:52,000
how we relate to the smell or taste and that that is conditioned we relate to uh

211
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,520
all our experience based on prior conditioning on on memories and

212
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:04,079
attitudes of mind that often we aren't even conscious of and noticing how our reactions to

213
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:11,040
different odors and tastes change over time that that points to the the same truth you know the same thing the

214
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:16,760
pleasure or disgust we experience is generated in our minds and the as conditioning

215
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:21,359
changes the the reactions in the mind

216
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:28,320
change some foods um uh we call uh comfort foods you know

217
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:33,520
different people of course have different comfort foods and um it can be

218
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:38,720
illuminating I think to notice what arises in the mind when when uh we smell

219
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:45,599
or taste those particular foods what what is it that actually feels comforting in them you know they're not

220
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:52,720
inherently comforting or just nutrition for the body or maybe just not nutrition

221
00:40:52,720 --> 00:41:01,240
but something that we like to take in what are the mental associations you know with the food that make it feel

222
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:07,599
comforting memories you know my husband uh um mentioned mashed

223
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:12,720
potatoes in this regard just a couple of weeks ago he was feeling a little bit

224
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:18,319
blue a little bit stressed and a buffet was serving mashed potatoes with

225
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:25,280
mushroom gravy and he ended up with a stomach ache some hours later because he had

226
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:32,880
seriously overdone the spuds you know because of the emotional resonance the flavor had for him what is the comfort

227
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:38,800
he's looking for it was a hook a fetter and and you know there are a lot of

228
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,920
people who use food for comfort occasionally probably me most people I

229
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,200
would imagine use it occasionally for comfort and there are some who do it

230
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:55,680
habitually who really um are kind of uh addicted to using it in that way and

231
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:00,960
and they often suffer for it in many many ways

232
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:06,200
slowing down you know noticing the effect of each bite in the mouth in the

233
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:13,680
mind looking to the mind and heart to see is there is there some kind of craving here that has nothing to do with

234
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:20,000
nourishing my body you know the craving is in the mind and the taste doesn't

235
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,520
cause it used to be an exercise that was part of

236
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:31,040
every uh intro to meditation class series and I think uh I think it was

237
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:36,240
also used in MBSR um students would be instructed to

238
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:44,400
mindfully um eat a raisin or a dried cranberry just one to uh to smell it

239
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,760
first you know just take in the aroma although raisins don't smell very much I

240
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:56,240
don't think um to feel the texture of it in the mouth to chew it very slowly kind

241
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:02,960
of letting the tongue really get involved in the taste and then finally to swallow it sensing it going down the

242
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:08,400
throat And people would often comment that after chewing for a little while the

243
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:14,160
taste became uh neutral or even

244
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:21,040
unpleasant it's an interesting uh kind of exercise i think usually we don't eat

245
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:26,240
slowly enough to allow ourselves to you know continually kind of track the the

246
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:31,520
sensations that are going on in the taste buds and the aroma receptors which

247
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:37,200
we have re aroma receptors in our mouths you know we don't think of of odors as

248
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:44,160
arising in our mouth but apparently they do i think usually when there's some kind

249
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:51,839
of craving operating in the the taste uh smell arena we tend to eat in a way that

250
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:57,920
prolongs the flavor that we desire either trying to get that next hit of a

251
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:04,400
pleasant flavor in quickly you know or maybe letting something uh something

252
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:10,079
like chocolate melt slowly in the mouth you know savoring each moment and then

253
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:15,200
maybe often wanting another bite as soon as that one is swallowed think I might

254
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:24,000
be giving myself away a little bit here with my references to chocolate and of course we see in uh in

255
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,599
alcohol addiction how strongly debilitating the craving that arises

256
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:36,160
between the senses of taste and aroma and the liquid tasted can be and that

257
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,839
craving of course it we know it destroys lives and addiction is a you know it's a

258
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:47,359
very complicated process and I don't mean to imply that all we need to do is

259
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:53,200
uh is to notice the craving and know it as something that arises out of prior

260
00:44:53,200 --> 00:45:01,800
conditioning and somehow we'll just let go of it but that is the beginning of course and the same with dependence on

261
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:07,599
food we talk about stress eating or anxiety eating need to recognize the

262
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:14,240
triggers there recognize the conditioning that pushes us toward looking for comfort in the foods we love

263
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:20,960
or the drinks we think we need investigating our experience to the uh

264
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:29,079
our relationship to the experience of eating and drinking of tasting and sensing odors what is the

265
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:33,720
hook what is the hook

266
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:42,640
we assign meaning to smells you know often especially smells associated with the body that the human body produces

267
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:48,720
odors and and most of them uh give rise to aversion and and most people there's

268
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:55,440
even shame associated with many of the odors that the body produces but they're just odors in themselves you know

269
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:03,480
perfectly natural we assign meaning to them that they don't have usually some kind of negative

270
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:09,200
judgment or shame if it's our body producing the

271
00:46:09,319 --> 00:46:15,359
odor dependent on the sense of smell and the odor smell some kind of reactive

272
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:22,240
mental process arises that obstructs our ease and freedom that that gives rise to

273
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:26,680
to dooka to pain

274
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,440
and I think we know that smells are especially powerful in evoking

275
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:45,920
memories i think of there's a a plant that blooms here in the in the foothills

276
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:53,280
and the mountains where I live uh cenothus California lilac it's often called and when I every time I smell it

277
00:46:53,280 --> 00:47:00,400
in the winter after the rains have come and it started to bloom it brings out memories of hikes from when I was a a

278
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:07,040
teenager in days in the garden long ago when I'd catch the scent of course a

279
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:14,240
French author Marcel P ended up writing a 3,000 pages of of fiction based on his

280
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:19,280
memory of a little cookie Meline

281
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:26,160
so sometimes memories evoked by odors might be really beautiful memories evoked by taste as well might give a

282
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:34,720
rise to appreciation joy and sometimes there are hooks yeah

283
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:41,520
and as we develop the the deep sensitivity to what's arising in us we can give more attention to what it is

284
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:48,480
that gives rise to the beautiful mental states as we gradually gradually

285
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:56,319
Untie the helpful unhelpful feathers feathers not feathers

286
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:04,040
feathers so remember that in every moment there are only two things

287
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:10,319
happening there's what is happening and our relationship to what is happening

288
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:16,000
and the fetter the knot that that really it characterizes it comes to

289
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,440
characterize our relationship to what's happening in a way that obstructs us and

290
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:27,640
sometimes it's really subtle and sometimes it's very obvious but it's something to tune

291
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:34,240
into it's something to recognize and just to know this is what's happening

292
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:38,440
and this is reactivity

293
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:44,880
thank you thank you for your attention and uh

294
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:51,240
I'll see you tomorrow and we'll talk about uh bodily sensations

295
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:57,760
tomorrow so I hope you have a day filled with uh

296
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:02,960
appreciation and gratitude for for what is good that comes through the sense

297
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,960
spaces
