1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:11,360
so I wanted to talk a little bit about fear and I talked about that uh last

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:18,600
week when I was here and those of you who listen to the 7 AMS know that I'm doing a week on fear

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:26,760
there and part of the reason there's a number of reasons because there's

4
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,160
fear we have fear and uh you know it shows up in our

5
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:39,200
lives and maybe much more than we realize there's like this fear is

6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,760
underlining so many of the things that we do the decisions we

7
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,920
make sometimes like fear of boredom like oh I can't be bored I got to make sure I

8
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:56,760
have my phone with me I guess we have phones for other reasons but you know just

9
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:03,120
this you know afraid that we we'll be alone with ourselves or maybe there's a

10
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:12,280
fear of sometimes our shadow side sometimes we're afraid of what might arise if we're quiet and

11
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:19,840
really touch into the anger or the sadness or the shame some of these

12
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,920
things so we don't go there CU you know we're afraid of what's going to happen

13
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,640
or maybe have this fear of failure we don't try new

14
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:37,040
things we don't kind of like stretch ourselves put ourselves in unfamiliar

15
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,759
settings try for different jobs or make changes or something like this because we have fear of

16
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:50,240
failure fear of endings maybe we're awkward around when something ends and

17
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,759
it's time to say goodbye and just leave or or we hold on too tightly or don't

18
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,799
want to even just deal with it when coworker leaves or somebody moves away

19
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:11,440
or whatever this is there's like this uncomfortableness this fear of endings or this fear

20
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:17,040
of I want to say not being in control but we're really not in control as much

21
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,080
as we think we are but kind maybe fear of like just the

22
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,640
feeling of not being in control of course we want things to go

23
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:35,720
the way that we want them to go and this fear of maybe feeling

24
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:41,239
Unworthy of course everybody's worthy being unworthy doesn't actually exist

25
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:46,680
but doesn't mean people don't feel that way feel like okay in order to be worthy

26
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,519
I have to succeed or serve or you know I have to do

27
00:02:52,519 --> 00:03:01,239
something it's really if we kind of like want to look at it in this way we'll see that there fear is like so prevalent is

28
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:08,120
really having a big role in our lives this is part of the reason why you

29
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,360
know fear is something to look at and become familiar with and learn to work

30
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:21,680
with last week I talked about the f a practice the fair practice F is for

31
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:30,400
friend kind of say like bef friend the fear e is for explore the fear a is for

32
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:37,159
allow the fear and R is release maybe was not so much that we're

33
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:44,120
actively doing the releasing but releasing of fear happens when we are exploring and allowing and being

34
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:51,159
friendly with it and soly the BRD he gave some teachings on fear I'm not going to go

35
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:56,760
into all of them today but wouldn't it be easier if there

36
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,360
just weren't fear if there just wasn't it just fear we

37
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:10,720
just didn't have fear if that just didn't arise it'd be so much easier just think like how much Freedom it would

38
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:17,239
have the the things that we could do if there weren't fear the how many people we could

39
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:24,720
benefit and support ourselves and so many others if we didn't have

40
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,840
fear so the Buddha he talked about this road

41
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,680
to fearlessness I stumbled upon this um this verse that's kind of like tucked

42
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:45,919
away in the samut Naya it's maybe not uh so

43
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:52,800
common but I thought I'd play around a little bit and explore kind of like these instructions to

44
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,800
fearlessness instead of just learning how to be with fear how to just not have

45
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:06,080
fear so kind of like this uh it's written in

46
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,520
verse it's very that's common there's a lot of things that are written in verse

47
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:18,479
but maybe I'll just say in a little aside that to translate poly verse into

48
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,800
English depends on your point of view is either really difficult or really

49
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:30,240
easy because it doesn't follow the usual grammar rules and it uses

50
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,440
uh word forms that are really unusual and it uses maybe some archaic

51
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:42,280
vocabulary like archaic even for poly so in modern times you kind of there's a

52
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:47,880
lot of interpretation that has to be done and

53
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:55,360
um so there's a way in which it's not you know like the verse is um pointing

54
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:02,240
toward something and then there's a way in which we can have to see it make sense of it and I thought maybe I'd

55
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,360
share with you kind of some of my thinking it's not you don't have to agree with me but I'll offer kind of

56
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,599
like my interpretation but part of the reason why I want to offer this is to encourage you to find your way

57
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:20,960
too with some of what's been said here and so maybe on the big p so not

58
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,000
only I'll say not only does it use verse but it's also using a metaphor and the

59
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,800
metaphor is this idea of a chariot you know that was like the fastest thing that was the only probably

60
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:39,240
vehicle at the time right was a chariot so this I way this to get to

61
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,960
fearlessness apparently according to this you just have to get on the right Chariot going the right

62
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,680
direction but what does that mean okay so here's the verse and then um I'll

63
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:56,319
unpack it and I'll share with you some things here and there's some things that are I think a little bit surprising at

64
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:05,759
least I felt surprised and then when I thought about it I felt kind of actually uh happy it made me happy to think about

65
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,560
this so the verse goes like this the path is called the straight way

66
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:19,400
and fearless is its destination The Chariot is called

67
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:27,039
unswerving fitted with wheels of Dharma conscience is its leaning board

68
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:33,560
mindfulness its upholstery I say the teachings is the charioteer

69
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:41,080
with Right View running out in front one who has such a vehicle whether

70
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:48,758
a woman or a man by means of this vehicle is in the presence of

71
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:56,240
nibana so there's this way that the destination is fearlessness and it's also going towards

72
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:03,120
nibana this recognition that uh Freedom includes like Freedom From Fear but also

73
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:10,000
this movement towards greater and greater Freedom right there's a shedding of a lot of the fears and a lot of that

74
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,039
has to do because so many of these fears that I described at the beginning were

75
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:20,680
fears about our sense of self like how will we look to others or will we be

76
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:26,520
safe and have security and as we find our way towards greater and greater Peace and Freedom

77
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:33,959
the sense of self is not as hungry for attention or needing to be uh

78
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:41,440
fed or protected or that's not as strong it's uh not driving the ship quite as

79
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:49,399
often I'll talk about that a little bit more when we get there but maybe I'll start here with the first

80
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:56,000
stanza the path is called the straight way and fearless is its

81
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,399
destination The Chariot is called unswerving fitted with wheels of Dharma so this

82
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:09,360
idea of the path is called the straight way some of you may know that about the

83
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:18,399
eight-fold path it's kind of like a foundational teaching in this tradition is a one of the way to um

84
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:25,360
Awakening and it's there's other places in the sutas where it's called the straight way I just want to say a little

85
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:32,320
bit about this eight-fold path as you might imagine it has eight parts to it I'm not going to

86
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:38,680
Define them but I'll just say very quickly we um before we use this word write

87
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,839
s I'm using the word write I learned it this way but often it's um also you

88
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:50,959
could translate as wise or correct or appropriate So Right View right

89
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:56,600
intention right speech right action right livelihood right energy right

90
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:02,240
mindfulness right concentration my only reason why I'm saying all these

91
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:10,720
eight is to point out that actually sometimes it gets summarized Sila Samar

92
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:17,640
PA ethics ethical Behavior mental development wisdom so

93
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:25,680
these three buckets these three types of practices is the eight-fold path and

94
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,200
we'll see in this verse here that there's Al three of these get mentioned

95
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,399
manip ethics mental development and

96
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:45,079
wisdom it says Fearless is its destination and as I was saying that um

97
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:51,160
as we have more freedom there's a sense of self doesn't need to be propped up as

98
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:57,279
much but somebody who is completely awakened it no longer has this idea that there's a

99
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:03,079
central core or Essence to their experience it's not

100
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:11,560
like they have something a central core to which other things happen instead it's like there's just a bunch of things

101
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:19,200
happening this isn't something that you have to believe or you have to adopt a view about but uh this can be part of

102
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:26,399
one's experience so to be

103
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,560
Fearless doesn't is what uh means to no longer have fear because

104
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:37,480
there isn't this core that has to be protected instead they are with whatever

105
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:44,360
is rising and whatever is rising without building a story around

106
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:50,720
it saying like oh that was awkward what I just said or what that other person

107
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:58,160
said and then they don't have to make a story like oh my gosh I'm so embarrassed that I tripped or whatever there isn't

108
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:06,040
anything extra that gets added on to it it's just like oh that's an experience and it felt like

109
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:14,279
this and one thing that's interesting is like as there's more and more freedom there's also more and more connection so

110
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:21,360
it's not like an aloofness it's not like a separateness it's instead of uh trying

111
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,880
to protect the core it's like wanting to connect and support other people so

112
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:33,160
fearlessness you could see where if you didn't had fear it's easier to so to

113
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:39,920
show up when others are having difficulties it's easier to say the

114
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,639
things that you know would really help somebody but it's hard to say or it's

115
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:51,399
easier to support people when they're waiting for test results back from the

116
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:59,120
doctors or something like this so this verse continues and it says

117
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:05,360
The Chariot is called unswerving this idea of

118
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:12,720
unswerving this goes along with the idea that it's the path is the straight way so maybe the Chariot doesn't need to be

119
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,160
swerving but I also would like to think about this is unswerving as it doesn't

120
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:25,360
go to other destinations if we follow this eight-fold path Mani PA it's not

121
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:31,680
like that we're going to end up someplace terrible where we don't want to go it's going to bring us to fearlessness

122
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:37,440
and greater freedom and peace but here's something that I think is

123
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:44,360
really evocative when I think about when do I swerve when I'm in my own version

124
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:51,560
of a charot that has a four-cylinder engine and you know however many gears you know this kind of thing we swerve

125
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:57,800
often to avoid something for our safety but um you know

126
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:04,000
just to avoid things what if this path means we don't have to

127
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,160
avoid anything everything becomes part of

128
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:16,399
practice everything gets folded in we don't have to try to disown parts

129
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,920
of ourselves we don't have to try to avoid certain situations instead our

130
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:29,800
capacity to be with difficulty grows our capacity to hold what's

131
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:37,160
uncomfortable grows so we start becoming more and more comfortable with being uncomfortable

132
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:43,240
it's like okay uncomfortableness feels like this pain feels like

133
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:49,560
this but our confidence even to be with the difficult things right we're all

134
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:56,320
going to get sick in our lives we're all going to have illness in our lives we're all going to have people pets family

135
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:04,199
members who die right it's unavoidable so I like this idea like the

136
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:09,720
path is going straight whatever arises next it's able to

137
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,959
meet and this is the practice it turns

138
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:22,920
out the path is meeting whatever arises that's we might think like oh

139
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:28,880
this um this often sometimes we talk about like the hindrances like this

140
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:35,560
restlessness like okay I'll be able to practice or I'll be able to meditate as soon as this restlessness settles down

141
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:44,079
or the opposite soon as this sleepiness goes away it turns out that restlessness is

142
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:51,440
the practice like to be with restlessness feel it in the body explore

143
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,319
it learn how to hold it and there's all kinds of things we can do discover like

144
00:15:57,319 --> 00:16:02,680
what causes restless to increase or what are the things that cause it to arise in

145
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:11,800
the first place all these things I'm just using restlessness as an example but this idea of the Chariot

146
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:19,120
this something that's going to lead us to fearlessness is meeting whatever is in

147
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,920
the way and we can use as supports the these

148
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:30,920
factors of the eight-fold path right action is about ethical

149
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:39,519
Behavior showing up in a way in which we're not causing harm not causing harm to others and not causing harm to

150
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,639
ourselves there's a way in which being mindful just being present for what's

151
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:50,639
happening even if it is exactly what we don't want because let's face it sometimes we

152
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,880
get exactly what we don't want but sometimes there's a way in

153
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:04,558
which being mindful bringing some attention to to it helps to maybe uh unpack it away from

154
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:11,079
the dreaded whatever it might [Music] be the ending of a relationship maybe we

155
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:17,520
desperately didn't want that to happen or was afraid it was going to happen and then it looks like it is

156
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:23,480
happening it doesn't help to pretend it isn't instead it helps us like to turn

157
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:30,399
towards and to okay what's needed here what can be sensitive to what

158
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:38,640
needed so this Chariot is unswerving and then the next line is fitted with wheels

159
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,120
of Dharma I like this expression wheels of

160
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:50,640
Dharma and uh one way that I'm thinking about this is maybe this contemporary uh

161
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:58,480
expression is where the rubber meets the road so that kind of like the Gera right

162
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:05,440
the Dharma is not yes we use it for the D um the Buddha's teachings but really

163
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:12,640
it's not like some just philosophical ideas that just exist in our minds not

164
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:20,240
just Concepts or Notions but the Dharma is really how we show up in the

165
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,919
world it's the way in which because these teachings that the Buddha offered

166
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:31,720
shared are they're really pragmatic it's not like here just believe this

167
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:39,640
stuff it's more like show up in this way CU he's really concerned about what

168
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:46,280
leads to suffering and the ending of suffering and things that you can see

169
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:52,679
and discover for yourself a real encouragement not to just believe the teachings he was not interested in

170
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:58,559
metaphysics or speculative views or when somebody asked him well what's the

171
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:03,600
nature of the cosmos he didn't answer and he said he

172
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:10,760
didn't answer because it that kind of thinking those types of concerns doesn't lead to the end of

173
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:18,520
suffering so when this Chariot has that D fitted with wheels of

174
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:25,159
Dharma it's like there's so many different ways we can think about this but one is our

175
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:32,240
practice is that what what do we know about ways to be in the world what can

176
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:40,480
what parts of the a-al path can we bring maybe we can bring mindfulness maybe we can bring right action of not harming

177
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,400
right intention bringing compassion right effort is looking at

178
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:52,200
okay what's uh helpful what's not helpful what's wholesome what's not

179
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:59,799
wholesome so fitted with wheels of Dharma and then the second stanza

180
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:06,559
or maybe I'll um yeah I I'll I'll leave that there the second stanza is

181
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,880
conscience is its leaning board mindfulness its

182
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:18,159
upholstery I say the teachings is the charioteer with Right View running out

183
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:24,880
in front let's unpack this a little bit conscience is its leaning

184
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:32,480
board so I tried to look this up like what is a leaning board in a chariot but it turns out it's not so common I guess

185
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,679
I couldn't really find this so this is my understanding is in this is in

186
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:44,360
Diana's mind right when I uh think of uh chariots is um there's like somebody

187
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:49,760
who's standing and it's like What's um like protecting them in front so that

188
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:57,240
they don't fall forward onto the horses or something like this so so conscience is its leaning board so

189
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:02,919
it's this maybe that goes around like this and we could say it helps them from

190
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:08,600
not falling out so conscience so conscience some of

191
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:14,640
you might know this PO word HEI some and I'm translating it as

192
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,799
conscience here and hiri is um that

193
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:26,520
Buddha called it like the one of the Guardians of the world because it's this

194
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:32,480
um it's this sense of recognizing how uncomfortable it is when we've done

195
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:39,559
something UNH wholesome when we've done something that we knew wasn't the best

196
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:49,120
thing to do but we did it anyway and this he is this you know this um wish to not

197
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:54,640
cause harm and it's based on a respect and a

198
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:01,440
care for ourselves and for others so it's not like this external like you

199
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:08,159
should not do this it's more of like oh it feels awful when I cause

200
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:15,480
harm and I care and respect others so I want to take care I don't want to cause

201
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:22,159
harm this feels for me like a nice way to think about how to be in the world you know it requires that we're

202
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:28,880
sensitive to what's going on with ourselves what feels uncomfortable but it builds on on this

203
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,120
wish to support others and to support ourselves not like we have to choose

204
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:39,840
oursel or others but both so this idea of conscience as the

205
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:48,039
Leaning board is something that's here that helping us F so that we don't fall out of the Chariot of um that's carrying

206
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:54,919
us towards fearlessness and in this poem in this verse and with this metaphor The

207
00:22:54,919 --> 00:23:00,400
Chariot is we could also say is the practice

208
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:07,440
what's taking us to uh fearlessness and then there's this very

209
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:14,320
curious expression mindfulness is its upholstery like

210
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:21,919
what I did I poked around in the poly here to say like okay par varum is the

211
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:28,440
poly so it could also mean something like covering or drapery

212
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:36,720
but um I was thinking well maybe you know this is speculation on my part that

213
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,200
uh maybe like this Chariot has a covering that protects them

214
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:48,520
from whatever they need to be protected from the Sun this is India right it's

215
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:55,039
hot and the you know the rain but we can think of mindfulness as something that

216
00:23:55,039 --> 00:24:02,320
protects us from whatever it is we need protected from there's I spoke about this earlier

217
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:08,240
there's a way in which if we can bring mindfulness if we can bring attention to what's

218
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,679
happening there is a way in which it protects us because it enables us to

219
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:21,840
bring our best wisdom we're not necessar less we're least less likely to be

220
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:29,240
caught off guard but instead we can be noticing what's actually happening

221
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:36,640
it's so common that when something's uncomfortable we start blaming or we or we collapse and then

222
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:42,120
we're no longer kind of connected to what's actually happening we're too busy

223
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:47,480
like yelling at the other person or yelling at ourselves or just shutting

224
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:53,520
down but there's a way in which mindfulness if we can stay present with what's

225
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:59,760
happening allows us to be sensitive to what's happening and not having to be

226
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,960
like the blaming and the shutting and kind of like blunt our

227
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:11,399
awareness and as best we can right some of some things in our lives are really

228
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:18,320
difficult and it's difficult to be with but to have the aspiration to know that

229
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,720
to know to pay attention to is better in

230
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:32,320
the long run even though it might be uncomfortable than just trying to avoid or pretend it's not there so mindfulness

231
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:38,799
it's upholstery I'm going to maybe say and I thought about this when I was uh driving here this evening like

232
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:45,200
upholstery I looked at some other translators they had the word

233
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:51,399
accessory but the poly doesn't really support that that this was a in little

234
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:59,320
little too far from the poly and then the second second stanza goes with

235
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:07,039
I say the teachings is the charioteer so actually this word is Dharma

236
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:13,919
again so the charioteer the person who is doing the driving is the

237
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:21,320
practice or it's our practice or maybe it is the teachings Dharma has so many

238
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:27,960
different ways we can interpret this word but I like this idea that it's guid

239
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:34,039
the journey like where the Chariot goes but not only

240
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:41,399
where like how fast like maybe things need to move

241
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:47,399
slowly maybe we need to stop and pick up some other passengers or let off some

242
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:55,480
other passengers or something like this those people that were sharing the Chariot with or whomever we were CH

243
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:01,640
saring it with but the Chariot teers maybe there's a way if it's the Dharma

244
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:09,640
it's also um wanting to go towards where there's less suffering so it's in my

245
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:16,080
mind right this this somebody that has their on their Reigns and is doing

246
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:22,520
what's best wanting what's best for us and then this idea that with Right

247
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:29,240
View running out front so the chair teer is following

248
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:37,360
Right View Right View is out in front so right view this is the first

249
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:45,080
element in the eight-fold path some of you might know and I'm using this word right not because the opposite is wrong

250
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:51,559
right means uh like the most appropriate or the most helpful or in the same way

251
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:59,360
that like um the right tool like we don't bring a hammer if we're trying to undo a screw the right tool is a

252
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,600
screwdriver so I'm using right in that way not as moralistically

253
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:12,159
right so rate view is a perspective or it's a frame of reference that and it

254
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:17,760
provides a simple straightforward understanding of how to bring suffering

255
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:23,440
to an end is this some of you might know that

256
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,480
part of right to view is the Four Noble Truths

257
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:34,399
the for so it's this recognition of this is suffering this is the arising of

258
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:42,000
suffering or this is the origin of suffering this is the cessation of suffering and this is the way to the

259
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,799
ending of suffering so what's out in front what the charioteer is following what the

260
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:55,360
Dharma or the teachings charer is following is this perspective or view of

261
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:02,559
the sway to suffering and this way to the ending of suffering this is the way right to Creer

262
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:10,120
Freedom this is the way to nabana this is the way to fearlessness because there's this way in

263
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:17,440
which our views our orientations our perspectives our beliefs the ways in

264
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:24,120
which we understand ourselves and the world these are like the basis on which

265
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:30,360
we make so many decisions in our lives are views and for the most part they're

266
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:35,399
unseen we don't even know we have them in fact there seem like such a inherent

267
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:42,720
part of ourselves it just seems like they're the truth or it's the Natural Way of the

268
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:51,600
world but our core views are just seem like embedded and

269
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:58,679
habitual but they might not be accurate they may not be true and they might not

270
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:04,559
lead us as clearly to the end of suffering such as views as the world is

271
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:13,799
an unsafe place I'm only worthy if I serve

272
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:20,720
others it's important to always be comfortable at all

273
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:28,120
costs it's important to never be vulnerable there's so many of these

274
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:33,640
views that we have that we might not even recognize that we have that don't

275
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:40,640
always support us so right view is this orientation to

276
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:47,639
be sensitive towards suffering what is leading towards suffering and what isn't leading towards

277
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:53,600
suffering so then the third stanza of this uh verse

278
00:30:53,600 --> 00:31:01,200
goes one who has such a vehicle whether a woman or a man by means of this

279
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:09,840
vehicle is in the presence of nibana so these two lines one who has

280
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:17,519
such a vehicle whether a woman or a man they're just trying to be inclusive maybe today we would say no

281
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:23,320
matter the gender but notice that they're not

282
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:29,240
saying you have to be a monastic or that you have to come from a

283
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:35,240
certain background or there's nothing like this they're just saying whether you're on

284
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:41,600
this vehicle the vehicle is this Chariot on the straightway you with the

285
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:49,639
aold path it's this it's it's about what you do it's

286
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:57,399
kind of like the wheels of the Dharma it's kind of like where the rubber meets the road the Dharma is not as I said not

287
00:31:57,399 --> 00:32:04,519
some esoteric teachings but it's how we show up in the world it's the way that where we find

288
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:12,279
more freedom and then this then the lines that this poem ends by means of this

289
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:18,480
vehicle has drawn close to nibana maybe I'll read that whole lastanza one who

290
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:25,760
has such a vehicle whether a woman or a man by means of this vehicle has drawn

291
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:31,200
close to nibana Nana being

292
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:39,000
Awakening I was thinking about this has drawn close to nibana is near nibana

293
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,279
they don't say that you get to nibana but you're like really

294
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:51,600
close maybe it's and I I don't have a excellent answer why this is but I was

295
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:58,760
think well maybe they don't want to give the impression that nabana is a location that it's you know someplace

296
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:04,440
over there that you'll get to later CU like nabana is found

297
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:12,880
here it's so common we have this idea we have to seek and go and find and certainly something like this uh it

298
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:19,960
suggest that to this idea that there's a path and that there's a chariot there's a little bit of a paradox here that it's

299
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:28,440
not actually over there some other time and there's this another ology that

300
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:35,559
I heard years ago and um it's really stayed with me I think it's really

301
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:40,679
powerful this idea that if you want to

302
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:47,279
get to nibana and it feels like nabana is over there we'll call that point B and you're

303
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:54,639
at Point a you're at Point a here whatever here is and you want to get to where there's complete

304
00:33:54,639 --> 00:34:04,200
Freedom it turns out the way to get to point B is to be completely at Point

305
00:34:04,639 --> 00:34:12,560
a right here with whatever it is so a little bit of a paradox here and

306
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:19,079
this is you know verse allows us to do this but maybe I'll end here with this idea

307
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:24,760
that you know what's being pointed to with this verse is that the way to

308
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:31,240
fearlessness is the way to niana Freedom peace and

309
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:38,800
ease and the way to nabana Freedom peace and ease includes ethical behavior and

310
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:48,520
includes views as part of wisdom you know seear ethics mental development and uh

311
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:55,398
wisdom so sometimes we feel like oh just to not to be less Fearless we just have

312
00:34:55,399 --> 00:35:01,520
to have courage we just have to learn how to have courage or something like this but it might be an interesting

313
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:07,119
exploration in our own lives what is the relationship between our ethical

314
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:14,560
behavior and fear what happens if we clean up any

315
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:21,160
little areas of unethical Behavior white lies or whatever it might

316
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:29,400
be and this idea that our views what views do we have that might

317
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:35,160
be promoting some fear what would it be like to view our

318
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:43,400
experience through this idea of you know to simplify it this is leading to suffering and this is leading to less

319
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:50,760
suffering no suffering and it's interesting to maybe even use this language of leading to

320
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:57,079
because to be sure sometimes I mean we are suffering and if

321
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:02,839
you think your whole life is just to get out of suffering then you're just pursuing pleasure

322
00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:08,839
and if that worked you wouldn't be here right we you were just out pursuing

323
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:15,119
pleasure nonstop right we all have tried it of course we did and it didn't work

324
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:20,359
so we found ourselves here so I don't want to give the sense

325
00:36:20,359 --> 00:36:27,599
that right view is just about you know Finding you know just being suffering or not suffering but this idea of you know

326
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,880
feeling into our wisdom is this going the direction I want it to go or

327
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:40,520
not I'm being sensitive to that and the relationship to view and

328
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:48,200
fear so this poem that's verse maybe I'll read it I'll close with uh reading

329
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,480
it this one last

330
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:02,480
time the path is called the straight way and fearless as its

331
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:08,640
destination The Chariot is called unswerving fitted with wheels of

332
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:15,800
Dharma conscience is its leaning board mindfulness its upholstery I say the

333
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:21,480
teachings is the charioteer with Right View running out in

334
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:27,839
front one who has such a vehicle whether a woman or a man by means of this

335
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:35,440
vehicle is in the presence of nibana and then maybe I'll open it up

336
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:44,160
and see if there's some questions or comments this idea OFA

337
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:49,760
Samar ethical Behavior mental development which includes mindfulness

338
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:57,160
and concentration and wisdom have a role with fear support us

339
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:01,960
for find in less fear more

340
00:38:10,319 --> 00:38:15,720
fearlessness hey thanks de really appreciate it quick question on the you

341
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:23,880
mentioned the you know Sila samadi PA how could you define the difference between concentration and

342
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:31,119
mindfulness yeah there there's a number of different ways we can um say this so

343
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:39,440
sometimes I like to uh say the difference this way concentration is so so often when we're

344
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:47,440
doing uh mind I'm sorry mindfulness when we start we're doing like maybe with the breath and then as we often teach it

345
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:54,319
here at IMC if there's uh something that's compelling we turn our attention

346
00:38:54,319 --> 00:38:59,800
to that let's say there's a really loud sound and we'll just like say oh there's

347
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:05,680
dog barking and we kind like just rest maybe with the dog barking and notice

348
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:11,720
that and when it's no longer compelling come back to the breath with the knee hurts go to the knee come back to the

349
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:18,000
breath so in this way with mindfulness practice this whole notion of

350
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,800
distractions doesn't exist instead we whatever seems like to be troubling we

351
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:30,000
just turn towards and fold it into our practice we bring our attention to it and we bring our mindfulness to it so

352
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,839
mindfulness is inclusive whatever is arising we're paying attention to

353
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:41,160
concentration it's a little bit more exclusive we have like okay I'm going to be on the breath I'm going to be on the

354
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:47,920
breath I'm going to be on the breath I'm bring on the breath dog sparking breath breath Just Breath like we don't bring

355
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:57,480
our attention to anything else we're just stay here and a breath and we bring a sense of um

356
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:04,720
wholeness and a sense of collectedness and a sense of a centeredness around the

357
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:12,240
breath does that make sense yeah

358
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:24,440
pH so hearing all this tonight I'm really aware that it's about fearlessness not courage and in my mind

359
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:31,839
there's definitely a difference like courage is what I have to do when I'm not fearless and I got to do the thing

360
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:39,520
anyway was there that concept when this verse was written of Courage of Courage

361
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:46,440
as different from fearlessness yes and Viria which is one of the fact

362
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:54,000
uh faculties is sometimes translated as courage can be translated courage and it talks about it so very sometimes uh also

363
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,920
translated as energy or something like this so yeah there's that idea of Courage

364
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:12,480
also thank you for your uh talking today

365
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:20,319
about fearlessness which we all need yes

366
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:27,119
uh um [Music] I uh reflected on

367
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:33,200
one or two stories which are related to Buddha where Buddha says ahinsa

368
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:41,520
paroda um we have talked about uh you know even some like musicals and songs

369
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:47,760
from Gregory peek of India but um there is

370
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:53,920
uh I feel there are two parts to the

371
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,079
fearlessness for everyone around the world being

372
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:07,000
Fearless One is uh I'll quote one story can you hold the microphone just a little bit closer so I can hear uh the

373
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,480
story is uh about anguli Mal mhm which I

374
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:21,040
have quoted the before also so there is uh it's uh so one self

375
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:30,200
dealing with uh fear or like uh what is out there is one part of it which is

376
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:37,480
essentially courage um but the second part is also I think

377
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:42,640
equally important in which case when

378
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:49,599
angulimal thinks that okay you know I'm just using an analogy he used to chop

379
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:56,920
fingers off people and make a Garland out of it um or killing people people or you

380
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:06,040
know gouging people I mean I'm using strong language here so I hope people are able to bear with me but just to

381
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:13,920
establish a point here um it's also it was like seemed

382
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:22,640
like Buddha took this upon himself like his duty to educate anguli Mal

383
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:28,040
hey uh he called out hey stop

384
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:34,680
um because he was preparing to do this whatever he was preparing to

385
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:40,440
do and Buddha it was like a transformational thing he

386
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:49,000
said um I have stopped but when will you stop so it was transformational for

387
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:57,680
him that he was educated he learned that it is a bad thing to gouge people's eyes

388
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:04,280
or chop people's heads or fingers or whatever or like

389
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:11,280
eat you know uh meat or whatever I'm just causing I'm saying violence is a

390
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:16,400
bad thing I mean there is a book I have quoted before the dance of

391
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:24,599
Shiva where the I mean the author Anand Kumar Swami he goes on to say violence

392
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:30,520
even in thoughts is equivalent to violence that is also Buddha is

393
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:37,599
saying um in there are 14 essays over there um on all philosophies all

394
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:43,760
religions so the point is it's it's actually it's a it's a

395
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:50,319
two-fold uh matter one is upon oneself the fear myself I um let's say I a

396
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:58,640
chariot here I am I can be Fearless uh uh but then there is also

397
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:05,319
like the passengers that I'm carrying it's my duty to kind of educate them

398
00:45:05,319 --> 00:45:11,920
that I see the yeah but I'll say one thing though about the story about angula for those of you who don't know

399
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:17,680
angul Mala is like this mass murderer and he's going to kill the Buddha and he's like running towards the Buddha and

400
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:25,359
the Buddha seems to be just casually walking but and Gully Mala can't catch up to him and Gully Mala says hey stop

401
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:31,240
and that Buddha says I have stopped you stop but so angula kind of saw that the

402
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:38,640
Buddha a was not afraid of him and B um couldn't be caught and then kind of

403
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:43,760
unfold like the Buddhas had stopped doing things that were unethical or had

404
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:50,440
stopped you know all kinds of other things and that's why anguli Mala couldn't uh catch him and and also there

405
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:57,400
was like some Supernatural thing happening there maybe I don't know and so it was when

406
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:06,520
anguli MOA saw something that was really different saw that there was a really different way that he then became a

407
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:11,559
eventually became a follower of the Buddha and became awakened eventually so

408
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:17,079
this story it's a very famous story so yeah there's different ways in

409
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:24,200
which fear shows up yes there's this definitely thank you for say get rid of it also you know I guess I mean if there

410
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:29,559
are people like you know I I don't know if we should be sending PE monks around

411
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:34,960
the world to talk about these stories and people to be

412
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:41,520
awakened thank you thank you thank you so thank you all for your time and I

413
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,960
wish you all the lovely rest of the evening thank

414
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,640
you
