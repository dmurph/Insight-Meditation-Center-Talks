1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,839
okay great so hello everyone hello and welcome

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:16,560
warm welcome to happy hour so so for today's practice at happy hour

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:24,800
um i would like to invite us into a practice of

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,240
appreciative perception appreciative perception and

5
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:37,760
we'll explore that more appreciative perception there would be some meta in there some

6
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,840
some loving kindness some would detail vicarious joy and some gratitude practice and the

7
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:51,199
inspiration for this practice uh this this evening morning afternoon whatever

8
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:59,760
the time zone might be this moment in time the inspiration comes from a a quote

9
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:08,799
by rilke that i will share with you it's a quote by rilka so so rilker writes

10
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:17,119
if your daily life seems poor do not blame it blame yourself

11
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:24,960
tell yourself that you are not poet enough to call forth its riches

12
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:32,640
for the creator there is no poverty and no poor indifferent place

13
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,960
ah that's quite profound so i'll read it again and maybe i'll say

14
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:45,280
one thing before i read it again so the idea of mutation is sometimes we go through our lives like oh

15
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:52,479
ho ho hum ho-hum hum drum um and our life

16
00:01:52,479 --> 00:02:00,159
seems poor our life seems poor and what the invitation is

17
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:06,479
as as he's inviting us that it's not so much that not

18
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,720
to blame our lives but maybe it's our way of seeing of seeing or actually our way of

19
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,840
not seeing it's our perception it's our lack of perception

20
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,760
to the riches that are in our life to the diversity to the beauty to the grace

21
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:32,239
to the opportunities to so much that there is in our lives so it's really the

22
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:39,280
the poverty of our perception so what he's inviting is what i like to call a poetry

23
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,560
of perception we can use the word gratitude meta all of that but let's make it

24
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,720
poetic tonight let's mix it up a little bit so the poetry of perception

25
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,200
now i'd like to read the the quote one more time with that appreciation so

26
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:04,000
he says if your daily life seems poor do not blame it

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,680
blame yourself tell yourself that you are not poet enough to call

28
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:16,560
forth its riches for to the creator there is no poverty

29
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:23,280
and no poor and different place so so

30
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,200
again you know the the uh buddhist language probably doesn't have

31
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,720
blame yourself so those parts will work you know kind of like we'll take out but

32
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:41,519
just the idea of if the life seems poor ah it's about our perception

33
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,360
how is our perception perceiving the good perceiving the beauty perceiving

34
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:54,720
all the poetry all the music all the color all the riches that are available

35
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,519
in life so that would be an invitation this meta practice in this happy hour

36
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:07,519
uh to invite us to open up to that perception if our life feels poor even if it

37
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,720
doesn't feel poor let's bring in the sense of appreciation

38
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:21,359
that the um poetry of perception perception to perceiving what is good

39
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:28,720
inclining the mind to what is beautiful what is wholesome inside

40
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:36,240
and outside so all right that's enough framing let's do it ah so

41
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,639
i'd like to invite you to get into your meditation posture shifting

42
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,040
moving

43
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:54,400
if you need to lie down that's fine see what your body needs in this moment

44
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,440
need to move to a cushion or a chair sit up straighter

45
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,360

it doesn't have to do anything

65
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:03,279
inviting it not to do anything the breath itself moves in and out by itself the

66
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:09,839
breath is breathed by itself

67
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:20,839
not needing to make it into a project just allow it to move as it has been

68

and see if the breath may be received

72
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,839
in the abdomen not from the control tower of the head

73
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,519
but sensed felt intimately

74
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:04,720

to soften to soften and let go with each out breath

76
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:33,130
and if thoughts are arising it's okay see them notice them

like a rock but release them like a helium balloon gently kindly

80
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:59,839

00:31:45,360 --> 00:32:01,840
and they feel so happy in your happiness and your good fortune

168
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:22,640
feel free to continue with this borrowed perception

169
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:29,600
the perception of the compassionate being next to you

170
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:36,200
whether there are challenges that you put on their lap they give you

171
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:41,360
unconditional love and compassion where they feel happy for your good

172
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,640
fortune and happiness

173
00:32:53,600 --> 00:33:11,840
awakening your own appreciation and happiness

174
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:44,000
feeling receiving complete unconditional love and support

175
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:53,200
feel free to be creative maybe maybe seeing yourself

176
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:13,838
hugged by this compassionate being a completely loving embrace

177
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,040
you're doing your best

178
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,838
they think you're doing your best

179
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:55,838
it's okay

180
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:05,440
held in a loving

181
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,839
embrace

182
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:06,800
and for the last moments of this practice that whatever came up or didn't come up

183
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:13,359
during this practice period to also be held

184
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:19,839
in the loving gaze of the compassionate being

185
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:25,760
no judgment just appreciation that you showed up and

186
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:33,839
you did your best

187
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,720
thank you all for your practice

188
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:15,359
so so we have some time or reflections for questions

189
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:20,720
you're welcome to raise your zoom hand

190
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:27,680
or type in chat as to what you noticed what

191
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:33,680
came up for you what was easy what was challenging what was

192
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:40,560
what you discovered in your practice and the invitation to share with the

193
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:47,599
sangha as a gift as a gift the gift of practice we give supports everyone

194
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:54,839
questions comments reflections especially if you haven't spoken for a

195
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:59,119
while in sangha

196
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:06,319
and just to as i'm as i invite you to feel free to raise

197
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:11,520
your hand i'll say a couple more words with the theme of perception there's so

198
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:18,400
many different ways that we can play with our perception in this way the perception of the

199
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:25,839
compassionate being next to us the buddha

200
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:33,359
because it is available so we can have this playing with this perception for poetry

201
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:38,800
of perception to turn our attention with kindness with love both to

202
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:44,240
ourselves and also to see the good in our lives to see the good

203
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:51,040
as ryoka said if your life if your daily life seems poor do not

204
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:58,400
blame it so dawn please

205
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:06,720
hello everyone nikki welcome back great to have you with us thank you well

206
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:13,680
thank you and um i i had a hard time uh imagining this compassionate being

207
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:18,800
and [Music] and so i struggled with that and so i

208
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:26,000
didn't i just sort of let it go at some point and just sort of focused uh on the breath or

209
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:34,000
the sensations in the body sort of a body scan and the the compassion being

210
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,960
was very vague towards the end it may be a ghost-like thing maybe but

211
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:46,560
it was it was tough yeah yeah yeah thanks for sharing that i really appreciate it

212
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:53,440
and i also really appreciate don that you hung in there with you know with the body and and

213
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:58,880
and um with the body scan with the breath which is great it's always a

214
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:04,640
great anchor to go to to be in body to be with the body and the breath and

215
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:10,400
and also the at the end it seems like the compassion the image may be kind of hanging out with it became a

216
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:16,640
little perhaps or it was there so so let me ask you a question if it's okay um

217
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:22,319
what what felt what felt like the crux of the challenge of the

218
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:28,000
kind was it the conjuring up was it power of imaginations or was it like oh

219
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:34,880
they're not compassionate enough if you could put in your own words i wonder yeah trying to just trying to imagine

220
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:41,440
such a being it's it's it's a foreign concept in my life it's very icy just trying to imagine

221
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:48,640
that it's like wow what is that got it okay okay that's helpful that's very helpful

222
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,680
for me too okay so so um so

223
00:42:53,680 --> 00:43:00,800
so is there so is there any um let's see so um yeah what would a compassionate

224
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:06,640
image be like so so are there uh and this is both for you and for everyone who might have had

225
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:12,800
challenge with this or will have challenge with this you know is there living being

226
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:19,440
you know anyone that you kind of identify or think of someone who's just a like a kind loving

227
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,880
being is is there one that is there someone you identify with again could be either living being

228
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:33,040
or or archetype for you that's like wow this person represents love and if is there one is it okay for

229
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:39,440
you to say it out loud if not that's okay too uh yeah there's somebody that helped me

230
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:47,760
when i was a teenager and um and so i often think of him fantastic yay so

231
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,960
so if you think of that person so is it easier to conjure that person up

232
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:59,440
as someone who's next to you yes i see you're you're not you can be unmuted yeah so

233
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:05,280
so instead of the compassion that they so that person can be your compassionate image so that that would be workable

234
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:12,720
don yes what's that yeah great tastic so

235
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:18,079
great thanks for bringing that up because he could be a living person someone from your past

236
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:24,560
an archetype someone from history it could be anyone so great i'm glad

237
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:30,720
yay so you can practice in that way on your own see great

238
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:37,599
thank you for bringing that up don you're and

239
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:43,359
just as i appreciate the reminder that we need not judge or practice no matter the outcome

240
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:50,560
even a good one yes yes i appreciate that exactly we're just planting seeds we're

241
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:58,319
planting seeds or planting seeds who are we to judge our practice it's it's more profound

242
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:04,160
than even we can understand it to be we don't want to limit our practice to our

243
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:11,359
limited mind and judge it good bad a star so great the other reflections we

244
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:15,760
have maybe time for one more reflection before we

245
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:23,280
transition hey nikki hey enough so

246
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:29,760
um i thought i'd share a story with the sangha that i think would support um the

247
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:38,319
theme that you introduced today a friend of mine used to volunteer with mother teresa and he told me a story of

248
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:43,520
a man who had donated a hospital to her and at the end of the tour

249
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:48,800
who who basically asked for a photo with mother teresa in front of the hospital

250
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,839
and this photo ended up being uh 15 minutes under the hot indian sun of him

251
00:45:53,839 --> 00:46:00,240
trying to pose mother teresa for the perfect photo for him and and at the end of it my friend who

252
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:05,599
was observing all this went up to mother teresa as the man left and said hey you know i thought that was

253
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:12,240
a bit rude um why did you agree to take this photo with this man and she turned to him and said poverty

254
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:17,760
comes in many forms [Music]

255
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,720

262
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:15,200
to stay uh if you have to go it's understandable

263
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:22,640
but if you're afraid to to be in small groups please stay if you if you have work to do family to

264
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:27,680
take care of it's okay but if you're afraid please stay it's really lovely this is a

265
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:32,800
very friendly sangha and there's just such beauty in the practice that can arise

266
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:38,480
from from sharing so so the invitation for tonight as we get

267
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:43,760
in small groups is again to start with 30 seconds of silent meta

268
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:49,280
for each other and receiving it from others

269
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:55,839
and then after the 30 seconds you are well you're invited to speak from

270
00:47:55,839 --> 00:48:00,880
your practice from your personal experience how this practice was for you what

271
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:06,400
worked what didn't just sharing sharing with the sangha and the sangha holding with

272
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:11,520
with care with compassion and you can share as little

273
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:20,480
much as you wish so um so with that making the groups

274
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:27,440
now and you can start with your with your uh meta

275
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:32,720
with your silent meta for the community

276
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:38,640
and i'm opening the groups now here we go

277
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:48,960
okay everyone welcome back so we've got a couple minutes for

278
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:56,319
reflections nicholas please that that hand shot right up tell me what's up enough of others in my

279
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:01,359
group it's it's anonymous um they came up that the the person that came up for them

280
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:07,040
was brought grief because they had passed or they were in poor health and so i thought that might be something

281
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:12,720
for a lot of people that would be helpful to discuss it's like whether to bring that person in in this case or how to

282
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:19,680
cope with grief also to work with that that's a good point and um

283
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:26,400
yeah and you know this practice is is intended to support the perception

284
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:31,599
through a compassionate being and not to bring up grief so if if this particular being is bringing up grief

285
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:38,079
then it's skillful to bow to them love them thank them and invite another

286
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:43,359
compassionate being until a day when this being coming up

287
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:49,920
doesn't bring up um doesn't bring up uh grief from i'll

288
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:57,839
share with you for example a lot of times a person who comes up is my mom for me who passed away three years ago

289
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:04,960
and i love her dearly and i still miss her and there is no grief there is just a sense of love that complete love

290
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:11,920
engulfing so until that can happen it is skillful to to use a different compassionate

291
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:18,079
image yeah thanks nicholas thanks for bringing that up fred please

292
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:24,800

300
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:18,400
