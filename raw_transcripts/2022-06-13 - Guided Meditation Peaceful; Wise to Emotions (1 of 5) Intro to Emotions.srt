1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:13,440
so good morning my friends and happy to be here with you again

2
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,480
and i've been on retreat for the last week and

3
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,920
i'm surprised to find myself sitting here with not feeling that there are many words

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,000
for the moment so um but feeling peaceful feeling

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,559
content happy so

6
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:44,879
we can begin and to

7
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:52,879
then i'll say something once we're settled some a little bit i'll i'll uh offer uh orientation a question for the

8
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,879
practice

9
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:05,119
so to allow yourself

10
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,840
to become quiet

11
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,280
to let your body become quiet

12
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:29,680
or if quiet is not possible let your body become quieter than it is

13
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,840
the quieting of the body

14
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:44,159
in a quieting of your eyes maybe if your eyes are open

15
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:51,280
let them gaze down or whatever direction the eyes are most

16
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,759
relaxed soft eyes

17
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:05,320
and to maybe gently close your eyes

18
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:16,560
and to gently quiet your mind

19
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,920
a quieting

20
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,080
maybe a reminder that now not much is needed

21
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,400
but to sit here quietly peacefully

22
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,280
and if the breath breathing is a refuge for you

23
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:56,800
become aware of your breathing aware of

24
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,879
the movements in your body as you breathe

25
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,799
then quietly slowly

26
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,680
comfortably take a deeper breath

27
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,640
not too deep just so it's nice

28
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,280
take a few deep breaths and as you exhale

29
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:02,920
a settling in your body releasing into your body

30
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,280
and letting your breathing return to normal

31
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,520
and a quiet gentle scanning of your body

32
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,560
to find the places of holding and tension

33
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,840
that as you exhale you can soften and quiet

34
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,680
as you exhale maybe quieting the thinking mind

35
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:33,560
maybe first by letting your thinking become slower

36
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,440
a bit more relaxed

37
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:04,720
and gently if you're going to be thinking think about your breathing

38
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,080
your body think about the here and now your direct

39
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:17,840
experience think about it in very simple

40
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:26,240
manner just wrecking thoughts of recognition this is an in-breath

41
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,840
this is an itch this is a sound

42
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:30,080
and might there be some even small hints

43
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:37,839
of being peaceful a peacefulness that

44
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:47,320
is underneath or outside of whatever agitation there might be

45
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:14,839
a peace which is not opposed to anything a piece which you can hold everything

46
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:27,760
and then as we continue this meditation you might ask yourself the following

47
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:36,160
question maybe ask yourself this question three or four times in the time we have here

48
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,240
what is happening right now

49
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:50,000
that if you recognize

50
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,040
you can be more peaceful about

51
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,240
what needs to be recognized here and now

52
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,040
so that you could be more peaceful about it

53
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,839
maybe more accepting of it

54
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:20,640
maybe more accepting of yourself as you are

55
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,800
what needs to be recognized

56
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,480
so it can be held in the context of peace

57
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,959
non-conflict

58
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,880
so

59
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,799
for sitting here meditating

60
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:25,159
what needs to be accepted so you can sit more calmly peacefully

61
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,640
so some degree of peace

62
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:52,520
provides the atmosphere for whatever is happening

63
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,080
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

64
00:26:53,120 --> 00:27:00,720
tapping into whatever calm or peace there might be here might be

65
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,799
around any agitation there is

66
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:18,120
and see if in your mind's eye you can gaze upon the world peacefully kindly

67
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:33,039
gaze upon the world with a vision with an eyesight that

68
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:38,880
can see the world peacefully calmly

69
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:51,840
there are places in the world where there is peace there is calmness

70
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,840
okay say be gazing upon the world kindly

71
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,919
love everyone

72
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,640
what might you learn from meditation practice

73
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,679
in holding everything peacefully

74
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,120
that might help you to love everyone

75
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:45,360
or to love a vast expanse of human beings

76
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,960
looking upon them kindly

77
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:02,720
may all beings be peaceful

78
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:10,080
may all beings be happy

79
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,960
may all beings

80
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,720
live in peaceful circumstances

81
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:27,320
may all beings have a peaceful heart

82
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:37,360
may all beings be happy

83
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,559
may all beings be free

84
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:50,939
[Music]

85
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,399
so

86
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:51,760
so good morning everyone and welcome to this monday morning and

87
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:57,760
nice to be back and and thank you meg for

88
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,720
teaching last week appreciate it very much and

89
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:13,440
so what i thought of doing this week

90
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:19,840
is to make and to have emotions be the theme

91
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:27,039
and to emotions are an important part of human life sometimes for ourselves and sometimes

92
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:34,399
for others and to be aware and wise about emotions

93
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:39,760
is one of the potentials of this mindfulness practice

94
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:45,200
because we can learn to be mindful of emotions and see them in new ways and

95
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:52,000
deeper ways fuller ways and

96
00:32:54,799 --> 00:33:02,080
so today i want to say some introductory words about this and that is to start off that

97
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:08,799
many of you know that i'm fond of the latin roots for the word emotion

98
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:14,080
that means out and the motion means motion

99
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:20,080
and here and so the um the

100
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:27,200
that which moves out and why i like this interpretation or this kind of etymological

101
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,240
playing with the word is that i like to think of

102
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:38,559
whatever emotions are they're changing they're in flux they're

103
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:44,080
they're moving and if we leave them alone

104
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:50,799
they move out they move out they settle out they they don't stay for too long

105
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:56,480
and so understanding the conditions that keep the emotions going

106
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:02,880
that fuel them that trigger them that perpetuate them is one of the things we can use the

107
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:10,720
mindfulness practice to do it seems that more literally the word

108
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:17,520
emotion comes not from first from latin but from french where it

109
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:24,079
in i think which i think in french means more to be excited by something

110
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:31,679
uh to be a certain kind of excitement agitation be to be stirred up by something

111
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:38,158
and was so you know it has this a little bit interesting is history but

112
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:45,520
even more interesting i i think is that um the the we take this word emotion many

113
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:53,440
of us speaking english take this english word emotion for granted or as if it's you know

114
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:59,760
describe something real or essential or

115
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:07,599
and important and certainly it does in certain ways but i find it fascinating that um

116
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:14,480
the english as an english word the word emotion wasn't was not coined

117
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:21,280
until around the early 1800s so it's uh only been around for

118
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,400
um [Music] you know a couple of hundred years in the english

119
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,599
language and there's a book on emotions and history of emotions

120
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:37,599
where the author says that kind of kind of maybe tongue-in-cheek a little bit

121
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:44,640
that until 1830 it wasn't until 1830 that the word emotion started to get currency or

122
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:51,440
it was actively adopted into popular speech in english i guess in england

123
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:58,400
and and so he says the author of this book says that until 1830 or so english-speaking people

124
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:04,880
didn't have emotions what they would refer to as they refer to having sentiments

125
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:10,079
or having he calls it accidents of the soul or passions

126
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:17,440
they had other words that they used for something that was in the domain in the range of

127
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:23,359
the world of emotions but they had kind of a different uh overlapped with different meanings it

128
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:29,680
doesn't mean exactly the same as what most many people here in english think of as emotions

129
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:35,599
and the um

130
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:46,480
and then i've looked it up in dictionaries for different definitions of what this word emotion is

131
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:52,560
and most of the definitions i see don't really tell me much

132
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:58,720
they don't not i don't feel like they're very helpful for providing a clear definition and this is one of the wonderful things

133
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:04,640
about this word emotion in english is that um there's no real agreement for what this

134
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:10,079
word means even in among psychologists there's different definitions different ideas of

135
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:15,920
what it is and so not having a clear precise definition

136
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:23,839
can also be seen as a gives us some freedom around it that we don't have to have some kind of

137
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:30,160
um fixed idea of what emotions are fixed ideas of

138
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:35,359
their role in our lives fixed ideas of their impact on us personally fixed

139
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:41,520
ideas of where they're going and what what's happening what they mean and

140
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:47,839
all that one of the things we can learn to do is to

141
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:52,960
whatever each of us individually refer to as an emotion

142
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:58,160
and we're allowed we're allowed to have our own definition and we're allowed to kind of use the

143
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:06,240
word to apply to what we're experiencing and as we see fit to use that word

144
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,599
but what we whatever whatever we were using that word to refer to

145
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:18,640
the practice of mindfulness can help us to discover freedom in a relationship to what we're

146
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:25,119
experiencing and so to experience freedom in relationship to emotions

147
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:32,240
and this is uh i'd like to propose for some of us it's a radical idea because it's not an idea that we need to

148
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:38,560
do anything about emotions we need to get rid of them the ones that are not we don't like

149
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:43,839
do we need to bring on the ones that we want

150
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:50,079
it isn't changing our emotions to be free of our free

151
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:57,440
with our emotions is to change our way of relating to them

152
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:05,440
to change the way we hold them or the way we think about them and this uh radical idea of discovering

153
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:13,280
discovering freedom in relationships to emotions to not be defined by them

154
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:18,320
not be pushed around by them not to

155
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,760
assume that emotions have meaning

156
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,280
that the emotions have a purpose emotions have

157
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,880
uh uh tell us who we are

158
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,960
or who we're not or all kinds of things all those things might exist together

159
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:46,480
with emotions but to be to discover freedom in relationship to them

160
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:52,560
to discover a peacefulness that can hold what

161
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:58,640
whatever emotion we have or to discover a wakefulness

162
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:04,400
to be awake to emotions as opposed to be overwhelmed by them

163
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:11,359
to be awake to emotions rather than being pushed by them or defined by them or

164
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:16,640
or or to without or to have emotions without assigning

165
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:22,000
meaning to them and

166
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:27,200
and so this ability then to give freedom to our emotions

167
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:32,640
is a tremendous gift to ourselves and the place where that gift i think is

168
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:38,880
safest to give and and the most productive is in meditation whether it's sitting

169
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,560
meditation or walking meditation and but in a context where

170
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:50,880
what we're doing is not acting out the emotion not acting because of the emotion

171
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:57,920
um not criticizing the motion not needing to not express the emotion because maybe

172
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,520
socially it's unacceptable in some way whatever we're feeling

173
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:08,560
but in meditation we're kind of we look peaceful the body's still quiet

174
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:14,560
but internally we can allow whatever the energies are the feelings are the

175
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,920
sensations might be the moods the states of mind that might be

176
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:26,319
associated with all this and the motivations that are associated with some emotions

177
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:33,599
that all these can flow through us to be present for us uh with permission we give permission to

178
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:39,359
it to be there we're not fighting emotions we're not feeling ashamed because of having

179
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:46,960
emotions we're not justifying some emotions we're not indulging in some emotions

180
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:52,560
and and we are just there's a ability to be

181
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:58,880
still to be quiet certain parts of us um and let make space create lots of

182
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:05,520
space for whatever the emotional expression is at the time and to be awake to it to be at peace

183
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:12,160
with it to allow it but don't and we're not going to act on it so if we're angry with someone we want to

184
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:20,079
punch them out we don't in meditation because we're not going to move and we just feel the energy that's there

185
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:26,240
if we have a strong desire for something we don't act on the desire

186
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:32,319
we just sit there and let the desire be there in that space of freedom just allow it

187
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:37,760
to be there without making a story or meaning or purpose out of it

188
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:44,240
if there's a wonderful emotional thing it really feels wonderful and delightful and this is where some people now will

189
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:50,960
protest uh we don't indulge in it we don't lean into it and they don't we don't

190
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:56,720
fuel it or or encourage it and some people say why not it's a good thing

191
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:04,720
it's true there are times when it's good to lean into and allow ourselves to really feel a lot of good emotions

192
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:10,240
when we're trying to discover how to be free with emotions we want to uh the freedom of something

193
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:15,520
has to be equally granted in all directions to what the good emotions are and the

194
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:22,560
difficult emotions and so certainly we're allowed to feel the good emotions but we don't indulge

195
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:29,359
in it we don't lean into it or savor it or actively enjoy it we just allow the

196
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:35,680
enjoyment to be there because we want to be able to do the same with the difficult emotions

197
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:42,160
allow them to be there maybe we don't lean into them always with those but we don't pull where we pull away

198
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:49,920
or we shut down or we attack or something so to learn how to be free

199
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:55,760
with our emotions is a huge gift from this mindfulness practice

200
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:01,599
and it begins by recognizing what our emotions are

201
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:06,720
and and you're allowed to have it your way in this recognition things

202
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:12,880
different cultures different places in the world different languages have a somewhat different relationship with

203
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,920
what we might think of as emotions and maybe different families different

204
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:23,440
all kinds of things so here in this practice is freedom practice you're allowed it for it to be

205
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:30,240
your way and your associations with it with the with the idea

206
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:37,920
that a clear mindfulness of your emotional life clear recognition of what's there

207
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:43,359
i can support you to hold it peacefully

208
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:49,440
to be aware of it without being pushed around by it and

209
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:54,720
so what i'd like to suggest that as we start this week is that um

210
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:02,000
you reflect some on your emotional life and two things one is you you kind of uh reflect on

211
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,680
what are the different emotions that move through you through the day

212
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:13,280
you might at the end of the day write down a list of all the emotions you can identify that you've had for

213
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:18,960
that day from the subtle to the big and once you have that long list of all

214
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:24,000
the emotions you see there look and see what are there any patterns

215
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:30,880
certain emotions appear more often or more predominant and then reflect a little bit about what

216
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:36,720
you've learned about emotions um what you have um

217
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:41,839
what your culture your family your religion your society your language your

218
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:48,800
languages if you speak different languages how what what have you learned about this emotional life of yours and how you

219
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:55,280
identify it and what you think they are so um that'll be the beginning of our

220
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:00,800
reflections for this week and um happy to be back and happy to

221
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:08,839
to to be sharing this with you thank you
