1
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:18,119
good morning good day everyone and welcome to

2
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,240
our inside meditation sitting

3
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,480
and this is the period of time where

4
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,399
the teachings are about insight the insight of insight meditation one of the

5
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:45,360
primary ones which is a kind of a deep

6
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:54,160
um insight into the changing nature of our experience into inconstancy

7
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,280
how things change how things disappear they arise

8
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,600
this is a kind of a universal human source for wisdom and deep understanding

9
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:12,240
of life and in a way the Buddhist tradition puts particular emphasis on it

10
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,680
that uh that um

11
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:25,040
uh it has tremendous value for the purposes of liberation of becoming free

12
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,040
and one of the reasons for that is that any ways in which we

13
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,119
interrupt the experience of change any ways in which we freeze our

14
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:44,240
experience or hold on to it or or raify it solidify it with how we think how we

15
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,840
perceive uh we add tension to our life and that

16
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:57,119
at first just might be a tension of trying to hold um the river back i mean try to get into

17
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:04,439
the river and stop the water from flowing is not going to be easy it's going to be frustrating

18
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:10,959
um and uh it might just be stressful it might end up into a major source of

19
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:18,319
suffering to be out of harmony out of attunement out of um

20
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,760
uh harmony with the changing nature of momentto-

21
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:34,319
moment experience and sometimes I think of it as a wind drag that we are uh have a big hands out

22
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,720
something out the window of a car and or something that's a big load on the back

23
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:47,519
of the car pickup truck and it's causing the wind is slowing the car down

24
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,280
or an anchor or some heavy object hanging over the back of a rowboat that

25
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,800
makes it much harder to row

26
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:06,319
so to pull in the wind drag to pull up the anchors to

27
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:13,159
untie the boat so we can flow with the the river

28
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:20,560
so it's poss but it's possible to know and feel and recognize that we have

29
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:28,879
stepped out of the river of change and uh and then put ourselves back and

30
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:35,519
it's as simple as returning to the breathing breathing itself represents

31
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:42,720
and is uh not only represents but uh can be uh kept at the center of this river

32
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:49,519
of change so to assume a meditation posture

33
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:55,519
and the paradox a little bit is that the stiller we are with our bodies the

34
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,439
stiller we are especially with our minds our inner life

35
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:07,840
the more we're attuned more we feel and experience change

36
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,799
the more we're caught in our thoughts the more busy the mind is

37
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:20,400
the more the mind tends to manufacture or interpret

38
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,320
that things are a particular way that they don't change

39
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:33,240
they'll always be this way or they'll never be different

40
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:42,880
so to sit quietly with a in a meditation posture that allows the

41
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,440
body to be still and quiet

42
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,039
in a way that feels nurturing

43
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,199
feels satisfying

44
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,560
and to gently close the eyes

45
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:19,680
and with the eyes closed to scan through your body

46
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,919
to see if there's some places where you can soften and relax

47
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,039
tensions of the shoulders

48
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,240
holdings of the belly

49
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:53,080
Tightness in the face around the lips

50
00:05:53,199 --> 00:06:00,759
the jaw around the eyes

51
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:16,360
tension is one of those ways in which we all too easily

52
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,639
impute permanence or constancy or

53
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:28,759
tension all too easily

54
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:37,720
causes us to be out of touch with the changing nature of experience

55
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,440
and within this posture that you're meditating in

56
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:56,560
if your body is relatively still then chances are the biggest movement in

57
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,520
your body is a movement of breathing

58
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:15,800
and the movement of breathing has within it

59
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,479
change the biggest is breathing the change

60
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:30,440
between breathing in to breathing out between breathing out and breathing in

61
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:48,280
and the closest place to feel the change is in the sensations of breathing

62
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:09,280
you might be aware of two or three different sensations in the course of breathing in

63
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:16,919
sensations in your belly your chest nostrils

64
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:42,120
some of the sensations change in intensity the brief moments that they're present

65
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:02,800
and the sensations you're experiencing are also being sensed

66
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:10,640
there's a certain physical sensitivity that allows us to feel

67
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:20,360
sensations that allows us to recognize know

68
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,720
the experience in the body of breathing

69
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,800
as you exhale

70
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,480
soften relax the thinking mind

71
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:10,360
settling your awareness into the sensations of breathing

72
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:36,240
and have gentle quiet slow thoughts

73
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,320
thinking about the experience of breathing

74
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:48,720
not in the abstract but gentle thoughts about the direct

75
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:58,040
experience almost like a gentle instructions

76
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,800
stay there

77
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,320
what is this experience of breathing

78
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,000
let me feel it more carefully

79
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:30,320
or it might be very quiet words of in as you breathe in

80
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,440
out as you breathe out

81
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:45,320
it might almost be a nonverbal thinking

82
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:54,720
that keeps you closely connected

83
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,600
to the sensations of breathing in and breathing out

84
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:15,839
and as you feel the sensations of breathing see if you can

85
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:23,399
ride along with how they shift and change

86
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:33,959
almost like there's a river of change right there in your body as you breathe

87
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:51,880
the thinking mind quiet letting go of any thoughts except those

88
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:58,760
which which allow you to stay intimate connected

89
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,160
to the river of sensations

90
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,600
connected to your breathing

91
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:52,519
and when your mind wanders off in thought

92
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,560
notice how it takes you away from the sensations of change

93
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,279
out of the river

94
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:14,240
and how the s the thinking contributes to a world of ideas and

95
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,279
memories and plans

96
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:28,199
that is kind of a holding on kind of a solidifying in thought

97
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:36,320
that removes us from the changing sensations changing

98
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,279
nature of the present moment

99
00:20:52,880 --> 00:21:01,320
and then notice whatever thoughts reactions

100
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:08,559
take you out of the river of change

101
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:15,960
pull you away from the changing nature of sensations direct experience

102
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:33,640
maybe some thoughts even feel like they solidify around ideas beliefs

103
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:45,240
plans and memories with a feeling like this is how it is

104
00:21:53,600 --> 00:22:02,400
noticing the difference between staying close to the immediacy of change

105
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:08,360
moment after moment in your body

106
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:17,400
versus losing that intimacy to change

107
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,799
being caught up in thoughts

108
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:08,200
Noticing ways in which you tighten up

109
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:15,760
grasp hold tight contract around certain thoughts ideas

110
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:22,640
feelings that take you away

111
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:30,720
from The flow of changing sensations the river of change that's here and now

112
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,440
in direct experience

113
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,760
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

114
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:40,440
as you exhale soften the thinking mind

115
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,000
as you exhale

116
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:57,919
let the thinking mind open wide so the thoughts can empty out of the

117
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:05,559
mind think thoughts can float away

118
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:11,520
in favor of an openness and a spaciousness

119
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,559
of a quiet mind

120
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,158
as you exhale

121
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,559
to set your heart at ease

122
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:41,320
lifting the weight the pressure

123
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,760
the contractions around your heart center

124
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:58,360
so that the heart center can be softer calmer

125
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,400
and softening the belly

126
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:22,200
so the belly can be settling offer stability

127
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:30,840
a foundation for being here and now

128
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:40,200
and a way then to gaze upon the world kindly

129
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:50,000
to sit here softly gently and to consider

130
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,279
the world around you

131
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:02,240
the people in your life and what it's like to not get caught in

132
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:09,399
thoughts and judgments interpretations desires

133
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:15,279
but to be open to them in a gentle soft

134
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:22,080
flowing way wishing them well

135
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:32,240
so we see them through the lens of appreciation

136
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:37,520
care kindness instead of the ways in which we've

137
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:43,120
locked into interpretations and desires and ideas

138
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:50,320
about others may we through this practice

139
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:57,279
free people from our projections our interpretations our needs our

140
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:05,158
desires may we through this practice

141
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:16,640
offer people freedom from us

142
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:25,840
may we offer them wishes of well-being and happiness safety and peace

143
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:33,279
may all beings be happy may all beings

144
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:40,600
be safe may all beings be peaceful

145
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:49,320
may all beings be free at least free

146
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:56,278
from our attachments our clings

147
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:03,159
our ways of holding on to how things should be

148
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,640
may we contribute to peace in this world

149
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:26,450
[Music]

150
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,919
thank you

151
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:38,799
so hello and welcome to this continuing series on the insights of insight

152
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:43,840
meditation and the topic currently is the First

153
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:51,039
insight insight into anicha anicha is the poly word often translated

154
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:57,279
as impermanence but in fact what it means is uh not

155
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:03,039
constant so inconstancy and the difference between those two

156
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:08,640
English words is impermanence is often inter interpreted that things will end

157
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:14,000
that things are not permanent because some point they'll stop being there

158
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,760
uh in constancy in contrast means that things are constantly changing they come

159
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:28,159
and they go that um uh days are not going to stop but uh individual days

160
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:35,840
stop and then the day comes back daytime comes and goes meals come and go

161
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:41,039
breathing comes and goes sleep comes and goes

162
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:47,679
all kinds of things in our life come and go and come and go and come and go breathing comes and goes comes and goes

163
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:55,919
comes and goes the heart beats uh ongoingly but each beat is an unc un

164
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:04,799
inconstant sensation in constant event a beat and it stops a beat and it stops

165
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:11,440
so it turns out that um if we don't imputee permanence if we don't get

166
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,480
caught up in our thoughts and ideas and have ideas this is how it's always going

167
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:23,840
to be this is how it is if we don't live in that world of concepts and ideas that

168
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:31,519
um it's much easier to experience how the present moment is always changing

169
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,880
always in constant and this fascinating difference between

170
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:44,799
the world of conception the world of ideas the world of plans the world of

171
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:50,640
stories um is that versus the world of direct

172
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:56,759
experience um is the difference between

173
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:03,039
um uh flowing down a river on a canoe in a

174
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:09,520
kayak versus sitting on the side of the shore and

175
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:15,760
fantasizing about how what a good kayaker I am i'm the best kayaker i'm a

176
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,839
great kayaker i'm the always be a good kayaker or I'm a terrible kayaker where

177
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:28,158
we lock in to an idea this is how things are and someone who's a good kayaker

178
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:33,440
will have a day they're not someone who's a terrible kayaker can

179
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:42,079
learn a skill and become better and there we don't have to have a fixed idea of how things are um I've had fixed

180
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:48,638
ideas of a friend maybe I felt hurt by someone who was angry and uh was holding

181
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:54,960
on to that anger seeing them through the lens of what happened a week ago

182
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:01,359
not realizing that they had changed uh it's something dramatic maybe very difficult that happened in their life in

183
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:06,880
the intervening days and uh I was still carrying my anger this is how this

184
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:12,880
person is and then I found out that they had a terrible loss and uh and as soon

185
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:19,280
as I hear that uh the the view I had before falls away and I'm ready to see

186
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,480
them now as they actually are i've seen people through the lens of my desires

187
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,920
where that desires was holding a fixed idea of who that person was and then

188
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:37,839
have those desires kind of soften relax or disappear as a lens of perception and

189
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:44,800
discovered that people are very different than the thought I had of how I the kind of desires or wishes I had

190
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:51,040
for them and so over and over and over again we can lock in to this is how

191
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:58,160
things are this is our interpretation that gives a kind of permanence a kind of constancy a kind of like solidity to

192
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:03,520
something that's inherently not solid it's always shifting and changing our

193
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:10,800
friends are always different from moment to moment minute to minute day to day our strangers are often different than

194
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:16,720
how we project ideas onto them bias prejudice all kinds of things that

195
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:22,480
we do are um are um

196
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:29,119
ways in which we solidify around ideas uh people spend a lot of time ruminating

197
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,320
thinking about themselves over and over again constantly tend to build up and

198
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:42,079
create fixed ideas of themselves often that are debilitating that can cause depression or anxiety or shame or all

199
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:50,240
kinds of things and um and this idea of fixating on ideas of self causes a lot of suffering

200
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:56,800
what we're learning to do in in mindfulness practice is to recognize

201
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:03,440
the difference between being locked in to ideas that give a sense of constancy

202
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:09,920
even permanence idea that I'll always be this way versus how things are in a

203
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:17,520
direct experience at a level that's deeper or more uh immediate than the

204
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,960
ideas the attachments we We have generally attachments

205
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:30,240
clings we have when we grasp onto something uh lends a sense of permanence at least

206
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,599
to the idea that we're grasping onto and this is what I need this is how it is

207
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:42,160
this is what's going on and in the doing that we've stepping out of the direct

208
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:48,160
flowing experience in the present moment of things always changing always changing

209
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:54,960
so as we sit in mindfulness meditation and settle in and especially you know we

210
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:02,640
f this this these talks are following the long series on samadei as we develop samadei and stability and centerness and

211
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:10,240
really find ourselves be able to rest here in the present moment in the direct experience not an easy thing to do

212
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,280
that's why samadei is really helpful to develop that capacity to be really right

213
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:22,560
here part of the value of That is to is is then to be able to rest in the

214
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:28,240
changing river of sensations experience thoughts feelings how it's all shifting

215
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:34,960
and changing much faster than our our interpretations our ideas of things

216
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:43,040
allow or admit or see and uh this is a very important insight

217
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:50,560
because what it allows is begins to show us the cost of attachment it begins to

218
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:57,359
show us how some of our suffering is born from some some kind of attitude

219
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:04,400
some kind of orientation towards permanence this is how things are this is how things need to be some kind of

220
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:11,359
permanence around holding on to an idea holding on to a memory holding on to a

221
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:18,720
plan or dream about the future that we're we're locked into something um and

222
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:24,320
even if it's a fantasy we're locked into and that fantasy is you know that we're

223
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:32,320
fantasy if we're kayaking or doing something wonderful there's something about being locked in that begins to

224
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:38,720
create a kind of sense of permanence in the knowing in the knower in the one who

225
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:46,800
is engaged any kind of clinging any kind of attachment is a form of stress that

226
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:52,800
gives us the wrong impression about uh what this world and life is about it

227
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:59,520
gives us a semblance of a fixed sense of self a fixed idea of

228
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:07,040
of desires a fixed idea of that tension or pressure um stress is kind of

229
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:13,200
something that's always built into reality into society that we um we have

230
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:20,560
to just go along with and many people don't see that how attached they are how

231
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:26,960
much they're clinging how much they've tightened up around ideas beliefs stories about themselves interpretations

232
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:32,960
judgments and the the vantage point that seeing

233
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:40,320
impermanence seeing the changing nature the inconstant nature of direct experience is it highlights how we get

234
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:46,480
caught it highlights how we're attached and it almost doesn't matter what we're

235
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:52,640
attached to uh we know we start seeing the cost we

236
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:58,160
see the tension we see the stress of holding on

237
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:04,160
that's a consequence of having of no longer being in the flow no longer being

238
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:10,720
in that river of change that things are always flowing and moving so that part of the insight of insight

239
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:19,200
meditation is the insight into how we suffer how we cling how we've lost

240
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:26,000
touch of something very immediate and nice here which we don't necessarily

241
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,599
think of as nice because the allure of thoughts the allure of promise of doing

242
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:38,160
things getting through our to-do list um fantasizing planning uh being caught up

243
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:46,400
in the world of activity can seem more promising more valuable than the simp

244
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:53,119
simple uh simplicity of being the simplicity of joy of happiness

245
00:41:53,119 --> 00:42:00,160
contentment of just being here and so as we start settling into the

246
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:06,079
inconstant nature of breathing the flow of experience we start can see how we

247
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:12,880
leave that for solidity we leave that for attachment and that is invaluable to

248
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:20,160
see this is the beginning of a real wisdom in Buddhism to real ability to be

249
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:25,280
your own teacher to see what you're doing to see what is healthy for you to

250
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:31,520
do and what is unhealthy and the opportunity is to be able to drop into this world of direct

251
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:38,160
experience so that in a deep way our understanding

252
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:45,920
our interpret our understandings our insight our attitudes our motivations

253
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:52,480
our way of living in the world arises from someplace deep inside

254
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,680
that is quite capable of living in a rich even sophisticated way in this

255
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:03,359
world without any attachments at all that we can take care of ourselves we

256
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:09,520
can be creative we can be living with our with the conditions of the world

257
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:15,599
responding from a deep place inside that's part and parcel of this river of

258
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:24,759
change that we are just like a skilled kayaker

259
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:33,119
is completely wisely knowledgeably aware of the river the rapids the currents all

260
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:40,000
the ways in which to paddle and to shift the weight there's a tremendous amount

261
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:47,359
that goes into into being a kayaker but it all exists and flows from this

262
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:53,920
deeper place of constant change and being part of that change in a sophisticated way as soon as the person

263
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:59,680
gets locked in to these ideas they lose touch with the kayaking and they might

264
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:05,280
even lose touch of with the shifting nature of the river and they can you

265
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:13,520
know end up in trouble we stay safe safer

266
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:18,880
in the river of life if we don't get attached and part of the

267
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:25,760
function of this deep insight into inconstancy is to see how we get caught so as you go

268
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:32,640
through uh your day today start noticing how you get caught

269
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:38,240
notice how the cost of being caught notice what you lose touch with

270
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:43,359
notice how often it happens and then maybe at the end of the day or some

271
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:48,400
point in the day if there's a friend that you can talk about such things

272
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:54,000
maybe maybe a dharma friend you can call uh maybe talk about what you're learning

273
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:00,480
about the difference between being in the present moment in a full way and losing

274
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:09,520
that in some way through being caught in ideas feelings attitudes beliefs bias

275
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:15,359
become wise about attachment and you'll become a much better kayaker in this

276
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:22,440
world of this world that we live in thank you
