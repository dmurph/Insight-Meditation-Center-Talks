1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:10,400
hello everyone and warm greetings very happy to be back here after being

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,200
away for a week and um

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:22,240
someone hears loud no hum not buzzing

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,519
so i'm also hearing buzzing

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,960
i'm better now it's the silence audio fine here okay so hopefully it's all okay well enough i'm

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,079
sorry for the people with the buzz i'm not sure what to do the

7
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:46,878
the heater is on so i don't know if they were picking up the sound of the heater here it's um

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,120
so

9
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,440
good morning

10
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,880
there's a kind of a rule of the road

11
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:16,000
kind of for rules the right word but it's um that when you're driving a car

12
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,880
you vary the distance between yourself and the car in front of you depending on the speed in which you're

13
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,560
driving so if you're driving um slow you might

14
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,920
keep your you know one car's distance from the other car

15
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,960
but then uh as you go faster maybe at 50 miles an hour you want to keep at least five cars distance from

16
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:47,600
the car in front of you so there's enough time to slow down and stop if something else something happens

17
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:54,399
and it's certainly done with a tailgate and so the same thing with our life

18
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:01,200
the faster our life goes the more space you want to have

19
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,200
between your thoughts that maybe if you're just sitting

20
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,200
quietly and just ruminating and thinking nicely that it's fine just let your thoughts do

21
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,879
the speed with which they go but when the thoughts start tailgating

22
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:25,200
thoughts start kind of one after the other without any pause whatsoever

23
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,800
and if especially if the thoughts are going fast then

24
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,560
there's not much room for a deeper awareness of what's happening

25
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,959
there's not much room to stop and really see and consider and be wise

26
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:51,280
about what is going on so the idea the possibility of

27
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:58,400
slowing our thinking down or maybe not slowing it down exactly but

28
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:05,519
giving space for thoughts the space between our thinking our thoughts

29
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,959
and not to have the thoughts kind of run through our minds one after the

30
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:18,400
other is a one of the wonderful ways of develop tapping into our own wisdom

31
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,599
and also our own safety we become safe safer

32
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:29,280
if we're not tailgating our thoughts because then we don't see enough they come so fast we don't really

33
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,680
see what's happening so does so so with that as a background for this

34
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,319
meditation

35
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:50,720
assuming a meditation posture in which you can sit in an alert way

36
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:00,000
if you take a really deep deep full breath and let your chest feel and

37
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,799
with air and then that sense of openness in the chest

38
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:13,599
as you exhale don't lose all of it sit with a posture that allows a chest

39
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:19,600
to be a little bit open a little bit expanded

40
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,160
sometimes if you take a very deep deep breath at the beginning so much so that you feel you're

41
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,800
pulling on your shoulders as the rib cages that expand upward

42
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:42,120
then when you exhale let your shoulders relax

43
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,360
and same thing if you take a very deep full breath and let your

44
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,479
the diaphragm when you breathe in pushes down if you're relaxed

45
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:06,320
and expands the belly to take a deep breath and relax and let

46
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,800
the belly expand as fully as you can

47
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,160
and then as you exhale let the weight of the belly settle

48
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:30,160
and then if your eyes are still open you can lower your gaze

49
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,240
if it's comfortable you can close your eyes

50
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:46,160
and then breathing normally

51
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,120
on the exhale relaxing the muscles of the face

52
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,960
on the exhale

53
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,120
softening the shoulders

54
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:27,479
on the exhale relaxing the belly

55
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:41,199
on the exhale relaxing your arms and hands

56
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,120
and if it feels right you can adjust the posture of your hands

57
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:12,719
and on the exhale relax your brain

58
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,319
as if the brain is a muscle

59
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:38,319
and then notice kind of the speed by which you're

60
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:45,840
thinking are your thoughts fast and tailgating each other

61
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:59,360
and if they are on the exhale can you soften and slow

62
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,918
down your thinking

63
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:30,479
maybe at the end of the exhale let there be a brief pause in your

64
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:36,080
breathing breathe breathe in a brief pause in your

65
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,080
thinking

66
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:50,440
so you begin getting a feel for there being space between thoughts

67
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:23,839
and then begin settling down into the body's experience of breathing

68
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,760
relaxing your thinking mind as you exhale

69
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,279
letting there be a simple pause in your thinking

70
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,320
at the end of the exhale

71
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,120
and maybe with that pause

72
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:54,279
you can receive more fully the beginning of the inhale

73
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,480
noticing the speed in which you're thinking

74
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:57,840
can you calm your speed calm your thinking down

75
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:09,280
slow your thinking and with the slowest thinking that's

76
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,320
available direct your thinking

77
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,080
to think about your breathing

78
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:29,200
with the simplest shortest thoughts you can thoughts of recognition

79
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:35,640
of the experience of breathing here and now

80
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,320
and as you're sitting here

81
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,000
if there's any degree of calm

82
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,799
align yourself with that calmness

83
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:23,799
allow yourself to feel the calmness the subtleness

84
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:40,360
letting the thinking mind enjoy the calmness

85
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,240
and as we come to the end of the sitting

86
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:38,880
perhaps you can consider that when you have a traffic jam of

87
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:45,200
thoughts there's not much space in the mind to

88
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,880
take in other people to really

89
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:59,440
see them hear them feel them recognize what's happening with them in

90
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,759
some fuller way

91
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:10,158
but when the thinking becomes quieter slower

92
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
it's possible to gaze upon others to look upon them

93
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,480
to see them

94
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,919
more fully

95
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,760
and that ability to be present for others

96
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:42,000
can be a gift can be a form of generosity

97
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:49,399
of care of kindness friendliness

98
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:02,320
may it be that the calmness and subtleness that might come from this

99
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:08,000
meditation today whether you know it or not

100
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:15,279
may it be that it somehow comes with us into our

101
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,240
life in the world

102
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:27,039
so that we're more present for people listening better hearing better

103
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:32,480
seeing better without the distraction

104
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:38,200
of a lot of thinking preoccupations

105
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:48,159
may it be that this meditation that we do serves for the welfare and happiness of

106
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:55,440
others may all beings be happy

107
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,960
may all beings be safe

108
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:07,600
may all beings be peaceful

109
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,320
and may all beings be free

110
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:39,760
so good morning everyone and welcome to this monday morning talk

111
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:46,399
and this morning or this week i'd like the theme

112
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:52,399
to be calmness and to discuss five different areas or

113
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:59,200
aspects of calmness and meditation is often associated with

114
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,399
calmness but not for its own sake though it can be quite nice for its own

115
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:11,360
sake but because calmness allows for greater wisdom to operate

116
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:16,640
it allows us to a greater capacity to see what's happening

117
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:22,640
and also sets up the conditions where it's easier to let go

118
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,840
of things which are healthy like to let go of there's more space in the mind or

119
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:34,080
softness in the mind where a clinging begins to loosen its grip

120
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:40,000
so to talk about calmness and

121
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:46,279
so the the

122
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:54,320
i when i think about this topic i think about it in relationship also to a distracted mind

123
00:31:54,320 --> 00:32:01,600
a mind that is caught up in his thoughts and preoccupations that um

124
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:08,320
the faster the thinking is the more preoccupied the mind is the more uh chances are that the mind

125
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,760
and maybe even the body is not tranquil does not calm

126
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:21,600
um and what happens when we're when there's a you know incessant chatter in the mind thinking

127
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:27,279
fast thinking one thought follows the other thoughts are tailgating each other

128
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:34,559
is that uh where our ability to un to perceive to understand

129
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:40,240
to um be creative to be um

130
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:46,080
is is diminished because the uh the busy thoughts

131
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:52,000
fill the bandwidth they fill the space and so other forms of intelligence as we

132
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,480
have other forms of ways of of perceiving and of reflecting

133
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,799
uh don't have a chance to operate but when we when thinking when we're not

134
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:10,240
distracted then we're also not distracted from

135
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:15,840
our deeper wisdom our deeper understanding we're not distracted from taking the

136
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:23,440
time to really see what's here the uh recently i heard someone say that

137
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,640
the more urgency he feels the slower he goes

138
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:34,240
but that was a wonderful principle because when things are urgent

139
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,600
it's probably a time when we have to really use all our mental capacities to

140
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:46,399
problem solve to figure out to understand what's happening to do things well to not be impulsive and make mistakes

141
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:53,600
because we didn't take time to learn what happened and so to um to

142
00:33:53,600 --> 00:34:00,240
to learn the art of calming ourselves learning the art of not being swept away

143
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,360
in destructive thoughts and agitated mind

144
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:10,560
is one of the most useful things that one of the great useful things we can learn from meditation and for

145
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:16,960
mindfulness but it's easier to learn it if we begin to appreciate

146
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:24,320
the value of calmness they uh and maybe we can begin by understanding

147
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:30,800
the uh they appreciate the calmness of a calm mind or more specifically

148
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:36,000
calm thinking it's hard to uh

149
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
well the buddha talked about the calmness and calming speech

150
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,839
so if you find yourself speaking very fast and sometimes when we get agitated we

151
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:53,520
speak faster speech how we speak and the speed by

152
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:58,720
which we speak we have some control over

153
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:04,560
some it's easier to control when we speak and how fast we speak

154
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:09,839
than it is to control our thoughts and our thinking because we have to engage more

155
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:19,440
physically with the act of speaking to begin experimenting and getting a feel for

156
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:26,880
speaking in ways that are not hurried begins giving you a feeling a sense

157
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:32,320
of what it's like for the thinking mind to also be unhurried

158
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:38,320
and then to begin slowing the thinking mind down especially

159
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:44,800
when you're distracted when you're distracted by your thoughts and your thoughts and concerns

160
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:52,880
and so to um slow down calm down the thinking mind

161
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:59,040
like you would come down speaking so the advantage of this is is not

162
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:05,520
saying stop thinking let go of your thoughts which might be too tall of an order for

163
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:11,520
anyone to you know do effectively in daily life but

164
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:16,640
but maybe it's possible to begin slowing down your thoughts

165
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:21,839
to have a little more space around them or a little more calmness associated with them

166
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:28,960
and um and so how do we do that one of the ways is to do it

167
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:35,520
relax the body chances are that if you're thinking in a fast

168
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:42,000
distracted way that something in your physical system is tense this tight this

169
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,760
pushing or leaning forward or or kind of holding on to some some feeling

170
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:53,760
holding on so to relax relax the belly relax the shoulders

171
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:59,440
and that's the advantage of some of this relaxation is they can be done without anybody else knowing that you're doing

172
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:05,599
it you can do it at meetings you can do it sitting in traffic you can do it you

173
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:11,359
know standing in line at the store you can take a little bit of time to relax

174
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:16,400
if you feel like you don't have the time to relax when you're standing in a line

175
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:23,599
cashier line check check in line at a store then you're probably

176
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:29,760
caught up in some kind of distraction something that is limiting

177
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:36,240
the depths of your wisdom the depths of your clarity of really seeing what's happening

178
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:42,160
so be very careful by the insistent voice in the mind or the sense of authority that distracted thoughts can

179
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:48,320
have like it's really important to think about this i have to think about it's so important this concern

180
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:54,400
and the kind of fear and sometimes desperation that goes in or the desire or the greed

181
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:00,240
that might even go in to thinking it has an insistence in it

182
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:07,040
when when that happens and you can't standing in a checkout line can't stand on your boat both feet and relax and

183
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:12,880
just um you know just relax your body for a few

184
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:19,040
minutes for a few moments then i then there's not much chances are

185
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:25,520
that your innate natural wisdom and clarity of thinking is not going to be available

186
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:31,040
because you're caught in that insistence that push to think so you might

187
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:36,480
take go as you go through the day look for opportunities maybe secret

188
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:41,760
opportunities no one needs to know you're relaxing your belly or your shoulders or

189
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:47,040
your face or whatever your hands but look for opportunities to relax

190
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:53,680
and see in that relaxing or that intention to relax if there starts to be a tug of war with

191
00:38:53,680 --> 00:39:00,960
your thinking mind thinking minds kind of doing somehow in some form or other saying no

192
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,079
no we don't have time for this it's so important to be

193
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:12,160
thinking fast and furiously or so important to be caught up in thinking about this concern

194
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:18,000
and maybe that's not the case maybe

195
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,240
if you really have an important concern that something that really needs to be thought about

196
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,359
maybe you think about it more effectively

197
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:35,920
better when you're calm when you're relaxed um when you slow down

198
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:42,480
when the thinking mind becomes slow enough that you can be attuned to what it feels like how you know that you're

199
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:49,680
in your body you feel embodied we thinking mind slows down enough there's a space to be aware of your

200
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:57,040
emotions and feelings kind of the deeper emotional connection to what's happening not the surface emotions of fear or

201
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:03,200
desire but slowed out enough to kind of those are kind of often symptoms of something deeper

202
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:09,599
and if you can slow down and calm down enough to fill in the picture with more of how you are who you are how

203
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:14,960
you are with more space for undistracted thoughts

204
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:20,319
calm relaxed thoughts that somehow arise from a deeper place of understanding a

205
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:25,839
deeper place of creativity within us uh often we can we

206
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:34,000
can find our way better with our challenges in our life than if we are have an agitated mind

207
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:39,520
so to uh practice to have an unagitated mind

208
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:46,160
is the same thing as a calm mind and and one of the vehicles for doing that

209
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:51,520
is a calmness of body a relaxation of body and this wonderful interplay and

210
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:57,839
mutuality between mind and body in terms of helping us be calmer

211
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:02,960
if some of you don't like the word calm there's other words tranquility

212
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,960
serenity peace ease all these words are kind of like in the

213
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:15,520
same family and if you don't like any of those words and you think it's too high bar or

214
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:21,200
somehow not not appealing then perhaps

215
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:26,319
an unagitated mind an unagitated body

216
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:31,520
because when you're agitated we can't be so wise

217
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:37,920
and we can't be kind it's harder to be kind it's hard to be generous from a place of depth and one of the

218
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:43,440
wonderful things about becoming calm and unagitated our care for others our friendliness to

219
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:49,119
others or attention to others they'll feel that it comes from a different place

220
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:54,240
in us it's bigger it's more richer it's more connected

221
00:41:54,240 --> 00:42:01,200
if we connect to others with a calm place rather than a distracted place or an agitated place

222
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:07,119
or this fast pace that some people some of us can be in sometimes where

223
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:12,400
there's not really enough space let it known for ourselves really in a deep way

224
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,839
but let not enough space for others as well

225
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:24,079
so calmness and maybe this week's theme will be useful

226
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:29,119
for you especially as we're getting ready for this

227
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:35,440
winter season and holiday season may you become a student of calmness

228
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,280
this week thank you
