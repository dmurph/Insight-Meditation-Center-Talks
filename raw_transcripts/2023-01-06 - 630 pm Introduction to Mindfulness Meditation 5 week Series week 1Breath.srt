1
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:43,440

8
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:34,380

9
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:40,019

Michael Michael Evan Kevin

12
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,540
hi Debbie welcome all of you yeah and we have Sally managing thank you Sally and

13
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:06,480
Richard recording yeah and for those of you who haven't been

14
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:13,620
here before there are two bathrooms three bathrooms in the back over there so please feel free to get up if you

15
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:18,839
need to unveil yourself there's also water over

16
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:25,860
there and so is it um is our custom to take off

17
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:32,760
our masks when teaching it makes it a little bit easier for people but first before I do that I want to

18
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:38,760
make sure there's nobody that has concerns about being in a space with somebody unmasked we do have fans going

19
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:44,360
but we have filters blue air filter is going

20
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:49,740
is anybody uncomfortable that one isn't working but um all of the

21
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:55,560
others in the room are we have several standalones and then we

22
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:01,560
also have a HEPA filtration system that is going that has sterilization in it

23
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,940
that is running right now right

24
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:14,519
so if we do unmask it will just be the teacher's unmasked everyone else in the group will stay masked that's how we

25
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:19,800
keep it safe so could we get an opt-in if people are

26
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,440
okay with the two of us being unmasked

27
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:40,500
so welcome I'll get us started um and I also want to welcome people on

28
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,600
YouTube I have some friends watching right now glad you're there

29
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:53,700
and I know there's some other people who would you know communicated with IMC about attending YouTube so

30
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:59,399
um Richard will be checking the chat for questions at specific times and writing

31
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:04,620
the questions down and we'll try and answer them as we can for those folks on YouTube

32
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:11,579
um so I think one thing that is really

33
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:17,399
important for me to acknowledge about the space is that um Insight Meditation

34
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:24,899
Center and everything that's offered here is I'm all part of a result of

35
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:33,240
generosity and that this space um is exists because of generosity

36
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:40,800
the teachings exist because of generosity the maintenance of the place exists because

37
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:49,339
of volunteers it's all volunteer and there's no such thing as you know

38
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:55,760
membership application you're a member if you want to be and

39
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:02,700
it's really it's really your choice to engage in the center as much as you wish

40
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:09,800
so we're all the caretakers of the space it belongs to all of us

41
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:18,060
another thing that feels important to say for people um often hi come on in

42
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:24,959
is that um the series that Don and I are are teaching it's a series that's taught in

43
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:30,260
a particular way in a particular order that's um

44
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:37,220
kind of tradition for the Western vipassana Insight Meditation community

45
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:43,800
and um we it is you know meditation comes from

46
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:49,380
Buddhism and other kinds of you know I mean there's a lot of traditions that

47
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:54,839
have meditation in some form or prayer or another

48
00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:03,180
um but we'll talk some about Buddhism but not a lot you don't have to be Buddhist

49
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:10,320
to be here or to practice meditation so I say that because some people find

50
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:18,300
it very helpful to know you don't need to leave any of your beliefs or practices outside of the space you can

51
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:24,300
bring them keep them and utilize the meditation practice in a way that works

52
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,660
for you

53
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,700
medic meditation can be engaged with without Buddhism but Buddhism can't be

54
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:44,959
engaged with without meditation and kind of a simple

55
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:54,000
simple way to talk about what meditation is one one I'll give you a few things but

56
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,579
just one simple thing to start is it's about having intimacy

57
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:07,199
with our experience with our lives it's about kind of being connected to

58
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:14,459
and aware of rather than sort of the the analytical thinking about our lives

59
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:21,959
it's a much more of a direct experience meditation and the practice

60
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:28,199
it's about coming into intimacy direct connection with our present moment

61
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:35,760
experience which is most easily found through our senses

62
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:43,620
touch smell sight Sensations in the body hearing sound

63
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:48,680
you know sort of helping us just right now even as I say that

64
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:55,740
orienting toward these experiences of feeling hearing sensing

65
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:02,399
breathing seeing can you notice anything shifting in

66
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:09,540
yourself as you bring more awareness into those

67
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,540
experiences

68
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:22,320
for me I do and it does feel something a little bit simpler and more

69
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:28,519
intimate with myself and even with you right now

70
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:35,060
another word that I like um to use to talk about

71
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:43,880
mindfulness practice meditation um it's about Choice having choice

72
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:50,699
helping us be aware in a way that

73
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:58,139
um maybe less of an automatic pilot way of being in the world

74
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:04,860
more choiceful as a result also it's maybe another way is to think

75
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:10,020
about the difference between responding to something

76
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:15,720
versus reacting in this practice

77
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:22,678
we're learning how to be with and respond to life instead of react

78
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:27,780
and by reaction I don't just mean externally

79
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:33,240
I mean even reacting to our internal experiences

80
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:39,600
the dialogue the judgments the thoughts the images the memories

81
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,760
all the things that happen in our mind

82
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:54,059
when we're reactive to them we can get carried away carried Downstream carried into a movie

83
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:58,340
in our movie starring guess who

84
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:06,600
and um it's just creates this constant intensity of reaction

85
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:12,660
having rehearsal conversations reaction conversations all of this stuff

86
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:18,320
that tends to make our lives a little bit more

87
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:25,700
I don't know difficult actually I think it's complicated

88
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:33,840
one other thing I'll say um is that there's a in Buddhism and in

89
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:40,140
this practice there's an invitation toward non-harming and this is also connected to this idea

90
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:47,400
of non-reactivity that are you know one of the aspirations of the the Buddha in this practice is to

91
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:53,520
not harm ourselves not harm others and not harm both

92
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:59,160
so never we never leave out the other and we never leave out ourselves it's always

93
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:04,679
you know our goal is not to harm not to harm

94
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:12,960
and so that's just sort of like to help you Orient toward why why we're doing this

95
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:20,460
practice you know what we're hoping to help you experience Don is

96
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:26,880
going to talk about how to take care of our body and postures and things for

97
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,400
sitting meditation thank you Tanya

98
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:38,520
yes so non-harming begins at home and this is home

99
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:44,460
so I'm going to go through three of the four major postures the four postures

100
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:50,640
associated with meditation classically in the Buddha's teachings are sitting

101
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,100
standing walking and lying down we're going to cover walking meditation

102
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:03,240
in a lot more detail in a few weeks I'm going to go through the other three because those are one of those three or

103
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:09,660
possibly more than one are going to be how you will spend your time meditating

104
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:15,179
so I'll start with a few basic principles whether you're sitting

105
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:20,460
standing or lying down there's a principle of balance

106
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:27,000
we're always looking for a balance between relaxation and alertness

107
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:34,380
so comfort and energy relaxation and alertness the second principle is that you should

108
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:39,720
be able to breathe easily so that means having a posture that

109
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:47,460
allows your chest and your lungs to be open regardless of anything else about it

110
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:54,600
and the third is a sense of softness

111
00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:00,299
so you can soften your eyes soften your tongue

112
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:07,260
soften your belly all of those things promote a parasympathetic relaxation response

113
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:12,900
through the whole body and that's very helpful to meditation

114
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:19,380
and then there's a few details with sort of your

115
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:25,140
eyes that I'll show you probably in profile as well as up front

116
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:30,360
first is when you soften your eyes what I mean by that is to let the world come

117
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:35,940
to you so right now all of you most of you are looking at me

118
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:41,820
if you were to relax your gaze and can allow the whole room to be in your gaze

119
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:47,100
without any Central Point in it that's a soft gaze

120
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:55,679
so the peripheral is as important as the center you're not hard focused on anything

121
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:02,640
you might be able to feel it a little bit in your face or behind your eyes the difference it makes just to do that

122
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,580
so many of us spend all day glaring at a screen right

123
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:16,140
right so I'm going to show you in a chair first you can kind of see me now I'll just

124
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:24,059
show a little bit here a base that's really important so no matter how you're sitting having your

125
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:31,980
feet connected to the Earth or the cushion in some way so that's more helpful than this or this

126
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:38,580
or the you know if you can manage it so that can require props these chairs

127
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:45,020
don't work for all sizes of people we have a lot of cushions I'll show you where they are in a few minutes

128
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:51,539
the second principle is to have your spine aligned

129
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:57,659
so I'm going to show you from the front first one way to kind of start to get your spine aligned and this is an old

130
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:04,760
zen trick is to rock back and forth a little bit left to right on your hip points

131
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:11,400
and then find Center like the weight evenly distributed between your two

132
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:17,820
buttocks and then forward and back just a little bit like your a pendulum

133
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:24,780
and again you'll find Center and then the ears roughly aligned over

134
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:32,940
the shoulders and you can imagine a string coming from the top of your head upward to the sky

135
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:39,860
ever such a slight chin tilt and I'll show you from the side as well

136
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:53,520
so I'm not going to use the cushions for the moment but the idea here is that you want your

137
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:59,100
hips a little bit higher than your knees and that may take some cushion adjustment

138
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:05,340
and for those of us with short legs it's going to be different than those of us with long legs Etc you don't want too

139
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:10,919
much pressure here I actually fainted once from that so you know be careful

140
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:16,500
and you can use as many cushions as you need to behind your lower back or under

141
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:22,200
your feet to kind of adjust but the basic principle is to have a

142
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:29,460
natural curve in your lumbar spine here and in your cervical spine

143
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:36,000
so um meditating like this we're like this it's going to give you

144
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,640
neck problems and headaches okay I'm exaggerating of course but again the

145
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:47,039
thread up from the top of the skull crown of the head chin tuck just a

146
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:53,580
little eye is soft down at a 45 degree angle

147
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:59,340
and then closing the eyes your hands can be natural on your lap

148
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:09,659
you can put them on a cushion as I have them now you can put them on each other but to choose a way that feels restful

149
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:16,020
many of us and chairs find it's helpful to have a cushion or two behind the lumbar spine especially if you've got

150
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:23,600
back problems but it's often helpful to have the upper spine separate from the chair

151
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:32,159
and can see there might be ever such a slight lift in the chest too not to

152
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:40,740
torque your upper back but just to allow he can feel like an absence of slump if

153
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:48,679
you take a deep breath you can feel that your lungs can fill easily and that's super helpful

154
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:56,400
last note here is that the mouth you it's hard and masks sorry if you open

155
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,919
your eyes I open your jaws as if you're gonna yawn a little bit

156
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,440
and float your lips together

157
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:12,179
your teeth can either be just barely touching or not even touching and then

158
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:17,400
the tip of the tongue can rest behind the teeth the top of the mouth the

159
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:23,179
palate and relax the rest of the tongue

160
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:34,500
and that will provoke a relaxation response as well when your eyes are closed you can either

161
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:39,659
leave them at that 45 degree angle or slightly almost like you're looking back

162
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:46,919
at yourself I think it was almost looking down at my own heart just a little don't strain anything

163
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:53,419
but that relaxes the eyes and the optical nerve the whole nervous system

164
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:03,799
so those are the basics I'm going to show you on a cushion and a bench now

165
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:09,840
so hopefully we can adjust the camera so that it's

166
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:17,520
easy for the people on YouTube to see so I don't sit on a bench very often

167
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:24,320
I'll just be very honest about that so you're not going to see the best bench sitting

168
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,880
but the idea here again is that the hips are higher than the

169
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:36,600
knees you're stable right and you can take a cushion in either one

170
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:41,940
of these or one of these little ones if your hands don't rest comfortably

171
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:49,679
like this and this for many people is a very stable posture and it's helpful for a

172
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:55,880
lot of people with back problems actually my preferred version

173
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:01,380
is what is called in Zen circles Cesar so you take yours off Foo that's this

174
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:07,500
little round cushion between your legs and you sit on it

175
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:13,020
and this just works better for my body you can stack other cushions underneath

176
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:18,020
it if it's not tall enough for you and that'll work fine

177
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:24,200
so there and then

178
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:31,039
the last one I'm going to show frontally

179
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:36,799
if I can keep my microphone on my ear excuse me

180
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:54,000
so the last style of sitting that is accessible to most of us is called

181
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:01,260
either Taylor style or Burmese style and it is sitting one leg in front of

182
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:07,080
the other like this if your knees do not touch the ground you can use those little back support

183
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:13,380
cushions to support them if your knees really don't touch the

184
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:18,899
ground I suggest using more than one zafu underneath and getting higher or

185
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:24,059
you can put it on its end like this and sit

186
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:30,299
but again the principle is that your hips should be higher than your knees

187
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:35,880
and this helps prevent all kinds of hip issues hip strain knee strain

188
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,679
there are tricks to getting in and out

189
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:46,919
placing you want to avoid torquing your knees in this process

190
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:54,299
so that's the basics there are also Lotus and half Lotus position

191
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:59,520
my body doesn't do them anymore so I'm not going to demonstrate them but there are plenty of examples online

192
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:05,299
particularly in yoga there it is yoga poses

193
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:10,158
so those are the basics of posture

194
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:17,640
and if any of you recognized during that that you need extra support you can dash

195
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:25,460
out and get yourself a support cushion right around on the other side of the skull thank you Don

196
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:45,080
it's a lot to take in right [Music] um and very very nicely shared thank you

197
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:52,980
so I'm going to take a little bit of time to talk about the first sort of we teach mindfulness

198
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:58,980
meditation in a progressive order and so the first week we teach about

199
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:06,480
mindfulness of breathing next week we'll teach about mindfulness of body the third week mindfulness of

200
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:12,360
emotions the fourth week mindfulness of thinking and then the fifth week will be

201
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:19,740
mindfulness and daily life and open awareness practice and so

202
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:25,020
you know does that mean I'm asking you to sit here tonight and not have

203
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:30,960
emotions thoughts um or have Body Sensations no it not at

204
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,120
all you're going to have all these things what I want to invite you to do tonight

205
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:43,500
and for this week because it it builds it's like you know building connection

206
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:50,539
with your breath this week like befriending your breath this week like bringing it with you everywhere you go

207
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:57,360
like really getting to know breathing and and then next week we'll do that

208
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:03,779
with the body and sort of kind of taking time like going to tea with somebody and getting

209
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:09,120
to know them better right sort of just spending time with being aware of your

210
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,520
breathing and so it's more of a preferencing your

211
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:20,159
awareness toward the breathing this practice this

212
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:26,520
week right this part and the thing about the breathing and

213
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:32,539
the reason we start with breathing there's a few reasons one is that um

214
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:40,440
it's very helpful to pay attention to something that's changing that has a rhythm

215
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:48,720
and everything is changing but the breath changes you know there's this kind of constant flow of in and out

216
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:56,600
and it can be felt a lot in many ways in the body right

217
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:04,860
and we want kind of you know this idea of non-reactivity that we're trying to grow

218
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:11,520
in meditation it's it's helpful to stay oriented

219
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:21,480
right it's easy to get lost in our experience and our thinking and so we talk about sort of having a an

220
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:28,380
anchor in our meditation or a tether for a meditation

221
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:34,140
and and we're we're what we're gonna do this week is practice using breath in

222
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:39,659
that way if it's accessible to you sort of like

223
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:46,679
you know the idea of an anchor is it kind of helps you not drift out to sea right

224
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:51,840
um the idea of a tether like sort of something that holds you you know holds

225
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:57,659
you in close so you stay oriented right

226
00:33:57,659 --> 00:34:06,500
um so we use these weird words like object of attention or your primary ink or

227
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:11,638
object of attention is really just sort of what are you paying attention to what

228
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:18,358
is what is primary in your awareness anchor is referencing this idea of

229
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:25,099
something that helps you stay connected to the present moment as I was mentioning earlier the sensations right

230
00:34:25,099 --> 00:34:31,618
seeing hearing sounding touching you know feeling these things are happening

231
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:37,679
here and and are experienceable easily you know and so

232
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:43,679
the breath is one of those things that can help us stay more connected to the present moment

233
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:49,040
so we start with a breath

234
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:54,679
if you have difficulty being aware of breathing

235
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:01,200
um you know it's not a problem if you can't really be aware of your breathing very

236
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:07,260
well so just know that and you can probably the easiest thing

237
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:13,560
is just the alternate for right now would just be to be aware of your hand or Your Body Sensations use use use

238
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:18,900
something in your physical experience instead if somehow the breathing is hard

239
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:25,320
for you but ideally we practice with the breath this week and then next week we shift to

240
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:33,140
the body and we grow and expand again this is not to say you won't have everything else happening

241
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:44,760
I just want to invite you now also to just answer silently in your own mind

242
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,880
why do you want to learn how to meditate why are you here

243
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,900
let's see what answer comes up for you

244
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:03,780
and whatever reason it is you know it's wonderful reason you're here we're glad

245
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:09,180
you're here and

246
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:14,059
see if you can hold it close but loosely

247
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:23,240
sometimes if we get too attached to what we think is going to happen for us

248
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:28,800
we we get focused on trying to make something happen instead of experiencing

249
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,579
what's happening

250
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:41,460
so bringing a sense of curiosity and remembering this idea of

251
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:47,760
non-reactivity like how can I just become like you know how naturalist you

252
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:53,160
know what a naturalist is somebody like who's a scientist and they

253
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:58,320
go into nature usually nature could be you know and

254
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:04,440
they sit down and they try not to interfere with what's happening

255
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:11,760
they try and just observe just to learn to take it in to to become

256
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:19,260
more aware and so can we become naturalists be curious about our own experience our own

257
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:27,060
meditation our own breath our own trouble having awareness of breathing even can we be

258
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:32,460
curious and just sort of like we don't need to judge it

259
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:40,200
we don't need to change it we want to learn we want to be open and curious and

260
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:45,800
staying connected to what are we seeing what is happening

261
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:57,119
you know it's said in the Buddhist teaching in the major manikaya is one of the canons of the Buddha's stories and

262
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:04,079
discourses and it says the purpose of meditation in which we consciously develop

263
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:10,020
mindfulness and discernment is to master and understand the skillful

264
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:17,700
use of the Mind so we're learning about our minds

265
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:23,420
we're learning how to be with our mind how to direct our attention

266
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:33,480
so Don said something incredibly important when she started talking about

267
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:38,820
um this you know learning how to take care of ourselves

268
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:46,260
at home and a home is in the body right so when we meditate we are coming home

269
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:54,420
or bringing our awareness to our home and so our body is really we're served

270
00:38:54,420 --> 00:39:00,000
well if our body is comfortable now if we're too comfortable we'll

271
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,540
probably fall asleep so that's why we work on this kind of

272
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:13,320
combination of alert but relaxed so it's finding the right balance and

273
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:19,140
sometimes sometimes we have to be more relaxed

274
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:24,420
because we're emotionally so tense so our mind is so busy so you know your

275
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:29,460
posture might change bit from time to time right you might need to

276
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:35,359
sit on the floor sometimes sit on the chair another time you know

277
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:42,380
but coming into this space into inhabiting your body

278
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:48,420
that's how we start and our bodies know how to breathe

279
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:54,359
we don't have to make ourselves breathe we get to just watch

280
00:39:54,359 --> 00:40:00,359
what happens and so we're going to move into a guided

281
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:05,940
meditation here as I kind of am talking we're I'm already sort of starting in

282
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:11,040
that way so feeling your bodies finding that

283
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:16,079
posture remembering maybe some of these things that Don taught us so beautifully

284
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:21,540
like oh the softening you know oh letting the eyes oh just

285
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:28,020
sort of ah receive right and then drop down

286
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:34,700
in a 45 degree angle and if you're comfortable closing your eyes

287
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:40,640
and feeling that lift from the top of the head

288
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:50,839
feeling that there's a little bit of a curve in the small of the back and behind your neck

289
00:40:52,099 --> 00:40:56,540
letting your hands rest comfortably

290
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:08,700
and this idea of opening the chest so for me I actually literally like to lift

291
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:16,920
my shoulders up and roll my elbows back toward each other when I sit down just actually kind

292
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:23,339
of a counter stretch to what we typically are doing in our lives with phones and computers and

293
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:30,900
driving and then just press the elbows down to your side and

294
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:36,260
kind of rest your hands again

295
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:41,540
and here we are we get to witness a breath

296
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,760
all we need to do is it's very simple but maybe not always easy

297
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:57,300
and just to be here in this room in this moment

298
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:05,040
in this body with a breath just one breath at a time

299
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:11,780
don't worry about how many breaths you know or how long just ah right here

300
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:14,919
[Applause]

301
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:38,400
and I find it helpful to be kind of clear with myself

302
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:46,099
to be clear with the mind okay this is a period of meditation

303
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:53,480
may my mind and body align with my awareness

304
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:04,160
and come here into this moment and help me be aware of breathing

305
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:13,819
can I give myself permission to not need to do anything else right now

306
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:23,280
maybe to tell myself that it's okay if thoughts or things come up

307
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:28,920
to bow to them and say yes I'll come back to you

308
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:36,319
if it's possible for right now can I be with breathing

309
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:53,599
giving ourselves permission to be

310
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:01,619
to receive our experience not having to make anything happen you don't need to have any particular

311
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:07,319
experience just be intimate with your experience as

312
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:14,339
it unfolds here and allow the breath to sort of be in

313
00:44:14,339 --> 00:44:17,300
the center of it all

314
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:31,859
and during this meditation period I'm going to point you to pay attention

315
00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:39,140
to different aspects of breathing just to orient you just to help you

316
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:46,400
it's not that you have to do all of these things it's just to help you connect more fully

317
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:56,119
so you might start by noticing the feeling of the breath on the nostrils

318
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:19,079
and what is there to feel here with the nostrils can you notice the feeling of

319
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:24,440
the breath kind of touching the inside of the nose

320
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:41,000
noticing the difference between the feeling of the inhale and the exhale

321
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:08,579
you might notice it's a little bit more less less clear with the masks on but

322
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:14,040
you you can still feel the difference in the temperature of the breath on the inhale

323
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,119
and the exhale

324
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:46,940
Can You Feel the breath on the area just below the nose on the upper lip

325
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:07,818
maybe in the throat in the back of the throat

326
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:30,140
let's bring our awareness into our bellies

327
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:38,540
and if you'd like you might even place your hands over your belly your belly button area

328
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:48,019
and just give your self permission to let your belly relax let it hang out

329
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:56,240
you can feel your belly expand with your inhale

330
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:06,680
you might need to give yourself a little permission or a little help to bring your breath into your belly

331
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:13,619
a lot of us don't do belly breathing we breathe higher in our chest so maybe

332
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:18,960
just imagine with the inhale your belly button pressing your hand out

333
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:27,000
as your belly expands and with the exhale the hand pressing

334
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:33,440
into the belly as your belly button reaches towards your spine

335
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:42,240
so this conscious breathing for a moment just to help open up the diaphragm the belly

336
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:47,700
just taking a few and more intentional deeper breaths to help us

337
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:53,720
feel that flow in the belly give ourselves permission

338
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:59,240
for the belly to breathe in and expand

339
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:11,280
and then just allowing the breathing to return to its own Natural State however

340
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:17,819
that is I'm just noticing again the belly now

341
00:49:17,819 --> 00:49:26,119
and see if it's a little easier to feel the breath in the belly

342
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:28,819
and maybe noticing also your chest

343
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:35,660
Can You Feel the chest and the shoulders maybe even the ribs

344
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:40,039
expanding with the breath and how

345
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:47,900
how does this part of your body feel when it's being breathed

346
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:26,520
so we've been spending time kind of knowing different parts

347
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:34,640
of where the body and the breath are impacted by each other

348
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:42,920
now it might be interesting to sort of hold it all a little bit broader

349
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:50,058
sort of allowing yourself to feel the whole sense of flowing

350
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:54,440
the breath coming in and going out

351
00:51:55,740 --> 00:52:01,859
just seeing whatever Sensations come into your awareness

352
00:52:01,859 --> 00:52:08,180
more of a receptive experience than trying to focus in

353
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:24,480
giving or awareness to the sensations associated with breathing and just

354
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:32,359
knowing that you're aware of it that's all very simple very light

355
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:40,380
soft and when the mind gets distracted and you recognize it

356
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:44,480
great no problem

357
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:59,780
you can't meditate you know have a wrong experience just being aware

358
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:03,740
aware of what's Happening

359
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:09,980
and letting the breath help you

360
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:30,480
know it's possible to just sort of almost breathe through your thinking or

361
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:36,119
breathe through a sensation or emotion so if other things are coming up that's

362
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:43,700
okay just see if you can't just sort of let them be there and let the breath flow right through

363
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:59,359
one breath two breaths three breaths in a row

364
00:54:57,890 --> 00:55:01,900
[Music]

365
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:24,420
so we have a few minutes now for questions and for Reflections

366
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:32,119
we'd be we would love to hear how that was for you what did you notice

367
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:38,400
anybody willing and we have mics in the room there's two on the floor

368
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:44,838
maybe you Sally and um you could pick them up and turn them on

369
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:51,660
and um Anne Rose is that your hand up no no okay yeah great that would be great

370
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:57,440
got us going is it on

371
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:05,839
good evening thank you Tanya done um I noticed that whenever

372
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:12,300
I my attention had deviated from the breath I just had just gave myself

373
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:19,260
gentle reminders beyond that I just I'm trying to focus more on

374
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:24,599
awareness without forcing it and that's been kind of

375
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:31,920
challenging but knowing that I have been doing that has also been helpful so just

376
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:38,119
trying to start 2023 with like okay let me just breathe then

377
00:56:38,119 --> 00:56:44,760
rather than forcing everything to be calm so yes thank you

378
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:50,520
is there any anything that question or any comment that you want

379
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:56,280
um this question is for Dawn regarding the the like you said the tongue position

380
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:03,180
wise where behind the teeth because I had never heard of that before so I

381
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:08,640
threw a lot at you guys um so you don't need to worry too much

382
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:13,680
about it but there's um if you roll your tongue along the inside of your top

383
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:21,119
teeth you'll feel some gum that sort of shelves off and then starts to go up

384
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:28,260
into your palate if you touch your tongue on that little shelf right behind your teeth or

385
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:33,780
wherever it's comfortable for you but the idea is that that very gently

386
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:39,180
touching it there tends to relax the rest of the tongue the tongue is actually quite a long muscle

387
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:44,880
and it is one of the um muscles we can relax that gives the rest of our body a

388
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:50,520
hint to relax so experiment and find the right spot for you some people actually like to have it on

389
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:57,119
the back of their teeth but I tend to bite my tongue if I do that so you might want it a little further back

390
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:03,800
thank you thank you for the question foreign

391
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:10,260
thank you so much I was interesting tonight because I started nodding off

392
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:16,980
um that doesn't happen that often I guess maybe it's tonight but it really took me out of the practice for sure

393
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:24,960
when I you know I like kind of lose balance or so yeah just any tips on that or maybe

394
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:30,660
you should just this time maybe just keep my eyes open or because I was really starting to fall

395
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:36,480
asleep I I think you said something wonderful

396
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:42,780
though just open your eyes right and um and and okay so tonight the naturalist

397
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:48,000
observed sleepiness right so

398
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:54,240
um was it okay was it okay to be sleepy

399
00:58:54,240 --> 00:59:00,059
I think oh yeah I don't I think I judged it as not okay yeah it's like okay I

400
00:59:00,059 --> 00:59:05,760
need to get some fruitfulness out of this you know I mean yeah it can't be falling

401
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:12,900
asleep yeah so interesting yeah and you know I mean obviously if we drift off to

402
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:18,540
a nap and La La Land it's not really practicing but there's a lot to be to

403
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:25,260
observe about being sleepy you know there's there's stuff to learn there like a naturalist would want to

404
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:31,799
know about what happens with sleep all all of it

405
00:59:31,799 --> 00:59:38,040
and the trick is finding that interest and enough awareness so you don't just

406
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:46,980
drift into the foggy land right um but yeah it doesn't have to be bad or you

407
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:53,940
know a failure it's like oh yeah this is a big part of our life it's sleep

408
00:59:53,940 --> 01:00:00,420
yeah does that feel helpful yeah I'll keep my eyes open tonight yeah

409
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:06,660
yeah standing up you know taking your coat off

410
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:13,619
it's a little for me it's a little warm in here tonight so you know that that that makes it harder for me

411
01:00:13,619 --> 01:00:17,900
um the stay alert yeah

412
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:25,079
great from

413
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:31,859
Margie how can we deal with tension in the face during meditation that is hard to

414
01:00:31,859 --> 01:00:35,599
release and very distracting

415
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:44,040
sure I can start with that one um thanks for the question Margie

416
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:51,119
the um the first thing you may try is before meditating giving yourself a

417
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:59,240
little face massage actually I'm going to turn off my mic for a second and just demonstrate

418
01:01:07,319 --> 01:01:13,440
that comes from the Tai Chi and Qigong lineage to do that kind of thing just

419
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:21,900
for a moment or two before clicking in and sitting down the next is to um

420
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:28,559
let yourself maybe yawn or do another relaxation response in

421
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:34,460
your face and then just allowing

422
01:01:34,619 --> 01:01:39,720
the best you can to soften around the tension the tension itself might not

423
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:47,520
want to relax but if you find the edges of the tension in the face and relax around it

424
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:53,339
that can sometimes start to soften the whole thing

425
01:01:53,339 --> 01:01:58,740
and finally if it's it's becoming distracting it can also be helpful to

426
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:05,099
intentionally notice whatever response emotional response is happening

427
01:02:05,099 --> 01:02:11,040
to the tension and just acknowledge that and then consciously bring the attention

428
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:16,079
to the whole body to the breath and just allow it to be there noticing

429
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:23,420
how it is so I hope that was helpful

430
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:30,059
great thank you hi thank you um I know it went through a lot but I

431
01:02:30,059 --> 01:02:35,700
tend to to have the same issue that like I've started to fall asleep like I

432
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:41,640
didn't this time but I started to be like in Dreamland like images and even

433
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:48,960
though I was not asleep body wise but the brain was kind of like like dreaming

434
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:54,180
um you mentioned about a standing position for meditation I never heard of

435
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:59,339
that and I think it would be good at least you know for me

436
01:02:59,339 --> 01:03:05,160
to avoid the sleepiness so I didn't have time to do standing or

437
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:11,000
lying down during the posture segment but the principle is to stand

438
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:16,920
roughly keeping the feet hip width apart just sort of like not your outer hip but

439
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:23,819
sort of under your hip points and you your anyone is welcome to try it now knee is a little bit soft that's the

440
01:03:23,819 --> 01:03:28,859
main key if you lock your knees like this you will eventually fall over

441
01:03:28,859 --> 01:03:33,960
so just a little bit soft as Tanya is so beautifully described at

442
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:40,859
the beginning of that meditation allowing your belly to be soft let the belly hang out

443
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:48,900
and then again the whole principle of alignment eyes it's helpful to have them at a

444
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:56,099
roughly a 45 degree angle not down not looking in particular at anything

445
01:03:56,099 --> 01:04:02,819
most people find it easier to do with their eyes open you are welcome to try it with your eyes closed

446
01:04:02,819 --> 01:04:09,000
for some people that's easy other people find they lose their balance

447
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:15,599
and then you can just have your hands hanging at your sides if you want to have them clasp in front or behind you

448
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:18,559
you can do that

449
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:26,040
and your head aligned over your shoulders all the rest of it's the same

450
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:31,980
and it's a great posture to go to if you're sleepy or if you've got back pain some people

451
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:38,339
find standing actually a more helpful posture and if anyone needs to see lying down

452
01:04:38,339 --> 01:04:45,680
tonight I'm happy to show you after class and then we'll model it next week

453
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:53,660
it's the hardest posture it's the hardest posture by far but some people don't have a choice

454
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:59,780
you're welcome thanks

455
01:05:01,559 --> 01:05:04,559
foreign

456
01:05:12,599 --> 01:05:18,859
I'm going to take a few minutes to talk about establishing a practice at home

457
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:27,540
I'm going to cover a couple of things the first is the sort of overall approach and the second is what you

458
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:34,859
actually do which Tanya covered it beautifully in some detail but I'm going to reinforce sort of at a high level

459
01:05:34,859 --> 01:05:42,260
some high points so first of all it's like establishing any other new

460
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:47,880
habit or new routine right so it's helpful to give yourself some structure

461
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:54,960
and do a little bit of planning it's nice to pick or create a designated

462
01:05:54,960 --> 01:06:01,260
spot in your space that's just for meditation or primarily for meditation

463
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:06,720
and ideally it's away from the comings and goings of the household

464
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:12,540
away from a lot of distracting things like televisions or computers or Etc not

465
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:18,180
a good idea to keep your smartphone right there you know some basic elements

466
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:25,740
you can set it up in a comfortable way as you experiment with finding the meditation postures that work for you

467
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:31,500
and like get yourself a timer that kind of thing and then

468
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:38,099
um I would say like just even the corner of a room is fine

469
01:06:38,099 --> 01:06:46,619
but just to have a spot you know you're going to go to and you experiment around and find it and it's okay to be creative

470
01:06:46,619 --> 01:06:53,280
so for example a friend of mine had a horrible commute to work he was a dedicated meditator and he got up really

471
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:59,880
early so he flipped it he met he drove to work first and then he meditated in the server room

472
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:05,099
at his job because he knew no one was going to walk in there before work hours and disturb him

473
01:07:05,099 --> 01:07:11,640
another friend who didn't have any time off work would go into the bathroom and meditate for 10 minutes because no one's

474
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:17,400
going to bother you in there so home is ideal but there are other

475
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:23,400
options right most people find a consistent time of

476
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:28,740
day is helpful so now just make it a routine and make it part of your routine you know like

477
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:35,700
get up brush my teeth go sit something like that and for many of us as I just alluded to

478
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:40,740
first thing in the morning is really helpful I would even say for most people

479
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:46,200
so maybe it's after the morning cup of tea but definitely before the news the

480
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:53,520
email the social media all that kind of stuff and that is helpful because our minds

481
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:59,640
aren't quite as busy then and cluttered so you can experiment for yourself that

482
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:05,299
is not a time that works for everyone so find what works for you

483
01:08:06,299 --> 01:08:13,260
a really helpful piece of advice I got early on was to commit to a flyby to my

484
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:19,258
meditation spot every day my one teacher of mine called it get your butt on the cushion even if it's

485
01:08:19,259 --> 01:08:24,600
just for one or two minutes often it will turn into more than one or

486
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:31,279
two minutes and you know you can commit to the 10 or 15 or 20 or 30.

487
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:37,920
while you're considering what you're able to commit to

488
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:45,359
also it's a good time to start proactively identifying any potential challenges that might come up for you

489
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:51,060
if you know what they are like one student of mine had a puppy

490
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:56,520
so one of her challenges was meditating with the puppy and

491
01:08:56,520 --> 01:09:03,060
she learned that puppy walking happened before meditation otherwise meditation didn't happen so you know just to kind

492
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:08,580
of plan in the things you know might derail you

493
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:14,758
there's also creating a contingency plan so for example

494
01:09:14,759 --> 01:09:20,400
maybe you want to meditate in the morning and for some reason it doesn't work that morning it might be nice to

495
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:25,500
have set aside the same amount of time in the evening as a backup plan

496
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:30,838
to do that sit and then if you to the morning practice you either have the

497
01:09:30,839 --> 01:09:37,318
option of doing a second practice or you get an extra 20 minutes great right

498
01:09:37,319 --> 01:09:42,540
so to know what your own potential challenges are and to sort of

499
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:50,600
troubleshoot them in advance a little bit maybe even enroll a friend or bring it up here in class

500
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:59,100
it's always okay to begin again if you miss a day

501
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:04,800
always okay missing a day start the next

502
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:11,280
next and always start over start over in general not letting the perfect be

503
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:17,060
the enemy of the good right do what you can

504
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:23,219
so and then it's about establishing kind of intentional meditation sessions or

505
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:29,119
what we often call in this scene formal meditation sessions

506
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:37,800
pick your posture whatever it's going to be and then it's helpful to start off with

507
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:43,500
a conscious reflection perhaps as Tanya brought up earlier why you're meditating

508
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:48,719
while you're there and then I find it really helpful to set

509
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:56,219
an intention or a resolve can't remember the language Tanya used but to be clear that this is a time for

510
01:10:56,219 --> 01:11:01,739
meditation to kind of tell my mind that so it doesn't go off and have a thinking party

511
01:11:01,739 --> 01:11:08,940
for 20 minutes right but to set that intention to be present

512
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:14,540
for moment to moment experience just the best you can

513
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:20,820
it's also supportive to very intentionally then go through the more

514
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:26,460
detailed setup of the meditation posture whatever it is like we did tonight

515
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:31,560
you know soften the eyes the tongue aligning your body maybe doing this it's

516
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:39,480
like you set up a little routine for yourself and after not very long that routine

517
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:44,580
starts to tell your body oh it's time to meditate and you'll be amazed your mind

518
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:50,880
just starts to kind of go into that it's again setting up that little habit

519
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:57,659
can be almost like a little ritual right and then at the end of each formal

520
01:11:57,659 --> 01:12:06,560
meditation session to end with a conscious reflection maybe reflecting back on how that was

521
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:13,860
how good it felt how appreciative you are that it happened

522
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:19,159
and then something I neglected to say at the beginning is um

523
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:27,120
when you do set up your initial posture when you do sit down one of the most helpful things to

524
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:34,560
keep in mind is an allowing kind attitude I think of it as the

525
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:40,560
internal posture the internal stance soft

526
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:46,800
appreciative allowing we learn a lot better that way

527
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:54,199
just like if you're trying to teach a puppy to come and you whack it on the nose it's not going to keep coming

528
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:59,880
if you give it a kind word we give our minds a kind word when they come back

529
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:03,800
they like to come back more often

530
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:12,239
and then I'll just say finally um it's a real gift

531
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:18,960
not to have big expectations at first the first year I started meditating I

532
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:24,000
didn't realize what a gift it was at the time that I had no expectations at all

533
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:30,360
for what was supposed to happen on the cushion other than that I was supposed to show up there and more or less follow

534
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:36,540
my breath and the reason I started meditating was to

535
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:42,300
deal with the physical issue the physical issue did not get better but I kept meditating because I noticed

536
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:47,460
the difference in the rest of my day and that was enough

537
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:53,100
so now and then to stop and reflect back on oh how am I the days I meditate

538
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:59,460
versus the days I don't not to get too fussy about it or do it

539
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:04,699
too often but to just check in

540
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:11,880
the Dalai Lama has a quote about checking in on meditative progress said we should do it regularly

541
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:17,520
at least every five to seven years oh

542
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:26,179
to not be too hard on ourselves if we're not noticing changes right away

543
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:33,960
so those are some thoughts about establishing the practice at home

544
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:39,500
and with that we're going to go into another short guided meditation

545
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:45,300
so um finding yourself a comfortable

546
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:51,659
posture be balanced aligned

547
01:14:51,659 --> 01:14:56,659
a balance between relaxation and alertness

548
01:14:59,159 --> 01:15:05,760
and setting the intention to be present for your moment to moment

549
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:08,760
experience

550
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:21,620
hmm softening the eyes the tongue the body

551
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:31,580
and noticing the sensations in this body

552
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:39,139
throughout the whole body at first warmed for cool pressure

553
01:15:39,620 --> 01:15:43,880
contraction or relaxation

554
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:59,000
and then especially attuning tuning in to the sensations of your body breathing

555
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:07,158
wherever it's most obvious and comfortable for you

556
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:25,219
breathing is the home base or anchor

557
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:30,380
the object of attention

558
01:16:46,199 --> 01:16:52,099
another tether to the moment that can be helpful

559
01:16:54,120 --> 01:17:02,480
is to very softly in the mind use a single word or a short phrase

560
01:17:03,659 --> 01:17:10,560
acknowledging breathing in when breathing in and breathing out

561
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:13,640
when breathing out

562
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:21,860
if you're noticing the breath at the belly or the chest

563
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:28,560
it could be rising on the in-breath

564
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:34,100
falling on the out breath

565
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:47,100
or simply in on the in-breath and out

566
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:50,360
on the out breath

567
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:59,360
keeping most of the attention on the sensations

568
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:05,460
the lived experience of this breath

569
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:10,640
a very light touch to the note

570
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:37,040
these notes are one kind of intentional thinking

571
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:45,020
thinking that is supportive to staying in the present moment

572
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:59,420
you may notice other thinking swirling around in there

573
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:06,320
that's okay mind think

574
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:19,140
the invitation is to allow all other thoughts of then and there

575
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:28,039
future and past Fade Into the periphery the background

576
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:37,400
and allow awareness of breathing awareness of this moment

577
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:45,020
to be in the Forefront of attention the foreground

578
01:19:53,100 --> 01:20:02,179
and try it silently for a few minutes together then I'll chime in again near the end

579
01:21:25,199 --> 01:21:30,140
if you find your attention is wondered

580
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:37,340
appreciate the return of awareness

581
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:42,540
and gently kind I

582
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:49,800
return your attention to this moment

583
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:52,698
this breath

584
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:04,460
foreign

585
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:17,640
foreign so we have another little while for questions comments

586
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:27,380
we'd love to hear what you noticed if you have any questions about what's come up so far in the class

587
01:25:29,580 --> 01:25:34,760
questions about establishing a practice at home yes please

588
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:44,460
uh this was perfect so I'm happy to yeah I didn't feel like falling asleep

589
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:50,820
this time so that was good that's it to the comment great

590
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:55,219
finding the right sitting gear can go a long way

591
01:25:56,699 --> 01:26:05,880
hi I did this standing meditation for my for the first time my time and what I notice is I'm way more aware

592
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:12,420
of the breathing and my body and my body starts gently rocking like when I was in

593
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:20,000
hell in or excelling and it was and I didn't go into the dream world or anything it was just

594
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:25,739
breathing and and body awareness I really like it I think I'm gonna do it

595
01:26:25,739 --> 01:26:32,178
I'm Gonna Keep It wonderful

596
01:26:33,719 --> 01:26:40,080
it's great you both experimented you know and you know no two meditations are

597
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:46,679
exactly alike so you know keep keep noticing and adapting as you need to you

598
01:26:46,679 --> 01:26:52,620
know try different things and so that it's fairly comfortable giving yourself permission to

599
01:26:52,620 --> 01:26:59,280
kind of even checking in before you're going to meditate uh what kind of a state am I in how's my body how's my

600
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:07,560
back today you know am I tired you know and yeah just just tuning in

601
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:13,280
tuning in and adjusting very good

602
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:28,320
hi thank you um I was just gonna say that I could

603
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:34,739
definitely feel a difference after these two small meditation sessions and the

604
01:27:34,739 --> 01:27:42,000
past week my anxiety has been pretty bad which usually affects like my appetite like I don't get hungry

605
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:49,139
um and this past one I was like worried about my stomach growling which I was like that's good I guess because maybe

606
01:27:49,139 --> 01:27:56,639
it relieved just a little bit of the anxiety enough to revive my appetite I don't know

607
01:27:56,639 --> 01:28:03,420
um but I did have a question as well um especially when it comes to meditating at home which I've been

608
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:11,880
trying to do more often definitely not every day yet but I struggle a lot with

609
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:17,159
having it be as effective as coming here in person and hearing someone talk to me

610
01:28:17,159 --> 01:28:22,199
and kind of refocus my mind um

611
01:28:22,199 --> 01:28:27,900
and there's some things I do like I try to listen to some of the recorded

612
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:33,360
sessions on YouTube uh other sessions that are more guided so that I can

613
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:40,139
incorporate that but I just it still doesn't feel like I'm able to relax and

614
01:28:40,139 --> 01:28:48,000
let go and focus as much as I am in person here so I was just curious if there's any advice or steps towards

615
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:52,880
getting there at home

616
01:28:55,260 --> 01:29:01,020
welcome to the club foreign

617
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:06,600
so what Tanya's alluding to is that many of us find it easier to meditate in a

618
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:14,159
group even if there's not someone giving the guidance there's just something about

619
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:19,560
the group field we call it the being together with a lot of people who are

620
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:24,659
doing the same thing you may have something more to add I'll

621
01:29:24,659 --> 01:29:30,600
just briefly say that it they are different experiences and there's value

622
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:38,040
to both so to keep doing both um learning from meditation teachers and

623
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:45,179
hearing the guidance begins to build your own internal voice and your own internal process for dropping into

624
01:29:45,179 --> 01:29:51,360
meditation and it's kind of like training wheels like you don't always want to have the

625
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:56,699
training wheels on sometimes you want to ride the bike without the wheels even though you're maybe a little wobblier

626
01:29:56,699 --> 01:30:01,920
because it does build a capacity Tanya do you have anything to add to

627
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:08,219
that maybe sometimes it's good to have the training wheels you know just to say

628
01:30:08,219 --> 01:30:13,679
that too that you know if you find yourself highly anxious or obsessed

629
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:21,600
about something or angry those are really good times to choose the guidance right even if you've been riding solo

630
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:27,420
for a while so just just to say yes absolutely Don what you said is

631
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:32,880
beautiful and I agree we need both experiences you know we learn and we

632
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:38,880
integrate and and again this adjusting you know sort

633
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:45,080
of checking in what do I need right now you know what I'm kind of calm maybe I can do it on my own tonight you know

634
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:52,080
or looking at how long you're doing it for as well so giving yourself a sense

635
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:58,320
of like I can do five minutes I'm I really feel confident I can do five

636
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:06,300
minutes and and having some experiences being confident you know maybe it's hard but maybe you cry maybe whatever but you

637
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:11,699
can get through five minutes you know you can get through five minutes you know and do that for a while and then

638
01:31:11,699 --> 01:31:17,100
maybe it it's like okay I can probably do seven or ten you know just sort of

639
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:23,520
working with yourself um and giving yourself some experience of confidence you know it doesn't have

640
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:30,138
to be amazing just okay I can do it I can do it

641
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:46,100
yeah and Rose

642
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:57,138
would you demonstrate that I'm going to take the mic off completely

643
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:07,320
to name that this comes from a different meditation lineage that I started before I was a Buddhist meditator which is I

644
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:17,119
was a Tai Chi practitioner for many years so this isn't in the Buddha's instructions it comes from that lineage

645
01:33:06,860 --> 01:33:11,940
showing yes as I said you don't have to do it in that order that's a series of

646
01:33:11,940 --> 01:33:17,219
things you can do and you can also invent for yourself like a lot of people have tension right

647
01:33:17,219 --> 01:33:22,100
at your jaw this can feel really good

648
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:28,620
I guess the general principle is just to kind of take care of yourself for a minute or two as you're settling into

649
01:33:28,620 --> 01:33:35,219
meditation like it might not need to be face massage for you some of us need to just like massage our shoulders for a

650
01:33:35,219 --> 01:33:41,400
second we're like Tanya was saying a couple of shoulder rolls can feel

651
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:48,060
really good if you've been at the computer desk all day so to just honor your body before you go

652
01:33:48,060 --> 01:33:55,260
into complete Stillness that's kind of why I tend to do this rocking thing and like a little bit of a wiggle first

653
01:33:55,260 --> 01:34:03,179
I actually really like to walk before I meditate I really really helps me a lot to just

654
01:34:03,179 --> 01:34:09,840
to do a 20-minute walk come back down and just sit and I just it's like there's so much

655
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:14,659
aliveness in my body it really helps me be present

656
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:22,980
don't overeat before you sit down [Laughter] what's that

657
01:34:22,980 --> 01:34:28,020
right you fall asleep right you just your system just shuts down yeah

658
01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:34,380
some people find stretching right before sitting to be really helpful I did that for many years before I sat

659
01:34:34,380 --> 01:34:41,100
went do the walk and then stretch and then sit then your body just feels so good it makes it a lot easier to focus

660
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:45,560
on the body on the body's feeling pretty good

661
01:34:46,860 --> 01:34:55,380
yeah your own little routine I no no hands up right now I just want

662
01:34:55,380 --> 01:35:02,159
to highlight something that Don said I just it's worth repeating the inner sort

663
01:35:02,159 --> 01:35:07,500
of what was the inner posture she liked to use the word the inner posture

664
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:14,159
how are we tuning in to ourselves this is so important this is that idea of the

665
01:35:14,159 --> 01:35:21,900
naturalist how would a naturalist respond if I got sleepy you can always ask yourself you know what how am I

666
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:29,820
relating to my own experience this is incredible important support for your

667
01:35:29,820 --> 01:35:36,900
meditation if you are being a harsh inner critic you are going to just get more and more

668
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:41,960
tense and stressed and feel like you're doing it all wrong

669
01:35:42,179 --> 01:35:50,239
so maybe in that beginning when you're sitting down kind of invite

670
01:35:50,239 --> 01:35:58,320
invite yourself to connect with a mindset a voice a person a figure some

671
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:04,620
way of being that you know kind of will help you be present wise and

672
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:11,179
compassionate right like non-reactive non-judgmental

673
01:36:11,179 --> 01:36:19,980
accepting but you know not codependent and indulging either right that creating

674
01:36:19,980 --> 01:36:26,900
that kind of inner environment is incredibly important

675
01:36:29,639 --> 01:36:38,000
I'll just lift up Tanya has used the metaphor of naturalist really beautifully a few times

676
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:46,199
that playful experimentation experimentation exploration you can't

677
01:36:46,199 --> 01:36:51,600
get it wrong just get interested get interested

678
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:57,480
that's that's an another really helpful internal posture or internal stance to

679
01:36:57,480 --> 01:37:03,540
take is um it's always okay to start over and

680
01:37:03,540 --> 01:37:10,260
reboot the experiment shift the posture change the location

681
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:13,698
reset the attitude

682
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:26,219
foreign wrap up or does anyone have anything

683
01:37:26,219 --> 01:37:32,060
else they want to share or reflect or ask

684
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:48,300
do you want to do the kind of no pointing to them just noticed my name is

685
01:37:48,300 --> 01:37:55,500
on the closing this is the handout for our first week it was on the little

686
01:37:55,500 --> 01:38:04,199
table as you walked in where the masks were those of you watching on YouTube you can go to audiodarma.org and a PDF

687
01:38:04,199 --> 01:38:10,260
of this handout is in the intro to mindfulness meditation series that will

688
01:38:10,260 --> 01:38:16,500
be posted shortly after this session is over so um

689
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:23,340
it has some really useful information and then it has some instruction on mindfulness

690
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:29,880
and breathing I like to read that and as I'm sitting and then just sort of close my eyes and

691
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:36,120
sit and kind of let the words percolate and then on the back I'm sorry the instructions on the back

692
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:41,719
the top of the back is also the homework yes there's homework in this class

693
01:38:41,719 --> 01:38:49,020
should you choose to accept it and that is to do a 20-minute session of

694
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:55,800
meditation each day okay and um

695
01:38:55,800 --> 01:39:02,100
the second bit of homework is to remain mindful during some kind of routine

696
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:08,280
activity washing your hands washing the dishes brushing your teeth

697
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:15,120
taking a walk like a simple walk maybe to the bus or wherever right but to just

698
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:23,340
be in a simple way present and aware and then the third thing is

699
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:28,920
for one half hour period sometime during the week pay careful attention to your

700
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:36,239
posture as you go through your activities and without straining

701
01:39:36,239 --> 01:39:41,460
take a posture that's alert and upright relaxed just like we were talking about

702
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:47,820
with the meditation postures and just notice what happens

703
01:39:47,820 --> 01:39:54,960
to your mood to your thought your feelings what happens to your internal world as you bring more attention to

704
01:39:54,960 --> 01:40:01,800
your posture so that's your mission should you choose to

705
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:09,300
accept it the recordings are available on YouTube

706
