1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,520
so it's 7am here in california and so

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,519
locally i can offer you a good morning and happy to be together and good day and

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:20,640
greetings for everyone around the globe who are participating and

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,199
the the kind of the theme for this guided

5
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:34,960
meditation is balance and uh finding a balance when we sit and

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:42,079
the balance is i liken it a little bit to us finding the midpoint

7
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:49,360
of a row boat maybe a fairly stable wide row boat but still a row boat that

8
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:56,079
um and finding the midpoint where there's the least amount of the center

9
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,600
of gravity kind of the boats and to stand there with our legs firmly on the

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:09,680
floor of the boat and and keep our balance and maybe you know our upper part of our

11
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:16,320
torso is maybe not moving so much but our legs are in fact kind of going with the rocking of the boat maybe

12
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,080
it's a gentle rocking but still we're constantly making small adjustments

13
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:29,280
and uh and the stronger we are and our legs and torso and things like that maybe the

14
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,600
easier it is to keep our balance so in meditation we're also developing a

15
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:42,960
kind of inner strength and a skill at staying balanced both to recognize about when we get off

16
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:50,320
balance and to recognize and to have the strength to kind of stay to come back to balance stay in balance

17
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,079
and the way it works in meditation is the most simple way is

18
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:02,799
to stay balanced without any kind of movement towards our

19
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:11,360
experience or any movement away any wanting or not wanting any movement in which we

20
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,360
get pulled by experience pulled into our thoughts any movement

21
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:24,720
pushed by the thoughts or pushed by experience of what's happening and rather both physically but also

22
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:31,120
you know in the heart the mind we stay balanced we stay in that center place where

23
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:38,560
there's a strength and a stability that wisdom can operate and clear seeing

24
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,480
can operate that we lose when we start getting involved in things or we start rejecting

25
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:52,319
things and staying in that midpoint of the boat of our life and of course we'll go

26
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,519
a little bit off and so part of the equanimity and practice is to appreciate that of course

27
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,280
just like in a row boat we'll get them pulled this way in that way and get picked up get involved and

28
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,319
all these things but hopefully not so much and hopefully with very gentle

29
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:15,680
maybe even loving course corrections no stay here come back see clearly what's happening

30
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,720
so we can stay balanced come back to that peaceful place

31
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:28,959
still place the balance place inside the dynamic balance the dynamic peacefulness

32
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:35,120
i don't think that you have to rest on your meditation laurels and just stay peaceful without a

33
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:42,720
kind of being engaged alert mindful to stay here here so with that as an

34
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,159
introduction to assume a posture

35
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:54,480
that maybe manifests a degree of balance

36
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:01,280
and uh and one way to begin then with balance is to

37
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:08,080
rock back and forth if you're sitting upright maybe sway back and forth and

38
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:14,959
and then make smaller and smaller kind of sways kind of looking for a place of balance

39
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:20,400
with the torso balance on the sitting bones balance of your weight against whatever

40
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,240
support is being received and then to kind of

41
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,600
feel up the spine up the torso and to make small adjustments

42
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,280
to feel a sense of being everything's balanced partly that means that the with the

43
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,320
weight of our torso kind of at all stacked up in a way that feels

44
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:49,280
aligned with this some center line within so that we're not leaning forward

45
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:57,199
part of our weight is in front of that center of gravity and and some of it's not behind and

46
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:03,120
something looking for that balance and to do something where the hands and

47
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,880
arms feel balanced as well so they're not pulled too far forward or

48
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,960
pulled too far down so the shoulders being pulled if you're sitting you might be able to

49
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,080
pull your hands back from the knee a little bit or sometimes putting a cushion or

50
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:28,639
something on top of your if you're here your your your thighs or your ankles so the hands are held up more

51
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,800
um can feel more balanced and support a balance of the torso

52
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,400
and then to close the eyes and with the eyes closed and sitting

53
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:50,080
still again feeling the body from the inside

54
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:58,400
and feeling where there is balance where there is stability in the body

55
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,960
where there's a kind of maybe even groundedness

56
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:15,360
of your body against whatever supports you upright whatever supports your weight

57
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:23,840
to feel that stability or groundedness rootedness

58
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:33,600
and to feel whatever seems stable within physical stability

59
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,720
some people might feel it the lower torso

60
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:48,880
around the hips pelvis some people might feel it

61
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,680
lower back or in the belly

62
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:03,840
or maybe in the area of the solar plexus behind it above the diaphragm

63
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:18,319
and maybe there's a can be a feeling of some stability as you relax your shoulders soften

64
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,759
it may be a stability

65
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:32,960
in the in the shoulder supporting the neck maybe in the back of the neck

66
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:39,120
in the way that that area supports the weight of the

67
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,840
head

68
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:56,720
and there's a way in which tension and holding even if it's

69
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,960
stable tension is a kind of

70
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,639
agitation

71
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:16,960
and greater stability and balance is found by relaxing some of the extra

72
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:24,160
tension in the body softening the muscles of the face

73
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:32,640
these are muscles that are sometimes constantly engaged in daily life

74
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:38,320
to express ourselves communicate ourselves to the world

75
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:44,479
smiles and frowns and scowls and

76
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:55,839
fears held in the muscles of the face

77
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,560
and it's a compassionate thing for the face on the exhale

78
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:10,640
to let the muscles ease not up to work so much

79
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,000
around the eyes forehead

80
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:27,519
jaw and the same thing with agitation and

81
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:37,839
restlessness in the chest if there is something

82
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:04,880
and relaxing in the chest softening easing up

83
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,720
without the kind of instability that comes from resistance

84
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:19,839
holding ourselves at our life at bay

85
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:27,360
and then softening in the belly a kind of release of the weight of the

86
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,800
belly letting it maybe that weight

87
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:39,360
release downward to create some inner stability in the

88
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:47,839
lower torso

89
00:10:52,079 --> 00:11:00,640
and then to feel whatever restlessness agitation energetics there are

90
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,920
there is in the mind

91
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:12,320
maybe in the area where we that we have the brain or anywhere

92
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:19,519
for you it's associated with your mental emotional activity

93
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:32,399
as you exhale relaxing the mind

94
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:43,839
relaxing the mental activity slowing things down in the mind

95
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:53,440
softening the mind and feeling the softness

96
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,839
of the mind

97
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:11,279
and then gently noticing

98
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:18,560
as we sit here for a minute or so any movements towards

99
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,720
or away any being pulled into something like our

100
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,839
thoughts or any kind of movement of recoiling or

101
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:39,600
pulling back or being pushed back

102
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:47,600
any wanting any not wanting

103
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:55,120
and just simply notice that and perhaps allowing it to be there if

104
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,639
it's there feeling it sensing what it's like for

105
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,920
the body the mind to have this movement

106
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,880
for and against

107
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,519
and feel how maybe there's not much balance there

108
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,839
or that there's some imbalance

109
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:36,480
and then the next couple of exhales see if you can release

110
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:43,440
any for against wanting and not wanting release it

111
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,600
enough to feel that you're in your life mind heart

112
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,319
comes to us balanced stability

113
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:03,680
or comes into a little bit more of a balanced ability than

114
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:17,839
it was when it wasn't stable

115
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,920
and then to really now

116
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,320
experience the breathing body the body breathing

117
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:15,120
almost like the awareness gently lands

118
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,480
onto the body breathing

119
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:30,240
and this is where we feel the gentle rowboat where the gentle waves are breathing in

120
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:38,839
and out the movements of the body expanding and

121
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:44,560
contracting the air moving in and out through the

122
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,199
nostrils

123
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:58,959
and if it's easy enough to establish a kind of gentle soft

124
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:09,839
stability steadiness with the breathing

125
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:18,399
and as you feel any other pull and push

126
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:24,959
moving forward against experience wanting and not wanting

127
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:34,079
keep finding your stability keep coming back to the breathing

128
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,839
let the breathing support you

129
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,360
let the breathing be the place that you stand or feel

130
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:51,839
so you're not so easily pulled into for and against

131
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,920
staying balanced in the body body breathing

132
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:05,280
with the mind having landed and on the breathing the

133
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:14,880
body breathing not easily pulled into

134
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,839
wanting and not wanting

135
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:28,640
and if there are little movements of wanting and not moving it's okay those can be some kind of

136
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:37,760
that's the place we use to find back to balance here breathing

137
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,840
centered on the breathing body

138
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,480
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

139
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:45,840
i have a question for you and that is how might your

140
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:53,840
kindness your love your compassion

141
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:07,840
benefit from having an inner stability in inner balance

142
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:21,840
how can kindness and love and compassion benefit from not being pulled into

143
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,559
in some way reacting for or against

144
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:38,720
without being pulled into desires or pulled into aversion

145
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:51,760
to be able to open our hearts and care and good will towards others

146
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,480
while remaining balanced without wants and not wants without

147
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,559
anxiety creating imbalance

148
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:13,039
perhaps even feeling a stability

149
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:18,799
in the kindness the good will the love the compassion

150
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:27,440
and maybe you can imagine that with it whatever balanced ability

151
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,840
calm you have now

152
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:39,919
sitting here can you bring to mind someone for whom

153
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:45,120
you have friendliness good will

154
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:52,640
compassion love and imagine sitting together

155
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:59,520
walking together and for you to remain balanced and

156
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:06,000
stable in your goodwill in your friendliness

157
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:16,480
not pulled into some of the complexities that can exist in these relationships of

158
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:27,600
wanting and not wanting protecting or fear

159
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:41,440
holding back or giving too much

160
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:47,679
our friendliness our goodwill is one of the great resources we have

161
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:55,840
it can be one of the foundations for buddhist practice

162
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,640
and may it be that all beings

163
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:11,360
