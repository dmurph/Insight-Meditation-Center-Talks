1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:14,040
so hello everyone and aware that in one way

2
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,260
many of you are spread out throughout the globe

3
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:25,800
participating in another way you are here in

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,679
IMC at Redwood City California here in our meditation Hall

5
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:38,700
and um I'm happy to have you along and to share this practice and this teaching

6
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:45,300
and this community together with all of us so um

7
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,820
one of the things that classically the classic Buddhism and I think we do

8
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,160
plenty enough in the modern world is we associate we sometimes treat the

9
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,820
mind as almost like another person sometimes we

10
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:09,540
certainly we identify with our mind as being this is who I am but sometimes we kind of relate to the mind as if it's

11
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,060
another person almost it's not that not us any more than Maybe

12
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:22,860
I don't know if this is a good analogy but after you cut off your fingernail clippings those clippings are not quite

13
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:29,820
you anymore so there's kind of a freedom kind of a independence from the mind

14
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:35,579
um which we can upon with which we can look upon the mind we can see it we can

15
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:44,840
relate to it we can be wiser than certainly parts of the mind that get us into trouble

16
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:52,380
and um so in that regard sometimes it might be helpful to think of the Mind

17
00:01:52,380 --> 00:02:01,020
as a child and sometimes children in order to feel safe I need to have

18
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:07,020
clear boundaries set you know you know and usually with some kind of hopefully

19
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:15,739
compassionate but very clear statement of no so a certain one of our our sons

20
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:22,980
he was I think much more aware and understanding of the world than we ever imagined when he was young

21
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:28,980
before he was verbal or when he was just a toddler and um

22
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:34,560
and now he was somewhat afraid quite a bit I think because he was so smart he

23
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:41,400
kind of understood much more of what was going on or much more of maybe the dangers or something

24
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,980
but sometimes he would push against the limits of what was appropriate behavior

25
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:53,280
and and it was necessary to say no and now you have to stop or that we

26
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,800
don't do that here or something and sometimes they have to be said very clearly definitively

27
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,879
and uh sometimes when we uh we it wasn't exactly my character to do that

28
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:12,540
so I had to kind of learn to be able to say say that and the remarkable thing that I saw

29
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:19,620
was that for a moment he would look very frustrated and angry

30
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:25,680
but oh just a moment immediately afterwards he became much

31
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,040
more subtle than happy it's like now he knew the how far he

32
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,920
could go he could he could know where what he was supposed to do or it was understandable now something about the

33
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,860
world he didn't understand and maybe he was pushing the limits of things to see to understand better how

34
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:51,060
does this world work and then it says no would tell them and and then he would just relax

35
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,420
so in the same way our mind is that the way sometimes

36
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:01,920
sometimes practicing acceptance of it or being

37
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,860
compassionate to it and in ways that just allow it to continue the way it's doing

38
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:13,319
sometimes sometimes that's exactly the right thing to do and sometimes it's not

39
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:21,199
the right thing and sometimes what's appropriate is to say no

40
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:26,880
not that stop we're not going there we're not doing that

41
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,979
we've had those thoughts those feelings those fantasies

42
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:38,060
thousands of times and having and thinking about ruminating about it

43
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:43,380
doesn't help doesn't lead anywhere maybe it's so it's kind of a waste of

44
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:50,699
time to do it now A Thousand and One Time or this train of thought this train of

45
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:59,220
ideas and desires or versions doesn't help anyone it's not supportive

46
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:06,000
maybe even makes things worse and so the Mind needs to hear

47
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,639
a very clear line no we don't do that

48
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:18,840
and how we tell the mind this how we establish a strong no in practice

49
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:25,740
that's uh not harsh not punitive not judgmental not diversive no hostility

50
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:33,720
involved just a Clarity a Clarity and a definitiveness no we don't stand behind

51
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,240
this this is not what we do sometimes it's phenomenally helpful in

52
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:45,620
meditation especially if you know what you're thinking about

53
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:53,280
is nonsense or is just simply not just an old Habit to continue ruminating

54
00:05:53,280 --> 00:06:02,039
about something so the wise use of no

55
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:09,360
and the wise use of saying no and then averting the gays attention from what is

56
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:16,259
not wise to what is wise and for the purpose of meditation here is to focus

57
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:21,680
on breathing

58
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:28,740
present moment so maybe for this meditation if you'd like you can experiment

59
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:34,740
as I guide you with um finding a way to

60
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,960
appropriately in a healthy way

61
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:45,419
to say no to things which are not appropriate

62
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:54,680
not healthy so assuming your meditation posture

63
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,440
and

64
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,759
if it's comfortable closing your eyes

65
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:27,120
and begin with saying yes yes to being here in this body at this

66
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,699
time maybe taking a few long slow deep

67
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:38,460
breaths and the exhale can be a long yes

68
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:45,599
here I am this is the place a clear reminder

69
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,740
here now

70
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:13,380
letting your breathing return to normal and scanning through your body to see

71
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:20,479
where you can relax face the shoulders the belly

72
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:27,599
and you might gently softly say yes to each little movement of

73
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:34,440
relaxation a yes were you allowed to appreciate and enjoy

74
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,180
the benefit of relaxing

75
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:13,459
and then also maybe relaxing a thinking mind

76
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:23,519
stepping away from thinking and ruminating first with a gentle yes to relaxing

77
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:30,800
softening quieting the thinking mind

78
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:34,580
maybe with each exhale

79
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:54,860
and then settling down on your breathing gently ever so softly

80
00:11:55,079 --> 00:12:02,000
maybe a gentle yes or a gentle

81
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:08,000
almost like a silent acknowledgment

82
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:15,920
it's a yes to the inhale yes to the exhale

83
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:10,279
and if you find yourself wondering often thought frequently

84
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:14,600
experiment with saying no

85
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:21,139
or enough stop

86
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:30,200
or if it feels nicer to do so you could say more politely

87
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:36,980
this is not helpful let's stop

88
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:46,639
enough now we have something else to do

89
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:53,100
something very brief and you might try experimenting as you

90
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,079
say the no to the thinking mind

91
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:06,920
to do so at the top of the inhale before you exhale

92
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:16,380
it might take me in holding your breath slightly so the shorter the statement is

93
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:22,320
the better and after you've made your statement of

94
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,560
no

95
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,199
then relax let go with the exhale

96
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:07,580
saying no to thinking at the top of the inhale

97
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:16,220
and maybe enjoying quiet surfing on the exhale

98
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,039
foreign

99
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:42,720
is there anything at this moment that it would be useful even

100
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:48,500
compassionate to say no to

101
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,940
no to your involvement with

102
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:54,360
and then as we come to the end of the sitting to turn your attention outward

103
00:26:54,360 --> 00:27:02,779
to this suffering world to the people that you care for

104
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,580
to the world you care for

105
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:15,260
and consider your love your care your kindness

106
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:26,120
Your Capacity to serve this world better

107
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,880
is there anything that you have within you

108
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:38,179
that you could compassionately say no to

109
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:44,940
that reduces obstacles to your love

110
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:51,679
to your care to your kindness for this world

111
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:10,460
and in saying no to it it makes more room

112
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:17,520
for Goodwill for well-wishing for kindness for

113
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:24,659
friendliness and may it be that this meditation we do

114
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:30,360
supports us to be a friend of others the friend of

115
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:36,900
the world may all beings

116
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:44,600
be happy may all beings be safe

117
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:54,620
may all beings be peaceful may all beings be free

118
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:02,179
and may each of us contribute to this possibility

119
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,080
as friends of the world

120
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:14,369
[Music]

121
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:25,690
[Music]

122
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:35,179
[Music] thank you

123
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:49,679
foreign

124
00:29:53,820 --> 00:30:01,380
so then continuing today with the strategies for dealing with challenges

125
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:06,960
and we have healthy strategies and unhealthy strategies

126
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:13,860
and all too often the unhealthy strategies the which are often our best efforts to

127
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:19,860
cope with great difficulty sometimes makes situation worse or we

128
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:25,200
spiral out we get caught up in the reactivity to

129
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:31,140
the challenges we have and and sometimes that reactivity or the

130
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:36,539
caught upness or what gets triggered in us can be so strong that it's uh can be

131
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:43,919
overwhelming and challenging so it's helpful if we develop a habit of

132
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:52,279
looking at how we are in challenges with the question what's that my strategy here what am I trying to do

133
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:59,340
how am I reacting or responding to this challenge that I have

134
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:06,779
and so there are five hindrances are often unhealthy strategies

135
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:12,960
and we're trying our best to cope with it but we're often choosing a way which

136
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,179
maybe can seem beneficial but actually is not

137
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:25,980
and this is particularly true with the second of the hindrances which is often translated into English

138
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:32,520
as a version and so in Buddhist English we have to understand that when the word aversion

139
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:37,919
is used it it doesn't mean just simply the state of averting ourselves from

140
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:43,919
something but it's also the state of having certain kind of hostility or ill

141
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:49,919
will towards something and sometimes uh the the instinct to

142
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:58,020
fight the instinct to attack the challenge we have um it can seem uh very productive or

143
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:05,159
very important or appropriate or justified in the moment and but uh and maybe it even

144
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:10,440
accomplishes what we want but it does so at a tremendous cost

145
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:15,600
and the example that I've used often I apologize for repeating myself is again

146
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:21,179
back to my son when he was young um there were some times when my no to

147
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:26,700
him uh was I used what I called my strong voice

148
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:34,140
and um and I'm afraid that I was you know pretty angry by that time that I used it but I I felt like this has to

149
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:41,880
stop and so I had a strong voice and then he would stop and

150
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:49,080
um times when I said no to him and it was appropriate there were times it was helpful for him to hear that and he

151
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:56,580
would be happy afterwards he knew the limits of what he could do and he understood the world a little bit better but when I used to a strong voice I

152
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:04,020
would accomplish what I wanted to do and I said oh that worked you know and and that was good but then sometime

153
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:09,240
later I heard him using the same voice for his younger brother

154
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:15,779
and I thought oh my what have I done here what kind of conditioning what example have I given of what's

155
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:20,940
appropriate how to be with people and so the long-term consequences of of

156
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:27,600
the strong voice kind of strong no aversion sometimes it accomplishes what we want in the moment

157
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,940
is not so healthy it creates unhealthy relationships perhaps

158
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:38,880
so um so but you know it is attempt to take care of ourselves at times

159
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:45,360
as other sometimes uh a version or no is uh doesn't really take care of ourselves

160
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:54,419
what does it take what's it what it's taken care of is our desires taking care of our our conceit

161
00:33:54,419 --> 00:34:00,179
and um and we don't want that threatened in any way we want to be able to do whatever we want

162
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:07,320
so there's a whole world of strategy that comes into play with the second hindrance with a version and we have to

163
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:12,358
understand this is a strategy we're trying to accomplish something in the world through it

164
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:19,200
then the question is is there a more healthy way of accomplishing this you know some of the same things

165
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:27,320
a more healthy thing that we would want so the the the uh the healthy side of

166
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:34,200
aversion is averting there is a healthy appropriate turning away from things

167
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:40,679
stepping away from things I'm not going to say that I'm not going to go into that I'm not going to participate in

168
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:47,520
this and um but it isn't with hostility it isn't with uh anger

169
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:54,118
it isn't with um shutting down but it's saying this is not working and until

170
00:34:54,119 --> 00:35:01,320
somehow this can work better I'm going to step back I'm going to turn away and um and so there's all kinds of

171
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:07,080
healthy turning away that we can do in our in our life and our strategy

172
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:14,700
so turning away so we can recover turning away so we can settle ourselves or discover ourselves

173
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:20,460
understand what how we've been impacted so that later we might be able to if it's appropriate to come back and have a

174
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:27,140
conversation or deal with some issue but to go ahead long you know

175
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:33,599
rushing into trying to take care of our problem that doesn't have to be taken care of in

176
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:39,420
the moment maybe there can be even a few minutes wait so we could catch our breath get some

177
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:46,320
clear sense of what's happening so we can find other strategies besides hostility

178
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:52,260
besides blaming someone and sometimes that hostility is directed

179
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:58,140
to oneself and um and that's just as important when the hostility is directed to the blame

180
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:04,920
is directed to oneself the guilt the shame the you know here I did it I made

181
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:12,240
a big mistake again I um that kind of aversion or hostility or or criticism of ourselves

182
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:17,280
also is a strategy that trying to make things better but it

183
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:23,640
doesn't and so is there another way is there a way of recognizing wow that

184
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:30,119
didn't work maybe I did say something I shouldn't have said and I'm going to turn away from that I'm

185
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:36,960
not going to do that again but I'm not going to attack myself I'm not going to live

186
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,480
under the weight of guilt or shame I'm going to do something better

187
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:50,040
I'm going to say no to it and in the future I'm going to dedicate myself to doing better in the future

188
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:56,880
I'm going to find a better way and so in Buddhism we learn from the past just enough

189
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:02,220
to be inspired even be encouraged there's a better way I'm going to find

190
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:08,099
it I'm going to do that I'm going to say no to behavior which is not healthy

191
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:15,480
and try to find healthy ways of doing that there are definitely times where we want

192
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:22,099
to learn to avert times when we want to say no there's a way of saying no to someone

193
00:37:22,099 --> 00:37:29,540
that is not um attacking them or exactly saying

194
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:35,700
you know you're wrong that can't be done but we say no I can't participate in

195
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:42,060
that no this doesn't work for me no

196
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:47,099
um I think that if that's the way this conversation is going I think that I

197
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:53,579
need to step away a little bit and I need to regroup because this is this kind of conversation

198
00:37:53,579 --> 00:38:01,140
um and causes me to not come from my best place or to be clear I

199
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:08,400
don't want to I feel my anger coming up now and I find that I don't want to be able I don't want to talk from my hostility

200
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:16,260
and my anger can we take a break I'd like to go around the block and chill and then you come back and you still are

201
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:22,740
very definitive and say no this doesn't work this is not right for me or can we find we have to find a different

202
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:28,740
way so we're definitive we're clear but we don't come from a place of

203
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:35,700
hostility the strategy we have is how can we find a way to be connected how can we find a

204
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:42,180
way to cooperate in this endeavor how can we find a way that um that like take care of myself in a

205
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:50,760
definitive and clear way I stand up for myself but no one's attacked that no one there's no hostility

206
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:56,880
and um and so there's I've noticed I've seen sometimes

207
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:03,540
in Buddhism where we have the strong value of not acting with aversion not having a

208
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:08,940
version that people misunderstand it to think they're never allowed to say no

209
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:14,700
they're never allowed to turn away step away from something

210
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:20,700
because oh that's a version or something so that's not true so

211
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:28,940
the strategy there's a strategy of averting and that strategy can in One Direction

212
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:35,579
it contains hostility ill will in the other direction it contains

213
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:41,940
wisdom it contains non-ill will not hostility

214
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:47,400
and and in the non-hostile way of saying no or averting

215
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:55,560
so it's possible to have that be very definitive and being definitive and establishing

216
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:02,579
clear limits of what's you're going to participate in or what you're going to do can be done with love can be done

217
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:09,420
with kindness it might not be reciprocated people might misunderstand

218
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:15,540
but on one hand that's their problem psychologically for themselves that's

219
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:22,320
what they have to come to terms with but many people are not going to do that so then you have to decide

220
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:27,599
if you explain to them more the impact of their actions how they are or maybe

221
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:34,560
you see more clearly what they're capable of and what their Tendencies are and it gives you more information about

222
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,980
how much you should step away saying oh this doesn't work at all I don't think we can find a way here now

223
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:46,579
that I understand this person is kind of stuck in that particular thing

224
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:52,200
so um so one of the most important things I

225
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:58,560
would like to suggest is that around this is that when we're challenged

226
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:04,500
take a little bit of time to consider what do you what in relationship to the

227
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:10,140
challenge are you trying to do what do you what are you trying to do

228
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:17,400
what are you trying to accomplish and how are you and is the way you're trying to do that does it work is it

229
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:25,400
healthy because many times and challenges people are operating from gut reactions

230
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:31,460
sometimes with um you know quick decisions or

231
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:38,460
things are not considered or not thought out and um and so a Dharma life is one where

232
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:43,800
we don't act impulsively um sometimes you might act spontaneously

233
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:50,160
but we never act impulsively where we're acting from our reactivity we take time

234
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:58,020
to ask the question what am I trying to do here what am I trying to accomplish and is the way that I'm doing it is it

235
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:04,740
for the welfare and well-being of everyone concerned

236
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:13,380
and that I think is the real key of a Dharma process is how is this how can we find a

237
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:20,220
way that's the best for everyone involved in the conflict even the people who are causing so much trouble

238
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:28,020
it does not mean we have to put up with it it does not mean that we have to we can't avert and step away or be clear

239
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:33,980
but the notion that it's not me versus you

240
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:39,359
um but rather yeah what's best for all of us you don't have to say that you're

241
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:45,960
doing that but that leads to long-term well-being

242
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:51,619
hostility only leads to very short-term well-being at the best

243
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,780
so asking yourself what are you trying to do and is the way you're doing it is

244
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:03,980
it really healthy for you and for others and for this world

245
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:09,720
so thank you and um we'll continue going through these

246
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:14,180
strategies for challenges tomorrow
