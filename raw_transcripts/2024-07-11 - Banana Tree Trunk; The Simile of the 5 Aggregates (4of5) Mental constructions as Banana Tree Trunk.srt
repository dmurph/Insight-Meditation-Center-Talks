1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:09,358
welcome welcome to our 7 a.m. meditation and dhad

2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:24,160
again yeah just happy to see the chat messages coming in from all around all

3
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,760
around the world

4
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:45,440
so here we are um we are on the uh five aggregate

5
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:54,680
simile this week and today uh we are going to speak about the force simile

6
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:00,440
and we'll practice with it and I don't know how exactly we could practice with it just yet

7
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:07,119
but uh um because the simile may or may not be

8
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,240
um kind of connecting with many of us who don't

9
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:20,840
know the trees so much so we'll see how it works so the the forth s simile of the

10
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:31,799
five Aggregates um is uh uh is about this PO word Sara

11
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:40,040
Saras often translated as mental formations or mental

12
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:47,799
Fabrications um it's a kind of uh human mental process or the

13
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:53,520
force that um is capable of

14
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,360
constructing things you know constructing ideas constructing a sense

15
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:07,599
of solidity uh based on ideas and

16
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:14,239
um this construction the constructing force can

17
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:20,040
construct the other Aggregates that we've been other cleaning Aggregates

18
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:26,920
that we've been speaking about and so it's deep rooted force and

19
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:35,120
yet uh this force of construct ing um it forms something that looks

20
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:43,200
very solid and uh very concrete um very persistent strong

21
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,959
even um but when we look um carefully examine it carefully as what the suta

22
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:57,080
was pointing to we see all this constructing forces are rather

23
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:03,239
ephemeral and the Sut use the word void Hollow

24
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:11,560
insubstantial and so Buddha used thiso of plantin plant plantain trees or

25
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,239
banana trees you know this is in the tropical uh places and you see this kind

26
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:23,000
of trees and they look from outside the trunk is

27
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,080
solid but if you look internally the tree trunks are formed by

28
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,159
all of this big pieces of leaves wrapping around and around around and

29
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,959
they look like uh solid trunk but they are actually hollow

30
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:50,519
inside they they can't be used to really make anything uh that long lasting or

31
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:58,120
sustaining and that's the nature of this Sanara if we look

32
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,560
internally they just things wrapped around around and forming something that

33
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,599
looks solid but they're actually

34
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:13,640
not so we'll practice with this a bit um

35
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:19,199
and my invitation is to maybe pay careful attention

36
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,479
to um this force that maybe inside of us

37
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:30,440
that can make stuff up like you know you may have a certain experience

38
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,960
and then there is a force that wanted to make this a real thing that you got to

39
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:42,720
fix or some real thing that you're judging about particularly in

40
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:49,880
relationship to this force of making a sense of a self I need mine based on the

41
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:57,080
momentary experience that's happening so those are my introductory

42
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:02,759
words and uh We Begin uh meditating with

43
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:10,750
this this [Music]

44
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,560
words so take a few long deep

45
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:38,280
breath inviting yourself love to come home to this body mind and

46
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,160
heart maybe

47
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:55,880
entering entering into this home here and now

48
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:08,400
feeling and sensing the global sense of the

49
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:23,160
posture feeling and sensing the outer

50
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:29,240
environment the space temperature

51
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,479
and feeling and sensing the inner

52
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,199
environment maybe some

53
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
mood

54
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:57,160
thoughts activities in the mind

55
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,960
and movements in the

56
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:27,960
body becoming Mindful and a present

57
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:45,560
you may not necessarily be anchoring on any specific

58
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:57,039
thing but you're present for the momentary experiences

59
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,720
committed to being present

60
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,200
one moment at a

61
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:54,279
time it's not a forceful thing but

62
00:08:54,279 --> 00:09:01,000
rather a heart values being present

63
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:30,880
a sense of a being

64
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:36,600
home may become

65
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:48,839
Fuller you can simply rest here

66
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,199
the movements and the flow of the

67
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:18,040
breath may become more

68
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,519
obvious now the energ energetic AI

69
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:40,959
body can be more felt sensed

70
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:12,000
a sway tingling

71
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:23,480
Sensations you can feel the dense within this body

72
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:06,240
raone he foamy body

73
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
light

74
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:23,959
Airy maybe bubbly like the water bubbles

75
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:51,920
and perceptions May float in and

76
00:12:52,399 --> 00:13:03,959
out like the Mirage the shimmering mirage at a high no know in a hot season

77
00:13:53,759 --> 00:14:03,160
softening and deepening in into the sea of

78
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:13,320
change in the body and in the

79
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
mind

80
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
e

81
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:31,959
e e

82
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,759
in resting in a quiet

83
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:29,680
Stillness you may notice the forces of Saras

84
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:35,680
that the stitches experience

85
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,600
together into a solid

86
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,160
story believe

87
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,839
a momentary waves of

88
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:21,720
emotions can become I

89
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,240
am that

90
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,880
emotion e

91
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,400
or something persists for a

92
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,640
while yes Sankara can

93
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:30,559
claim it's always like this

94
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,480
when this can be seen

95
00:18:52,159 --> 00:19:00,720
clearly we have a choice to set it free

96
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

97
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

98
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

99
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

100
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,559
e e

101
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,799
there is nothing to

102
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,440
fix staying

103
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:41,120
in the being and staying in the clear

104
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:52,000
knowing it has an innate

105
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,559
capacity to set free

106
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,278
what's not

107
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
graspable

108
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

109
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360

110

e

118
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,080
e e

119
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:36,399
when we're simply being with a clear

120
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:43,120
knowing that's available here and

121
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:54,720
now it's possible to release any

122
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,039
contention that's here

123
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:15,799
and it's possible to feel and sense a kind of a

124
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:26,120
wellbe that it can hold non wellbe

125
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:38,440
they don't have to be in conflict with

126
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,639
each

127
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:00,960
other for

128
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:57,080
there may be tenderness and a care that's available

129
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,679
that can be

130
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,840
felt

131
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,799
e e

132
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:39,439
[Music]

133
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:50,919
s like to read this part of the sutta that uh speak

134
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:57,399
about uh Saras as a a planting or banana

135
00:33:57,399 --> 00:34:07,039
tree trunks so here it is suppose practitioner that a person

136
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:15,599
needing hardw seeking hardw wandering in search of a

137
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:21,800
Heartwood would take a sharp tool and enter a

138
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:28,800
forest there they would see the trunk of a large banana tree

139
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:34,960
straight freshh without a fruit but

140
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:44,919
core they would cut it down at the root cut off the crown and unroll the

141
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:52,878
coil as they unroll the coil they would not even find soft wood

142
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:58,880
let alone hardwood a person with a good site would

143
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:07,520
inspect it ponder it and carefully investigate it and it would appear to

144
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:13,480
them to be void Hollow and

145
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:20,280
insubstantial for what substance would there be in the trunk of a plantin

146
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:26,640
tree so to practitioners what kind of mental

147
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:35,320
formations there are whether past future or present internal or

148
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:41,640
external gross or subtle inferior or or

149
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:50,520
Superior far or near a practitioner inspects them pers them and carefully

150
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:58,400
investigates them as they investigate them they appear to them to be void

151
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,720
Hollow insubstantial and for what substance

152
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:08,200
would there be in mental

153
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:17,280
formations and so this image of um banana tree trunk as I was saying that

154
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:23,480
the the leaves Co you up and that kind of form the

155
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:29,400
trunk um but they Hollow once they

156
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:35,319
uncoiled and if the person is looking for something that's longlasting and

157
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:43,319
strong and steady stable like you know building something strong which is used

158
00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:49,160
to um kind of point to symbolizes how we're searching for some

159
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:54,400
kind of lasting well-being a deeper kind of well-being

160
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:02,000
the Heartwood you won't find it uh in this coed mental formations you know

161
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:11,440
banana tree trunk because inside um it's a

162
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:19,800
hollow and so that is the nature of Saras like different uh mental

163
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:25,960
formations that gets stitched together they kind of call you together to form

164
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:31,200
an a sort of illusion that something

165
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:37,599
is solid but when you look carefully that's

166
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:46,280
not the case I want to use an example to maybe illustrate this I remember on a

167
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:53,359
Meditation Retreat and uh in the middle of um uh

168
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:58,680
The Retreat and I noticed and one sitting

169
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:06,000
there was some experience began to emerge that my mind began to name

170
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:13,760
it and you know this is X and then there is kind of the force

171
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,040
that wasn't enough as if then it's trying to name it yet another word oh no

172
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:26,400
it's something like this and then you know it's kind of multiple times in a row it's trying to

173
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:34,359
name what the this experience is initially was naming this in English

174
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:42,520
after a while I felt like oh no this doesn't quite capture exactly what it is and and I start throwing Chinese words

175
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:49,440
at it at some point I noticed wow this kind of like has a

176
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:56,319
force in this it really wants to nail it then I recognized this wow this is the

177
00:38:56,319 --> 00:39:02,480
force of a sun it's trying to make it a thing you know

178
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:08,760
based on the experience that's uh floating through and flowing through and

179
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:15,920
I thought to myself wow there's no end to this you know I can make it this I

180
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:21,000
can make it that but that they experience just what

181
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:28,000
it is it may not need a word it may not need an image

182
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:36,200
it may not need any conceptual ideas to be associated with with it and it

183
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:44,000
doesn't need any justification like this and so when that was

184
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:51,319
seen oh some part of me began to soften oh I can just let it

185
00:39:51,319 --> 00:39:57,560
be I don't need to have it must be something

186
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:05,200
and so that's the momentary Freedom that can become available when we begin to

187
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:12,480
recognize uh sort of the nature of this momentum the nature of this Force that's

188
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:19,640
happening and so this is maybe kind of a trivial example but often when this

189
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:24,800
Force began to uh take its own sort of

190
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,319
uh Ride Along its own momentum

191
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:37,040
it can begin to create this sense of a self by wrapping around this layers of

192
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:45,720
mental and physical activities that's happening uh perceptions ideas and

193
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:52,720
beliefs and at some point we will lose track by seeing the

194
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:59,920
momentary Ever Changing experiences uh we turn them into sort of

195
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:08,280
a banana trunk banana tree trunk it becomes about me rather than

196
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:15,400
the experiences that are changing uh in our

197
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:22,880
meditation I kind of uh offered some pointers where uh sometimes when we have

198
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:29,079
certain waves of emotions and the Saras can

199
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:35,359
function uh by turning the momentary experiences

200
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:42,200
into you know like maybe I'm experiencing some kind of a sadness or

201
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:49,800
maybe even extended kind of a sadness then it can be turned

202
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:55,800
into a I'm always like this that's a

203
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:01,359
construction that's not not the reality and we can overlay on top of

204
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:07,119
that even further by declaring this is how I am I'm always

205
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:12,760
like ever since I'm little and so you can

206
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:20,559
see this kind of a construct began to limit us and blocks

207
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:29,559
so many other possibilities that's here too and because of this we can't see Joy

208
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:34,680
or happiness that may be momentarily available here

209
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:41,800
too that's present too we can't see a kind of a well-being that may be

210
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:50,920
here and so that's the danger of um getting lost in the construct the

211
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:56,640
constructing force and so the Dharma practice offers

212
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:02,280
us to stay in the immediacy of our felt sense

213
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:09,760
experience then we can begin to see how the the forces stitch together and coil

214
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:15,559
this layers of a construct that's how it's being

215
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:22,920
constructed and in seeing it we have an opportunity to choose

216
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:30,920
something different we can see oh The Experience are just

217
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:38,400
experience the AAL Force leads to duka and we can have an opportunity

218
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:46,880
choose to let go let go of coiling and often this let go doesn't uh doesn't

219
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:56,200
need some kind of active doing instead uh this letting go kind of um

220
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:01,960
moving away from this constructing Force comes very naturally when we begin to

221
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:10,240
see the phenomenon just as is and so that gets released as a

222
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:17,640
natural unfolding of the Dharma and so

223
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:25,760
um you know for today uh the rest of the day as uh you go about the day maybe you

224
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:34,200
know pay attention to uh this forces that may be making stuff up constructing

225
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:41,599
realities in our heart and mind and just have a lot of humor around this you know

226
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:50,800
this part of ourselves try very hard to make this life work and um by practicing you can begin

227
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:58,480
to see there is a different possibility there is a different kind of a well-being that may be

228
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:03,520
available but not keep feeding into this

229
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:09,400
Con constructs and so have a wonderful rest

230
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:16,440
of the day and may your day be filled with this

231
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:24,200
exploration and the Dharma Joy so be well everyone
