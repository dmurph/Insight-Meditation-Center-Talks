1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,160
okay so good morning or afternoon or

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:13,440
evening it's nice to be here with all of you for this week

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,199
and why don't we go ahead and get started with the meditation and then i'll i'll

4
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:25,840
say a bit more afterwards about what we'll be doing together this week

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:33,680
so please find a posture that is upright and also

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,200
someone where you can have some ease in your body

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,239
and just feel yourself settling in and letting go of whatever it was you

8
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:52,800
were doing before arriving just having the sense

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,039
internally that you have arrived

10
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,680
if it's comfortable to do so you can gently close your eyes

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,720
otherwise just have a soft gaze downward

12
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,840
and just bring the attention internally

13
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,119
perhaps feeling first into the place where you're sitting so

14
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,479
your seat against the cushion or the chair

15
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,520
or the bench or the bed maybe you're even doing standing

16
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,520
meditation

17
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:49,439
so feeling the support under you and just allowing

18
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,720
your body to find some balance sometimes i even

19
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:02,399
rock back and forth slightly or forward and back just to find that center point

20
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,599
where the body can be supported with minimal effort

21
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,239
from the muscles

22
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:30,160
and when that balance point is found it may feel like the body naturally

23
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,440
straightens or extends upward

24
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,720
almost as if there were a little string from the top of the head

25
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,920
it just feels

26
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,239
natural and then we can invite some ease

27
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,680
throughout the body especially places where we tend to be

28
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:06,959
habitually tightened so softening the muscles of the face

29
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:14,040
like in the forehead and around the eyes the jaw

30
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,239
softening the eyes and the eye sockets

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,159
releasing all the little muscles around the scalp

32
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,599
down through the throat

33
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:58,080
and into the shoulders letting the shoulders just naturally settle

34
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:06,920
out maybe thinking of the shoulder blades sliding down the back

35
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:28,120
and letting the arms soften down through the hands

36
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:48,080
then down into the torso softening the chest area the upper back

37
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:59,440
maybe sensing the ribcage front the back the sides

38
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,840
and down into the belly

39
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:24,520
inviting some softness just whatever is willing to release

40
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,759
down through the hips

41
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,199
sinking a little deeper into the support

42
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,880
groin muscles the thigh muscles

43
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:11,120
all the way down through the calves and the ankle joints and the feet

44
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:24,240
it can be helpful at the beginning of a meditation just to briefly scan through the body

45
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,199
and all we do is invite some ease

46
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:37,039
there are parts of the body that are still tense or that we couldn't connect with

47
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,919
particularly that's fine

48
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,759
the body is fine as it is

49
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:02,080
and then as the body gets a bit more still even just a little bit

50
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:09,039
often it's easier to connect with the sensations of breathing

51
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,479
so we're just allowing that simple

52
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:25,440
connection of the body breathing in and breathing out

53
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:36,758
just naturally not changing anything about how that happens to be right now

54
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,319
just bringing that into the field of mindfulness

55
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:44,399
we may begin to notice that breathing is a whole body process

56
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,160
there's of course the we may know anatomically where the lungs

57
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:57,600
are but as you tune into the breathing in a

58
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:04,320
meditative way it may be possible to

59
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,399
sense the way the breath affects other parts of the body

60
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,800
the shoulders rise and fall slightly

61
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:23,560
the belly down underneath the lungs the belly is moving

62
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:32,040
maybe there's even a slight feeling in the arms and the legs or the head

63
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,680
we don't need to push for that but i'm just inviting

64
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:51,320
an opening up of our understanding of the breath

65
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,600
so we can connect in with very simple sensations

66
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:40,639
not even really the idea of breathing in breathing out

67
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:48,640
but sensations more like tingling

68
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:55,720
or pressure heat

69
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,160
the brushing of the clothing against the skin as the body shifts

70
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:26,279
even very subtle sensations that would be hard to put a word onto

71
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,440
so i call these elemental sensations

72
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,920
they occur throughout the body

73
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:01,760
i would invite in this meditation to use these simple

74
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:08,680
breath or full body sensations as the object

75
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:20,639
if it works for you you can see them as an observer you can

76
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,399
imagine that you are watching them with some interest maybe the way a

77
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,040
child watches waves on the beach

78
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:45,360
that's fine it's also possible to

79
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,560
enter into the sensations directly

80
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:57,760
as if the mindfulness is getting very close to these sensations

81
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,200
that feels supportive or interesting

82
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,920
so i'm just connecting with this

83
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:26,079
world of body sensations for a little while and if the mind gets

84
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:31,839
distracted which of course it will it's no problem just

85
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:37,120
immediately open again to these simple

86
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,240
sensations either as an observer

87
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,639
or entering into them directly

88
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,800
okay

89
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:12,959
when working with the body it can be helpful

90
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:19,038
from time to time to just quickly scan through again

91
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:24,558
and soften any places that may have become tense

92
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:31,120
sometimes the eyes get tense because we

93
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:36,720
are trying to look at these sensations

94
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:42,799
we might just not notice that we're building up some tension in the shoulders or

95
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,919
the belly and that's fine when we just turn

96
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:53,600
attention briefly back to the ease and the body and we can

97
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:59,840
identify those tight spots and soften them and

98
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:08,840
on with our direct connection to this world of the body

99
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,720
if there are sensations that feel particularly

100
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,840
strong or

101
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,799
dominating the awareness it's fine to

102
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:59,919
focus on something else more often this observer stance of

103
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:07,039
being separate from that but watching it is a good way to just maintain the

104
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,399
balance of the mind

105
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,720
so being sensitive to how you're relating to this particular

106
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,440
meditation

107
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:35,400
taking care to just stay in something simple

108
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,960
you may notice also that there is change

109
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:49,840
the body is continually blowing changing

110
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:56,400
even sensations that seem relatively constant

111
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,919
have changed since the beginning of the sit for example

112
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:10,799
so being aware also that there is inconstancy and

113
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:17,600
shifting and changing dynamism in the body

114
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,760
and continuing to rest with that

115
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:50,799
so as we continue on [Music] just bringing in one more

116
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:59,360
element is to consider the knowing

117
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:06,799
the knowing quality that is allowing you to be mindful at this moment

118
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,480
there are different aspects or kinds of knowing

119
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,840
and what we've emphasized in this sit

120
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,559
is this kind of bodily knowing

121
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,600
it may seem like a subtle difference but consider that the bodily kind of knowing

122
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,720
is it's different from thought isn't it

123
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,720
it's different from emotion

124
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,880
it's different from knowledge that other people have told you

125
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:04,799
about the knowing of these direct body sensations is one form of what's called

126
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,679
direct knowing direct knowledge

127
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,840
very clear and distinct

128
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,520
and completely unique to you

129
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,400
always available

130
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:38,000
so just being aware of that direct knowing quality

131
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,720
of body sensations

132
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:57,760
so there's a lot of information in the body

133
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:03,840
a lot of signals coming in

134
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:10,640
and they're always in the present moment what is known through the body is always

135
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:18,720
in the present moment whereas the mind can go out to other

136
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,640
things that's in other times and places

137
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:32,240
so maybe just as we're going about our days this week

138
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,799
we can consider that having this intimate

139
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:46,399
direct connection to what's going on in our body can actually help us

140
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:52,480
in our daily life it may not be as subtle as we have

141
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:59,600
during meditation but we can

142
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:06,640
use it as a way to know that we're being present that we're in the present moment

143
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:15,440
we may be able to notice if we have times of tension or times of ease

144
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:21,360
the body can help us to stay mindful and to

145
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:27,760
stay in a wholesome state of mind so when we're with others we're

146
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:34,320
more likely to remember our arnetta or our patients

147
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:39,880
so this is actually very practical

148
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:46,480
helpful information to have sometimes i just feel my feet on the

149
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:52,399
floor or what's going on in my belly and that's

150
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:58,799
you know that's enough i maybe that's all i can bring into my attention while i'm also with someone

151
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:04,640
else but it's very helpful so i am quite

152
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,840
experimenting with that

153
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:17,600
may it be that we can stay with the present moment so that we can be present for

154
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,120
others as well as ourselves

155
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:43,799
may what we've learned is in this meditation be of service to all beings

156
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:55,410
[Music]

157
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,190
[Music]

158
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,600
okay so

159
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,960
many of you know me i'm kim allen and

160
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:19,760
i saw one comment asking about gil because apparently he had to cancel

161
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:25,279
the meditation yesterday um just to let you know he is fine

162
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:32,559
that was just a complication where he wasn't able to be there but everything is okay

163
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,240
so i'll be here with you this week

164
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:45,519
so as you likely know there are a lot of lists in buddhism and

165
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:51,679
i think they're quite helpful but i was recently reminded of some

166
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:57,519
items from a different set of lists in the 12 days of christmas

167
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:04,399
and the last set goes like this five gold rings four calling birds three

168
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:12,240
french hens two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree it's an interesting list

169
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:20,159
and it turns out that buddhism has some unusual lists also so i was inspired to consider some of

170
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:25,519
the less well-known lists in the buddhist teachings and that is going to be the

171
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:32,320
theme for this week so today we'll have a list of five tomorrow a list of four

172
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:39,360
and so on down to one item on friday and we'll see that there's some deep

173
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:47,679
dharma in these somewhat less common teachings and i also chose them to apply to this

174
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:54,960
year end time when some of us are in the midst of family and maybe others of us might be having a

175
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,640
more reflective or contemplative time or maybe maybe some of us are doing both

176
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:08,240
that's good so i hope you'll indulge me in this exploration this week

177
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:13,839
so today's list of five might be called

178
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:20,960
five ways of ascertaining truth and then also how we can uh preserve

179
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,320
that truth while we're talking so

180
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:33,040
somewhat like what i alluded to in the meditation how is it that you know something

181
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:38,638
how is it that you know something and i i mean that is a sort of a question to explore

182
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:45,520
so consider you know how do you know your dog's name or how to drive a car or what to say to

183
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:50,720
your child's teacher the first time you meet them or what about

184
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:57,200
more spiritual truths how do you know the deeper movements of the heart or the more universal

185
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:04,320
qualities of a of a human life so without attempting in a whole

186
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,839
epistemological catalog we can observe i think that it's that we

187
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:16,400
have many different modes of knowing we have facts that are memorized and stored in

188
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:22,240
our brains we have emotional understanding we have cultural norms

189
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:28,079
we have logical deductions [Music] i used to work

190
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:34,400
long ago at a lab where i was running complex machines and i would if i hadn't

191
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:41,920
used one for a while i would go to use it and sometimes i would remember how to use it because my hand would move

192
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,960
toward a certain knob i had some kind of a body memory about how to use that

193
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:53,119
machine and then you know kinds of knowing where we can't quite pin down what it is we

194
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:59,200
tend to just call intuition so we have a lot of different ways of knowing

195
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:06,480
why is this interesting or important well how we know does matter because

196
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:15,040
some types of knowing are more reliable than others right so the buddha in one of the sutas

197
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:21,440
um 95 he talks about how we know

198
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:28,480
spiritual or religious truth and he comments and the reason he's giving this teaching is that he comments

199
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:36,079
that very often people will make assertions about this kind of truth that amount to saying

200
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:41,200
only this is true everything else is wrong you know so we have a

201
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:47,680
an idea where we're asserting a certain thing as fact and that everything else must be wrong

202
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:55,040
but then he he gives a little more nuance to how it is that we know things and he points out five common ways of

203
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:00,240
knowing that are not actually fully reliable

204
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:06,720
so he i'll list the five so he says um faith or

205
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:12,400
yeah faith or trust in something um the second one is liking something

206
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:18,240
gill translates it as it is pleasing so we like something it sounds good

207
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:25,200
makes you know feels feels right um and then the third one is oral or cultural tradition

208
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:30,880
something that our culture has just always known is true

209
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:36,000
the fourth one is logical reasoning something where we've deduced it for

210
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:43,280
ourselves by thinking about it and the fifth one is called reflective acceptance of a view so that means we've

211
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:50,960
heard from somebody else we've thought it through and decided that that's a correct assessment so those are the

212
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:57,599
five um the buddha says that each one of these the way the suta says is it is that they

213
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:04,320
can turn out in two different ways so that that means that we could have faith in

214
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:09,680
something complete faith in it but it's actually false or

215
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,800
we could not have faith in something but it is actually true

216
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:20,000
and the same for all the others and we could reason something out very carefully but we'd come to the wrong

217
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,440
conclusion or we could not accept the logic of something but it

218
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,800
is actually correct so it's interesting to consider that yes

219
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:36,480
it's true i can't really say that any one of these five is absolutely 100

220
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:42,320
uh reliable all the time now of course we use all five of these

221
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:47,839
throughout the day and and we might notice also that uh the

222
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:53,680
first two are in the emotional realm so having faith in something or

223
00:38:53,680 --> 00:39:00,240
finding it pleasing kind of in the affective realm uh the middle one is in the cultural

224
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:05,920
realm what what society tells us and then the last two the reasoning or

225
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,960
the reflective acceptance are logical cognitive

226
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,240
so then one might ask also what's left so he's he's eliminated

227
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:22,400
large swaths of our uh you know realm of experience as not totally reliable ways

228
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:28,560
of knowing so the buddha doesn't say in this suta to just throw out anything any of these

229
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:34,079
ways of knowing he just says to be clearly aware that they're not definitive

230
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:40,720
and what what is reliable according to this teaching is to know something through direct experience

231
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:47,200
that's kind of remember he's talking mostly about religious or spiritual truth so instead of asserting things or

232
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:53,599
deducing them or just having blind faith in them we should actually experience things through our

233
00:39:53,599 --> 00:40:00,480
through our practice [Music] so it's pretty interesting list right

234
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:06,079
so then um he goes on after this to

235
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:11,760
describe a path for discovering spiritual truth that actually makes use

236
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:18,160
of several of these unreliable methods along the way so that gives at least some assurance that it's okay to be

237
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:24,880
using them he suggests that we should have some kind of faith in in a teacher or in the teachings in order to be able

238
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:30,079
to walk the path and he also says that we should use reflective acceptance of what we've

239
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:36,880
learned you know when you hear teachings like like this one that i'm giving don't just believe what i say you know

240
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:43,200
please think about it does that make sense have i seen that in my life um yeah and so he

241
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:48,440
considers that those are actually good and reliable well

242
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:53,520
helpful ways to approach the path and so with care we can use these ways of

243
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:59,839
knowing skillfully in order to get to the place where we can directly know things through our own experience

244
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:06,800
like what i pointed to in the meditation where we have bodily knowledge is quite direct

245
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:14,400
so then um he focuses then on how we can know how we can talk about

246
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:20,560
what it is that we know and this is now practical for our holiday time if we're discussing

247
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:26,000
ideas and facts and views and opinions with relatives for example

248
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,560
so the buddha talks in the suta about preserving or safeguarding the truth by

249
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:39,440
clearly stating how it is that we know something so we have to notice then how we know it

250
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:45,359
um and so then when we make declarative statements we can say from what basis

251
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:51,920
we're speaking so for example if you thought some think through logically you can say i've

252
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:59,440
reasoned my way through this and i think such and such or because of xyz it follows that such

253
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:04,960
and such so you're being clear about the fact that this is coming from logic

254
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,720
or if you have faith in something you can say my faith is that such and such is true

255
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:16,240
or i trust that such and such is true so this provides some honesty and clarity

256
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:22,079
around the statements that we're putting out into the world and so what we don't want to slip into

257
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:28,880
is only this is true everything else is wrong you know that doesn't usually land very well for other people

258
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:34,480
so we have to be careful about making declarative statements you might find that this

259
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:42,240
helps in conversations with others in order not to get into so many disputes

260
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:48,000
so maybe i'll just give an example of um kind of the difference between these

261
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,359
typical ways of knowing and the more reliable experiential one

262
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:59,040
i was trying to kind of discern if i had one experience where i could

263
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:04,960
show several of them and i thought about one time that i went on a ropes course

264
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:10,960
i don't know if you've been on one of those there are various ropes and suspended planks and nets and

265
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:16,160
other things meaning uh sort of gaps between platforms and they're all about

266
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:22,960
50 feet up up over the ground right so you're moving on ropes and nets and

267
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:28,240
logs and other things that have been constructed high up and you wear a harness

268
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:33,599
so that you know you can't actually fall but it's it's as if you're

269
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:38,880
climbing around on these things and of course they're constructed so that they swing and sway and they're

270
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:45,680
generally unstable so um i can say that you know the intellectual knowledge that i couldn't

271
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:51,040
fall wasn't very useful to me you know i had the harness on and so i you know

272
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:58,480
suspended securely by a cable but it didn't really help my body's visceral reaction was wow i'm

273
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:04,880
50 feet off the ground i'm i'm afraid of moving on these unstable things but i

274
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:10,079
sort of you know picked my way across a number of these gaps walked along some

275
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:15,280
of the ropes and so forth and you know i used mindfulness to feel

276
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:21,200
okay fear you know i'm not sure about doing this and that

277
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:27,280
was okay i gained some measure of confidence because i actually learned that i could negotiate my way through

278
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,400
this and i could be with the fear and that was fine um but so that you know the the

279
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:39,599
emotional realm and the logical realm were operating but still not completely

280
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:45,040
not completely assuring my my being but what reduced the fear most

281
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:50,400
effectively was when i actually fell off and and then i was caught by the harness

282
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:56,800
and so i knew actually i had a direct experience that i actually wouldn't fall

283
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:04,560
and after that i became much more confident um walking around on the the nets and swaying logs and so forth

284
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:11,040
and interestingly i didn't fall again after that because i somehow had enough confidence

285
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:17,280
that i could actually do it physically so it's interesting experience so maybe

286
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:23,040
you've had something similar you know where you've worried about it thought about it been mindful of the fear but

287
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:28,319
what actually worked was to to do it and have the direct understanding

288
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:34,640
and the buddha's point toward that in more subtle ways in this suta where we um

289
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:41,599
you know we we might talk logically about what we know about the teachings or we might have an emotional feeling

290
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:48,720
about them but in the end when we have a direct understanding in our own body and our own being and it becomes kind of

291
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:54,000
incorporated into how we are somebody once said about visiting their

292
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,079
relatives they they don't like it when i'm a buddhist but they love it when i'm a

293
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:06,000
buddha so maybe this will help in some way

294
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:13,200
so then also just to exercise the you know how we talk about it i'm teaching you from this

295
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:19,520
why am i making these statements from coming from this teaching it's because of a combination of

296
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:25,040
experiential understanding that i know from my years of practice that these

297
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:32,400
teachings do point toward what is true and also out of faith or confidence that the things that i haven't verified yet

298
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,920
for myself are likely also to be true so

299
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:44,640
speaking from a combination of experience and faith and also the fact that i've logically thought through them

300
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:50,000
so i'm preserving or safe regarding the truth by telling you about how i'm

301
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:56,560
relating to the suta and then passing it on to you so i hope that that gives you

302
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:01,760
some sense this list of five ways of knowing i'll repeat them

303
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,800
faith finding something pleasing

304
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:13,680
cultural tradition logical reasoning and reflective acceptance of a view

305
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:20,640
i hope you might consider how it is that you use these five to negotiate your life how it is that you

306
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:28,079
know things that you are confident in doing things and also what things you know directly from your own experience

307
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:33,520
and maybe finding ways to talk about those with other people such that we aren't

308
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:41,359
making declarative statements that aren't backed up by how it is that we know them

309
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:48,400
so hopefully that was interesting um and tomorrow we'll be on to a list of four

310
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:56,079
and so forth down through the week so wishing you very well and see you again

311
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:59,520
