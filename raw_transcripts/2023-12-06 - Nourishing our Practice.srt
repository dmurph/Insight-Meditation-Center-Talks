1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:06,799
so welcome welcome everybody so before I start I have two

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:12,200
announcements but it sounds like that volume is a little bit

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,520
high thank you Jim if we can turn it down there we go thank

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,519
you otherwise I yeah end up doing something weird with my voice if I I

5
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:31,679
feel like the volume is a little bit off two announcements um there will not be a

6
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,760
gathering on December 25th Monday night December 25th we will not have something

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:44,840
here and the next week January 1 I'm going to change the time a little bit

8
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:51,640
I'm going to have a start 15 minutes earlier so at 7:15 and end at

9
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,680
8:30 so the meditation will be 30 minutes It'll be longer I'm sorry

10
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:03,799
shorter and so that uh and then the Dharma talk will be the same 7:15 to

11
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:09,200
8:30 just so the night ends a little bit

12
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,119
earlier so those are my kind of like two announcements I guess we have a few more

13
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:23,520
Mondays with the regular schedule and then January 1 will be the new schedule I'll try to remember to make

14
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:31,079
sure that that's the calendar will be changed I'll try to remember to make sure that the website gets changed too

15
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:38,640
I mean that there's a notice but if you end up showing up at 8 7:30 that'll be okay

16
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:48,240
too okay so today I wanted to talk a little bit about what are some of the supports for

17
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:56,439
practice or what are like some of the fuel for practice or what are some of the nourishments for practice we might

18
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:03,119
say no matter what however we Define practice whether it's uh meditation

19
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:09,879
mindfulness practice or loving kindness practice or concentration practice or

20
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:16,080
practicing with ethical Behavior or practicing generosity and

21
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,360
compassion you know whatever whatever we have as a practice or whatever we Define

22
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:29,440
our practice as the truth is it's not like we always every day all the time

23
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:37,000
feel motivated to do this right of course not we're not machines we're humans but what

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,360
are some of the things that can be a support for us I know sometimes like out

25
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:49,319
there in the greater World they talk about well remember your why like you know why you're doing something okay so

26
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:55,239
that can help but maybe there's a little bit more uh detail or something more

27
00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:01,959
that we can add here and so in the suas there are a a number of things that are a support for

28
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:07,080
practice and it's not formalized as a list instead I kind of like pulled

29
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,879
things out of some other lists and some um other teachings and kind of like I'm

30
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:19,640
gathering them here today just to something that might be a resource or something to think about like what is

31
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:25,560
the most meaningful for you like maybe there's something I'm going to talk about that really will be a support for

32
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:33,519
your practice you know maybe not all of them will be maybe you'll feel inspired or motivated and maybe you won't but the

33
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,760
objective is I just wanted to offer something to

34
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:47,680
consider so one thing that's kind of interesting to this like some of these supports to practice are often related

35
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,599
to what brought us to the practice to begin with in some ways this is kind of like

36
00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:00,560
you know remembering your why like why are you doing this

37
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,720
but there's something um the reasons that bring us to the path are very often

38
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:12,799
kind of like smaller they're like a they're not as uh vibrant they're not as

39
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:19,079
compelling they're not as provocative as what supports us or as what propels us

40
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:26,120
on the path and I'd like to talk about that a little bit more but because part of what

41
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:35,160
uh really supports practice is connected to maybe some like some deep um deep

42
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:42,840
longings or deep questions that we have that we might not even know that we have

43
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:48,759
until after some practice maybe there's a way in which we start to maybe see

44
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:54,080
some benefits or we notice that as the mind starts to settle down it touches

45
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:00,720
into some other things that uh we didn't even know were there or

46
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,039
there's a way that uh that something that's maybe deep or really inside of us

47
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:14,120
can be your support for practice and um maybe there's this way

48
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:21,319
also of kind of practice is uh this o o opening up of what's

49
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:27,919
possible maybe we used to think like okay yeah I'm going to start meditation because I'm a person who has a lot of

50
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:35,280
anxiety I'm just going to bring this up but then as we start to practice we start to realize oh yes I have anxiety

51
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:43,520
but yes I have care for other people and yes uh I also have some warmth and I'm

52
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,680
able to develop that or so our ideas about our s

53
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:54,240
grows and also our ideas about what the practice can offer

54
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,960
grows so with that as an introduction I'll introduce uh one of these first uh

55
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:09,400
qualities the poly word is svea and it's often translated as a sense of urgency

56
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:16,479
like a sense of yeah this is something I really want to do and I'm going to get with it I'm going to do

57
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:22,720
this and some of you might know maybe all of you know about this story of the

58
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:29,080
Buddha when he the Buddha to be before he was the Buddha when he was just like

59
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,400
us that he was uh he encountered after having this opulent

60
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:41,680
lifestyle filled with you know every Pleasures known at that time he

61
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:49,639
encountered sickness old age and death which because uh just the circumstances

62
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:55,199
of his life that they had been pretty much sheltered from maybe in some of the

63
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,280
ways in which we often are sheltered from this sickness and death death right

64
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:06,240
often that we don't have encountering dead people or dying people unless there

65
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,800
are immediate family or something like this right it's not something that's really part of a popular

66
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:17,560
culture so the Buddha to be that we would call him a Buddha SATA at this

67
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:24,080
time before he's a Buddha he encounters old age sickness and death it's like wow

68
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:30,160
this is awful is there a way that we can get around this

69
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:36,720
I don't want this and of course isn't it's one of the

70
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,199
truths about uh The Human Experience and so this is what spurred

71
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:48,520
him on to practice some of you might know that he left his life as the palace

72
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,639
he lived in and became an aesthetic he went from one extreme to the other and

73
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:59,120
practiced for many years before becoming awakened but whether for us it might be

74
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,720
some something like sickness old age and death but maybe there's something that

75
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:11,159
there's a tragedy in our life or a loss in our life could be with health or a

76
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:17,680
loss of a loved one or of a relationship or whatever it might be some sense of

77
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:24,039
real deep uh grief and sense of loss and maybe we start to feel disoriented and

78
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:31,000
losing the meaning that we had of our life or what we thought what a good life should have or how am I going to make my

79
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,518
life work now that there's been this tragedy or loss so there's a sense of like okay

80
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:45,080
well I think uh a spiritual practice might you know be a support for

81
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,360
this or maybe even the loss isn't something about health or relationship

82
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:56,240
maybe it's something about an existential crisis something about what

83
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:03,079
is life about is this all there is is is is there anything more I thought

84
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:08,480
it was going to be better here I am at this age and what you know it's still so

85
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,360
much work or I I don't know there's so many different ways that we might think about this what comes to my mind right

86
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:22,079
there's a reason why people in the middle of their life buy sports cars or you know do

87
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:27,839
something different is because they're thinking like yeah I I was kind of hoping there'd be something

88
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:33,399
more so maybe sense of urgency is maybe that's not a good

89
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:40,680
translation but this sense of this wish for more and and a maybe a belief that

90
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:47,440
there can be more it's got to be something richer or Fuller or more

91
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:54,839
satisfying some Vega and so ton taniku he uh has this

92
00:09:54,839 --> 00:10:00,920
definition for s Vega that he says it's this sense of

93
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:09,120
dismay or a sense of alienation that comes with realizing like is this really what life is about

94
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,240
and then coupled with that is this maybe a sense of

95
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:21,360
uh complacency or foolishness like oh I've been following this path I've been

96
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:29,120
organizing this my life in a way that um my community Society supports but it

97
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,360
didn't lead to where I thought it was I followed all the rules I you know did

98
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:42,720
what Society expected of me and yet my life isn't turning out the way that I thought so some Vega sometimes this

99
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:49,240
sense of urgency Chanda this this another poly

100
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:56,399
word often gets translated as enthusiasm or Zeal I like this word zeal enthusiasm

101
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:02,720
a good word too but um it comes from that's one off not this

102
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:09,959
isn't the only place it gets described but uh in one of the sutas it it's described as

103
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:15,120
um uh the Buddha is instructing like okay how can you find a way to freedom

104
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,079
to nibana to Awakening and he gives this long

105
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:28,680
detailed list of steps you can do and it starts with um finding what you think somebody who

106
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:35,360
you think think could be a teacher and evaluating them do they have

107
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,000
qualities or do they behave in such a way that seems to like promote a sense

108
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,760
of greed hatred and delusion if so they're not a good teacher but do they

109
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:52,639
seem to not be promoting greed hatred and delusion then they could be a good

110
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,720
teacher so this real thing you know don't believe everybody but to evaluate

111
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:04,320
them and to and gives particular criteria and you're welcome to do that with me do I have greed hatred and

112
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:10,160
delusion I'm not perfect right I'm not a completely awakened person

113
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:16,560
but so then they said that okay so if you find that there's somebody that is

114
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,639
not promoting greet hatred and delusion then um go to listen to their teachings

115
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:29,480
and reflect on their meaning and only accept them after consideration so not

116
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:35,959
only just believe everything the teacher says but to reflect on them and uh

117
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:42,240
accept them after consideration and then they says here

118
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:49,480
that's just natural that some enthusiasm or some Zeal Springs up that like this like okay I hear somebody who's talking

119
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:55,320
about something that makes sense to me I think there's a um a willingness to

120
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:02,320
engage with the teachings willingness to um um put them into practice to try them

121
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:09,320
out right easo was like this key teaching come and see and so part of

122
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:16,760
this the teacher is like well come and see here's uh what the teachings are and so this enthusias I'm like okay I don't

123
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:24,160
have to just believe it and you know just do what's being told to me but there's a way um I want to try this out

124
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:30,560
I do want to see for myself what's being described so maybe there's a way that

125
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,160
something just make makes sense to us by what the teacher is saying like oh yeah

126
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,959
and I'll say for me personally when I first heard the four noble truths which

127
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:48,560
was very surprisingly was during a yoga class I didn't wasn't seeking some

128
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:55,160
Dharma teachings they were in at my view at the time they were uh what's the word like

129
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:00,680
they were like forced on me they were push put on me I thought I was going to be taken yoga class they were this

130
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:05,839
little Dharma talk got put in there but wow when they talked about the formable

131
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:12,279
truth like there is suffering there is a cause of suffering and there's the ending of suffering and

132
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:18,360
a way to the end of suffering it meant a lot to me it meant like oh yeah this is

133
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:25,240
something I really want to pursue to look at and explore and for me that was

134
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,600
uh I had some real enthusiasm and Zeal from what I had heard I didn't really know that teacher didn't have an

135
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:37,279
opportunity really to examine or investigate them but uh that just that's

136
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:43,040
hearing something that made sense to me kind of had this Zeal show up so maybe

137
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:51,600
that's something also that can be a support maybe there is a um a way

138
00:14:51,600 --> 00:15:00,680
that you can keep in like what what brought you to the practice and maybe even like some of the deeper

139
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:08,440
aspects of it can be a support for practice to touch into that here's a a third thing that can be

140
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:15,880
a support for practice the poly word is do this means a like Vision or seeing I

141
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:22,199
guess literally would be seeing sometimes translated as Vision but more

142
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:27,279
specifically this Vision or scene of what's

143
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:35,839
possible it's Not Unusual for people to maybe when they were younger or maybe

144
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:42,600
even just recently they had a sense of what is possible sometimes this is they

145
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:50,639
have an extreme experience tragedy or um like near

146
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:56,399
drowning or you know something like this heard of this or some uh real

147
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:03,759
severe uh accidents or psychedelics let's be honest some

148
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:09,399
people do psychedelics and this practice was started you know it's not an

149
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:15,600
accident that the the founder people who brought this back from Asia I think the

150
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,880
reason why they went to Asia back in the 60s is because they had their own psychedelic

151
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:27,440
experiences so there's people who have this touch into this view or this idea

152
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:34,519
like oh there's more to this world there's something else and they want to do a meditation practice as a way to

153
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:40,240
touch into or see or experience that again or maybe

154
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:46,360
sometimes there's people who have meditative experiences that they try to you know

155
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:51,880
touch into before I I this is very very common

156
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,920
people like oh yeah there was that time that it was so Blissful and happy okay I

157
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:02,959
got to do it again and I was let's see what shirt was I wearing when I did that and what breakfast did I have and you

158
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:10,600
know we'll do everything we can and I have certainly done my share that too trying to like recreate some

159
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:17,798
fabulous experiences which by the way never works just but you won't know that until

160
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:24,240
you try it so it doesn't matter that I said this because what happens right as soon as we enter this we do this like oh

161
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,320
I want this again just that wanting is prevents it from happening

162
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:36,679
so just a heads up about that not to be disappointed if uh you don't immediately

163
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:44,160
have those experiences again in fact I think uh I heard this as a dermat talk um I

164
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,360
can see the name of the Dharma teacher his name now just right left

165
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:56,640
my um Steve Armstrong I heard him say this one time he said uh during a

166
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:03,600
Meditation Retreat he said there's nothing that ruins your whole day more

167
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:09,240
than a really good sit first thing in the morning because then you're does you

168
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:14,919
know try to have it again or something like this so but dos this vision of

169
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:20,919
what's possible and wanting to maybe like oh yeah even knowing that there's a

170
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:27,200
different way of viewing or experiencing the world or

171
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:36,280
just having a really Pleasant peaceful expansive spacious experience where the suffering is um

172
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:42,480
drifted away and and it is true there are Bliss states too and so maybe you've

173
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:48,159
had something like that I've had like just tears of happiness this usually

174
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:53,520
arises more on the longer Retreats when you have time to really sink in but

175
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:59,400
that's was quite something to just feeling like yeah just just tears just

176
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:06,360
lots and just so beautiful nothing but tears so daana is another thing that

177
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,520
might be a support for

178
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:21,840
practice and so another one is this poly word niida and this often gets translated as

179
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:27,240
disenchantment and sometimes when uh people hear some Buddhist teacher talking about

180
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:33,760
disenchantment then what they kind of hear is like discouragement but it's not about

181
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:41,520
discouragement at all in fact it um it follows it's in this liberative

182
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:50,280
dependent arising in this uh stepwise um list of Freedom it

183
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:56,039
follows um Sam which is a kind of like a collectedness of the mind and a

184
00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:03,039
settledness of the Mind that after Sam is seeing things as they

185
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:09,159
are yatana and then uh then there's this

186
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:18,200
niida this disenchantment so seeing things as they are that leads to this

187
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:26,159
disenchantment so this is what's um being pointed to is that we see things

188
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:36,200
that don't bring us the happiness that we thought they were going to bring that uh seeing things

189
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:43,679
that as soon everything will be I'll be happy as soon as I get this as soon as I graduate as soon

190
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:49,919
as I get promoted as soon as I get that better job have the perfect relationship as soon as my partner stops doing this

191
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:55,159
soon as my partner starts doing this you know these types of things

192
00:20:55,159 --> 00:21:02,200
right and then we real well then maybe maybe some of those things actually do happen maybe we do graduate get a job

193
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:07,320
our partner changes we change lose weight whatever it is maybe those things

194
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:14,640
happen and then we realize oh I'm not as happy as I thought I was

195
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:22,120
going to be right this is very this isn't an uncommon thing we

196
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:27,360
have uh very powerful Industries to

197
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:33,400
enchant us right advertising right Madison Avenue right is all about

198
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:39,120
telling us you'll be happy buy this look like that do

199
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:46,240
this or now we have uh you know these little electronic computers that we carry in our pockets like who who cares

200
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,600
if you're not happy here distract yourself this will be your you know something that'll make you happy happy

201
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:58,640
enough or something like this so a disenchantment is this no longer

202
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:06,080
believing oh yeah this really isn't going to be a lasting source of Happiness like I thought it

203
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:14,799
was so it's like no longer being Under This Spell you're no longer Enchanted by no

204
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:20,080
longer Under This Spell of believing that something else is is going to solve

205
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:26,960
all your problems something in the future cuz that sets up this seeking

206
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,039
mind everything everything's going to be better

207
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:39,159
later so something's going to be different later and then there's a way in which we

208
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:44,679
can just create our life is all about seeking whereas this practice is

209
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:50,000
pointing to no it's about kind of like finding here in this moment this

210
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:57,120
experience so disenchantment is maybe also kind of like the way that we not no

211
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:03,440
not only are we um no longer Under This Spell but maybe there's a way in which we kind of like

212
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:10,559
outgrow some ideas to in the same way that a snake that

213
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:16,880
grows its skin sheds its skin as it's growing maybe we like shed some

214
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:23,720
enchantments as uh our practice grows and

215
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:29,880
matures maybe no longer thinking that just pursuing pleasure just you know a

216
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:35,159
measure of our life is how many pleasurable experiences we can have or

217
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:41,000
chasing status or more and more money and it's often the case

218
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,840
that we it's not until we have a little bit of something um maybe we do get a

219
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:54,240
little bit more money compared to earlier in life or maybe you know we have a little bit more status or

220
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,360
whatever it is a little bit more pleasure it's often not until until we've achieved or attained some of these

221
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:05,640
things that we actually realize oh that didn't make me as happy it wasn't as

222
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:12,400
satisfying as I thought it was going to be or maybe even this idea of the kind

223
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,720
of like the other side of maybe there's just realizing that

224
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:22,799
worrying something doesn't actually help

225
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:28,520
and it uh makes us feel kind of awful this you know this little bit of anxiety

226
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:34,720
so no longer Under This Spell of thinking that worrying or

227
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,440
um yeah nagging ourselves or nagging others or something like

228
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:47,760
that so niida disenchantment something that this can

229
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:53,039
be a support for practice is realizing you know what all these other things

230
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:59,840
aren't what I thought they were going to be maybe there's this practice is something that can really support this

231
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:10,158
greater sense of well-being and freedom and another one is

232
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,520
compassion poly can be karuna and or

233
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,960
anukampa so compassion is this we this wish that we want to do something for

234
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:28,640
the world we see all this suffering and we want to do something

235
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:37,320
to end the suffering whether it's in ourselves or others one way to that compassion gets

236
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:43,000
described as it's this uh warm heart this loving heart this

237
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:51,919
uh loving kindness this respect warmth care that uh kind of like radiates

238
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:57,039
out and when it's radiating out it it encounters people who are having

239
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:03,799
difficulties of course it does CU there's a lot of people having difficulties including

240
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:09,240
ourselves and so this kind of like this kindness this

241
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:14,440
warm-heartedness when it meets difficulties it turns into compassion so

242
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:22,360
it's this uh born out of uh warmth and it's a wish for suffering to

243
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:30,679
end it's so that's compassion coruna and un PPA it's also kind of related to this

244
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:36,240
idea of this urge to maybe understand suffering is

245
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:42,480
stronger than this urge to just always avoid it maybe he's like what what's going on

246
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,760
here that's underneath the suffering so that I can really help

247
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,880
alleviate it for others and for

248
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:58,919
ourselves for some people this can be a real you know driver for

249
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:05,360
practice you know this is scene like it doesn't right it's it's uh we see it all

250
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,640
the time it's not like it's hidden on the difficulties of the world right

251
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:18,720
there's a whole another industry that's Mak sure that we can see all the suffering that everybody's having right the media industry is all about this

252
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:25,720
too highlighting everything that's awful maybe I should be a little more

253
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,919
kind in my ass test but sometimes it feels like

254
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:39,480
this so here's a um a short verse that kind of like um talks about also this is

255
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:45,559
the Buddha before he was awakened there's a verse that describes something

256
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:51,200
like what happened when um he was encountering some

257
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:58,039
suffering so this is written um in the first person so again this is the Buddha before he was awake

258
00:27:58,039 --> 00:28:03,480
when he was at buddhis SATA just look at people and their

259
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:09,039
quarrels I will speak of my dismay and the way that I was shaken seeing people

260
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:15,760
thrashing about like fish and little water seeing them in conflict with each

261
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:22,320
other I became afraid I felt discontent at seeing only

262
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:30,760
conflict to the very end then I saw an Arrow here hard to see

263
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:36,240
embedded in the heart pierced by this Arrow people Dash

264
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,480
about in all directions but when the arrows pulled

265
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:49,240
out they don't run and they don't sink so he was seeing difficulties out

266
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:54,559
there like conflict everybody was had and he was shaking feeling

267
00:28:54,559 --> 00:29:02,880
uncomfortable and this kind of and he said I felt discontent then I saw an arrow here in

268
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:09,720
the heart kind like noticing okay there's what in his heart is is what he

269
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:15,240
has is what other people have and was kind of like underline this this content

270
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:22,080
this conflict this suffering so in some ways this is kind of like about compassion too like

271
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:29,080
feeling seeing the difficulties and this wish to the difficulties to end and part

272
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:35,200
of that way that difficulties end is that we see how we are contributing like

273
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,840
how does what how we are help us understand how humans are in

274
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:47,760
general and maybe there's something if we can show up in a different way then

275
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:54,399
other people can be touched by that they are touched by that we all know this when we've been

276
00:29:54,399 --> 00:30:00,200
around somebody who has some calm or ease or

277
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:05,679
warm-heartedness when there's a lot of difficulties it makes a difference it

278
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:12,720
does make a difference even in small ways and maybe I'll just share there was

279
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:20,320
a time earli in my practice when I was a chaplain at uh San Francisco General

280
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:27,279
Hospital those of you who don't know like San Francisco General is like a county hospital there's like this is where there's a lot of suffering there

281
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:35,760
I'll just say that there's a lot of suffering and um it was quite something for me to you know show up in hospital

282
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:42,279
rooms um you know wanting to just you know really kind of my role as a chapen was

283
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:47,760
just to provide an ear for people who wanted to talk it's hard when you're in

284
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:55,000
the hospital and uh I was in part of my training to be CH and I uh appreciated

285
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:02,159
so much what one person said said sometimes your job is to just get thrown

286
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:07,799
out of the room because they can't throw anybody out these poor people right they're

287
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:14,440
getting woken up in the middle of the night here let's take your temperature let's take some blood or you know all these things they don't get any control

288
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:20,000
out of this but at least the chaplain they they can throw out the room and

289
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:27,440
they can feel like they have some agency and St so I I kind of liked that too look like not like I had to provide

290
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:35,200
anything in particular necessarily but just this idea of you know wanting to alleviate suffering for

291
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:42,880
others and maybe there's all kinds of different ways that it's supports practice but for me when I wasn't thrown

292
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:49,480
out of the room you know it was a practice to be able to uh stay steady

293
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:54,720
and balanced with uh encountering

294
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,799
really the type of suffering that I hadn't seen in my kind of life you know

295
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:05,960
some of these people didn't have homes they you know had uh

296
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:13,799
addictions and they had uh mental illness and was you know just a lot of

297
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:19,240
suffering and so for me that really supported me like okay I wanted to be

298
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:26,279
able to show up with warmth and openness and spaciousness that required that I

299
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:31,799
like I had meditation practice to touch into some of the Stillness and touch

300
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:37,960
into some equinity so here are some of these

301
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:44,279
things I just wanted to offer kind of like this list of things as support for practice this isn't like a usual list

302
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:51,159
but maybe there was something here that can support you like as a nourishment for

303
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:57,080
practice so the this list let's say I started with a some Vaga this sense of

304
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:03,440
of urgency then Chanda enthusiasm or Zeal

305
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:09,480
often after hearing teachings and the sense of urgency is um

306
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:16,960
often when there's a tragedy or loss a vision of what's possible do

307
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:23,880
having touched into or seen or sensed I remember um in some practice discussion

308
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:30,919
I was saying to the teacher when I was on a retreat yeah I can like smell that there's more

309
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:37,080
freedom available like I just had this sense dos is a literally seen but

310
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:44,519
there's a way like we can feel like yeah I can see how this direction of the Mind

311
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:51,000
settling down and the heart and mind opening can continue even though I don't

312
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:59,120
quite maybe haven't experienced it I have this sense that it's available so I could be

313
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:05,320
do and then Nia this uh disenchantment maybe it's like well all

314
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:13,000
the things that I thought was going to make me happy or was going to work didn't so maybe this is something I'm going to

315
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,200
do here and this um I should say this

316
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:27,480
disenchantment um is comes right after that is a Vaga which is um

317
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:35,760
like no longer saying through colored lenses or a way of um sometimes it gets

318
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:42,520
translated as a yeah actually I'm not going to go down that route I'll just say

319
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:47,720
disenchantment no longer being under the spell of

320
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:55,158
things and then compassion on compa or karuna you know this wish to each each

321
00:34:55,159 --> 00:35:01,640
suffering again suffering of others or ourselves those are some of the things

322
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:06,760
that can be a nourishment for practice that can help support our

323
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:14,520
practice and you'll notice that the things that I described here that are things that are often just arise

324
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:19,599
naturally through our life experiences and sometimes we might be

325
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:26,000
dismissive of them but just noticing some of these things that arise and

326
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:34,200
maybe we can bring mind as a support for practice so I'll end there and open it

327
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:41,400
up and see if there are any some questions or comments about what I shared

328
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,759
tonight could you please read the arrow poem

329
00:35:54,359 --> 00:36:00,480
again yeah I'll just say for

330
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:06,440
um this is my own translation so you'll find if you look at it you'll find something a little bit different this is

331
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:11,760
just suan Napata 4:15 just look at people and their

332
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:18,920
quarels I will speak of my dismay and the way that I was shaking shaken seeing

333
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:25,240
people thrashing about like fish in little water seeing them in conflict with each

334
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:31,920
other I became a afraid I felt discontent at seeing only conflict to

335
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:39,119
the very end then I saw an arrow here hard to see

336
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:44,520
embedded in the heart pierced by this Arrow people Dash

337
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:53,280
about in all directions when the arrow is pulled out they don't run and they don't

338
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:59,319
sink I've kind of like this idea of people dashed about in all all directions right this is what we do like

339
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:05,359
fish in little water right we when there's difficulties we kind of flail

340
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:12,760
around and dash about you know maybe it's not the most smooth or elegant that

341
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:18,599
we can be from

342
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:26,280
act yeah theas yes but this was before he was the Buddha but it's in the suas

343
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:31,359
it's suata 415 yeah but before he was

344
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:36,920
awakened anybody else have a comment or

345
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:44,880
question um the poem really strikes a chord for

346
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:52,119
me right now um it's it's actually kind of uh crazy what a synchronicity this is

347
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:59,319
because um I uh got involved in labor organizing a few years ago and was kind

348
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:06,000
of processing my experience with a friend recently and said like you know it was like an arrow went through my

349
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,000
heart when I started engaging in organizing um and you know it's it's

350
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,319
been a big experience and a big chapter of my life but um got myself into some

351
00:38:18,319 --> 00:38:25,359
uh novice trouble with I think anybody who's engaged in organizing probably

352
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:30,960
knows how complicated and and difficult and at times um you know I would even

353
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:37,880
say traumatizing organizational change can can be um but since I've started

354
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:45,079
coming to IMC and and practicing and going to therapy and doing these things for for personal growth it is kind of

355
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:52,160
like I can just rest in solidarity with others and and bring that kind of like

356
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:57,200
warm expansiveness into spaces like that that that you were describing so

357
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:02,640
um yeah I'm grateful to IMC and thank you for sharing the poem fantastic

358
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:08,599
fantastic thank you for sharing that that's really great I love to hear that thank you thank

359
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,800
you um since in the quote he does

360
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:27,920
mention that he saw the arrow and when the arrows moved you know people don't think he

361
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:34,040
says the so is it fair to assess that the Buddha already had some level of

362
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:42,200
attainment when he said this because he was not enlightened but he was still saying something pretty insightful right so is it is that

363
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:49,319
coming from such a place it doesn't feel like a na is saying it right so but he was saying it before he was enlightened and it still strikes a chord as powerful

364
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:56,680
as something that he would say after you know the point I'm making so it feels like so is he have some level

365
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:03,079
of attainment is he yeah it feels like because he's not enlightened but it really strikes a chord for me still like all the other sutas I'm like boom it's

366
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:09,599
like a bomb okay I get it here he's not enlightened and still really powerful so that difference is kind of jarring for

367
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:16,839
me yeah yeah yeah you know um the context of this poem is never said in

368
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:23,440
the sutas it's it's part of a collection of poems that none of the poems have

369
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:30,319
their context stated wait so yeah that's right

370
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:36,440
so I don't know I can't answer that question but I think uh all of us can relate to this though right that where

371
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:43,640
we do see this arrows in our heart I I gave a dermat talk on this uh um on this

372
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:50,200
um poem maybe I'll kind of dig that up and uh kind of Flesh it out and do

373
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:56,160
something again yeah feels feels Noddy in his head yeah cuz I love this one too

374
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:03,040
it's it's really it's a really powerful one just as you said yeah yeah yeah for some reason uh when you said that the

375
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:08,520
image of uh a crosswalk in New York showed up you know in crosswalk where

376
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:13,560
people are running heless culture in New York like a New York mindset yeah and everybody struggles with it but the

377
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:17,720
image of that sort of came up you know

378
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:25,240
yeah okay are there any more comments yes can

379
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:32,520
put evening so I want to Circle back to the

380
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:38,640
poem again I guess we never left it so no need to Circle back but so the fish in little water I'm sort of picturing

381
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:44,440
like a a fish that's been flung into the bottom of the boat or something it's like it's flailing around trying to get

382
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:50,040
find bigger water somewhere I don't know where that leads

383
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:56,000
but when you say the he sees the arrow here and you point to your chest and

384
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:04,119
that's not the image that came to me at all I just thought like oh there's an image on the there's an arrow on the ground or didn't seem like it was

385
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:11,920
necessarily so the line is then I saw an arrow here hard to see embedded in the

386
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:19,839
heart H okay so that's that's why I was getting this embedded in the

387
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:25,440
heart okay is that helpful and well when

388
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:31,160
people have the Arrow removed they neither sink nor what is it rise

389
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:36,559
or pierced by this Arrow people Dash about in all directions when their

390
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:41,760
arrows pulled out they don't run and they don't sink so Dash about in all

391
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:49,839
directions when they have it but when they don't have it they don't run and they don't sink yeah so sink for me this

392
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:57,240
brings like you know you uh cross over to yeah maybe I'm getting

393
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:02,559
um you know there's this idea that uh you're on the near shore where there's all the difficulties and then there's

394
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:09,920
the farshore where there's no difficulties and then there's water in between and so you don't sink means that

395
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:16,119
you can get across to the other Shore yes

396
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:22,839
okay but do you want to say more about the fish thrashing about you were thinking that it was in a boat so like

397
00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:28,520
somebody well that or it's maybe the Maybe um the flood waters have receded

398
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:34,119
and now it's where it's trapped it's yeah it's

399
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:39,200
doomed ultimately whatever and they flop around they try to yeah go into search

400
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:45,640
mode they're looking for anything to escape yeah maybe there's a certain chaos too

401
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:52,000
right it's not like they're organized flopping like okay I'm going to go there right they're just uh it's random Walk

402
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,079
So Random walk nice nice

403
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:09,440
okay oh one last com changing the hours in January January will start 15 minutes

404
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:15,119
earlier and end at 8:30 so 7:15 to

405
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:21,880
8:30 how long meditation 30 minute meditation instead of

406
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:28,680
45 thank you no don't for 45 you can come earlier

407
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:35,920
I was thinking to myself if it were up to me or it is up to me actually but I was think that I think about it right

408
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:43,480
tell you i' like to do like an hour sit but I don't think anybody will come to that I was thinking like oh maybe I'll

409
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:50,720
come early you know at 7 and start sitting at 7 so I could still have 45 minutes so I don't know can we go back

410
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:56,680
to it in the spring having a longer sit yeah that's a good idea

411
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:03,359
I can't promise anything but uh I I think yeah yes back to

412
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:08,800
yes could you get the mic oh yeah yeah can we have the the

413
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:17,319
mic um so when when you recite

414
00:45:17,319 --> 00:45:24,680
it one is that we running around with the arrows and then the thrashing fish so

415
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:30,559
they can of like headless chicken to me um can you hear me

416
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:36,359
now she was just talking about uh fish thrashing about people when they have

417
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:41,760
the arrow or dashing about kind of like chickens without their heads kind of

418
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:47,640
this similar yeah and it's very interesting that you you pointed to the

419
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:55,480
distance between um a very active turbulent Place versus one that is not

420
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:02,240
but I think I kept wondering how does one get the arrow out it's like a torn right you take the torn out and there's

421
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:07,640
relief yeah and I was curious about that so like how one gets the yeah and I

422
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:15,599
would say that's what practice is about so our meditation practice Ling kindness practice generosity ethical behavior all

423
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:21,760
this kind of stuff takes the thorn out then our whole mind might just starts to

424
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:27,800
settle down thank you you're welcome

425
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:35,280
okay so that's to end this evening so I wish you all a safe travels home and a

426
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:41,720
lovely rest of the evening thank you and if you'd like you're welcome to

427
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:47,920
come up here and ask some questions or say something more
