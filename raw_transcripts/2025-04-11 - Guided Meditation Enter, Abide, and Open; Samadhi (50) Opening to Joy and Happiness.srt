1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:13,040
if you look there underneath that tree the closest tree branch there's a little little in

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:19,880
the picture here for me but a very big white egret that's up in the grass

3
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:26,359
hunting for something and that egret's been living here at Spirit Rock

4
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:34,480
for for um some for a year or so so it's well

5
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:41,320
known it's been given a name and uh yesterday it was

6
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,559
about right next to where I'm staying here so maybe it'll come into the

7
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,878
picture later

8
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:34,040
someone asked for the name uh the is called Paul

9
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:44,360
so hello everyone and welcome to Spirit Rock Spirit Rock Hillside that is

10
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:52,319
um and I think uh behind me uh in this direction is up

11
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,360
in the hills there is the Spirit Rock meditation the actual meditation hall

12
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:04,080
from where I'm teaching a retreat today this this week and uh one of the ways

13
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:11,200
that Spirit Rock is designed is that um uh you have to be outdoors to go between

14
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,560
almost anything and so there's a constant going outdoors and experiencing

15
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:23,159
the land the sky the weather the turkeys

16
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:28,239
the different animal yesterday there was a beautiful day before yesterday there

17
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:36,000
was a really beautiful healthy looking coyote stalking the hillsides up here

18
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,159
and uh and now I showed some of you there was this white egret that's been

19
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:48,680
here so uh welcome and for the meditation today

20
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:55,440
um and on continuing the exploration of samadei

21
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:02,000
uh the descriptions of the janna each of them has a is different but they all

22
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:11,720
contain a similar wording and that is one enters and abides in these states of

23
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:17,040
being and so this idea of it's entering it's not staying apart it's not staying

24
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,360
up in the head looking down but it's dipping into it's entering um and one

25
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,800
way from that I understand this or helps to understand it it's entering into an embodied

26
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:35,040
state but an embodied state that is not

27
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:43,840
exactly our physical body but rather the the sensations in the body that are born

28
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:50,240
from the meditation from being settled from being connected

29
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:57,600
being unified calm clear just as if you get angry you can

30
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:05,360
feel new body sensations in your body and if you enter those difficult sensations maybe you'll be more angry

31
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,840
so when we start getting kind of more and more involved with meditation then

32
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:18,680
there are these uh samadei sensations that we can enter

33
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:26,800
in abide in which I take to be rest in enter and rest in them so this resting

34
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:36,080
is very different than pushing or wanting more or trying to have something happen um it's closer to enter and be in

35
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:43,400
them a kind of sense of beingness resting in them um abiding in

36
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:49,360
them and then one more step that uh is not in exactly in the text but it's my

37
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,919
interpretation of the classic instructions and that is to

38
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:03,039
open to some of these sensations direct experiences that come

39
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,120
with meditation that have to do with u

40
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:14,800
well-being joy happiness uh delight contentment

41
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,600
and um open to it so that it seems to have more space in the body so there

42
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,400
it's an embodied opening so we enter into the maybe very

43
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:33,319
subtle at first sensations that seem connected or associated with

44
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:39,680
meditation and rest in them and open for them to become more expansive to open up

45
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:46,120
to spread throughout their whole being so to

46
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:55,440
enter abide and open so assuming a meditation

47
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:59,039
posture

48
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:10,199
and and I recommend that you close your eyes

49
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:19,680
and with your eyes closed to feel and

50
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:30,960
sense maybe some of the leftover or

51
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:39,120
associated experience of feelings of delight or awe or openness in seeing the

52
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,960
hillside sides in the sky behind

53
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,720
me if that somehow had an influence on your body

54
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,280
your heart your mind let that be

55
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:06,400
there however subtle it is and the art of entering into

56
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:14,960
it and if it just simply assuming your meditation posture if it's

57
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:21,160
familiar there there's a contentment there is

58
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:27,360
a familiarity there's a

59
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:33,560
relief there's a lot of some kind of good feelings that can

60
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:40,279
be assuming our meditation posture feel those in the

61
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:44,479
body and enter into

62
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,880
them or lower yourself into them in the

63
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:58,880
body rather than associating yourself with the efforts and the

64
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:05,040
choices and the strivings of the mind the brain up in the head up in the

65
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:12,519
control tower drop down into the

66
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:19,640
body into the middle maybe like it's a

67
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:25,040
lake of whatever subtle small

68
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:30,360
mild good feelings there might be

69
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,519
and if it's uh accessible in the middle of that

70
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:51,839
or deeper deeper underneath it or around it become aware of your body

71
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:04,160
breathing aware of the expansion and contraction of your torso as you

72
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,440
breathe and that the impulse to breathe

73
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:24,519
in is inside the breathing itself the breathing body

74
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,000
enter into your breathing to feel that impulse

75
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,079
the movement the expansion of breathing in

76
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:55,320
as you exhale let that be a settling into your

77
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:02,200
body entering your body like you would enter a refreshing

78
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,680
lake to the water

79
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:26,800
as you exhale relaxing any tension or pressure in the thinking

80
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:44,240
mind letting go of your thinking

81
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,279
and doing so by letting go

82
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:58,440
into whatever good feelings there are in your body even if you

83
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:05,040
feel off or feel uncomfortable anywhere in your body

84
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:12,519
for now see if you can drop yourself into that which is pleasant

85
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,760
with a very modest idea of what that

86
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,880
is breathing

87
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:31,800
naturally maybe some point in the cycle of [Music]

88
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:45,928
breathing there's something pleasant [Music]

89
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,440
Enter and abide in

90
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,709
[Music]

91
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:22,920
[Music] and if in the course of this meditation you get pulled into your

92
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:29,760
thoughts notice how that might be pulling you away from an

93
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:38,720
intimacy of your body and those sensations wholesome sensations of just

94
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:46,880
sitting here let go of your thoughts and allow yourself to enter

95
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:56,560
settle into the pleasant enjoyable

96
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:06,560
sensations abide in those as you breathe breathing through it with it around

97
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:15,059
[Music]

98
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:23,680
it and open the body open the heart

99
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:30,880
open up so that the pleasant sensations the

100
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:37,839
good feelings the joy can spread through your

101
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:06,240
Buddy in these three steps rest enter abide and open

102
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:13,240
done very very gently kindly

103
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:19,160
softly as if you have all the time in the world

104
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,839
at each

105
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:31,040
step encouraging the thinking mind to be

106
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:38,959
quieter letting go of thoughts in

107
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,519
favor of a more intimate

108
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:57,800
Connection to the goodness of this moment in your body

109
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:04,759
enter abide and open

110
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:13,440
maybe an opening of all your senses nothing left

111
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:23,000
out but you abiding at the center of it

112
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:32,600
all abiding in the center of all the well-being that's available

113
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,679
letting it spread through your body

114
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:15,579
[Music]

115
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,950
[Music]

116
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:41,320
and if during the time of this

117
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:47,840
meditation your body feels more subtle more calm

118
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:57,840
If you feel a greater contentment or ease in any

119
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:06,039
way if there's a joy

120
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:14,799
enjoyment in your body of meditating however small it might be

121
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:25,000
Enter into it drop into the embodied experience of

122
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:34,440
it letting your body feel it sense it more fully

123
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:48,880
abide in it rest in whatever good feelings wholesome

124
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,600
feelings there are sitting here

125
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:09,240
meditating and open to those feelings

126
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:18,480
open beyond the edges of him so they either expand

127
00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:26,840
spread or so that there's no

128
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:35,080
boundaries no edges to the good feelings

129
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:45,960
enter abide open

130
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:14,619
[Music]

131
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:33,240
and then opening your body your heart your

132
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,279
mind beyond your meditation beyond where you

133
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:43,320
are out across the lands

134
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:54,600
cross the hillsides the forest the trees the oceans the lakes the skies the

135
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:01,720
clouds and allow your good will

136
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:09,080
allow a kind of inner seeing that sees all

137
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:19,080
things with kindness with [Music]

138
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:26,120
care a care where we want to care for what cares for us

139
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:33,799
so much on this earth is constantly caring for

140
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:40,080
us providing oxygen food

141
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:50,120
may it be that the way the purpose the

142
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:56,200
dedication of regular meditation practice

143
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:03,720
is to contribute to a better world starting with

144
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:09,120
ourselves that brings forth a better us

145

00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:57,039
free thank you and with this bow I we

152
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:00,518
end this meditation

153
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:30,349
[Music]

154
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:51,840
so welcome to our next talk on samadei on the last

155
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:57,440
talk on the second Janna and

156
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:04,559
um most people who experience the second Janna feel that it's much more

157
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:10,638
satisfying than the first Jonah and um there is maybe a little bit

158
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:16,320
of evaluation in the mind with the first Janna kind of a sense of relief of not

159
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:23,118
being caught in the thinking mind the desiring mind the aversive mind anymore

160
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:30,720
and um the um and um so there's a abled ability to

161
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:35,839
kind of just be in the experience itself in a deeper way it's not in

162
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:41,599
reference to what we've left behind and how good it is to no longer be caught up

163
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:48,878
in the hindrances and um and so things get the thinking mind the act the active mind

164
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:53,919
becomes quieter and quieter pe more peaceful more open and there's virtually

165
00:34:53,919 --> 00:35:00,079
no thinking uh and uh one of the ways to kind of

166
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:07,400
move into this or enter into it is to begin appreciating the difference

167
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:13,359
between ordinary thinking uh conversational thinking commentarial

168
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:21,680
thinking um thinking with words and uh or images and begin

169
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:28,440
appreciating that there are nonverbal ways of knowing we could know

170
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:35,119
without there needs to be thoughts that tell us so and so when we get into these deeper

171
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:41,119
states of samadei uh there is a kind of a knowing there is a deeper place inside

172
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:47,119
that maybe even guides us a little bit because it knows stay here enter here be

173
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:52,320
present um and um this is good but

174
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:58,560
there's there's no there the the ordinary verbally thinking or vision

175
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:06,480
vision making kind of thinking that goes on for some has gotten quiet it's taken a wonderful

176
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:13,040
delightful vacation finally it could rest and um and but still there can

177
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:18,280
bring a deeper knowing that somehow keeps us connected here in the present

178
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:23,880
moment a kind of nonverbal knowing and

179
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:32,320
um and uh it's that kind of knowing that recognizes the the joy and the happiness

180
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:39,119
that characterizes the second chamom so the pity the poly word and suka the poly

181
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:46,880
word that I translated as joy and happiness and uh people other people who

182
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:53,680
um practice jannaas um sometimes they're not happy with me using the word joy uh

183
00:36:53,680 --> 00:37:00,960
and happiness because they feel like generally that's too modest that it should be something

184
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:06,079
more like rapture or um and bliss

185
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:11,200
but as we get into this uh deeper especially in the in the second Janna it

186
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:18,880
becomes um important to uh open to the joy and the happiness when it's there

187
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:26,560
the joy and happiness of being fully engaged fully involved with no distractions with the with the practice

188
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:34,920
itself it's such a wholesome feeling feels like there's such a rightness being here and now and that

189
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:42,000
they it feels so complete like this is good this is a this feels more deeply

190
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,960
satisfying than a lot of things that people can experience in life and um and so there are these two

191
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:55,680
things uh joy and happiness and um and it and as this

192
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:02,000
second gen matures matures means we become more familiar with it the joy and the

193
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:10,359
happiness spreads it becomes more fully embodied uh we open to it more that um

194
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:15,960
uh we start seeing the distinction the difference between the joy and the

195
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:21,760
happiness until this point uh we talk about joy and happiness but maybe we

196
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:28,400
don't really see they just kind of mingle together and there's no real difference between them but as

197
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:34,160
everything gets quieter and calmer um and the thinking mind becomes even

198
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:41,839
quieter and softer And the excitement of uh that um very subtle but excitement of

199
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:48,240
of um of of you know entering into these states begins to abate uh we can start

200
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:53,280
seeing the difference between the joy and the happiness and one of the common

201
00:38:53,280 --> 00:39:02,320
ways to uh see it is um that the joy is a little bit more

202
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,520
mental whereas the happiness is more a little

203
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,560
bit more physical now the physical sensations of the joy can be quite

204
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:19,839
strong some people kind of are a little bit confused to hear that it's it's more of the mind than it is of the body but

205
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:25,920
the uh there's a kind of a mental um excitement you start feeling there's a

206
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:32,560
there's a mental uh thrill a mental kind of uplift energy excitement ah this is

207
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:37,839
good oh yes ah not that we say those words to ourselves but there's a little

208
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:45,200
bit kind of energy like that and um and that energy is a higher level of

209
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:50,599
activity of excitement than the happiness and the happiness

210
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:57,800
is almost like a very deep contentment in the body it's a very deep sense of

211
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:03,520
well-being that um uh the mental excitement or the mental activation of

212
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:10,320
joy is is no longer there and now and and with the mental activation of joy

213
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:17,200
the sensations in the body tend to be a little bit more stronger more active and

214
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:22,320
sometimes quite active quite strong like big waves of bliss that kind of wash

215
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:27,720
over us sometimes um it feels like a lot of lot of

216
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:33,599
movement um but with the happiness the movement and the it feels like a gentle

217
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:40,320
hum or vibration or or warmth or it might still feel like there's a flow but

218
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:47,079
the flow feels very harmonious within us and um there isn't any of the subtle

219
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:56,000
maybe not so subtle excitement of the joy and um so as the second genre matures uh

220
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,680
there's a being able to distinguish these two uh becomes very useful in

221
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:09,240
terms of moving further um into the third genre which we'll discuss I'll discuss with uh next

222
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:14,400
week and um and so uh learning to feel

223
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,680
the distinction or the difference between joy and happiness becomes part

224
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:27,160
of the task as we go deeper into this meditation into the Janna's and

225
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:35,119
um and uh but either way don't be in a hurry uh it's best with Janna's never in

226
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:41,200
a hurry um take all the time in the world to become familiar to feel it to

227
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:47,720
look around uh to spread whatever goodness there is to enter

228
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:53,640
into to abide this idea of abiding is means we're not in a

229
00:41:53,640 --> 00:42:03,160
hurry and um and opening and opening so that um

230
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:10,640
uh and the quote from the classic traditional

231
00:42:10,839 --> 00:42:19,520
teachings so that the p practitioner fills pervades saturates and permeates

232
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:25,520
this body with a joy and happiness born of concentration so no part of the body

233
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:32,400
is not touched and this um expression this body

234
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:38,480
um uh is is not referring to kind of the

235
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:44,720
ordinary physical body we might think about but rather the body

236
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:54,640
uh that we experience in meditation itself in a kind of way um the the experience

237
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:02,359
we have of our body is very much conditioned by our mind uh except when

238
00:43:02,359 --> 00:43:08,000
there's the physical pain of the body is quite intense they would acknowledge

239
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,920
that that was not mindmade but so many of the sensations

240
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:20,160
in our body have a very close strong conditioning very strongly conditioned

241
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:28,400
by the quality the characteristics of our mind our posture shifts and changes with the moods of our minds the

242
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:35,359
preoccupations what we kind of the negativity bias we have sometimes brings us into parts of our body where we're

243
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:40,960
reacting to them or pushing them away or have aversion certain emotions um and

244
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:47,119
attitudes cause a lot of tension in the body and so as we meditate and the mind

245
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:52,160
became softer mind becomes more relaxed not no longer preoccupied no longer

246
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:58,880
caught in things then um the body responds accordingly and and it's you

247
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:06,720
start feeling a very different feeling in the body and it's almost like we have two different bodies we have the body in

248
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:14,960
ordinary life and we have the body the samadei body that uh kind of glows and is

249
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:20,359
luminous and light and open and um has a very different

250
00:44:20,359 --> 00:44:26,000
sensation and so to appreciate enter into this kind of different body even

251
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:32,720
when just the feelings of it are just beginning to happen and uh enter into it

252
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:39,520
help it support you to um be willing to put down put to rest the ordinary

253
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:48,480
thinking mind enter into the state the feelings the sensations enter abide rest

254
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,680
in it resting in it so it can kind of spread so it can kind of you can

255
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:58,880
appreciate it you can be nourished by it you can let it registered in a deep way

256
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:05,920
let it recondition you in a nice way and then open to the goodness of it open to

257
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:11,440
the joy and the happiness to of it and then next week when we start the third

258
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:19,040
Janna um we'll talk about this distinction between the joy and the happiness becomes particularly important

259
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:24,880
uh because the joy will fade away and we'll be able to enter and abide uh in

260
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:30,599
the happiness of meditation of the Jonas so

261
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:36,880
um so in the meantime uh you might want to over this weekend

262
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:42,720
um keep these three uh steps in mind maybe throughout the day as much as you

263
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:48,599
can maybe have a sticky note that you put on something that reminds you um

264
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:54,319
enter abide and open and just see if you

265
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:59,839
can do that in ordinary life everyday life uh maybe when you drive someplace

266
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:07,160
and you arrive don't get out of your car right away sit there a little bit and um

267
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:14,400
relax enter abide and open

268
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,839
if you're standing in a in a line in a supermarket uh don't

269
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:26,240
read the you know the headlines on the news that's there rather stand there

270
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:34,000
maybe with your eyes closed but looking down enter abide and open with what's

271
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:41,040
happening here for you and maybe being attuned to what is good and right right now that you want to be attuned to if

272
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:46,280
you're just in your thoughts thinking a lot enter and abide and open through the
