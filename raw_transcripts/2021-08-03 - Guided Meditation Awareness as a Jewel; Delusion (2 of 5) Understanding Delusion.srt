1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:11,519
so warm greetings from inside meditation center in redwood city

2
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:18,240
and uh welcome to this meditation and welcome into this

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,760
community of people all over the country the world the

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:33,119
continent coming together to meditate now and also some people do it later in the day hello to them as well

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,239
so

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,840
one of the when we do mindfulness practice

7
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,360
sooner or later and ideally it's sooner we would come to have a deep

8
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,800
appreciation of our capacity

9
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:05,600
for being aware our capacity for mindfulness for clear recognition

10
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,680
for observing what's happening for sensing and feeling what's happening

11
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:18,080
as it's happening there's many different angles or

12
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,880
perspectives to this you know these different different sides of this wonderful jewel this diamond

13
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,079
of awareness and different times different ones are emphasized

14
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:39,119
but this jewel appreciating this tremendously valuable thing that is so overly easily overlooked

15
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:45,920
because the mind is using awareness to focus

16
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:54,240
to be absorbed in something else to obsess or to be mindfulness is the

17
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:01,040
passive awareness is the passive vehicle pass a vehicle with which we then get involved in our

18
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,600
thoughts or what i call the world of aboutness we're thinking about something about the

19
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,640
future the past about people in our lives about

20
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,400
events about fantasy and we can get so involved in those thoughts

21
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:25,520
those ideas those concerns maybe because we're have strong desire or fear or

22
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:33,440
aversion to it or whatever reason there might be and um and we're not really really aware

23
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:39,280
that we're aware we might know that we're thinking about something but

24
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:46,720
we're everything is kind of keeping channeled into that world of aboutness

25
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,840
in mindfulness practice we're stepping away from the world of aboutness

26
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,840
not to reject it but to know it so clearly that oh now i'm thinking about something now

27
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,879
i'm feeling something now i'm sensing something so clearly that we become aware

28
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:13,680
of the fact that we are aware we become aware of the the event

29
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,360
of being mindful so we hear a sound and rather than immediately going off

30
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,799
and thinking what is that sound and what should i do and what do i have to fix here to not

31
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:32,080
have the sound the the first place we go is we simply know the sound oh it's

32
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,519
listening hearing sound but we do it in such a way that

33
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:43,120
the awareness of sound the knowing of it the mindfulness of it

34
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:50,400
becomes the jewel stands out becomes really the main center

35
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,280
of our experience and so we have this jewel this treasure it's a phenomenally

36
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:06,080
powerful effective enlightening freeing to begin to appreciate

37
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:14,319
our simple capacity to awareness when we you know really

38
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:19,840
taste it or feel or know it it's kind of like

39
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:26,840
being distracted and being given clear clean refreshing mountain water from a

40
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,560
spring and we don't taste it we don't feel it don't we just talk away and just drink

41
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,320
gulp down the water or to really take it in feel oh this is

42
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,240
this is pure water this is you know really feels refreshing and good and

43
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:52,000
really feel the tasting of it so the the knowing of it

44
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:00,080
so and the avenue to doing that the means to doing that important part

45
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,120
of it is to be relaxed not trying too hard it's almost as if

46
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,840
the if we can be upright and the more relaxed we can be

47
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:20,000
then awareness is the natural

48
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,720
center of our experience awareness just begins to stand out and highlight

49
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:34,000
this treasure of ours so taking a assuming a

50
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:42,400
meditative posture that will allow you to both maintain a

51
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,160
postural physical alertness of some kind

52
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,840
and to relax your body

53
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:04,639
and gently closing your eyes and without doing anything special

54
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,880
around breathing become attuned to the experience of

55
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:17,680
exhaling become aware know what it feels like for

56
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:35,840
you to just as you are to exhale

57
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:44,560
and then become aware of different places in your body where there might be tension

58
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:52,720
and as you exhale ease up soften

59
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,080
relax the tension

60
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,840
in the shoulders and the belly

61
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,319
maybe the muscles along the sides of the spine

62
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,840
maybe in your fingers and hands

63
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:33,680
and as you inhale inhale into the very place that you've relaxed

64
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:40,639
as if that place can receive the inhale

65
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:59,840
as if the inhale prepares for further relaxation on the exhale

66
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:13,840
and if you're thinking about things you're in the world of aboutness

67
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:20,479
about what you're thinking and we want to be in the world of

68
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:27,840
awareness of presence

69
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:38,080
a kind of awareness and mindfulness it's closely related to a silent way of being

70
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:46,000
that allows you to sense and feel more deeply your experience

71
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:59,120
or a way of knowing recognizing

72
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:09,279
that recognizing what's really happening here in the present moment as you

73
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,680
breathe

74
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,640
as you relax the awareness can maybe be more receptive

75
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:37,839
or maybe even receptive is saying too much too much work awareness just is

76
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,000
and in its very is-ness

77
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:51,839
it registers it experiences it knows

78
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,879
and the diamond of awareness

79
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,800
allow it to stand out a little bit

80
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,640
in mindfulness of breathing

81
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:28,880
simple awareness of breathing where breathing isn't the main point of

82
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:35,279
what you're doing breathing is the means by which

83
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:42,640
awareness mindfulness is revealed is

84
00:10:42,640 --> 00:11:01,839
known is experienced mind's capacity to know to be aware

85
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:27,919
to highlight awareness you might use a very simple mental note

86
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:33,520
that recognizes whatever it is you're aware of

87
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:42,159
not that the note is that important in naming the experience

88
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:49,279
it's more that the note in the wake of the note

89
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:59,840
you're more aware of being aware

90
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:05,440
recognizing an in-breath with the word in

91
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,760
and then in aft in the wake of saying that being more there to recognize to

92
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:22,240
experience the end the in-breath out for the out-breath

93
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,840
appreciating

94
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,840
simple

95
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,158
and as we come to the end of the sitting

96
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:30,000
to take a few moments to appreciate your capacity to be aware

97
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,880
present moment awareness not thinking about awareness to

98
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:46,000
appreciate it but knowing it as you're aware now

99
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:55,120
not trying too hard to know awareness kind of know it from the edges or from

100
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:02,000
know it from behind or underneath

101
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:11,039
though it with the kind of peripheral awareness of the mind

102
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,840
appreciating its simplicity

103
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:28,080
that way in which awareness can be simple just know

104
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:38,240
and in the same way love can be simple

105
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,480
good will friendliness compassion

106
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,840
can be quite simple

107
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:57,279
also not being caught in the world of aboutness

108
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:03,520
thinking about things but allowing the world to register in

109
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:10,640
the heart in the simplicity of the heart the sinful response of

110
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:17,840
love of compassion good will

111
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,840
and allowing it to be simple without needing to figure out anything

112
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:30,480
or act on anything just just love

113
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,240
just good will

114
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:49,360
kindness and perhaps there's a way in which the

115
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:56,799
following words resonate with the heart

116
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:03,200
especially if you don't try to engage the meaning of the words

117
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:10,559
completely like how to do it but just listen as if

118
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:16,799
in some way these words express the sentiment of they are the

119
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:27,840
heart may all beings be happy

120
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,080
may all beings be safe

121
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:44,399
may all beings be peaceful

122
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:55,840
may all beings be free

123
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:09,520
may the simple capacity for love for kindness

124
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:16,559
may it shine nourish you

125
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:24,320
may the nourishment of kindness spread through your body

126
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,840
may the goodness of goodwill

127
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:51,840
radiate through your body

128
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:03,440
and then without getting too complicated may it may it be

129
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:08,320
that your good will can be expressed today

130
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:17,360
in ways that keep you intimate connected to a relaxed

131
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:22,960
inner place of well-being and peace

132
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:34,399
and may this good will peaceful relax goodwill may it also find an expression

133
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:39,919
in the world in what you say and what you do

134
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,840
in small or big ways in which you

135
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:55,840
contribute to the welfare and happiness of others may this meditation practice we did

136
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:01,519
today contribute to the happiness and well-being

137
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:15,840
of the world

138
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:37,039
so this is the second talk on mohawk

139
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:43,679
usually translated as delusion and today i'll talk a little bit more

140
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,480
specifically what the buddhist understanding of it is

141
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,120
so moha moha

142
00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:01,840
is considered to be one of the three roots or three origins

143
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:07,440
for everything that human beings do that's unwholesome

144
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:14,480
unhelpful harmful and now in the tradition of

145
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:22,240
early buddhism this moha is said to be present in every

146
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:28,559
in unethical act that someone does in every unwholesome

147
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:34,640
act that someone does and what unwholesome implies here is that it's unwholesome

148
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:40,559
for the person who does it and it's unhelpful and wholesome for the person who might be the recipient of the

149
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:46,960
act so if we're doing something which is not healthy for ourselves

150
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:53,600
psychologically heartfully then there's some degree of delusion in

151
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:59,760
that action in that act of speech or in that action act of act of the body

152
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:07,039
and um this the word moha delusion is related then to a lot of other kind of cluster of

153
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:12,079
concepts or mental activities that are related

154
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:18,878
and maybe the biggest one in buddhism is ignorance but ignorance that's not i don't you

155
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:24,960
don't know something you didn't you know read enough books to learn things but rather it's more like an

156
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:31,599
ignoring uh it's a little bit more volitional it's choosing almost like almost like

157
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:39,200
choosing not to know and or allowing the conditions to be

158
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:46,240
present of delusion that interferes with knowing it's related also to bewilderment

159
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:52,560
to confusion and to living the world not quite understanding what's happening and being bewildered

160
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:59,680
and it's also related to um the idea of um

161
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:07,359
and i forgot what i was going to say um the um

162
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:15,200
of foolishness and um the kind of core or the core the kind of

163
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:22,880
one of the most common ways in which the buddha talks about someone who is

164
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:30,160
mature spiritually he talks about them as being wise and those are immature are foolish

165
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:36,160
and that's that divide is not the divided between saint and sinner but rather the divide between the

166
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,920
foolish and the wise and some people might feel is unfortunate to make this distinction

167
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:49,119
but the difference between is uh the difference maybe between this uh sinner and a fool is sinners in the

168
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:55,359
kind of way it's often used in the west um you know there's no redemption there's no

169
00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:02,640
you know the person that's what a person is but when you're a fool it's possible to become wise foolishness

170
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:10,320
is a temporary phenomena and partly what we're doing is becoming wise it's overcoming delusion

171
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:17,040
now the word delusion uh in english and and moha in pali

172
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:24,560
implies that the mind is creating ideas that are not based on reality

173
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:32,480
so we either we we have projected some false ideas some fantasies

174
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:39,440
onto how things are or or we just live

175
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:46,560
in a world of fantasy that has no connection to the world around us and so there's a it's something the mind

176
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:53,520
is doing and in terms of thoughts ideas maybe some degree of feelings are involved and

177
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,720
contributing to this world of delusion and one of the very useful

178
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:05,920
reference points for understanding this is the psychological word or projection

179
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:13,359
that we have ideas we have bias we have prejudice that belong to the world of ideas

180
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:18,640
sometimes very intimately connected to feelings and motivations

181
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:25,760
and these bias and prejudice that we have preferences that we have is our

182
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:32,480
projections that we put on top of our experience and in and there's a whole slew of these

183
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,760
ways in which the mind is actively involved in obscuring

184
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,880
what's actually happening in the moment because it's created an idea of what's happening

185
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:48,800
that interferes with the direct experience and socially this is very painful when

186
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:54,000
we see people through the stereotype we see people through bias or prejudice

187
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,599
and and sometimes we see ourselves through bias and prejudice

188
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:06,400
these ideas and mind forms and and then they're projected on others and ourselves and the world

189
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:12,400
obscuring our ability to see clearly and this this understand why ignorance

190
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,520
is not just not knowing but isn't ignoring that it happens when

191
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:24,000
we have these projections when we're not allowing yourself to see deeply what's really going on

192
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:31,599
now in the in the tradition one of the there's a few things which are really central to um the projections we

193
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:37,040
have one of them is that we project the hope of happiness

194
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:44,079
onto things that don't really produce happiness like if we're trying to make ourselves

195
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:50,000
happy sometimes even safe with unwholesome activities with lying and

196
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,680
stealing and cheating and and or with being caught up in greed

197
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:02,640
or ill will uh then we think somehow our well-being

198
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:09,040
is there to be found in engaging in unwholesome activity and that's a kind of delusion because

199
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:16,560
unwholesome activity is always harming ourselves and um and so to end that projection

200
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:22,800
then we can that allows us to see actually this is not happiness producing i projected this

201
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:29,200
hope for happiness into that activity that it was going to do something for me

202
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:35,599
and so the same thing uh so this pr idea of projecting and if we can

203
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:40,880
part of wisdom is to see the difference between what's wholesome and unwholesome what's

204
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:47,359
harmful and what's not harmful and to become finely attuned to this so we really kind of begin living in the

205
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:53,280
world of what is beneficial both for ourselves and for others

206
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:59,680
the other uh important idea of projection is the idea of um we pre

207
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:05,680
we project uh a kind of permanence in things which are not permanent and it might be

208
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:10,800
a permanence just we have for the few minutes that it's there uh like oh we

209
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:18,079
we behave kind of on kind of unconsciously perhaps as if this is forever it's always going

210
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:24,480
to be a hot day now it's always going to be you know this way or that way and

211
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,920
i remember that uh there was a brief period of time when i was i think about 20

212
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:35,119
where i had a wonderful summer and in the middle this wonderful summer i said to

213
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:40,560
myself i'll never be depressed again this was a delusion of permanence that

214
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:46,880
came back and kind of bit me because that fall right after that wonderful summer i was more depressed

215
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:53,280
than it ever been and then i had the thought oh i'm gonna now i'm gonna be i'm gonna be depressed forever that was the attitude i had i

216
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:59,520
didn't say those words but the weight of it all this weight of permanence this is how it is

217
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:05,520
and and it's a it can be a projection and um and to live under the weight of

218
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:13,920
that product projection it causes a lot of suffering and and it so it obscures that projection of

219
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:20,000
permanence or constancy obscures how shifting and changing our experiences

220
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:27,760
and there's a whole different way of being in the world when we see the inconstancy of it the changing shifting nature and we find

221
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:34,880
how to let go and find our peace with it there's also the projection of

222
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:42,160
identity we all have you know some kind of identity gender or nationality or

223
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:48,079
all kinds of things but but there's something about the act of

224
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:55,200
projecting it on even though maybe nominally it's accurate but the act of projecting it and holding

225
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:00,880
on to it and seeing through the lens of it can obscure can create a sense of solid

226
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:06,079
self permanent self a constant kind of

227
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:11,680
ideation of who we are and what we're caught up in and this is a and so much of what we

228
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:17,520
think of myself my identity as a projection or we're acting through a projection in

229
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:23,440
relationship to it and so that's a kind of delusion that obscures

230
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:30,640
how in some very profound way we are always more dynamic more complicated more

231
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:39,280
fluid more um more changeable more

232
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:47,520
than any projection we have on ourselves that in fact that these projections obscure uh some deeper

233
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:55,119
capacity for awareness and aliveness and freedom which is always going to be here so

234
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:01,680
uh delusion as as being an activity of the mind

235
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:09,359
it's not a passive ignorance but it's the creation of ideas which are not accurate

236
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:15,680
and then projecting that onto the world or wearing them as filters on our on our

237
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:22,720
eyes so we see the world we see the world through those interpretations through those ideas

238
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:29,680
and and it's a wonderful thing to take those filters off it's a

239
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:35,520
wonderful thing to let go of those projections the um

240
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:42,480
the cost of having living this world of projections of delusion is a lot of stress there's a

241
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:49,520
lot of tension that comes along with it and to live without projections without these

242
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:56,560
these mind creations that we see through this assumptions beliefs prejudice bias

243
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:05,200
is allows the mind to be much more relaxed than it is and and to come to that place of ease

244
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:11,359
and peace that not only is it good just peaceful and useful for the mind itself

245
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:16,400
but it allows for uh to see with the absence of delusion

246
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:23,839
the absence of mohammed and and how to get to that and how to practice with delusion and

247
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:31,520
come to the other side is the topic for tomorrow so thank you and you might

248
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:39,200
you know these next 24 hours see if you can become a little more attuned or notice

249
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:45,760
how ideas surface in the mind and then those ideas become the means by

250
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,800
which or the filter through which we then look and understand what's

251
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:56,160
happening and and the key of this is to see it

252
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:04,160
arise see the beginning of something then it's easier to see it as a creation of the mind and and catch

253
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:09,760
it as a kind of delusion so

254
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:17,280
thank you very much
