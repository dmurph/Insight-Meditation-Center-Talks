00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,760
to check in and see those of you who um tried out the homework if you

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:40,320
reflected on one action of body speech or mind yesterday what did you notice

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,960
i would love for you to take a moment in silent reflection or perhaps to share

8
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:57,239
that reflection either now aloud or with others later or by writing it down later

9
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,159
so with

10
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:20,360
that just name that reflecting on actions body speech and

11
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,400
mind can be a lifelong practice

12
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:31,759
and in the talk today I'll be talking a little bit more

13
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:38,079
about bringing a perspective of lifelong

14
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:46,360
practice into how we practice how we live

15
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:59,680
so some people are saying loving and kindness with a conversation with your

16
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,040
son wonderful some things lots of things can

17
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,039
remain unsaid yes that can be

18
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,440
wisdom

19
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,870

27
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:32,280
soften turning the gaze inward and softening inner

28
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:39,519
speech or perhaps even allowing it to slow down or stop

29
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:48,959
starting with a few deeper slower

30
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:59,799
breaths and inviting a wave of

38
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:28,400
natural and inviting the attention to rest on each breath

39
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:47,120

68
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,800
staying in contact with all the sensations of the

69
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,040

70
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:14,079

breath and all of the sensations of the release of the

72
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:30,600
outreath like stroking A beloved animal

73
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:47,079
perhaps noticing the still points the

74
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:51,199
pause at the end of the

75
00:13:53,639 --> 00:14:00,079
outreath and letting go into

76
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,240
that

00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:14,800
releasing before the natural arising with the inb breath

78
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:20,720

go on each exhale let go let go let go

82
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,320
[Music] immersing

83
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,880
softening into the moment

84
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:29,200
in the last remaining moments of our meditation

85
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:39,080
together noticing taking in

86
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:45,700

00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:10,000
savoring any little glimpse or corner of goodness

90
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:22,520
is reflecting back on these moments of

91
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:28,840
meditation and gathering them up in your

92
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,240
heart in your body

93
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,120
and from that

94
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:03,759
place offering perhaps with an internal gesture

95
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:12,320
the sense of generosity of letting [Music] go offering that goodness those benefits

96
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,440
out into the world the others your life touches or

97
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,840
has touched

98
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:33,360
may they be safe

99
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:40,799
happy as healthy as possible no matter what their

100
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,000
condition may they heal into

101
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:55,880
peace may they know ease

102
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,000
and may they be

103
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:14,670
free may our practice here together be a cause and

104
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:19,880
[Music] condition for greater peace and letting

105
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:24,600
go in our own lives

106
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:30,799
and in all of the lives we touch and all of the lives they touch

107
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:37,880
outwards and outwards rippling may all beings be

108
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:44,600
safe peaceful and free of suffering

109
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:03,400
[Music]

110
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:21,240
thank you for the sincerity of your practice

111
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:24,120
i feel almost too calm to think or speak but um I guess it's my place in

112
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:30,240
our time together to speak so here I go

113
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:37,519
first just to um to say that if you would like to practice together more online I'll be

114
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:43,360
offering a half day through the Sati Center for Buddhist

115
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:49,960
Studies and um that is August 16th I

116
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:55,720
believe can go to their website for more information

117
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:14,080
and we have now reached the fifth talk in our series here this week

118
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:20,720
on inspirations for insight stories and myths from the Buddha's life

119
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:26,360
and how they relate to insight freedom practice

120
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:31,519
is and this is indeed the last story of the Buddha's life it's the story of his

121
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:38,840
last teachings his final words and his last

122
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:43,600
meditation so as some of you may be

123
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:49,120
aware the Buddha lived to quite a good old age for ancient India and according

124
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:55,200
to his own words in the ancient discourses he was around 80 years old

125
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:04,039
and he had been traveling teaching on foot for 40 years founding an

126
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:09,320
order and in the months before his death he knew he didn't have very much time

127
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:16,079
left and he was very clear about his priorities so he traveled around

128
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:21,358
emphasizing a certain teaching that I'll get into a bit more later

129
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:27,280
and then in his last hours he arrived at a little town and sort of was a bit

130
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:34,800
cloistered he saw one or two visitors and then when it was approaching the

131
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:41,599
time for him to go he settled between two Saul trees and the members of his order

132
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:46,760
gathered around and I think other kind of disciples lay disciples gathered

133
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:54,000
around and he lay down and he took the time to ask if they

134
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,040
had any last questions anything he needed to clear

135
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:05,400
up and no one

136
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:11,520
did so his last words and I'm paraphrasing of course here is make of

137
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:18,760
yourself a light a lamp an island look for no other

138
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:27,920
refuge and then right after that he said "Make the dharma your light your lamp

139
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:35,119
an island no other refuge take refuge in the practice in other words take refuge

140
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:42,480
in the teachings and he did this without appointing a successor very pointedly

141
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:49,680
did not name a successor the teachings the practices the ethical framework that

142
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:57,040
had developed within his time with this sa those were his

143
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:02,520
successors then his final meditation he entered into

144
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:08,079
samadei systematically going up and down through all of the janna and the

145
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:14,800
immaterial jas or immaterial bases which Gil covered in the last weeks and then

146
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,880
he went back down back up and entered the fourth

147
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:27,520
Janna which is deeply peaceful and equinimous and it was from there it said

148
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:37,880
that he released he let go into the final nibana pari nibbana unbinding and

149
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:43,839
death and in this story the trees beside him and all of the trees in the area

150
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:50,079
went into bloom out of season and scattered their petals down like I think

151
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:57,040
about knee deep by rubbish pile deep and it's quite something you know this

152
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:03,320
beautiful scent and if we take this as a mythic element just like in the story of his

153
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:10,799
awakening flowers here are linked to inner beauty ethical

154
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:17,920
virtue so that's a very brief version of this story

155
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:24,920
what might contemplating it offer in terms of supporting inspiring

156
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:30,720
insight well first the Buddha

157
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:37,920
repeatedly presumably intentionally gave a specific teaching

158
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:45,040
in the weeks before he died when he'd already realized it was time to let go of his life energy

159
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:51,320
and I'm summarizing here um this is from dean Aaya long discourses

160
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:58,800
16 concentrated concentration that is samadei fortified with virtue brings

161
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,359
great benefits understanding fortified with

162
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:10,200
samadei brings great benefits and great fruits that is

163
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:17,119
insight and a heart fortified with understanding A heart fortified with understanding

164
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,480
becomes completely

165
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:29,640
liberated so that's a summary it's based on Nyanamole's translation i think it's

166
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:36,920
significant that this is the theme that he expounded in his final

167
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:42,760
days to summarize the summary virtue is a basis for concentration beneficial

168
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:49,440
samadei which supports understanding but yields insight which in turn supports

169
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:55,760
complete freedom liberation and his meditative process

170
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:02,119
then demonstrated and refined that teaching

171
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:07,640
it's an understatement perhaps to say that the Buddha lived a life of great

172
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:15,400
virtue and this supported his capacity to easily access Janna near

173
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:22,160
death at death in particular the Buddha chose the fourth Janna as his final

174
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,920
release and the tradition teachers to this day teach that the fourth Janna

175
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:37,240
that place even less than um full Janna is the best departure point for

176
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:44,320
insight that kind of peace that kind of equinimity it may be for a split second

177
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:53,640
in the middle of a storm or it may be a long period of calm relaxed equinimity

178
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:02,800
the process of letting go dissolution is important for insight and

179
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:08,320
for liberation and the Buddha demonstrates for his total unbinding at

180
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:14,720
the moment of death so to just bring this into our

181
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,839
contemporary world as a hospital chaplain I had the profound privilege of

182
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:27,359
being in the presence of a number of people dying it changed me it changed me

183
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:33,760
those who can enter samati states at will at death are rare

184
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:40,560
but less rare and just as beautiful are those who have done their inner work who

185
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:46,839
have served the dharma selflessly or served others who have lived true to

186
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:52,440
themselves ethically who have cleaned up any messes in their

187
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:59,880
lives at least in their hearts and let go at peace it's

188
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:07,640
palpable when you're in a room with someone in that kind of peace

189
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:17,599
perhaps one way to summarize this from a Buddha Buddhist

190
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:29,359
perspective is to again paraphrase the Buddha's last

191
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:43,160
words make of yourself a place of safety refuge for yourself and

192
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:49,200
others allow yourself to be a light a lamp an

193
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:57,920
island let the dharma let the practice and the teachings be your lamp island

194
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,960
refuge refuge in the practices of ethical and

195
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,078
meditative cultivation and of a generous

196
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:13,760
heart keeping death in mind in life can

197
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:19,839
serve as a reminder of what's most important what do I want to look back on

198
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:26,559
eventually oh becomes very easy to make certain

199
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:35,880
decisions in other words to be peaceful in the dying

200
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:41,680
process it's helpful to live in such a way that one can reflect back and feel

201
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:46,920
at ease with

202
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:53,720
so this supports insight it supports wise relationship supports a vibrant

203
00:42:53,720 --> 00:43:02,760
loving peaceful contented life so in summary for this week the Buddha's

204
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:09,960
example can inspire each of us to insight and living well by

205
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:15,560
cultivating simplicity and contentment by

206
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:22,480
cultivating wise nourishment and a learning mindset with whatever arises in our

207
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,800
lives hearts and minds and by cultivating

208
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:35,440
mindfulness non-contention kindness and honest

209
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:45,720
self-reflection may this path support you in a life of peace love and

210
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:51,319
ease thank you for your kind attention
