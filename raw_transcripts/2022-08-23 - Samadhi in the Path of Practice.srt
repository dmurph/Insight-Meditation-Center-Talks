okay so welcome welcome everybody so tonight i'm going to continue on i'm

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,720
doing the series on the seven factors of awakening and last week i talked about samadhi and

25
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:43,120
i'm going to stay on samadhi again i'm going to kind of flesh it out and talk about it a little bit more today

26
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,440
samadhi i'm using the pali word not the english word because i think the english word has a lot of

27
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:56,239
associations that might not be so helpful or yeah has some baggage along with it so

28
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,760
let's give the definition that i would like to give and there's a number of dharma teachers that

29
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,360
use this definition so it's not 100 percent of diana ism but

30
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,680
it's a way that i think it's a little bit fuller and helps us appreciate it and that samadhi is

31
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:21,360
the mind and body feeling unified settled and steady

32
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,959
in a state of well-being three different elements there mind and

33
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,959
body and i'll talk about that in a little bit here the body's definitely involved

34
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:39,040
settled steady and unified so not distracted or

35
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:45,760
not uh split with our attention going anywhere and everywhere and then with a state of well-being a

36
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,200
state of like some niceness we might say and um

37
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:57,760
i'm using kind of these vague words niceness and well-being so that we don't have to get so caught up on exactly what

38
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:04,239
it is and uh maybe maybe not today but uh

39
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:10,640
maybe next week i'll unpack that a little bit more but for now we'll just use this kind of well-being

40
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,720
samadhi so i will say that um often the english

41
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,000
translation that's used is concentration but right when we hear this word

42
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
concentration we kind of think like of this narrowing and this burrowing down and straining and huffing

43
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,400
and puffing and you know trying to really stay on the object we don't think about well-being we don't

44
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:41,360
think about the body and it's often it can we have these ways of how we think about

45
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,918
samadhi so i'll be using this word samadhi

46
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,960
and i said this last week but um i just want to emphasize it again that it's not one

47
00:04:52,960 --> 00:05:00,320
thing i mean i described it as a state but it's not like in or out

48
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:06,560
you have it or you don't you know it's not like that it's a spectrum and so we could say here's this more

49
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,320
unified collected and here's completely distracted and in terror and disembodied

50
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,680
right at one end and then the practice is just to move in the direction towards

51
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,840
more collectedness more settledness more well-being and in a way that includes both the mind

52
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,879
and the body is kind of a way of being unified

53
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:35,120
so one thing that as i said i'm talking about samadhi in

54
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:43,600
terms of it being an awakening factor so it's the sixth of seven awakening

55
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:50,840
factors i'll just list the other ones here i'm not going to talk about them but mindfulness

56
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:58,080
investigation energy joy tranquility samadhi and then the next one will be

57
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:05,680
equanimity so these are nice thicks right these kind of energy joy tranquility

58
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,440
so it's this all these um supports for awakening when i'm using

59
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:17,680
the word awakening here i'm pointing to this really greater freedom

60
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:24,319
that's available this freedom from whatever it is you feel like you need freedom from

61
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:30,479
anything and everything literally everything so it can also this we might even think

62
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:37,840
about it as a spectrum um i remember i heard to gil gosh this was

63
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:46,000
quite some time ago give this little analogy about freedom which has stuck with me all these years

64
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,520
maybe it was because uh he said it right at the end of a retreat and write it you know our minds are a little bit more

65
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:58,319
settled in the retreat and things come in and stick but he gave this little story

66
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:04,479
of he was kind of describing freedom and he said that in his household it was

67
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:11,680
the tradition that on sundays they would have waffles and that he would make the waffles so

68
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:18,479
every sunday you know make these little waffles and one of his sons uh liked to have

69
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:25,120
syrup with this waffle that's perfectly reasonable but they wanted syrup in every single

70
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,120
little one of those little squares and not any on the plate

71
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,160
so this kind of particular way that the syrup has to be right

72
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:43,039
in order for the waffle to be acceptable to be eaten and then so there's a certain amount of

73
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:49,440
suffering between the sun and the father who's uh trying to make these waffles and make them just

74
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:58,160
right for this one but then he said you know as his son grew up he just kind of outgrew it just

75
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:04,160
didn't make so much sense anymore and you stopped caring so much about this syrup having to be in exactly every

76
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,520
waffle and so gail was pointing to outcome sometimes freedom is like that you just

77
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:16,639
kind of like outgrow or you just naturally let go or it's not such a big part of your life

78
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:23,680
anymore some of these things that used to be a source of suffering i'm using suffering right in this really broad way

79
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,720
difficulty uncomfortableness but also what's interesting about this

80
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,560
story so this sun kind of grew up and

81
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,800
had this shift in his idea of how his food had to be so he certainly had more ease

82
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,720
but his father also had ease right didn't have to make the breakfast

83
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,959
being perfect so when we find more freedom it affects those people around us and this is part

84
00:08:52,959 --> 00:09:00,080
of why we practice not just so that we feel better but just to make the world a better place

85
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:08,240
the world ends up becoming a better place whether we wanted to or not by the more freedom that we have

86
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,160
so how does this samadhi tie in with this freedom

87
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,720
this greater freedom so maybe this is uh

88
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:27,920
one thing that i can say that and i pointed to this also last week that as the mind and the body start to

89
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,279
settle less distractedness less

90
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:39,680
restlessness less agitation but still with some real brightness and clarity so

91
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:46,240
it's not a dullness it's not like we've kind of fallen into a stupor

92
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,480
or some cotton ball where we don't feel anything now the samadhi has a real quality of

93
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:59,279
yeah i use this word brightness so there's that there's a real clear scene

94
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:06,720
so as the mind settles as the body settles there's this increased clear seeing

95
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:13,360
and we there's a number of we can see a number of things quite a few things

96
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,480
that just like that story i told with a girl and his son

97
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:25,200
kind of like shifts our relationship like once we see that

98
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:31,279
then we're just like oh i i just i don't just our relationship to it changes so

99
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:38,160
we don't we aren't holding on to it in the same way it just feels natural just to stop just

100
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,839
let go so this letting go happens and turns out

101
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:51,519
letting go leads to more freedom absolutely every time

102
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:57,519
but right we have to know like there's the letting go has to

103
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:04,000
come from a place well maybe i should say i think there's old letting well maybe i can't make

104
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,480
blanket statements like this because of course right an exception showed up in my mind but

105
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,079
for the most part the direction to go is towards letting go

106
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:21,440
because we know that clinging brings suffering grabbing on

107
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,560
gra snatching this kind of like you know holding on really quick quickly that

108
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:33,040
does not bring more ease okay so what are some of these things that we

109
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:42,279
see that allows us the letting go to happen which allows the freedom to go happen

110
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:49,040
so i mentioned this a little bit last week and i'll just say this briefly again but

111
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:55,120
we as we this is as the settling starts to happen we start to see through or

112
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,880
maybe notice how oh yeah our experiences are not always the same

113
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:08,320
we might have this feeling i'm a happy person and we might not be noticing the times when we're not happy or i'm a sad

114
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,720
person and not just really noticing the times when actually it's we feel perfectly fine

115
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:21,040
when we're in the shower cooking breakfast or taking the dog for a walk you know there's our moments during the day when

116
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:27,920
that are maybe neutral we don't feel sad but as the mind and the body start to

117
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:35,279
settle we start to see not only in our daily life but really deeply in meditation practice

118
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:42,000
how things are changing ideas we had about ourselves

119
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,680
are not so solid and things aren't uh so

120
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:53,839
constant and stable and like square black boxes like okay this is

121
00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:00,880
good and this is bad or i'm this way i'm not that way we start to see like oh wait some of these things

122
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:07,279
they actually aren't as solid and stable and many of them are flickering

123
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:12,320
with some you know really fast or maybe it's slow

124
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:19,440
and so this this ideas of solidity and continuity that we have about so many

125
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:25,680
things in some ways about everything we realize oh

126
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,440
they're not solid they're not continuous in the way that we thought

127
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:37,040
and when there's this deep scene we realize oh it just doesn't make sense to

128
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:45,120
be really grasping on to something that's really changing and isn't uh solid like we thought it was

129
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,959
it turns out that when we're really grasping we're actually grasping to a concept

130
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:56,000
those are the only things that are really solid concepts but you know other

131
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,040
things turn out not to be as solid as we think but i'm not going to get into all the physics and the metaphysics maybe about

132
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,320
that but just this recognition that things

133
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,760
don't they're not the way that we imagine that they are or that we're experiencing them

134
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:21,040
as our relationship shifts then the clinging shifts we don't have to stop the clinging it

135
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:27,519
just naturally happens that way and so one way maybe a little bit more

136
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,639
specific if we're doing meditation practice

137
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:39,839
and as the mind starts to quiet down often this doesn't happen until somebody's on

138
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:46,000
retreat and they have these maybe extended times of meditation

139
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,120
maybe a few days maybe it's different for different people

140
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,320
maybe it's not on first retreat but as the and maybe for some people it is

141
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:02,399
some people it isn't we're so different but the whole

142
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:09,519
experience of having a body starts to shift too

143
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:16,240
this perception of the body changes

144
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:24,320
the edges don't seem quite so definite doesn't quite feel as heavy or

145
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:30,560
in fact maybe there's times when we don't even feel like there's a body at all

146
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:37,600
or maybe it's just filled with this lightness or um lightness in terms of lack of

147
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:44,800
heaviness but also lightness in terms of lack of darkness so these two different ways

148
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,720
but then we might say like whoa what's happening with the body and then we might just uh check like we could open

149
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,920
our eyes or even check like oh yeah okay it's actually here the same way but it

150
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,839
feels different and we just might feel into that

151
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:08,639
and then we could just ask well it definitely feels different

152
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:15,440
and but i know i don't always feel this way and we can look and say but my body is

153
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:22,800
still here and it feels different so which is the real body

154
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,360
like which is the real way it is

155
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,759
and then well it feels real when i'm meditating it feels certain that real feels a certain way when i'm not

156
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:39,040
meditating when i'm not don't have some samadhi it feels another way

157
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:44,800
and so this is also one of the things that we see with samadhi is

158
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:51,839
our perceptions can change something that seems one way

159
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,240
can seem another way in another setting and we just start to see this in more

160
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:05,280
and more things and what i'm saying is not anything new everybody knows this

161
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,720
in some kind of way but maybe we haven't really thought about it we know that when we wake up on the

162
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:19,280
wrong side of the bed so to speak we're just grumpy then everything that day just feels irritating and bothersome

163
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,720
and we aren't our best selves and impatient with people or whatever it might be

164
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,840
just because we're grumpy and then maybe you get an email and makes you

165
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:36,240
mad but if you woke up that morning feeling refreshed

166
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:42,640
you had your waffles exactly like you liked them right and the day was then you know that

167
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,679
same emails okay yeah maybe that other person was in a bad mood no problem i'll

168
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:54,640
just respond to this right we don't have the same reaction so which is real

169
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,760
is it the way that it's perceived when you're grumpy or is it the way that it's perceived

170
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:07,039
when you're in a good mood so samadhi starts to help us see oh

171
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:14,400
maybe there isn't one way maybe perception changes

172
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:21,840
depending on how the mind is and we know this but when the mindset we

173
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:30,559
start to see this more and more clearly and then also there's some letting go like okay

174
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:36,880
i'll just use this grumpy example okay this email arrives and you feel grumpy but you might also recognize i'm just in

175
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,960
a bad mood today it i'll feel different like we have this expression oh just sleep on it things

176
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:49,840
will feel better in the morning right there's this recognition that it's not always just one way

177
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:58,160
but this we start to see this in more and more things and a little and more thorough and pervasive way

178
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:06,720
and this supports some let's i don't have to hold on to it because i know that it's can be seen another way

179
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:13,120
so there's some letting go and without letting go there's some more freedom

180
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:21,840
but maybe i'll say just um a little aside about this idea of the as the body

181
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:29,120
so it turns out that the body is really important in samadhi practice

182
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:35,679
and certainly kind of like the first stages of samadhi and we we might think like oh it's just

183
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,720
the mind and you just have to focus the mind but it turns out that actually it's

184
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,160
integral to have the body to have this sense of the body and

185
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:53,280
right now i can point to a few reasons why that is but one is

186
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:58,960
somali doesn't arise if we are like over efforting

187
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:05,600
i gotta get it dang it i'm supposed to get settled and why is my mind so distracted and you know this kind of

188
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:11,440
this uh restless or this i don't know what the word is but this irritation or

189
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,799
frustration with ourselves and trying to will power and trying to you know make

190
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:23,520
that mind stick but sometimes we don't even notice that we're doing this because it's a habit

191
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:30,080
it's how we show up in the world in so many different ways and of course we do right because

192
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:36,320
sometimes it's helpful to do that in our daily life but we try to take what works in daily

193
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:42,240
life and apply it to meditation some things work and some things don't and this is one of those things that

194
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:48,000
doesn't but we might not notice that we're doing this

195
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:55,360
until we pay attention to the body and we notice that maybe the shoulders are up and we have our hands for me i

196
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:01,919
notice i get tension in my hands and i'm like making a little bit of a fist or something or or maybe there's this way

197
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:09,360
in which we're really leaning forward or the way the chin is really up as we're striving trying to make something happen

198
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:16,320
so sometimes it's not until we're really aware of what's going on in the body that we know some of the subtle

199
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,520
stuff that's happening in the mind and as long as these things are

200
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:27,440
happening the mind that somebody won't arise this mighty arises with it's a letting

201
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,440
go it's a softening it's you there can be a certain amount of

202
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:39,039
focus but that you can force yourself to do but it's not really sustainable and that's

203
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:45,200
not the same as samadhi so maybe that's one reason why the body is helpful

204
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:53,760
but the second is i keep on talking about this sensitive to or having a well-being

205
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:59,120
and often this sense of well-being also shows up in the body

206
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:05,120
i'll talk a little bit more about this next week i think but i'll just say there's often maybe like a

207
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,240
literally a little energetic uh

208
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:16,720
effervescent glee maybe i'll use that word

209
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:23,200
um that just kind of shows up in the body like oh yeah this feels good

210
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,400
that's kind of a feeling so i just want to kind of throw that in

211
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:36,480
there how the body is part of samadhi practice and how part of it helps us supports us with uh

212
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:42,080
samadhi but another reason how samadhi helps us with

213
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:48,880
more freedom is when there's the mind is settled it's

214
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,480
more malleable it's not so brittle

215
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,799
and what i mean by that is you there might be this recognition of

216
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:06,320
okay when i meditate i do this for example

217
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:13,600
i have i have the breath as the anchor and when the mind wanders i come back to

218
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:20,559
the breath and then when the mind wanders i come back to the breath when the mind wanders i come back to the breath perfectly fine to do this practice and

219
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:26,159
it makes absolutely no difference how many times you have to come back to the breath honestly

220
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:32,400
but there might be we might not notice how the way that we're coming back has a little bit of

221
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:39,440
irritation with ourselves disappointment in ourselves frustration and that's a little bit of

222
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,480
it might be really slight but this little bit of ill will or a

223
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:51,520
little bit of like i said earlier dang it why is my mind not doing this

224
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,720
and so what might be helpful is to open up to

225
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:03,919
some warm-heartedness maybe do a little bit of loving-kindness practice one way to open up you can also open up

226
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:12,000
by doing mindfulness as sounds so somali helps the mind to be malleable

227
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,159
in terms of it can be open to different ways of practicing to be sensitive to

228
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:25,520
what's helpful here what's helpful to support this sense of unification this sense of settledness

229
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:33,120
the sense of well-being the sense of being connected or embodied so it's not like stuck in one groove

230
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,880
that can only go in this one gear or can only go this one way but morris can be

231
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,400
flexible and try new things and this malleability also goes with

232
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:50,320
this shift of perspective or shift of perception i was talking about earlier

233
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:56,880
oh we might see things differently and if the mind is malleable we can play

234
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,880
with that a little bit oh i noticed that i'm a little bit angry

235
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:08,159
about that thing that that person said earlier today

236
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:14,480
then we might have this well can i soften around that and there might

237
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:21,200
be this sense of malleability that oh yeah i can't shift my ideas about that

238
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:27,600
and that brings more freedom so that's another way that samadhi

239
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:36,159
helps us with some more freedom but also as the mind starts to settle

240
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:41,520
there sometimes we as we kind of like open to

241
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,799
little that more settled level and then we we remember

242
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:52,880
what was less settled we realized oh yeah there is there is a

243
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:58,880
little subtle dukkha in the less settled state

244
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,559
there was a little bit of agitation a little bit of suffering that this

245
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:12,080
level this definitely has less duca but i didn't feel like i had any duca before

246
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:18,159
but now that i'm a little bit more quiet i can see the subtle duke of this

247
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:25,200
subtle unsettledness dissatisfaction a little bit of tightness wishing things

248
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,480
were different or something like this so the mind settles it helps us to see more

249
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,640
and more subtle levels of dukkha and where there's dukkha there's

250
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:42,559
clinging we can almost say they're synonyms and so

251
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:48,000
when we start to see that then we might have a little bit of curiosity what is

252
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,520
that took about and maybe we can shift our relationship to a

253
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:59,760
little bit or let go soften whatever it is that's uh

254
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,640
supporting that dukkha

255
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:12,240
here's one other thing that we can see with samadhi with somali practice and as

256
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:18,320
we gain samadhi is it starts to become abundantly clear

257
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:24,720
how little we get to control what the mind is doing

258
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,919
right we all would prefer to have this collected state of well-being like why

259
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:37,360
not but we can't make it happen we can't just say okay mind do this

260
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:44,000
it doesn't work and we will try [Laughter] we will try and try and try of course we

261
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:52,080
will of course we will but what we start to see is that actually we don't control

262
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:57,679
what we think we can control instead

263
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:03,360
we can help create the conditions in which it is more likely that it will

264
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:09,919
happen we don't get to make things happen

265
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,279
and then once we see this very clearly with samadhi you start to see this very clearly

266
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:20,799
often if not every time in the beginning when somebody arises for people

267
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:26,000
it's a surprise because if you're really gunning trying

268
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,840
to make it happen it won't happen so usually when it arises it's a

269
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:38,480
surprise because you weren't looking for it and yet here it is it arose

270
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:44,000
as more as you start to see oh so many of these things arise when i'm not

271
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,640
trying to make them arise but i'm settling i'm kind of relaxing opening

272
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:57,360
softening being with what is in this gentle way with a real with a commitment to

273
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:03,760
practice with a loyalty to the object

274
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:09,760
but with also softness and openness then we start to see that things can

275
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:15,279
arise and we also see that things end

276
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:22,000
we don't get to control when they end even if they do arise so this recognition that things

277
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:29,360
are not controllable we start to see how many things in our

278
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:35,440
lives are not controllable a part of us knows this but we start to

279
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:41,600
see it in a deeper way and it becomes glaringly obvious right if we're trying to

280
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:48,240
quiet the mind so these are some of the things there's

281
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,840
a few more things but um maybe i'll save those for another time but way

282
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:59,600
in which this kind of like samadhi is can be a support for greater freedom but

283
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:06,080
it's perfectly natural that like oh okay diana if i've convinced you or anything it's

284
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:14,960
like okay it sounds like a good idea but and i'd like to try it but how do i do it how do i make this happen

285
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:21,360
and i as i said it's um it's about a com having

286
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:28,159
a steadiness to practice that has an orientation to well-being

287
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:34,840
which isn't the same thing as pleasure they're definitely related but isn't exactly the same

288
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:42,000
thing but with some softness and openness and this takes some practice to

289
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,399
how can we be sincere and persevere and consistent

290
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:54,720
and have ease how can we not like pounce on something and think like okay i'm gonna hold on

291
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:01,919
i'm gonna be with this but how instead can we just with some ease just come back and come back

292
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:10,480
to the object maybe i'll end with this poem that points to this

293
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,679
this poem is by maddie weingast who's a poet who was inspired by

294
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:21,600
some of the poems that were written by women thousands of years ago

295
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:27,039
it's quite something buddhist women thousands of years ago this is the oldest literature

296
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:33,360
by women that has survives to the modern time

297
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:39,440
and uh so maddie weingast he's inspired by these women so this isn't exactly what

298
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:46,480
the women said i looked at the paulie what what he's referring to it's not exactly the same but if the

299
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,519
mood is the same okay so here's this poem

300
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:58,960
this is a nun speaking when everyone else was meditating

301
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,679
i'd be outside circling the hole

302
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:10,720
finally i went to confess i'm hopeless i said

303
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,399
the elder nun smiled keep going she said

304
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:24,080
nothing stays in orbit forever if this circling is all you have

305
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,720
why not make this circling your home

306
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,679
i did as she told me and went on circling the hall

307
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:43,840
if you find yourself partly in and partly out if you find yourself drawn to this

308
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:50,000
path and also drawing away i can assure you

309
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,480
you're in good company just keep going

310
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:02,880
sometimes the most direct path isn't a straight line

311
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:10,399
sometimes the most direct path isn't a straight line

312
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:16,399
i appreciate this so much like like okay if you're restless and just all you're doing is circling the

313
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:22,559
hall walking walking walking or whatever whatever it is okay that's what it is

314
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:28,880
this practice isn't asking us to be somebody we're not it's not asking us to be completely

315
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:35,360
different we start where we are we work with what we have and we don't

316
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,559
have to be different we just work with

317
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:46,000
what's available of course we do like how could it be otherwise so

318
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,519
i know i just i love this poem i think it's a an encouragement that even if you just

319
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:58,880
find yourself circling just keep going and this the elder nun who is uh

320
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:06,000
patachara we sometimes put a we have a statue of potato sometimes that sits here

321
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:13,358
so she was patatara was just encouraging okay just make it your home

322
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:20,240
so samadhi it's a number of different ways it's a support for our practice and the support towards

323
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:27,358
greater freedom it's part of the way in which it's one of these factors of awakening

324
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:33,599
so if you'd like we can take some questions now

325
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:38,320
and if there aren't any questions that's okay too but

326
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:44,240
and sveta i don't know if you can see if there are questions on youtube

327
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:50,398
and if there are then um maybe you can say there's a there's actually one question okay

328
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:56,560
um jesse is asking how is samadhi related to the four janus

329
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:03,119
yeah so samadhi uh i'd say the four genres is a subset of

330
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:09,280
samadhi um and i'll talk a little bit about that i think uh next week and for those

331
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:15,359
people who don't know jana's is a an absorptive state it's a particular

332
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:21,760
meditative experience or state and so smarty is broader has a broader

333
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:28,839
definition but jhanas are definitely are as part of a samadhi so

334
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,078
anybody else have a question

335
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:44,119
yeah maybe we'll use the microphone

336
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:52,640
so i heard an earlier talk that um you can think of buddhism of having two

337
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:59,359
wings cultivation and letting go and sometimes i notice when playing with

338
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:08,320
letting go and just um you know letting things arise as it is um there's this uh space and just you

339
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,760
know things are are how they are and like oh you know you can add in things

340
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:19,599
like um equanimity or whatever and i'm just curious

341
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:26,560
uh as you're adding things in uh these qualities then it's not um it's

342
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,599
harder to let go it's hard to do both at the same time and i'm curious um

343
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:37,839
your thoughts on like the balance between that and um yeah

344
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:43,040
so the balance between cultivation and letting go yeah

345
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:49,920
i would say that we are cultivating qualities to support letting go

346
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:56,000
and i would say that letting go is part of the way that we cultivate qualities

347
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:03,680
so the way that you you heard it is there kind of these two uh i don't know two movements of the mind

348
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:10,240
maybe cultivation and letting go um they definitely go together and in some ways they're the

349
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:16,240
two sides of the same coin but let's see

350
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:21,680
i'll definitely would say that this practice sometimes the way that we teach it um

351
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:29,040
it can feel like okay i have to acquire attain something samadhi i have to get this and

352
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:34,839
this tranquility thing or this mindfulness thing so we sometimes feel like we have to

353
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:40,480
acquire but this practice is really about letting go kind of shedding

354
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,599
but in order to really allow some of the deeper letting go

355
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:51,040
it's helpful if we have some other qualities if we have some

356
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:58,079
steadiness if we have some well-being if we have some understanding of what is underlying the difficulties in

357
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:04,400
our lives if we have some understanding of what are the things that we can let go if we have some understanding of what

358
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:11,440
is letting go and stuff like that so is that helpful yes very thank you

359
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,599
[Applause]

360
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:26,400
i have a question um so i know that tranquility i heard many

361
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:33,200
times tranquility is supported by tranquility right tranquility is supported by

362
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:40,480
tranquility so if there's tranquility there can be more yeah what do you think about samadhi so

363
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:47,280
so do somebody experiences they do they kind of train our mind to

364
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:55,920
maybe experience you know absolutely yeah yeah they really do if you have a if you

365
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,119
spend a lot of time in samadhi some of the deeper stages it really

366
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:07,680
becomes um some of these stages that are really pleasurable and just really

367
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:13,760
satisfying in a way that our regular uh thinking or something like this it it

368
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,880
gets so that like you can just remember them and you're having that experience just

369
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,560
because you're brought it to mind again so it's definitely but it's not until you have those

370
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:31,520
experiences of course right until you can remember them right so yeah it definitely does kind of

371
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:44,160
this might be going back to the first question about the jonas but is there a relationship between

372
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:50,160
samadhi and stream entry like when you enter that phase of awakening

373
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:56,000
i'm because i i've heard of stream entry being a part of awakening as well and there's samadhi too so i get a little

374
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:03,839
confused by the the terminology sometimes yeah yeah um so stream entry is the first level of

375
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:10,960
awakening and it's kind of like you enter the stream of the dorm it's it's kind of a clunky nomenclature

376
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:19,680
and so a question often arises do you have to have jhanas in order to get stream entry this is a common question

377
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:27,040
and i would say you have to have samadhi for stream entry you have it maybe

378
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:34,079
maybe not all the way full into adriana but you have to have cl you have to have a samadhi definitely

379
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:39,520
some settledness stream entry is just the first stage of awakening

380
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:45,040
if you want to go to later stages i would say probably some jhana is required for that is that helpful is

381
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:49,000
that kind of answering your question

382
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:05,359
hi dana i'll be quick i just wanted to say thank you last week i was a bit upset about my

383
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:12,319
meditation practice and you had brought up the measuring thing and that that's what i was doing

384
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:17,760
and for this sitting i was just kind of letting things be as they are and i

385
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,520
wasn't waiting for the bell and i was like and when it came i'm like oh

386
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:29,920
there it is and just that less of the resisting you know and just kind of letting it be

387
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:36,400
not that i experienced a state of samadhi but i kind of understood like okay if i'm

388
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,599
gonna circle or i'm gonna do it and i'm just gonna let

389
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:47,359
it be as it is and see where see where it takes me and fantastic
