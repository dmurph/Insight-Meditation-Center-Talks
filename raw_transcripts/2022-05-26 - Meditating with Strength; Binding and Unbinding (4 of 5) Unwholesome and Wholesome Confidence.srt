1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:07,359
so good morning and a good day

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:15,200
from redwood city inside meditation center so and thank you for being part of this

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:22,000
i appreciate it very much coming here and in a certain way kind of sitting in the

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,279
middle in the midst of all of you so um

5
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,719
because buddhism to the degree to which buddhism or meditation mindfulness

6
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:45,600
is associated with values of peace of non-harming of a certain kind of

7
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,199
modesty and non-greed non-hatred

8
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:58,399
it's very easy in that process to feel that one should diminish oneself

9
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:04,799
it's a degree to which there's letting go of attachments and one of the primary attachments is to

10
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:11,600
self there's a can be the idea that somehow we should

11
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,840
be self-effacing and diminishing ourselves kind of like we don't count or just let go of our own

12
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:24,880
needs or situations or somehow somehow consider ourselves unimportant

13
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,960
maybe but in fact it's true that buddhism has a lot to do

14
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,079
with letting go of attachment to self letting go of conceit and arrogance is a

15
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,600
big part of it and there's also

16
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:48,880
a coming into or merging into a kind of personal strength

17
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:57,600
uh a certain kind of very some people say unshakeable confidence

18
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,840
that we can take our stand we can be here in

19
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,360
a clear upright full way as if we count as if

20
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,680
we are allowed to be strong and in that strength

21
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:23,360
to uh not be arrogant in that strength to not cause harm or in that strength not

22
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:30,080
to be you know not to cause harm in the world or or to

23
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,840
hold ourselves in a way that any kind of way that diminishes other

24
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:42,239
people but still to just be there with strength

25
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:48,000
and some people might say with power some people might say use the word confidence

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
some people might use this idea of uh you we're allowed to be here in a very stable

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,800
clear upright kind of way here so in this meditation that we do today

28
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,239
i'd like to try to evoke this for you as a support for your meditation

29
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,920
practice and and maybe some of the words that i use

30
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:18,959
will not work for some of you and one of the arts of guided meditations is if some word that's being

31
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:25,200
used is not quite right for you you might try rewording it and

32
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,120
see what word might a similar word might work for you or you might consider

33
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,480
that maybe in general circumstances this word doesn't this concept doesn't work

34
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,799
for you but that there might be one or two times in your life where this

35
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:49,599
it is relevant it is important and so to kind of use that situation as a reference for what the meditation is

36
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:55,280
about so um

37
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,640
so assuming a posture for meditation in whatever posture it is

38
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,680
probably most of you are sitting a few might be standing if you might be lying down

39
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,200
and there might be some of you also who are maybe doing this walking maybe walking back and forth in

40
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:20,239
in your room as you listen whatever posture you have to

41
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:26,000
enter into it with the idea that you're going to

42
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,639
have a posture that has room for your confidence

43
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,080
even if you don't know you're confident yet you create that so maybe sitting up a

44
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,840
little straighter than you normally would maybe rolling your shoulders back

45
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,479
a little bit

46
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:57,840
maybe letting your chest be a little bit more open and expanded

47
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:09,039
and then feeling the base wherever your whatever is where your weight of your body touches

48
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:14,080
your mat your chair your bed the floor

49
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,840
see if you can feel a solid stability there

50
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,600
recently as your weight the body

51
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,479
comes into contact with what is supporting your weight

52
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,840
feeling the support the stability

53
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:48,080
and perhaps that support or stability for some of you

54
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,400
can be a source of something comparable to confidence

55
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:01,520
something that's going to hold your confidence or from which confidence can arise

56
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,160
gently close your eyes

57
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:16,400
and in a moment to take a few long slow deep breaths as we often do

58
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:23,520
but see if you can let the deeper breaths three quarters full not a strain to breathe just

59
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:30,000
deeper breath be breathing with confidence

60
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,919
with a kind of intentionality

61
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:43,280
volition that you're really behind and really

62
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,840
this is breathing confidently

63
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:58,479
breathing in deeply and then letting go of it all as you exhale

64
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:05,599
maybe a long exhale softening relaxing the body

65
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:19,840
breathing in confidently and exhaling letting go into embodied

66
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,680
strength embodied confidence

67
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,960
into and let your breathing return to normal

68
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:53,199
and take a few moments finding where in your body

69
00:07:53,520 --> 00:08:00,639
what parts what area of your body do you most associate with your strength

70
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,000
personal strength or

71
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:17,759
confidence if if you are going to do something with some

72
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:25,720
strength or real confidence dedication

73
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,880
is there some place where you would feel that strength or that confidence

74
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:40,680
in your chest or your belly hands or the feet

75
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:48,680
in the spine it could be anywhere

76
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:05,959
and if you have such a place that you associate with personal strength or confidence

77
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:14,080
breathe with it let your breathing kind of move through it

78
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,800
accompany it

79
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:32,800
as if gently calmly breathing is aligning itself with that

80
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,800
confidence

81
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:51,839
breathing is carrying that strength spreading it through the body

82
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,440
gently

83
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,600
let your inhales arise from your confidence and your

84
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,600
strength

85
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,640
and on the exhale

86
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,920
let go of your thoughts

87
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,040
let go of reactions

88
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,680
let go of self-preoccupation

89
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:55,639
let go of ways in which you are measuring yourself for

90
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,880
judging yourself

91
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:14,320
letting there be inner strength confidence

92
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:23,040
as you breathe in and as you exhale let go

93
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:29,360
and let go into that confidence

94
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,639
a confidence that reassures the mind

95
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:46,079
it doesn't need to think about things figure things out

96
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,959
it doesn't need to be involved in self-concern

97
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,959
self-preoccupation

98
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,240
confident to be here now

99
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,320
in this lived experience

100
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:22,440
and might there be for you a calm confidence

101
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,919
a confident come

102
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:38,640
where some subtleness or calmness

103
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:45,520
coexists with strength

104
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:51,000
a strength which is not asserting anything

105
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:59,440
as their strength which is not calling attention to itself

106
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,240
but is embodied strength

107
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:21,440
that offers confidence to being present here and now

108
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,120
may be present through the body

109
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:38,240
that offers confidence for about the value

110
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:46,840
of being aware being present to the experience here and now

111
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,120
feeling for a moment or two whatever degree of embodied confidence

112
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:05,440
or strength that's stability that's here

113
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:14,640
and staying somehow resting in that

114
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:22,240
turn your mind's eye outward to the people in your life in your

115
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,960
communities

116
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,960
the world of neighbors and colleagues and

117
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,200
people of your town your city your region

118
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,720
people you know and don't know

119
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:54,320
and with that confidence that strength gaze upon them kindly

120
00:28:54,799 --> 00:29:01,520
gaze upon the world with good will and friendliness

121
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:13,279
ready to attend to others

122
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:18,559
aware of them in their conditions their situation

123
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:24,158
where your inner strength does not direct you towards

124
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:31,679
conceit of your own but to care

125
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,039
of self and others

126
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,840
may this practice that we do

127
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,720
free us from conceit

128
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:55,360
and liberate a confidence that allows us to meet the

129
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:02,240
world with good will with care

130
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:08,080
may all beings be happy

131
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:16,880
may all beings be safe may all beings be peaceful

132
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,278
may all beings be free

133
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,559
do

134
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:49,520
so the theme this week is binding and unbinding

135
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:55,039
or being tangled and untangled

136
00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:01,440
and that there are qualities of our inner life qualities of being

137
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:08,399
that um can look like each other be related to kind of similar

138
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:15,120
but on either side of that divide and so sometimes in

139
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:20,960
letting go of how what these two are confused and letting go of

140
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:28,320
what how we get caught and entangled in attachments because the uh the the wholesome side of

141
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:34,640
it looks similar we might let go of that too but we want to keep the wholesome that

142
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,760
which is unbinding that which is helps us to become untangled

143
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,840
and so the conceit is one side of that divide for

144
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:51,039
today buddhism puts a tremendous emphasis on freedom from conceit

145
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:57,840
and sees that conceit is clearly an attachment and entanglement

146
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:04,799
and and then together with that is this philosophy this teaching that uh that we

147
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:10,720
to realize not self to realize how many things everything

148
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,480
but how many things in our life that we take somehow to be me myself and mine

149
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:22,159
aren't really that way and they're not really who i really am

150
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:27,519
and so to let go the entanglement with things that we appropriate for our

151
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:33,200
self-identity for the way we cling to identity and ideas

152
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,559
so these two ideas of not self and overcoming conceit then lends itself to

153
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:45,679
the idea that you're not supposed to in any kind of way be strong or be confident and show up in

154
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:51,519
some kind of confident clear way like you're really there you should probably sit in the back of the room you should

155
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:57,519
probably you know slump in the couch so people you know you're not to really you know

156
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:04,640
asserting yourself and but in fact buddhist practice

157
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:09,760
is meant to free the emerging qualities

158
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:16,880
strength emerging qualities of life that have nothing to do with attachment that

159
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,919
come from uh a the the the

160
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:28,799
release of deeper responses attitudes

161
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:35,279
feelings motivations for this world that we live in

162
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:41,519
and one of these can be a sense of confidence there can be strong confidence

163
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:47,679
in the dharma in practice of strong confidence in oneself that we've learned how to navigate

164
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:53,360
through the world wisely one of the ways to have that that's uh i

165
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,480
would like to suggest is easy to understand but maybe not to do so easy

166
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:04,399
to do is to be um confident

167
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:09,919
that we'll go through the world and not uh break the precepts

168
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:18,079
so hopefully all of you are confident you'll go through the world and not uh act on any impulse to

169
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:24,398
kill any any other human being you have confidence this is not what you're going to do

170
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:30,480
you're not going to steal from someone and then from there maybe hopefully you're not going to

171
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,240
cause harm through your sexuality misconduct there's where people kind of

172
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:42,079
that's part of the reason why their sexual misconduct is people start making exceptions

173
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:47,679
that uh and then that you don't lie and you don't engage in intoxication

174
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:54,240
but have confidence in your precepts so that we don't

175
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:01,440
you know we can have that confidence confidence we're not going to intentionally harm anyone

176
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:08,320
we're not going to purposefully go we'll restrain ourselves if necessary but that's not what we're going to do

177
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:15,040
and and so and then there's confidence in her ability to

178
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:20,560
not make things worse um and that's you know this is a powerful

179
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:27,520
thing whatever situation you're in don't make it worse you might not know what to do

180
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:33,520
maybe not knowing is important but not it's okay not to know maybe

181
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:39,440
but don't make the situation worse hold your tongue don't act if you think it's going to

182
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:45,280
make the situation worse and to have confidence that you know what to do like that

183
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:52,480
to have confidence in your practice that you can show up and be mindful and find your way with what's going on

184
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,000
and and and that confidence then feeds a kind of inner strength

185
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,880
and buddhist practice makes us a stronger and stronger human being as we go along it's kind of like

186
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,920
we're cultivating and developing muscles spiritual muscles

187
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,960
psychological muscles muscles of mindfulness muscles of concentration and

188
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,200
focus muscles of equanimity muscles of

189
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:26,480
non-reactivity muscles of understanding and wisdom and discernment

190
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:32,800
and so these become strong and that's that strength can feel embodied

191
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:39,200
and and so that when we show up someplace we don't show up with any hesitation we

192
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:44,880
don't show up in any way to kind of diminish ourselves we might not

193
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:51,119
we don't assert ourselves but we also don't diminish ourselves and there's a confidence in just being

194
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:56,160
present and that midpoint between pulling away

195
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:01,839
and asserting ourselves but just there fully this full

196
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:08,240
confidence in being present and here as if we count as if we belong here all that

197
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:15,119
so to navigate between conceit and his confidence and not confuse the two

198
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:20,480
in uh in buddhist teachings the conceit is said to be a product of

199
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:27,440
the imagination it is a

200
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,960
a function of its purpose is to advertise oneself the way it's

201
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:39,359
talked about in the ancient world is to hold up a banner a flag look at me i'm so great

202
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:45,440
somehow advertise myself is being great it's uh it

203
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,960
comes along with greed greed for a certain for my way and what

204
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:56,320
i want and who i want to be it

205
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:01,599
it thrives under it thrives with praise

206
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:07,200
and the searching for praise is part of the some one of the

207
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:13,440
functions of conceit it's a contraction it's a form of irritation for the heart

208
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:19,040
to have conceit oddly enough for many english-speaking people

209
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:26,320
the word conceit is often associated with arrogance which the buddhists also associated with

210
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:33,520
but it's also associated with a certain kind of preoccupation with self a contraction and tightness around self

211
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:38,880
that is a negative what we would call an english may be a negative conceit and that is

212
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:45,680
uh an attachment to being or a preoccupation or or kind of being entangled with

213
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:52,000
thinking of oneself as being less than others being less valuable than others or

214
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,280
something like that and um and that's just as much conceit as thinking that we're better than

215
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:03,280
others uh it still involves the self it involves comparisons

216
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,320
and the and the practice is supposed to free us from

217
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:15,040
establishing an identity based on comparing ourselves to others either this better

218
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:20,640
or worse than and and then what what can we do instead of

219
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:28,720
comparing ourselves is that we learn just to be we learn to be without comparisons

220
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:36,000
we learn to be without measuring ourselves against other people understand any kind of standards at all

221
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,160
we learn meditation to let go to do that there are some standards that

222
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:48,320
we might have to deal with the precepts for example the standards of

223
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:54,560
making amends for some of the harms we've done in the world the standards of learning how to speak

224
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:01,680
honestly truthfully kindly we might have to kind of clean up our act to some degree

225
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:08,640
in order so we can really let go and trust this moment trust ourselves

226
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:14,720
so that there can be an emergence of a non-arrogant

227
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:21,119
non-conceitful sense of real strength and presence

228
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:26,319
confidence aliveness and um

229
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:32,400
and so we do things then uh with without attachment without clinging to

230
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,440
anything but also wholeheartedly maybe

231
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:44,640
we don't we're not held back by attachments we're not held back by holding on to complacency or resistance

232
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:51,520
of any kind or ideas it's too hard but there's a freedom in what we do

233
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:58,480
that we do it wholeheartedly given the conditions of our mind and body the energy that's available and

234
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:05,760
and all that but there's not a complaining that comes along with doing there's a

235
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:14,240
just this is what i'm doing to whatever way that i can um this is what's doing so confidence

236
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:21,359
strength as part of dharma practice in fact uh there's a um

237
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:27,839
five strengths powers that the the mindfulness tradition that buddha

238
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:34,000
talks about it's the power of confidence the power of engagement

239
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,839
the power of mindfulness the power of samadhi

240
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:46,480
and the power of wisdom of discernment and

241
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:51,920
and and how can those powers flow through us emerge through us

242
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:58,960
without conceit i'd like to propose that conceit is always a react reactive response to the

243
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:05,920
world but that dharma confidence dharma strength is not

244
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,520
reacting to anything but is an emergent quality that emerges emerges through our

245
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:18,318
freedom that we allow for so um

246
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:28,240
so it may be for these next 24 hours you can look at this you can try to take a look at this

247
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:36,240
divide between two ways to be in the world one where we're entangled in self-concerns of some form

248
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:41,599
of other of how what people think of us both that or how we want people to think

249
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:47,359
of us judgments in ways we measure ourselves that we're entangled and caught in

250
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:53,920
conceit or or even arrogance or

251
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,440
even kind of self-diminishment that we might uh be caught in

252
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:06,079
verses and a whole other way to be in the world with confidence with certain strength

253
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:12,400
and to do this exercise and explore this i'd like to suggest that in whatever way that it is

254
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,440
appropriate for you that you uh

255
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:23,760
act in the world this day you find ways to behave or to do that

256
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,040
our expressions of confidence expressions of whatever innate strength that you can

257
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:35,359
tap into it might be as simple as when you're sitting in chairs you might

258
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:40,640
not slump but sit in some way that also allows you to relax and rest

259
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:46,560
but but really allows you to be you know it's a posture of confidence and strength

260
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:52,640
if you're cooking if you're washing dishes if whatever you're doing see if you see this to this day you can

261
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:57,760
do it with some way that allows something to emerge inside and be expressed

262
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:03,440
that is strength and confidence without conceit and as you do this

263
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:11,440
emergent thing of confidence and strength you might it might highlight where conceit is operating

264
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:17,280
and if you start seeing it don't despair seeing conceit clearly

265
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:23,440
is one of the great benefits of mindfulness practice and if you see it clearly then there's hope

266
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:30,000
for not having it to interfere with your life not to bind you and keep you in

267
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:36,880
entangled so thank you and um and

268
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:43,240
i hope this this exploration is nice for you
