1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:10,920
okay so uh so welcome folks uh yeah nice to

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:17,600
uh nice to see a lot of uh familiar names welcome to uh to new folks happy

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,880
to uh to be with you happy to be practicing and

4
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:31,960
um yeah so that's uh let uh sit or whatever posture body's in

5
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:40,160
and just take that posture

6
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,960
consciously e

7
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:44,079
just sensing what it would mean to be grounded this moment

8
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,959
and perhaps the the spine reaches ever so gently Towards the

9
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:28,920
Sky then we surrender everything else to gravity

10
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:05,480
we're practicing not being alarmed fed by Sam

11
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:17,680
Sor by this realm of uh Pleasure and Pain gain and

12
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,760
loss e

13
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:12,920
and we might use our our breathing it's a way of uh smoothing out

14
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,400
the energetic field of our body

15
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720
mind

16
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,639
e

17
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,680
for e

18
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:13,159
we practicing putting down the

19
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,199
project that we call our

20
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,680
life we're not trying to uh fix or help

21
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,960
things

22
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:51,280
along just kind of trusting that uh as we

23
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,520
surrender help is on its way we don't have to find

24
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
it

25
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
e

26
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
e

27
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,479
for for

28
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,120
it's just getting so

29
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,639
simple is this body breathing

30
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,079
silence beckoning us

31
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:07,320
help is on its

32
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:19,360
way and doesn't require you your

33
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
willfulness

34
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

35
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
e

36
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
e

37
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
e

38
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
e

39
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
e

40
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

41
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

42
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,040
e e

43
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:48,440
the phenomena arise fears arise thoughts

44
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:56,040
arise may become intimidated by them by what they

45
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,279
might mean

46
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,959
and so we freeze time and we try to make

47
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,519
meaning try to reassure

48
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,079
ourselves it's fair enough

49
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:41,519
but uh we are

50
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:51,920
practicing knowing all phenomena it's empty

51
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:24,160
experience becomes so

52
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,240
vivid but uh I L

53
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,919
attenuated

54
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:46,559
wispy space likee so there and barely

55
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,840
there e

56
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:02,440
if all we ever do is try to fix

57
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,760
ourself we will never know

58
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
ourself

59
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

60
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

61
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

62
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

63
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

64
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,520
e e

65
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:22,880
maybe we can say the anchor

66
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:32,520
silence and every bit of noise is

67
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:38,200
met with infinite

68
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
patience

69
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

70
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

71
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

72
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

73
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

74
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

75
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:31,159
e e

76
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,080
e e

77
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:38,679
okay so uh yeah good to good to sit with

78
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:46,120
you so I was uh on teaching a a young

79
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:52,640
adult Retreat uh last week and uh mostly folks in their

80
00:29:52,640 --> 00:30:03,120
20s and somebody asked a question very relevant to that development phase about uh comparing

81
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:08,880
mind the mind that um the mind that

82
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:17,840
compares and uh that is of course a time when uh identity you know is being

83
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:25,840
forged and a key way that we how we know who we are is by

84
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:35,398
looking at others and making comparisons and judgments greater than less than equal

85
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,799
to and there really they're kind of two Dimensions maybe we could say of this

86
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:49,880
comparing mind there's the kind of coarser level of me comparing myself

87
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:56,840
to another and then the second dimension is is sort of almost more fundamental

88
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:05,039
it's about measuring M measurement any sense of

89
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:12,679
territoriality and so on the coarser level um we we compare ourselves to

90
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:22,760
others right we we kind of turn ourselves into a noun into a thing

91
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:30,000
an Essence we turn others into a thing and then we assess the differences

92
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:38,080
you know kind of like you know laying one you know our vision of

93
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,279
ourselves against almost like two sheets of transparencies put against one

94
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:51,200
another seeing what the differences are and uh this is a very painful realm

95
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:59,559
you know we all know the pain of it uh this is the realm of arrogance and pity

96
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:05,480
and envy of

97
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:12,679
Pride shame is an evolutionary psychologist that described you know you described

98
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:18,559
pride and shame as the universal grammar of social

99
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:25,320
valuation the universal grammar of social valuation pride and shame and

100
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:32,880
when I saw that phrase I was like you know that does sound right but it also sounds

101
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:40,880
very gross you know the universal grammar of social valuation evaluations

102
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:46,919
you know um the uh SAS Joseph um Epstein was

103
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:56,000
talking talking about the seven deadly sins lust and gluttony greed laziness wrath pride and envy and said of the of

104
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:04,919
the seven deadly sins only only Envy is no fun at all right and that is maybe

105
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:13,120
the Hallmark of the kind of comparing mind you know the the gesture of being a

106
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:19,039
spectator observing uh the the object of self this

107
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:26,960
is very painful very painful and uh matu rard says uh in

108
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:33,159
every every instance Envy is the product of a wound to self-importance and the

109
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:40,960
fruit of an illusion what can other people's happiness possibly deprive us of nothing

110
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:46,240
of course only the ego can be wounded by it

111
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:53,799
and feel it as pain these are the results of our having forgotten our innermost

112
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:59,480
potential for affection peace

113
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:07,559
but you know it's not just feeling less than

114
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:13,440
that's painful even feeling greater than or even momentarily equal to the Buddha

115
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:19,480
says we have to get out of the game of comparison all

116
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:25,760
together and as we develop a more fluid sense of

117
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:33,960
self and maybe we say a not not self that's that's the most true form of

118
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:43,000
self-esteem as our Insight deepens the less impulse we have to do any comparing

119
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,720
to substantiate ourselves to deprecate

120
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:57,079
ourselves and then there's a more a more subtle sense of comparison that involves

121
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:05,680
any measurement the the the budha says like um whatever

122
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:11,440
one's obsessed with that's what one is measured

123
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:18,680
by and this is in a sense getting into a kind of Boutique level of

124
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:24,520
suffering but any measurement any measurement being here but not there

125
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:32,480
being greater or lesser there being any other side to our love

126
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,599
any other side to our knowing uh um

127
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:45,240
ascribing any characteristics to me all of that there's suffering it's not

128
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:50,560
Sublime so in the um godat Su uh this is

129
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:58,200
not the Buddha but uh monastic said um uh greed is a making

130
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:04,880
of measurement aversion is a making of measurement

131
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:10,520
delusion a making of measurement greed is a something

132
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:18,760
aversion a something delusion a something greed is a making of themes a

133
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:26,319
version a making of themes delusion a making of [Music]

134
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:33,560
themes the defilements greed hate and delusion are are all about

135
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:39,960
measurement about options and optimizing about a sense of

136
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:45,000
dislocation and lack me

137
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:52,880
here the object there me here now my happiness somewhere

138
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:59,160
out there in some future me here and now now and the ideal

139
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:04,800
version of me just beyond my grasp

140
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:12,680
me pinned between a messy past and an ominous

141
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:23,119
future and clinging clinging involves a lot of cognition of measurement of

142
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:28,800
strategizing and this carries some burden on the heart

143
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:35,160
we might say defilements greed ha and delusion there a something rather than a

144
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:41,720
nothing they're a theme rather than themess

145
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:47,760
Freedom much less of a something

146
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:53,000
themeless so what what we ask is like the alternative

147
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,440
to to making measurement the alternative to somethingness the alternative to

148
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:07,520
making themes and of course it's okay to measure sometimes

149
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:15,680
but if all we ever do is measure something fatigues in the

150
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:23,520
heart and sometimes the the the Brahma vajar the Divine abodes are described as

151
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:30,319
the four immeasurables loving kindness and compassion Joy

152
00:38:30,319 --> 00:38:36,640
sympathetic joy and equinity the four immeasurables four immeasurables this is

153
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:41,800
like alluding this is not a dualistic

154
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:49,400
love uh meta sahena the the Mind Made

155
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:54,599
vast made vast with

156
00:38:54,599 --> 00:39:01,280
love and this is a kind of love that um that

157
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:07,720
can't can't go wrong there's no unfolding that disqualifies this love

158
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:14,520
there's no other side to it there's nothing excluded from it it's not based on

159
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:18,960
measurement it's not expressed as a

160
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:25,680
measure the from again from the suas there's the

161
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:32,680
case where a monastic keeps pervading the first Direction with an awareness imbued with

162
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:38,839
Good Will likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth thus above

163
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:47,040
and below and all around everywhere in its entirety they keep pervading the all

164
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:52,160
encompassing Cosmos with an awareness imbued with

165
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:57,520
Good Will abundant enlarged immeasurable

166
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:03,720
without hostility and without ill will this is called the

167
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:14,440
immeasurable awareness release this is alluding to

168
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:19,920
um alluding to uh kind

169
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:26,359
of flavors of somati flavors of uh kind of

170
00:40:26,359 --> 00:40:35,599
formless s body where the the landscape is reduced all measurement Falls

171
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:41,599
away and the world of experience is reduced to one

172
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:46,839
thing to space to knowing to

173
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:58,280
emptiness and the space can be uh pervaded pervaded by by love

174
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:07,319
and there's um there's no no phenomena are being modeled by our

175
00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:16,480
brain except that space flavored with love not even our

176
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:23,839
body and we just keep

177
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:30,680
dropping distinctions we keep not caring

178
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:36,000
weirdly to develop this love we keep not

179
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,319
caring we trust that um all the alarm Bells all

180
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:48,880
the alarm bells that go off in samsara that go off in the circuits of our body

181
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:55,920
are false alarms that no phenomena will hurt

182
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:03,680
me and so I don't need to tend to it there's a kind of relinquishment The

183
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:10,359
Silence of Letting Go letting phenomena fade thin

184
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,839
out and there's so much you know there's so much relief in

185
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:25,480
not measuring you know I I have a measuring mind there's so much relief in not

186
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:33,040
measuring not being measured by the world you

187
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:40,200
know and then distinctions are reborn here

188
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:46,040
and there body and mind you and me liking and

189
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:54,400
disliking but it's hard to forget just how simple the mind can be and how free

190
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:00,280
how free one might be when measurement goes

191
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:07,520
silent this sounds maybe like oh this rarified States or something to Crave

192
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:15,040
to but um we don't

193
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:22,720
uh we don't crave our way to non-measurement right this is more

194
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:27,960
measurement and we don't crave rarified States for

195
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:34,079
themselves or to solve their our problems you

196
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:40,400
know we really honor um the

197
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:45,920
immeasurable mind you know we honor rarified

198
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:52,359
States for the kind of for the gentle tender

199
00:43:52,359 --> 00:43:58,400
shadow that they cast Over the rest of our lives

200
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:06,078
the way is we our measurement is haunted by the

201
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:14,000
immeasurables soer this for your consideration uh sweet to uh to think of

202
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,119
you wherever you are and um even though we're on like an

203
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:28,640
8C time delay uh feels very intimate right

204
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:36,040
now okay see you uh see you next uh next week
