127
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,679
so the guided meditation

128
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:40,240
invited us to to tap into to invite this meta

129
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:46,480
the the generosity mentor this before because we all have this sense

130
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:52,559
and yet sometimes we need creative ways creative ways to really access

131
00:32:52,559 --> 00:33:00,559
what it's like to have a heart of generosity sitting sitting with generosity with what arises

132
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:06,640
instead of judgment instead of grasping pushing away what is the spirit

133
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:12,320
of generosity spirit of ghana that can support

134
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:18,399
all of our actions all of the actions of our mind and

135
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:26,640
and the actions of our speech the actions of our our body to all kinds of actions

136
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:32,880
so [Music] treating generosity as i mentioned

137
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,559

144
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:31,358

145
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:37,200
generosity of spirit when we offer others

146
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:42,800
safety from ourselves it is offering

147
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:48,320
it is cultivating ethical conduct morality offering non-harming it's an

148
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:54,638
act of generosity when other people feel safe in our presence so we can see that

149
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:03,359
as an extension of generosity and also generosity donna as

150
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:08,560

153
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:27,200

154
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,560

155
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:39,920
stage of awakening enlightenment you know i've got it i've got the badge yay it's not

156
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,839
something you get awakening it's not a thing you acquire it's a gift

157

161
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:19,599

162
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:27,839
awakening and it is said that the two wings of the bird of awakening one wing

163
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:33,760

00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:08,400
that supports compassion for ourselves and for others it's an act of giving it's a giving of love it's a giving of

169
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:14,240
care giving of meta and

170
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:20,320
similarly generosity with cultivating wisdom

171
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:28,240
and i'll get a little detailed for a moment so cultivating wisdom

172
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:33,599
and seeing the three truths seeing the three characteristics

173
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,800
the characteristics of existence

174
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:48,960
impermanence unsatisfactoriness in personality or not self

175
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:56,560
not self it's not personal so generosity supports us helps with

176
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:05,200
cultivating wisdom seeing these three um characteristics of being human

177
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:11,760
so generosity when you're generous it helps you to see impermanence they're

178
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:17,520
intertwined it is impermanent things come things go

179
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:25,119
yes i let go of this thing that either this object my time my

180
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:31,440
my um [Music] you know let go give you my affection et cetera it says i need it it rises and

181
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:38,160
passes it's not for us to keep it's not for us to to hang on to it's not you know here's this bell oh it's not for us

182
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:44,720
it's it comes it goes so there's there's generosity helps us

183
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:50,000
cultivate and really see anita impermanence also

184
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,040
with dukkha unsatisfactoriness there is unsatisfactoriness with holding

185
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:01,680
on to something holding on to everything for our own sake we know this the sense of scarcity

186
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:07,119
the sense of scarcity the sense of uh tightness

187
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:12,960
that can actually create unsatisfactoriness can create suffering so generosity

188
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:18,240
can help us see and uh and work with dukkha

189
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:25,040
and perhaps most importantly it's anata which is not self impersonality

190
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:31,359
so ultimately generosity helps us see that it's not

191
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:36,560
about me and it's also not about you

192
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:44,160
that there is no separation between the giver and the receiver and on some level

193
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:49,440
there is no giver there is no receiver

194
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:57,280
i'll leave that as a coin it is said

195
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:02,720
that the gift of the dharma is the biggest gift

196
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:10,000
and i like to invite you not to just think of that as you know being a dharma teacher and and

197
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,000
talking dharma but dharma is is much more expansive the vision of dharma what

198
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:23,200
dharma is so you can give the gift of dharma to a friend to a colleague

199
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:29,040
to a parent with your presence we say

200
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:34,880
don't be a buddha don't be a buddha i'm sorry

201
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:41,280
don't don't talk about buddhism be a buddha this is often what we say at the

202
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:47,440
end of retreat so when people go home we say okay because everybody's excited they want to go home and proselytize and

203
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:54,640
tell everybody to go on a retreat you should go on retreat we tell people okay don't talk about buddhism but be a

204
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:00,960
buddha be a buddha so show up show up with kindness show up with

205
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:06,640
generations show up with generosity of spirit that is the biggest gift it's the gift

206
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:12,079
of dharma you're giving a gift of dharma to others you're enabling

207
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:19,839
their heart you're enabling their dharma their beauty their goodness to to glow

208
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:25,599
and grow as you support as you give them the gift of your presence your gift of your dharma

209
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:32,319
um so so we can all give the gift of dharma with

210
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:39,440
our presence with um the way we show up in the world the way we can be a buddha

211
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:46,560
you don't necessarily need to to talk about it um and

212
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:52,480
last thing i wanted to um yeah

213
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:58,079
maybe i'll skip this part there's so much more to say maybe i'll say this briefly

214
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:04,240
um generosity of spirit is also thought to

215
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:11,040
be um the pillar of of joy and here's a reference for

216
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:17,640
those who liked like to read the book um

217
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:24,400
by dalai lama and desmond tutu called the book of joy they talk about eight

218
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:30,640
pillars of joy which is a beautiful book highly recommended

219
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:36,640
actually i spent a series during happy hour last year covering the different pillars

220
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:44,079
and when they get to the last pillar they get to generosity which is the last pillar and they say oh actually

221
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:51,680
generosity of spirit in many ways it includes all the other pillars of joy

222
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:59,359
it includes compassion it includes gratitude it includes forgiveness humor humility acceptance

223
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:05,040
and and wise perspective it includes everything so basically if you practice that

224
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:10,480
generosity of spirit everything else is included in that

225
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:18,240
and i like to end with um with this invitation

226
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:24,720
that can we think of generosity expand our view of generosity this

227
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:30,720
generosity of spirit towards ourselves towards others can we

228
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:38,640
offer everything we do we say everything we think

229
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:44,160
can we consider offer our life

230
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:49,838
as an offering as an act of generosity

231
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:58,160
can everything be a gift can we consider our life the way we live what we think say

232
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:03,760
and do as an offering

233
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:09,200
to others as an offering to ourselves what if we consider that set that

234
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:16,480
intention even if we align for it just for a few seconds or minutes a day

235
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:21,839
it will grow it can grow and transform the way we show up and the way the way
