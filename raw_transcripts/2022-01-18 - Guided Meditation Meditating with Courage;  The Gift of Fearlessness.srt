1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,279
so good evening those of you here and

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:13,360
in the west coast and hello to everyone else wherever you are

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,560
and happy to be here have a chance to be here in monday evening and

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,000
uh you know for a good part of the last 30 years i've come down

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
to teach these monday evening talks and so they're quite quite um

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:42,640
um close to my heart to be here and so i appreciate this opportunity

7
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:50,239
and for the

8
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:57,600
meditation this evening i would like to suggest

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,199
an idea that you're welcome to ignore

10
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:11,880
if it doesn't work for you but the idea is that you would sit

11
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:19,040
practice mindfulness during this next 30 minutes or so

12
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:29,200
to do it with courage had any indication that there's fear

13
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:37,920
sit with courage and you might be surprised by the layers

14
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,759
of fear that we go through as the mind relaxes

15
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:50,320
it's like going through the layers of the mind layers of the heart and not uncommonly there's places of

16
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:58,000
fear and certain layers or certain corners and to not see it as a mistake

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,479
to not see it as indication that something's wrong with you or wrong with anything

18
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:11,520
but rather see it's something for this period of time something to sit

19
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,560
with but to sit with courage a courage that maybe also

20
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,800
allows you to do it with the heart curl in french the word courage comes

21
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,160
from heart the kind of courage that

22
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,480
keeps your heart open keeps you so present and aware and

23
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,519
willing to experience what's here for you

24
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,760
so this is not the courage of bracing yourself or stealing yourself through something

25
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,959
but rather the courage to be present for whatever is

26
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:02,080
but to be present kindly but with a kindness that's strong

27
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,640
to sit with courage so to begin by assuming a meditation

28
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:16,959
posture that has some qualities characteristics of courage

29
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,959
that evoke some courage for you

30
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,280
if you're sitting maybe sitting a little more upright than confident

31
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,760
adjusting your neck so that your neck also

32
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:43,440
somehow has space at the back of the neck

33
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,720
for there to be a kind of strength and courage

34
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:57,519
maybe the chest is a little bit expanded

35
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:04,560
not proudly not effortless effortfully but just as you sit up straight to allow

36
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,560
the chest to expand in a confident way

37
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
in a way that perhaps brings your heart to the forefront

38
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:26,960
the sensitivity the emotional sensitivity that is there in the your heart

39
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,800
is awakened and then

40
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:42,440
gently close your eyes and taking some long slow deep breaths

41
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:52,478
but see if it's possible to do so with a sense of courage or strength

42
00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:02,400
perhaps even to use a dangerous concept maybe even with some sense of power

43
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,680
the power of presence the power of showing up and being

44
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,840
present here and now

45
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:24,479
and as you exhale to relax without giving out the up the strength

46
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:30,960
and the courage but relaxing whatever tension is unnecessary

47
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,840
soften relax

48
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,919
and letting your breathing return to normal

49
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,479
and if it's available maybe you'll feel a gentleness

50
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:20,720
in the breathing some parts of the breathing might feel

51
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,000
the cycle of breathing might feel gentle

52
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:33,000
soft peaceful

53
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:46,400
and courage and strength can coexist with this tenderness softness

54
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,840
gentleness of the breathing

55
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,560
gently relaxing on the exhale

56
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:33,520
relaxing their mind relaxing and quieting your thinking

57
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:41,759
so there's more room and awareness to show up and be present

58
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:50,479
here in this body with courage and strength

59
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,080
and with peacefulness and gentleness

60
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,720
breathing in and breathing out

61
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,799
and there's where you come to the end of the sitting

62
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:59,840
can you tap into a place of quiet courage

63
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,480
strength

64
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:14,559
the courage not to assert yourself on the world but the courage to show up fully

65
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:22,240
be present for yourself all of who you are

66
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:29,399
be present for others for all of who they are

67
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:49,760
when there's some courage perhaps it's easier also to have respect

68
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:56,480
for oneself and to have respect for others

69
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:06,399
may we as we come out of this meditation aspire

70
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:13,200
to be present for others and for ourselves

71
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:21,279
with a steady presence with attentiveness and listening and

72
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,279
curiosity

73
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:41,919
may all beings be happy may all beings be safe

74
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:52,760
may all beings be peaceful and may all beings everywhere be free

75
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:12,710
[Music]

76
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:26,880
so hello and

77
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:36,960
on this pla on this evening of martin luther king's

78
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:44,799
holiday and i would like to read a quote of his

79
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:57,360
people fail to get along because they fear each other

80
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:03,600
they fear each other because they don't know each other they don't know each other because they

81
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,840
have not communicated with each other

82
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,599
so someone read this to me or posted this

83
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:22,720
just a couple hours ago and i was struck by it and

84
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:28,720
thinking of martin luther king as a great champion for

85
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:35,839
non-violent civil disobedience nonviolent protest

86
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:41,280
i remember that my first real interest in buddhism

87
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,720
was when i was a freshman in college

88
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:54,480
and i was of the age that could be drafted for the war in vietnam

89
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,560
and so that was a big topic of discussion the other freshmen

90
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:07,440
and i took the i always had the seemingly the extreme pacifist position

91
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,720
i didn't believe in war and wasn't going to fight in a war

92
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:19,040
and um so i had this very strong ideal

93
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:24,720
pacifist ideal but i didn't think of past this kind of

94
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,000
pacifism as being passive as being doing nothing

95
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,760
i felt that it to live up to this ideal i had to be willing to put my life on

96
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,359
the line at a protest or to confront some of the injustices in

97
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:47,520
society and i recognized that i was afraid

98
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:53,680
to do so and i didn't feel good about having fear not to live up to

99
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:59,520
my ideals so i searched around

100
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:05,520
for how to address this fear and i don't think i had any

101
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:12,640
strong irrational reasons for this but for some reason

102
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:18,640
i came upon buddhist practice that this was the way

103
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:25,760
to find how to work with this fear to work through this fear and it didn't really propel me into the

104
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:31,520
world of practice that was a still a year or two away but

105
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,359
it was kind of the first kind of

106
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:43,200
interest that i had so to

107
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,760
hear this wonderful quote from martin luther king today

108
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:55,680
and that about fear and that um

109
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:01,200
the people fear each other and i think that uh

110
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:06,839
he's saying something very important here that sometimes assertion of

111
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:12,240
power over over others sometimes hate

112
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:18,640
mistrust can have its root in fear

113
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,720
and there's many things that we fear i think it's a hugely

114
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:31,599
pervasive pervasive attitude many people have anxiety

115
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:38,078
and and part of buddhist practice is to

116
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:47,520
encounter that fear to meet that fear to learn to be present for it

117
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:53,760
and to not cower from the fear but rather to

118
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:59,359
show up for it to really find a place within

119
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:05,599
that has the capacity to be with fear

120
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:11,680
not succumbing to fear and part of the

121
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:19,119
wonderful possibility of meditation and mindfulness is to learn how to show up in a strong

122
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:27,200
way how to be present in a strong way to what is challenging what is difficult

123
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:33,200
including fear and life is very different

124
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:39,440
if we are not influenced by our fear now there are certainly things to be

125
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:45,680
appropriately afraid of and buddhism recognizes that there's

126
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:52,560
appropriate fear and inappropriate fear skillful fear and unskillful fear

127
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:58,640
and compromising our ethical integrity

128
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:05,680
is something to be appropriately afraid of succumbing to hatred

129
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:11,839
or greed is something to be appropriately afraid of

130
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:19,040
but succumbing to anxiety and so coming to our imagination

131
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:26,960
of what we think is dangerous is not appropriate it's not helpful

132
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:34,320
and to be able to distinguish between the fear that's appropriate and the fear that's inappropriate is part of the

133
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:41,520
benefit that comes from stopping and taking a good look at fear understanding what it's about

134
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:47,680
and uh is it uh about the future and if it's about the future how much

135
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:53,920
does the imagination play that role and how strong is your image imagination

136
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:59,119
sometimes the imagination is so strong that its tendrils of imagination reach

137
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:05,119
down into our muscles and activate them with fear sensations

138
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:12,960
fear contractions and the fear can feel so much more anxiety and so much more real

139
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:22,280
it doesn't feel like it's imaginary it feels real because the imagination has triggered a real response in the body

140
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:33,280
and it's not to be dismissive of the power of fear or the challenge or fear

141
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:39,119
and it's certainly not to be dismissive of fear itself fear maybe should always be seen as a

142
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:44,880
messenger and it's a messenger that something here needs attention

143
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:51,680
and sometimes is that what needs attention is what's in the world so as martin luther king said

144
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:58,480
that if we don't know each other that we can be afraid of each other

145
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:05,280
and so the fear of others might be a message that we should get to know the other person

146
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:13,200
i've had many kind of um negative feelings for people

147
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:19,119
and but by going and talking to them

148
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:24,640
i'm surprised how quickly they go away and sometimes i've had you know that

149
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:30,160
could be also with people that we're afraid of and occasionally it's because people we

150
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:35,520
have occasion reason to be afraid we have the wisdom to know when it's

151
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:40,800
appropriate but sometimes we go be counterphobic

152
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,240
show up and say you know what's happening here and can you tell me what's you know tell me

153
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:54,318
what's happening and can i get to know you let me tell you something about myself

154
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:02,560
and so fear is a multi-faceted complicated

155
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:07,839
thing one of the things we want to be careful for when we

156
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:14,000
are mindful is not to see fear as a mistake or that we're bad or that

157
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:21,520
it's something wrong but rather it's a sign of something that

158
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:27,359
we want to show up for and sometimes we want to show up for ourselves and there are layers of fear

159
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:32,720
within ourselves that really could use our attention

160
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:39,520
and the attention that i've learned that is most helpful for

161
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:45,119
the layers of fear within us is the is the attention that helps the

162
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:51,200
fear feel safe that helps the fear uh

163
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:56,400
not feel like you're being dismissed or seen as wrong or we're trying to escape

164
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:02,400
from it and run away from it and

165
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:08,800
so [Music] an awareness an attention a mindfulness

166
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:15,119
that holds the fear that's present for the fear the image that

167
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:20,480
has been very very valuable for me is the image of taking my hands and

168
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:26,160
cupping them together and coming underneath something and just holding it there

169
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:33,760
and so coming underneath and holding the fear touching the fear

170
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:39,520
helping the fear rest in the in the palms of awareness

171
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:46,800
and then breathing with the fear and meditation is a fantastic place to

172
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:52,800
do this because hopefully when we sit and meditate in that time

173
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:59,760
there's nothing to fear there's no external dangers that are threatening us and so maybe it's a place where it's

174
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:06,240
safe enough to offer this kind of attention to fear and see what it opens up to and where to

175
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:12,000
where it takes us and sometimes it takes us deeper and deeper into ourselves

176
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:19,520
and sometimes it takes us into the ability the strength and the courage to be able to talk to others get to know

177
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:26,640
them better and hopefully let them get to know us better

178
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:32,360
i wonder how often people's despair

179
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:39,200
[Music] upset um about

180
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:46,800
what's happening in the world is based on fear that is reasonable enough to have

181
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:53,200
but the fear is unduly influencing us that somehow we've allowed the fear to

182
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:59,920
take over as opposed to having the fear accompany us

183
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:06,560
i learned some years ago that i had fear

184
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:12,319
and i i just felt i just imagined the fear was sitting on my shoulder

185
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:19,920
it accompanied me through a situation that was a had some danger involved and

186
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:25,680
and but i i was not afraid but fear was present for me

187
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:31,680
and and i kind of came to i just came i didn't think that i would be able to

188
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:38,560
not be afraid i would not have the fear but i could

189
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:46,800
i knew how not to have the fear take over so i just imagined was sitting on my left shoulder and it was my companion

190
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:51,520
as i went through the dangers i was doing going through

191
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:58,000
so one of the

192
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:04,720
possibilities with mindfulness practice with mindfulness is to cultivate a new relationship with

193
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:10,640
fear a new relationship with anxiety one in which

194
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:18,079
we it's not only it doesn't somehow have an impact on us because we show up

195
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:25,359
strong enough courageous enough that we're able to be present and breathe with it without believing it necessarily

196
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:31,520
or identifying with it or taking it on without letting the

197
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:41,720
the all the muscles kind of contract and react around the fear so the fear gets um accentuated

198
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:50,240
so what if the gift that we able to give the world

199
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:57,280
is the gift of fearlessness and what this means in buddhism

200
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:02,480
is that um it's a gif giving people the gift that they

201
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:08,319
don't have to be afraid of us and so rather than being so focused on

202
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:13,760
our own fear one way to let put the fear up on its

203
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:19,920
place on the left shoulder perhaps is to turn the whole fear thing around

204
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:26,640
and offer ourselves to the world as someone that others do not have to be afraid of

205
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:33,760
to offer the gift of fearlessness and

206
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:40,400
and also there's a gift of fearlessness for ourselves that we do not fear

207
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:46,319
and when we don't fear others that's a gift to them as well it's not a healthy thing

208
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:52,160
to have anxiety and fear for others now there are times where it's

209
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:57,440
appropriate to be afraid of others they are dangerous and um

210
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:03,760
but there's plenty of times when that the fear we have the social fears we have

211
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:11,760
maybe are not as appropriate as the emotion believes maybe we don't have to succumb to it

212
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:17,839
and so to learn how to to give ourselves the gift of fearlessness

213
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:25,119
either by not having the fear or having a strength and a presence where we

214
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:32,079
we recognize the fear but we are stronger than the fear

215
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:40,480
so to sit with fear to practice with fear and to begin discovering that we have

216
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:46,160
strengths that we didn't know to have courage

217
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:51,599
to have a heart that can has the strength to stay open and

218
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:59,760
present and sensitive to this world a heart that can look directly

219
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:07,599
at what is happening look reality right in the eye and see for what it is

220
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:14,480
i don't think what i'm saying this evening is easy it's not something it is something that

221
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:21,359
requires wisdom and care but it's a wisdom that comes from stopping and taking a good look

222
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:27,200
really studying a situation look if recognizing what's really happening

223
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:34,160
so that fear is not doesn't evoke the imagination or running away or

224
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:39,760
cutting ourselves off from what's happening but we use it as a reminder

225
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:44,960
now is it's a messenger now is the time to pay more careful attention

226
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:51,839
what's really happening here and if it is a real real world danger

227
00:49:51,839 --> 00:50:00,480
then perhaps we're in a better position to take care of ourselves and find safety and if it's a

228
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:06,640
comes from social anxieties or imaginary fears of what could and

229
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:12,640
possibly can happen in the future i wonder if there's not there isn't

230
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:18,000
another alternative than changing the world running away

231
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:25,280
but rather to the opportunity to really stop and breathe with fear and take a look at

232
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:31,440
fear hold the fear and find the strength the power

233
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:37,440
the courage to be with the fear

234
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:43,359
in a way that helps the fear be safe helps the fear feel reassured

235
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:50,319
because it's being held in the strength and courage of your good heart

236
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:57,440
so those are my thoughts this evening for martin luther king's holiday

237
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:03,359
i think that i don't know how much fear martin luther king had but

238
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:08,960
he certainly was a courageous man

239
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:15,280
who kept showing up in all kinds of situations of great danger

240
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:22,319
and it took a lot of courage to show up in his non-violent way when others wanted to harm him

241
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:28,400
i think it's a great lesson and it's a great buddhist lesson

242
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:34,800
to live the power of non-violence with courage

243
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:40,400
the dedication to change the world for the better

244
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:45,520
because if we can change the world even in the smallest kind of ways

245
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:51,838
we do change it for everyone and to change it

246
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:57,839
in the direction of fearlessness of safety of getting to know people of

247
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:05,040
communicating deeply so that in that knowing in that communication in that

248
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:11,440
recognizing each other the depths of other people are humanity perhaps we teach

249
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:17,359
we learn ourselves not to fear others but maybe also more importantly

250
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:21,200
we teach others not to fear us

251
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:31,520
may we give each other the gift of fearlessness may we all live in safety

252
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,839
thank you
