1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:08,960
okay so hello to everyone from around the world so nice to see all of

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,639
you let's go ahead and prepare for

3
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:20,160
meditation so settling in finding a

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,680
posture that will be comfortable for you for a half hour or

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,840
so I invite you to close the eyes if that works for you bring the

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,480
attention inward having a sense of connection and

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:49,520
intimacy with your own experience at this moment perhaps starting with the

8
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:56,680
body noticing your posture maybe you're in the sitting

9
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,920
posture or you could be standing or lying down

10
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,920
and just having an overall General sense of the body in the position that it's

11
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:24,000
in and then inviting finding some kind of balance and

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,360
ease in the posture so checking to see if you're using

13
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:39,560
a lot of muscles to hold yourself in this position and seeing if you could find a position that's quite balanced so

14
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:45,960
that there's not much need for muscles to hold you

15
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:55,399
up softening

16
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:08,239
inviting ease in some of the main places we carry

17
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,120
tension so maybe in the face the

18
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,280
jaw inviting ease through the

19
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,560
shoulders down into the chest and the belly

20
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,720
muscles of the low

21
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,280
back

22
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:51,000
softening and also finding a comfortable position for the arms and legs

23
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:09,440
and then connecting in to whatever degree of groundedness you feel from having

24
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:19,200
balanced and invited ease in the body is there a sense of stability or

25
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:28,080
settledness in the physical aspect of you

26
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,319
maybe sensing the natural Stillness of the body when it's

27
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,840
sitting and even if the body is uncomfortable in certain ways you know

28
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:01,720
those pains and aches and challenges that we have

29
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:09,079
there can still be a sense of groundedness and connectedness to what you're sitting on

30
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:11,560
to the

31
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:20,320
Earth body is fine as it is

32
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,280
and to start off today in the mind and the

33
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:48,919
Heart the invitation is to evoke or connect in with the quality of

34
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:58,560
sincerity so maybe locating the part of your heart that is really sincere about

35
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,039
meditation or about the spiritual life and offering that

36
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:10,520
part Center Stage offering it respect and

37
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:18,199
care this may be only a small part or it may be a tentative part of

38
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:25,759
you but the suggestion is to give it a a warm welcome

39
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:37,080
today acknowledging it yeah there is in my heart a a depth of

40
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,560
interest in this

41
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:50,440
practice even if the rest of my life is busy or sometimes directed in other ways

42
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:56,478
yeah there is a part though that's really really

43
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,000
sincere and maybe it's easy to contact

44
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,758
that and then releasing

45
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:30,759
the explicit connection to that an opening to experience

46
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:41,360
will gradually open so beginning again with the experience of the body noticing now the

47
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:48,880
body in the space that you're in sense of the room around you or maybe you're

48
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:57,840
outside sense of your actual location in space

49
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,199
and then also a sense of the bodily

50
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:18,360
Sensations inside that you're

51
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:27,159
experiencing the clearest one might be the breath coming in going out

52
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:37,039
the body contains Myriad

53
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:49,120
Sensations just letting those come forth be noticed

54
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,479
opening further to include explicitly noticing the

55
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:20,000
sounds where you are there's the sound of my voice and

56
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:28,960
there may also be sounds in the room sounds outside

57
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:39,560
people animals electronic equipment

58
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,640
heaters the things in our lives

59
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,320
we don't need to put a lot of effort into trying to hold all of these things

60
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:22,560
that I'm naming at once it's just that we open to the potential for each one allowing that

61
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:30,560
into the field of our awareness if such a thing should come in

62
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,440
a sound or a sensation of the

63
00:09:51,160 --> 00:10:00,680
breath and in the same way gently opening further to include any emotions

64
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:08,079
that may be present or maybe a general mood in the

65
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:17,399
heart how are you feeling in general and also the shorter

66
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:22,920
term flickers of emotion that come through

67
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,920
maybe there's a moment of

68
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,560
joy and then a lingering sense of

69
00:10:52,760 --> 00:11:01,720
sadness maybe you have a general mood of ease this morning or afternoon or

70
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,639
evening and then a flicker of

71
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,680
irritation just letting those experiences play on the screen of the

72
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:27,399
Mind along with any other Sensations or sounds and physical experiences that are

73
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:30,399
coming

74
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:10,079
and see now if you can include thoughts and

75
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:18,399
intentions in this Same Spirit as things that simply arise and

76
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:25,680
pass coming in going out

77
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:37,120
thoughts also are just movements of mind maybe they have a physical feeling

78
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:45,800
also phenomena experiences that come and go

79
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:43,519
and all of this is known by this quality of

80
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,720
awareness of

81
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:01,720
knowing kind of a heartful knowing that's

82
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:09,800
open to whatever experience arises and allows any experience also to

83
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:23,600
pass the whole gamut of what comes into the human mind

84
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:38,399
and noticing that as we open gently piece by piece it is possible to be with

85
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,000
all of this in a restful

86
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,040
way for

87
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:40,120
it's also a natural part of the human experience that the mind gets distracted

88
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:46,800
or caught up or contracted around something in

89
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:58,800
particular and in that case you could reinvoke that part of you

90
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,920
that that is sincere and touch that distraction with

91
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,959
the sincerity of caring for your meditation

92
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:14,600
your spiritual life just

93
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:21,319
see see if that softens the sense of caught

94
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
upness

95
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,880
for for

96
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,799
for

97
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
the

98
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,440
I

99
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:58,400
and as you continue to rest with the flow of experience and what awareness is

100
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:07,000
now naturally knowing you could see what kind of

101
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,240
meditation or what happens in your practice if you

102
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:21,799
allow the sincerity to have some space will the Mind settle in and pick

103
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:28,840
up the breath will it stay in open awareness

104
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:41,880
what is the Dharma want to do in you right

105
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
now

106
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
for

107
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
for

108
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,520
for for

109
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,400
e

110
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,360
for

111
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:17,000
and gently now

112
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:24,960
reconnecting with the sense of the body sitting

113
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:35,960
allowing your awareness to generally

114
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:42,960
sense position of the Body Sensations in the

115
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:56,320
body noticing what kinds of emotions or

116
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,240
thoughts are present

117
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:10,200
if any and perhaps sensing

118
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:17,679
into any space that you feel in the mind or the heart or the

119
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:30,120
body that which surrounds our experience or which provides the

120
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:38,640
background for experience to arise in noticing the contrast the experiences

121
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,120
and the

122
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:55,320
space often when we let the Dharma lead both of those aspects become

123
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,919
clearer sharper

124
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:11,360
and perhaps considering As you move out of the meditation the session today into

125
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:18,600
your regular life how would it be to let the Dharma

126
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:25,159
if that terminology makes sense take something of the

127
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:31,240
lead bringing our spiritual heart to

128
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:36,799
bear on just the ordinary activities could be the same type of

129
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:42,480
activities but done from the sense of practice or from the sense of walking

130
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:48,840
the path the benefits that would bring to our own

131
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:57,200
heart and also to others without our even having to talk

132
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:04,960
about our practice or the Dharma we would be expressing that

133
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:11,360
somehow there's a saying in the Dharma that

134
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,519
others are not so happy when I'm a Buddhist but they're very happy when I'm

135
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:22,880
a Buddha so carrying with

136
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:31,159
us our sense of the Dharma and the path for the benefit of for

137
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,959
[Music]

138
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,380
[Music]

139
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:12,320
[Music] so I'd like to start today with a story

140
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:18,760
that was told to me by an older man probably in his

141
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:25,519
70s and he just showed up one day in a class that I was teaching I didn't know

142
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:34,519
him before and he said that 50 years ago roughly he

143
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:40,720
had experienced a profound spiritual opening that was so profound he couldn't

144
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:46,960
quite relate to it at the time and his response was just to go

145
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:54,399
back to his regular life to his career his family other things um but this experience that he

146
00:30:54,399 --> 00:31:01,240
had had kept lingering in the back of his mind and sometimes he had made attempts

147
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:09,440
during his life to connect with spirituality but he hadn't really landed on anything that felt right for him and

148
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,720
so he had just um had just LED his life as as was

149
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:22,200
expected in the world and when he talked with me about it it was clear that his heart was

150
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:27,760
hurting in some way he had set aside something that was deeply meaningful to

151
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:33,440
him him for decades uh in order to live a more conventional

152
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:40,240
life and I wondered if he was bringing all of this to me because something in

153
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:45,880
his subconscious was sensing that maybe he didn't have much time left in this

154
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:51,360
life or at least you know not much time when he would have good enough

155
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:56,600
health so I felt like what the thing to do was was to strongly encourage him to

156
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:04,440
get serious about his spiritual seeking I think I even said something to the effect of hey you may not have much time

157
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:11,320
to resolve this yearning in your heart so go out and find what you need to find

158
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:20,039
and this is it and he didn't come back so um but I got

159
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:29,120
the sense something had landed so I hope he found what he was looking for even after a 50-year delay

160
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:35,279
and I open with this story which I know is kind of a powerful story uh in order

161
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:40,440
to say a couple of things directly first of all it's never too

162
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:48,120
late to get started um but second you do need to act on your heart's calling if you're

163
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:53,399
feeling such a thing so if you've had some kind of an opening or a yearning or

164
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:58,919
an intuition about the spiritual life if we have that but we don't give it any

165
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:04,320
space so if we keep living in the way that's expected by the people around us

166
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:10,080
and by the world then it will fade a bit it doesn't you know it's like a plant

167
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:17,120
that needs sunlight and space in order to grow and it can't do that if we don't

168
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:22,799
give it any space so you know the alternative to

169
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:28,279
that is to give your spiritual calling some space to take root and to grow and

170
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:34,440
to see what comes of that and I've noticed that people who prioritize their

171
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:40,679
heart's wishes deepest wishes may not always have an easy life but they tend

172
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:48,120
not to have any regrets either so we've made it to the last day

173
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:54,679
of this week about our spiritual direction that we might be thinking

174
00:33:54,679 --> 00:34:00,279
about at the beginning of a new year and so maybe it's time to ask a

175
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:05,320
question what are you doing with your life it's an important question at any

176
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:12,358
stage of life actually and you know how can a person use this life well I think

177
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:21,520
that's a great question and I love it because it has so many answers there isn't just one way um but there maybe is

178
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:28,320
your way and so you know maybe one way to answer this question in a very

179
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,919
general way is to see our life as an act of walking a path you know to consider

180
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:40,520
ourselves to be a practitioner that's what I am I'm a bunch of other things too you know maybe

181
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:47,720
a parent a partner a worker a Community member a friend to VAR in various other

182
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:53,760
situations but at the heart of it all you know I'm a practitioner of some kind

183
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:59,480
so the theme this week of Letting Go and cultivation maybe culminates in these

184
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:05,000
Notions of a path and a practitioner and what is that for

185
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,839
us so I think even if we have a family and we're working and other things we

186
00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:18,160
can still Orient our lives around the spiritual life and that makes a difference somehow that changes how

187
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:24,119
things unfold somehow

188
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:31,359
probably it's a distinct group of people in the world who see Life as a

189
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:36,599
practice there are some who do and some who don't and we wouldn't expect that everyone

190
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:44,000
would but I think the ones who do are somehow concerned with finding

191
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,280
Excellence with finding human flourishing and maybe with engaging

192
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:57,280
differently in the world than the more conventional way of being I've certainly found that you know

193
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,880
as a te teacher who connects with people who come to me about such things yeah I

194
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:09,000
do see that that there's this this group that are orienting around practice has

195
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:16,240
really good effects so but to engage in a life of practice if that's of interest

196
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:24,359
does mean making some choices and this is not just a Buddhist idea I think many spiritual teachers and

197
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:30,920
philosophers and guides and counselors have noted that some kind of discipline

198
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:38,079
or conscious engagement with our life is needed if we want to grow spiritually

199
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:43,560
you know what does it mean to be a practitioner so I wanted to suggest

200
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:49,680
today some uh qualities of a practitioner that

201
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:55,040
um that you may consider and consider what they look like in in your own case

202
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:00,160
because I think each one has um many different

203
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:06,960
manifestations and so the first one you know the First Quality that is shared by

204
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:14,400
people who consider their life to be walking a path I'm just going to use the blunt word which is I think they share

205
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:20,839
the quality of renunciation um recalling also that renunciation is the first of the three

206
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:26,800
wise intentions of the Eightfold Path that the Buddha named so what does that mean though it

207
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:32,640
it I think it's simply means that we're fueled by an internal calling so to to

208
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:38,640
practice we really do have to give up some things at the very least if you're going to sit for an hour a day that's an

209
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,960
hour that you don't do something else and you know we give up certain

210
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:50,119
things for the purpose of having a deeper and richer and Fuller life in various

211
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:55,800
areas so I don't know if pronunciation is the right word for that as it has

212
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:04,880
kind of connotations that are not so positive but I'm meaning it in a positive sense of uh letting go of what

213
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,599
is not supportive for this path that we're wanting to walk and so maybe there

214
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:15,880
are certain areas that we have to uh particularly look at in that case and

215
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:22,200
one of them is of course the material life that's maybe what we first think of with

216
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:27,839
renunciation but I don't think renunciation in this case means some

217
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:33,040
kind of restriction or narrowing or

218
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:39,480
um yeah cutting off but really more a real investigation of what is material

219
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:46,920
sufficiency in our life learning what is just enough so that we don't have extra

220
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:52,480
burdens on the Mind material things take up mental space and so if you're wanting

221
00:38:52,480 --> 00:39:01,040
to use your mental space for service for for practice for meditation for retreat

222
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:08,160
for doing things that are meaningful um we don't want to have too many extra things that we're managing um but you do

223
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:13,400
need to have enough in order that life is uh comfortable enough secure enough

224
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:20,800
assured enough you have access to health and good food and all of that so this is

225
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:27,880
I think uh something that has to be done consciously so really looking at our material life to have the right amount

226
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:34,160
that frees us from fear and also from the need for overwork and over consuming

227
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:41,280
that can happen in our conventional culture so the material life is worth

228
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,960
examining in light of a spiritual life and then the second area is maybe of

229
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:52,000
renunciation is maybe seeing beyond the conventional

230
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,920
expectations so giving up con conventional views if you will um

231
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:03,280
so what is our relationship to what our society says we're supposed to be doing

232
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:11,319
you know get an education get a job get the right house have this or that keep up with the

233
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:16,920
neighbors Etc um it's okay to uh live a

234
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:22,599
life that looks conventional in certain ways but where are you coming from in

235
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:29,160
doing that you know is it um are we just buying into do everything that Society

236
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:34,839
tells us we should want and need and will make us happy or have you discovered in some way that those things

237
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:40,839
don't necessarily bring happiness that's what a lot of brings a lot of people to

238
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:48,400
the spiritual practice maybe they haven't quite articulated this but they're coming in the door because what

239
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,440
they were told would make them happy didn't actually fulfill that and the

240
00:40:53,440 --> 00:41:00,359
Buddha picks right up on this in his teachings he's very direct about this and says yeah these things are not so

241
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:06,960
satisfying but it's okay you don't that doesn't mean depression and confusion

242
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:13,520
there's a there's this path that does bring actual satisfaction and actual

243
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:20,000
happiness and so we have to um again work in this area of how do we relate to

244
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,160
the messages that we hear every day and see every day uh and yet something is

245
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:32,480
calling us differently in our heart and there's I think a fair amount of work in being able to navigate that skillfully

246
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:38,359
gracefully uh keeping up the connections and relationships and factors of our

247
00:41:38,359 --> 00:41:45,079
life that are needed this has always been true in whatever culture uh religion and spirituality has arisen in

248
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:50,599
so practitioners have to navigate that it can help to have a

249
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:57,680
teacher and then um maybe another large area another main quality of a

250
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:04,400
practitioner is what I like to call converting all problems to internal

251
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:11,040
problems and this is um this doesn't say that all problems are internal but one

252
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:17,240
quality of a practitioner is to look first inside to always try to find the

253
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:23,079
source of our suffering or struggle in our own relationship with experience

254
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:30,040
this will serve you very well in the long run if you're walking a path and being being a practitioner in life is to

255
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:36,880
first look at how we can change how we can shift that allows the Dharma space

256
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:43,839
to grow each of these areas are ways of creating space that lets the Dharma have

257
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:52,400
something to move into so that we're not covering it over like that man did for 50 years and not giving space for uh

258
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,960
something beautiful to grow so people with these qualities of

259
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:04,800
renunciation and of looking internally first I think have a certain depth and

260
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:12,280
strength that others can feel and interestingly what we discover when we

261
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:17,800
take on these qualities of practi of a practitioner is we discover softness

262
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:23,280
humility love compassion all sorts of things that um

263
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:29,520
come out of creating that space for the heart to grow so practitioners are moving toward

264
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:37,440
becoming both stronger and softer becoming freed from the compulsions of the heart that narrow us and bind us and

265
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:44,559
make us harder and also weaker so this gives us a general idea

266
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:49,839
of what letting go and cultivation can cover in their full breadth and you

267
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:55,559
might see if you've had specific New Year resolutions or intentions like

268
00:43:55,559 --> 00:44:01,800
we've talked about this week how they might fit into these ideas of Letting Go

269
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:06,960
cultivation of material sufficiency of

270
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:13,319
um having an internal sense rather than just following societal conventions and

271
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:19,359
also uh bringing all of our problems into internal problems can we change

272
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:26,880
ourselves in some way so I want to read a quote from Steven Bachelor about creating a path

273
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:36,000
that I find very beautiful uh it's a couple paragraphs a little long but just just hang in there and and see how it

274
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:42,800
lands as we learn to play this complex instrument of Bones flesh nerves

275
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:48,640
impulses thoughts and feelings we trace a path that weaves its way like a

276
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:54,599
Channel Through the landscape of our experience it is Guided by an intuitive

277
00:44:54,599 --> 00:45:00,880
yearning for what we value most deeply its space is the openness we are able to

278
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:06,359
tolerate within our hearts and Minds it is sustained by the networks of

279
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:12,640
friendship that Inspire us to keep going the path follows the Contours of

280
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:19,319
our life as one day turns into the next it is found amidst the most mundane of

281
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:25,720
circumstances as well as the most Sublime to create a path is to become

282
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:31,480
intimate with the space opening up within around and before us

283
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:36,800
this intimacy comes from the mindful awareness of what is unfolding in our

284
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:43,319
body feelings minds and worlds from moment to moment we get used to the

285
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:49,800
taste the feel the texture of the path it ceases to be something to which we

286
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:56,119
self-consciously Aspire and when we stray from it we feel its loss as an act

287
00:45:56,119 --> 00:46:05,599
of self- betrayal so I really like this notion of the path

288
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:11,599
being something that's unfolding right here from connecting to

289
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:17,079
this experience here and now and creating space for the Dharma to move us

290
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:25,359
forward into the next moment it may be powerful and profound and it can be making coffee for

291
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:32,760
your family so um so returning to the foundational suta

292
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:38,319
from the dhap that we read at the beginning not engaging in what's

293
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:44,119
unskillful engaging in what is skillful and purifying one's mind this is the

294
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:52,240
teaching of the Buddhas so how does this look for you as we launch into

295
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:57,880
2025 it's your life and I think you won't regret um making it into a

296
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:05,079
spiritual path so my wish for all of us in 2025 is to give ample space to the

297
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:11,000
Dharma to let it grow and flower in whatever way it can in your life for the

298
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:20,480
benefit of you and everyone so thank you so much it's been a beautiful week be well
