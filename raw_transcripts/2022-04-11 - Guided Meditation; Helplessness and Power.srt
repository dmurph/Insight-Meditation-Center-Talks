1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,359
so welcome welcome all nice to uh

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,639
got the the chats streaming on the side nice to see your names welcome thanks

3
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:18,880
for the uh warm greetings to the substitute teacher

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:25,439
um yeah happy happy to be here this week and um look forward to

5
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:33,288
exploring together so um [Music]

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,360
yeah we'll have the same same format as gil usually uh practices and um

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:47,680
a kind of lightly guided sit for a half hour and then some some reflections until uh a quarter two

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,559
so um yeah

9
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,719
just uh settling into a posture

10
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,798
and sometimes when we're queued to begin paying attention

11
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,760
it's almost like we imagine the spotlight of attention being shown

12
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,200
from the direction of our own head from our eyes

13
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,560
the perspective of looking down into our body

14
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,519
but that's just another thought actually

15
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,360
so maybe we begin with the image

16
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,159
of your body pervaded

17
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:12,440
by awareness porous to awareness

18
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,320
sometimes it's supportive to feel our bodies the kind of earth

19
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:40,000
element of our body the groundedness the weightiness the force

20
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,120
of gravity the downward pull of the earth

21
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:57,520
sometimes it's supportive to know our body

22
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,720
as vibrating space

23
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:30,199
to be present is to be unintimidated

24
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:37,880
by the flow of pleasant and unpleasant

25
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:54,720
to relinquish our preoccupation with control

26
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,199
molding ourselves molding the moment

27
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,800
every phenomenon kind of invitation

28
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:28,519
more deeply into the present

29
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:51,040
whatever narratives accumulated about this sit

30
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,519
how it's going how you're doing

31
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,360
just put it down

32
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,079
make yourself radically available

33
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,240
to this moment

34
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,199
there's a palpable sense that moment by moment

35
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:39,639
life is softening rather than hardening our hearts

36
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:59,839
we actually leverage the imperfection of the moment

37
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,759
for our freedom

38
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:27,438
and so rather than trying to extract something from the

39
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,720
moment from our practice

40
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,919
we let ourselves be softened by it

41
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:18,919
letting go is not a job we reluctantly perform

42
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,880
but uh an utter delight

43
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,120
and joy

44
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,360
and so we develop a kind of confidence

45
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,360
of faith in letting go

46
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:16,679
and it doesn't solve the complexities of being human demands on any life

47
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:34,559
but it does resolve suffering of this moment

48
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,520
and that's something

49
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:40,979
do [Music]

50
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:42,240
so uh yeah

51
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,720
it's good too good to practice with you

52
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:03,120
so william james said nothing includes everything or dominates

53
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,960
over everything the word and

54
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,760
trails along after every sentence

55
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:20,799
the word and trails along after every sentence

56
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:29,679
sometimes when when gail and i have taught a a retreat

57
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:36,039
we've we've done the three characteristics

58
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:44,399
and they're supporting opposite or apparent opposite

59
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:49,760
so we open to suffering but that is paired

60
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:57,840
with a consolidation of well-being we open to a nietzsche to impermanence

61
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:04,559
uncertainty but that's paired with a teaching on stability

62
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:11,440
we open to the teachings on selflessness

63
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,840
and that's paired with self-confidence

64
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:26,480
and there's a certain kind of importance in impairing pairing teachings

65
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:32,960
and so this week likewise some pairs that seem important to me

66
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:38,159
that seem maybe in conflict uh

67
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,840
with each other but actually support each other

68
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:52,720
so today the pair helplessness

69
00:32:52,720 --> 00:33:02,080
and power so helplessness is a kind of uh defining

70
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:08,080
characteristic of any animal's life and

71
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:14,880
among the most harrowing experiences a human can have

72
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:22,799
and sometimes i feel like maybe maybe duke suffering and helplessness

73
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:26,000
are synonyms

74
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:37,200
we are in the end small small creatures amidst unimaginably vast

75
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:46,159
forces and humans we need a very very specific

76
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:53,840
environment of temperature and pressure mixture of gases

77
00:33:53,840 --> 00:34:01,840
and just a kind of staggering number of things need to go

78
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:07,840
right in our body just to be alive

79
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:16,638
and so just to have this breath is um

80
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:24,560
is donna yeah is um is a kind of generosity

81
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:33,280
and helplessness the experience a moment of helplessness is it's very

82
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:39,440
frightening it's the kind of most extreme form of vulnerability

83
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,800
and we scramble to exert our power to keep

84
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,839
control to exercise will

85
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:57,118
and helplessness will take almost anything

86
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,720
over a moment of helplessness

87
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,760
people cry you know for many reasons but one of the main

88
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:13,680
reasons i've learned that people cry is a sense of

89
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,680
helplessness

90
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:26,400
and perhaps our our tears are a kind of plea

91
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,839
i need you i need you

92
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:41,760
and the movements of our mind um are so much of our cognitive and emotional

93
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:47,680
life is really organized against helplessness

94
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:55,599
organized around the sense that we can always do something it feels like we can

95
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:02,160
always do something it feels like something might always be

96
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:08,400
fixed you know like that is the essence of samsara

97
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:14,480
this realm like like that something might be fixed something else might be

98
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:22,079
governed some facet of our experience of our life might be governed

99
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:28,400
and that sense of what could be what might have been what will be

100
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:34,800
all those possibilities uh

101
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:42,079
are so deeply compelling to us and so we can tinker tinker with the moment from

102
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:49,200
cradle to grave and sometimes

103
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:54,760
in order to soften the blow of a nietzsche of

104
00:36:54,760 --> 00:37:00,320
uncertainty and reliability we blame ourselves

105
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:06,640
yeah because blaming ourselves creates the illusion of controllability

106
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:14,560
well if i just didn't mess up yeah and in fact i think a lot of

107
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:21,119
self-hatred is really our attempt to conceal the truth

108
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,838
of uncontrollability from ourselves

109
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:35,040
we're helpless in moments to silence our minds to

110
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:40,160
protect ourselves from pain

111
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:47,040
to back our ways out of some karmic corners

112
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:56,320
like we get backed into a kind of karmic corner and our bed is made we're gonna suffer

113
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,880
we're helpless or nearly helpless in the face of so much

114
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,960
greed hatred delusion that seems to animate the world

115
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:16,880
our species there's a measure of helplessness in this and so

116
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:22,560
it is actually strange alien to hear the dharma teacher

117
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:31,320
say surrender that this is a path of letting go

118
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:38,320
actually open to the moment we we can kind of feel like we're doing it but we're

119
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,119
subtly trying to master the human condition

120
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:51,920
to really open not to try to master the moment not to try to get the upper hand on

121
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:57,720
helplessness that is profound

122
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:05,359
so we open we open to helplessness we let it soften

123
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:11,200
our heart we let it teach us everything is teaching us

124
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:17,280
as is said and our life

125
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:27,079
our families our world all of that becomes so poignant in light of helplessness

126
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,000
and when change comes were a little bit less

127
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:43,640
startled when death comes we're a little bit less startled

128
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:52,560
before we've come to appreciate helplessness we kind of try

129
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:59,280
to exert our power over all things over ourselves over others

130
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:06,960
but as we open to helplessness we stop fighting the first noble truth

131
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:14,079
and then we pick our fights wisely

132
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:22,880
we pick our fights wisely there from this understanding

133
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,318
we find our power

134
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:34,960
studying helplessness illuminates our power

135
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,880
we're no longer trying to govern all of this realm

136
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:50,560
yeah studying helplessness illuminates our power we actually know

137
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,920
what we want what we actually want

138
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,520
we're not so lost in the kind of fever dream

139
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:06,880
of egoic clinging craving

140
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:13,520
we know what we want and we're empowered

141
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:18,720
we're empowered because through our encounter with the human

142
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:23,839
condition through our encounter with helplessness we actually understand more

143
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:29,359
deeply how things work and that allows us to

144
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:37,040
exert our force wisely efficiently

145
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:47,920
this is kitty sorrow as our practice of the path deepens we

146
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:53,838
will naturally grow in personal power

147
00:41:54,079 --> 00:42:00,000
cultivating silas ahmadi panya plugging into the measureless merit

148
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:08,000
of the triple gem we potentize our actions for good or for ill

149
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,480
it's vital to be interested and sensitive to our impact on the world and those around us

150
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:22,160
being a teacher or a dedicated buddhist practitioner we are waving the banner of the awakened

151
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:28,160
one representing that extraordinary heritage

152
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:34,160
partaking of that trustworthy power and prestige

153
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:41,040
when one has power once wholesome actions are amplified but so are the unwholesome ones

154
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,839
everything we do has more impact

155
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:54,000
we open to helplessness we open yeah

156
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,599
be open to it and through this we find

157
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:04,160
the places where we can exert power

158
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:11,599
we come to understand the human condition more deeply we come to understand others more deeply we come to

159
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:18,400
understand what we want more deeply and this is empowering

160
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:24,319
this is empowering we exert our power

161
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:30,720
in awesome ways exercise influence in ways

162
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,920
that matter and it comes

163
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:41,359
out of this willingness to befriend this most

164
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:48,000
radical of experiences helplessness

165
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:55,839
so i offer this for your consideration and

166
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:03,200
as always please um please pick up what is useful and uh

167
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:08,680

168
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:14,079
so thank you for for being here uh i'm glad we
