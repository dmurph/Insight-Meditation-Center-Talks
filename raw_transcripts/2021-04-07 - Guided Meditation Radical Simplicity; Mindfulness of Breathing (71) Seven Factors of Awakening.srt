1
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:14,240
so a warm hello to all of you and

2
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,680
those of you who are writing your names in the chat hello it's nice to see your names and those of

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,880
you who are not warm hello and it's so wonderful to

4
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:32,078
have this time together and uh i find that uh this

5
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:38,960
meditation practice mindfulness practice um a little bit of a miracle

6
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,370
and we're kind of a natural wonder wander in that

7
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:50,160
[Applause] in its essence it's very simple

8
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:57,440
and in some ways the simpler you can make it be the more wondrous it becomes the more

9
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:07,360
amazing and well maybe sometimes immediately miraculous becomes and this art of learning to be aware

10
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,840
but be aware in radical simplicity

11
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:22,479
in a sense just be aware and not to add anything to it not to

12
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:29,840
build stories around it or not hijack your

13
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,439
awareness with desires and aversions and of course we have stories and

14
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:41,360
desires and aversions and stuff but it isn't that we have to

15
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,680
be free of those but we include them in this radical

16
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,520
simplicity of awareness rather include them in the sense of knowing it

17
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,680
as opposed to having them somehow color take over influence how we're

18
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,200
aware so radical simplicity

19
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:13,680
and some of you have been doing these all these last 70 talks on mindfulness of breathing and

20
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,160
it was a lot of information a lot of ideas and and now as we're coming to the end you

21
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,840
know i want to evoke the idea that

22
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:32,319
there is a path through all these steps and the ideal path i think is

23
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:39,280
not to make much effort to do so but just to rely on the radical simplicity awareness

24
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,360
and then watch how these steps develop watch how practice unfolds

25
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:53,360
but without any expectations or demands or efforts to make it so

26
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:01,599
and finally this uh kind of a image that i've

27
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:07,519
learned from buddhist teachings that was very meaningful for me for this

28
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:15,280
simplicity is the idea of taking a backward step just stepping back and then watching and

29
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:23,200
looking stepping back and how far do we have to step back in the mind so we can just observe just be aware

30
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,720
in the simplest possible way and sometimes it's taking a step back

31
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:35,200
and turning around 380 degrees and just just looking at

32
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:41,120
how we're aware and appreciating how simple it can be

33
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,760
just aware in its essence awareness is very simple

34
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:56,319
and as some of you have heard me do before now you know if i gave the instructions for you to stop being aware

35
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:03,439
for many people when they hear that it's like then they can't like you they can't turn it off

36
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:09,920
you know unless you distract yourself somehow in fact the instructions to stop being

37
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,200
aware for some people heightens their awareness it's kind of always there in

38
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,239
some form in the simplest possible form of it just

39
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:26,240
here with this maybe here with um

40
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,000
with your breathing so

41
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,240
entering into a meditation posture

42
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:47,440
and maybe adjusting your posture some

43
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:57,840
part of the adjustment is just a reminder that you'll be here now

44
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:11,840
gently closing your eyes and then to

45
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:25,840
take a few gentle slow long breaths three quarters full

46
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:32,240
as a movement towards being here

47
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,800
in this body simplifying yourself from all the concerns of the day

48
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,080
yesterday and your life just simply here

49
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,960
in this body

50
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,120
breathing in and in a long gentle exhale

51
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:02,319
relaxing at the end of the exhale so maybe you release more

52
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,840
longer exhale

53
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,840
and then letting your breathing return to normal

54
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:31,520
and as you exhale to move through the body from the top to the bottom settling

55
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:38,639
yourself and relaxing as you do and the exhale relaxing the muscles of

56
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:47,120
the face around the eyes and the forehead

57
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,840
the jaws

58
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,840
on the exhale relaxing the shoulders

59
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,400
small adjustment in your hands where they are in position might free up the shoulders a

60
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:17,840
little bit more

61
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:33,199
softening the belly releasing the belly

62
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:59,840
softening and releasing the legs the holding in the thighs or the calves

63
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,639
and then within the body as part of the body

64
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:27,440
becoming aware of your breathing

65
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,479
breathing in a simple ordinary way

66
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,919
but perhaps on the exhale for a few exhales

67
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,919
releasing relaxing at the end of the exhale

68
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:54,880
so that it's a little bit longer

69
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:01,200
and so there's a little pause before you inhale

70
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,760
very little pause

71
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:14,480
just long enough so you feel the body's natural urge

72
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,360
to breathe in

73
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:37,839
and allow for that urge to manifest as an in-breath

74
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,839
and then with the breathing

75
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:23,360
just the breathing how simple can you be aware of it

76
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,279
perhaps a simplicity

77
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:37,360
that allows the a fuller experience of breathing

78
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,000
to have space in awareness

79
00:10:43,440 --> 00:11:01,440
it's not crowded out by other concerns and things

80
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:08,000
and then as we sit here today no matter what is happening for you as

81
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,360
you sit and meditate maybe there can be a refuge for you

82
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:21,680
in the simplicity of awareness the simplicity of just being aware just

83
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,760
mindful taking a backward step so you're less

84
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:36,000
involved and tangled simple recognition ah this is how it is

85
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,480
okay

86
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:47,279
a simplicity of awareness where nothing is a problem

87
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:57,839
just something to be aware of

88
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:22,320
whatever is happening to you it's all right to limit yourself to

89
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:28,399
simply knowing it simply being aware

90
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,600
taking a backward step to not be involved with it

91
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:41,839
just be aware

92
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,200
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

93
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:21,840
the simplicity of awareness can also teach us about the simplicity of love

94
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:29,120
sometimes when we are alone like in meditation it's kind of personal

95
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:35,520
situation where you don't have to speak to someone or interact with someone

96
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:41,440
where it's a little bit safe sometimes this is where we can discover

97
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:49,919
the simplicity of love the simplicity of kindness or goodwill

98
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:59,760
a caring quality of the heart may be a appreciative quality

99
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:06,799
way in which our heart is delights and appreciates and values someone

100
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:14,399
that doesn't require us to say anything or do anything

101
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:22,640
the person doesn't have to even know it and so it can be free we can be freer

102
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:31,840
to love freer from complications

103
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,760
and to discover the simplicity of love

104
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:49,279
can be a great lesson that supports us and how to care and love and have good will for people

105
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,399
when we are together

106
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:04,320
so as we sit and end this sitting perhaps you can touch into

107
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:12,159
the simplest form of goodwill and well-wishing or

108
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:17,279
or about our appreciation for of others

109
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:26,559
maybe it's a worthless appreciation with just a warmth or a softness

110
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,278
of the heart

111
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:38,399
maybe it can feel quite lovely to allow for that softness the warmth

112
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:46,720
the love to be there without needing to do anything about it it's just there

113
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:55,840
vibrating or glowing

114
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:04,240
and then as to whatever degree you can in fact feel some simplicity of care

115
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,760
love see if these words i speak

116
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,200
resonate with that place

117
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:23,840
may all beings be happy

118
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:31,039
may all beings be safe

119
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:42,080
may all beings be peaceful

120
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:51,840
may all beings be free

121
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:05,840
and may that my love my good will my kindness my care

122
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,679
word wordlessly

123
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:16,799
flow out for me out into the world

124
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:25,279
and may whatever benefit that's come from this morning's meditation this day's meditation

125
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:33,840
may in fact be for the welfare and benefit of all beings everywhere

126
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:48,720
so having covered the 16 steps of mindfulness of breathing

127
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,320
the the buddha's instructions in this practice continues and to

128
00:32:54,320 --> 00:33:01,440
first explaining how mindfulness breathing

129
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:08,000
comes along with the fulfillment powerful word

130
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,039
fulfillment of the four foundations of mindfulness

131
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:21,279
and and and as i said yesterday each of the four

132
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:27,679
parts the four tetrads are the 16 steps is directly connected to one of the four

133
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,960
foundations of mindfulness so if you do the first tetrad of just

134
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:40,000
connecting to the breathing and feeling the breath body relaxing the bodily

135
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,399
formations that to do that well fully to enter into that deeply

136
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:52,399
is also fulfills the first foundation of mindfulness the mindfulness of the body

137
00:33:52,399 --> 00:34:00,399
and so forth what's interesting is then next the buddha says that practice

138
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:07,600
fulfilling the four foundations of mindfulness fulfills or brings about evokes the

139
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:13,040
seven factors of awakening and the way that uh it does that is is

140
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:19,200
that if you do fully the first tetrad it fulfills the first foundation of

141
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:27,358
mindfulness the full fulfillment of first foundation of mindfulness then awakens or brings along with it

142
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:35,440
the seven factors of awakening and the seven factors awakening then lead to awakening and

143
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:44,240
uh so the implication here is that each of the tetrads each of the four steps of of anapanasati

144
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:52,638
is can be complete in itself you don't have to go through the 16 steps one after the other

145
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:59,599
it's enough that your practice is just staying with any one of the four and i think for many

146
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,960
people just staying with the first step and so the first four steps

147
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,880
are not like elementary or remedial or something and you want to get to the higher steps

148
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:17,599
it's uh you're supposed to kind of you know guide yourself through them the the first four steps can take you

149
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:23,280
all the way to awakening just just doing that after the buddha

150
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,320
died there were commentaries early commentaries and they kind of went on a little bit the same

151
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,520
way to say that if you just do the first tetrad it

152
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:40,400
also fulfills the other 12 steps that somehow just kind of the simplicity

153
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,680
of just being present for breathing in the body and relaxing the body

154
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:52,880
uh calming in body and doing that fully um brings about all the other

155
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:59,599
benefits all the other movements of practice and to me this has a lot to do with the simplicity of all

156
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:05,119
this practice that the simpler we can be uh and the less entangled we are

157
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:13,680
and trying and wanting just being here in a very simple way it's onward leading it sets free

158
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:19,359
a a you know it sets the water begins flowing down

159
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:25,760
the river flowing down the mountainside you have to put up big boulders and blockages to stop it

160
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:31,839
and you can do that but but it's a lot of work but if you remove the obstacles

161
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:38,400
water will flow so this practice of anapanasati mindfulness breathing

162
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:44,240
is a practice becoming simpler and simpler in that all the obstacles are step we step away

163
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:49,599
from we release the obstacles and then something unfolds and moves and

164
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:56,960
deepens and and uh and so the meditator doesn't have

165
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,720
to be so concerned about that deepening just but go along for the ride

166
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:08,079
if we can really stay intimate and connected and trusting

167
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:14,960
of this mindfulness of breathing mindfulness of the being in the body and letting the body

168
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:21,119
relax and soften and around this breathing we do and not get caught up in other things

169
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:26,480
and just simpler and simpler just breathing just breathing

170
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:34,640
focused settled steady composed on the breathing and the idea is not to force that

171
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:42,320
but uh to know that a lot of that has to do with letting go it's just allowing yourself to become simpler and simpler

172
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,839
so that as the so then the buddha says with the with the with the fulfillment of the

173
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:55,760
first foundation of mindfulness then that fulfills the first

174
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:02,960
of the seven factors of awakening which is mindfulness itself when mindfulness is fulfilled that in

175
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:09,040
the language is very interesting it's a language is more like then it's natural or what flows out of

176
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:16,640
that what arises out of that as opposed to what we're supposed to do so continues this process of simplicity

177
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:23,119
we're just getting out of the way and something begins to bubble up and unfold this miracle of the

178
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:29,040
dharma so he says that when the mindfulness

179
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:36,640
has become well developed then what follows that is uh

180
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:43,839
investigation one looks more carefully with wisdom at what's happening when you know what

181
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:50,240
is if mindfulness is clear clarity uh investigation is really seeing more

182
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:56,640
more in more detail what is clear what is happening so just kind of a great amount of

183
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,920
clarity and investigation of discerning what's there for the buddha

184
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:07,839
the more we're discerned the more we see clearly what's here it gives rise to

185
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:15,440
energy gives rise to engagement it gives rise to interest and oh this is good partly because the

186
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:21,440
more we can investigate what we're investigating we're really discerning and seeing if we're really

187
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,480
mindful is how the the trail the path that opens

188
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:33,520
in front of us into what's where freedom is where what's wholesome what's beneficial

189
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:38,800
and we follow the choices that are in the wholesome direction and because

190
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:45,040
we know what's unwholesome we know that clinging and grasping and aversion doesn't really work

191
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:50,560
and so we choose not to go there we don't pick we don't stop having those feelings but we don't get

192
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:56,000
involved they don't pick up which to degree which is true there's choice

193
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,240
we choose what's wholesome and in the for meditators that the wholesome thing

194
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:08,079
can be as simple as just staying with the breathing being mindfully breathing considered to

195
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:14,960
phenomenally wholesome healthy thing to do and so then there's energy in that there's enthusiasm for

196
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:20,319
that and so there that arises and not that you have to be enthusiastic or interested

197
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:25,680
but it just flows out of this practice as it deepens

198
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:30,800
as we have this interested engagement then what flows out of that is joy and

199
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:36,240
delight happiness about this what flows out of that

200
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:41,280
is something deeper settles and relaxes feels reassured

201
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:48,240
uh it becomes calm tranquil a deeper tranquility or serenity

202
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:55,040
and that deeper serenity and tranquility leads to greater concentration or or more subtleness and more

203
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:02,560
steadiness more composure and and that deeper composure and

204
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:08,880
subtleness concentration then out of that flows equanimity a deep

205
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:14,800
non-reactivity of the mind and equanimity is like the pinnacle of simplicity

206
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:22,160
that's where things are so simple the awareness we're just aware and the awareness is not ruffled by any

207
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:27,280
wanting and not wanting so you know until we get to the stage of

208
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:33,520
equanimity awareness is not really completely simple so don't worry about it

209
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,560
don't try to have perfection but the movement is just be simple as you

210
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:45,839
as you can and so then we move through these seven beautiful factors that's kind of the miracle of practices too

211
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:51,839
that the simple awareness just staying in the simplicity of it can lead to these beautiful qualities of

212
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:59,680
mindfulness deeper discernment or investigation

213
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,319
energy or engagement effort joy

214
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:14,240
tranquility concentration and equanimity and

215
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:21,599
and part of the value of this deep equanimity is that um this simplicity

216
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:28,240
it's a radical simplicity where we're getting closer and closer to where the mind is not for or against anything

217
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:33,680
it's just there luminous clear present fully here without

218
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:39,119
wants and and aversions without building a cell for having itself

219
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:47,440
referential like you know it's a self-help project it just there's almost like the self self concern conceit

220
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:55,040
just falls away because things have gotten so simple and clear and that equanimity that is that way

221
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:00,960
then uh is uh because it's not doing anything or

222
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:07,440
wanting anything or trying to get anything at some point that awareness can discover

223
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:14,480
a kind of a rest a kind of a letting go a kind of release where

224
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:21,920
the any remnant any kind of way a structure uh

225
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:30,960
personality structure linguistic linguistic structure any ways in which the mind

226
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:40,319
is involved with things and thinking about things and just releases let's go and um and

227
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:46,400
there's an experience of freedom that it's such a nature or this freedom

228
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:51,520
that then people say well now i know what the practice is about

229
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:58,800
oh so this is what it's about this level this possibility of being free from any attachment any

230
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,839
clinging any agitation any contraction at all

231
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:09,680
wow this is possible and it's uh then i would call it the

232
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:14,800
ultimate fulfillment of simplicity and it's a simplicity which that rather

233
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:21,119
than being boring or being like we feel like we're missing out on the wonderful things of life

234
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:26,480
this is the wonderfulness this there's something of the peace and the clarity and the

235
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:33,200
happiness and the of of freedom is just you know one of the greatest things in this universe

236
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:39,280
and and so some people then to this is when then we

237
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:47,359
really know this is what practice can do this is what about this is what simple clear awareness is and then

238
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:52,480
um it said in the ancient world and this is not meant to be discouraging i

239
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,520
hope it's encouraging um the in the ancient kind of lore is

240
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:02,800
that then this is when dharma practice begins

241
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:09,760
the first real taste of freedom is because when we know what the practice is really about

242
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:14,800
we have no doubts about it anymore and now i can start practicing this is what

243
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:22,880
the practice is and there's this huge confidence that arises and uh and in the ancient language of

244
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:28,240
the buddha then a person at that point is called

245
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:33,520
a practitioner so it's you know of course we're practitioners before

246
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:38,560
that and wonderful practitioners and a lot of benefit before this kind of freedom

247
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:43,680
but um and then usually in english they translate the word

248
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:50,319
sika as a trainee now a person is ready to train now a person knows what

249
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:57,520
the practice is about so um but all from this simplicity

250
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:04,000
they don't have to make it complicated and and even the very first step of anapanasati

251
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:10,880
the commentary you say is enough just stay there be with that's enough to go all the way you'll be taken you'll be carried there

252
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:16,880
if you do it sincerely and fully and regularly and then

253
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:22,720
the text goes on to one more teaching for tomorrow and that's a teaching of what practice

254
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:28,160
looks like uh this looks like

255
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:34,000
after a person has when a person become a trainee when persons become a practitioner in the way i'm talking about

256
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,359
how do we practice after the first glimpse of awakening

257
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:45,040
so thank you very much and i'm looking forward to being here with

258
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:51,599
you again tomorrow
