1
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,680
foreign so my I offer my warm greetings

2
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:05,880
and my warm wishes for this meditation session

3
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,979
and uh it's a

4
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:18,060
very fortunate thing I believe to be able to sit and meditate I don't take it for granted even though

5
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:24,479
I've been doing it for my adult life to be able to connect with oneself

6
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:30,479
connect with reality with life with freedom with intimacy with love with

7
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:38,520
appreciation with gratitude with ease and

8
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:45,240
and with honesty with an honest uh connection to what's really happening

9
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,940
for us the truthfulness of the moment even if it's difficult

10
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:57,120
so many things that meditation can do and different settings different uh

11
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:03,899
ways that it's fortunate to sit here with our experience so in the topic of this week is

12
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:11,160
equanimity and one of the things that supports Equanimity is concentration

13
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:17,360
which for the purpose of this meditation I'll Define as a

14
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,980
singleness of purpose or singleness of aim

15
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:31,080
that or a steadiness of aim and I'd like to the analogy for it

16
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:37,140
is that of a boat moving through the water and the boat is heading maybe to Harbor

17
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:42,500
and it's a clear spot there where it's heading towards

18
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:48,300
and it might be far out at sea but he knows it sees the harbor and it

19
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:57,360
just heads steadily for that Harbor and as it does so all kinds of waves and water and

20
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,820
Maybe Driftwood or different things small things are floating in the water

21
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:10,140
and but the boats stay steady on this point and allows the water just

22
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:16,680
to wash off the side of the hull and and the point of the water just kind

23
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:23,519
of cuts through the cut of the boat to the bow cuts through the water and with the steadiness and aim for

24
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:30,660
where it's going and whatever else it encounters with the water just washes off to the side washes off to the side

25
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:36,360
and it's not uh I don't think of it as being dismissive of the water

26
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:42,300
the boat needs the water to float and to be able to move

27
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:48,120
and so the and it's not aversive of the water and

28
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:53,640
it just kind of steadily not stopping for the water and and is moving ahead

29
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:59,519
and letting everything just wash by its Hull so in the same thing same way it's

30
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:05,760
possible to sit with the steadiness of aim on the breathing

31
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,160
and it's not necessarily easy to keep the steadiness but the steadiness of

32
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:17,100
returning the steadiness of beginning again the steadiness of just resting and

33
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:24,540
staying and this is the harbor this is the Refuge here with the breathing and all kinds of things might arise

34
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:30,720
and allow it to just wash right by allows you just to be what it is don't

35
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:38,040
have to be against it or reactive to it or judge it or get excited by it

36
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:44,640
just let it wash by and if it is difficult that arises

37
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,860
there's no reason to no need to get involved with it as a difficulty

38
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:55,680
if it's a joy no no reason to get involved with it as a joy just hold the

39
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:01,320
steadiness with the breathing and in that way the tendency to get

40
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:08,399
excited or agitated um activated by the things that Iraq that float by in

41
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:15,180
the water maybe it won't activate you and the mind will stay steady and equanimous equanimous but all things

42
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:20,000
that uh wash by that float by

43
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:28,339
so to take a meditation posture and um

44
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,100
to gently close your eyes

45
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:42,600
and as you are right now can you allow for a gentling

46
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:48,740
of your innards gentling of your being your body

47
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:55,940
perhaps by relaxing the muscles that are tense and

48
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:02,760
the ways in which you are when we're when the muscles are tense it's kind of like we're holding

49
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:10,880
ourselves against reality away from it or even away from ourselves

50
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:17,760
to relax as deeply as is possible for you

51
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:26,240
whilst sitting upright or without slumping in any way

52
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:37,019
softening all around the face the face that

53
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:42,899
works so much at expressing ourselves to others into life

54
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:46,760
and responding and reacting

55
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,980
giving the face a vacation

56
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:02,959
letting the muscles of the face release from the skull

57
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:17,540
to soften and relax the shoulders releasing and

58
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:25,339
allowing the pull of gravity on the shoulders

59
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:37,339
and to maybe soften in the chest

60
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:49,100
maybe something just behind the rib cage can settle back

61
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:57,000
settle back and down as if what's behind the chest the rib

62
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,860
cage you can also relax and

63
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:06,980
come to rest

64
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:24,260
in the muscles that are behind the skin of your belly

65
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:35,720
deeper than where your skin touches your clothes

66
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,720
to see if the belly muscles can relax soften

67
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:58,279
so there isn't that pulling away pulling backwards in the belly

68
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,800
in the hands and the arms can soften

69
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:26,959
in the mind let's see if you can bring a gentleness to the mind

70
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:37,440
a simple kindness

71
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,240
easy kindness

72
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:51,360
and a willingness to be here in your body

73
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:59,180
aware and attentive curious appreciating

74
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:07,400
the opportunity to be here with your lived experience

75
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:20,660
and then within your body as part of your body becoming aware of your breathing

76
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:27,798
become aware of how your body experiences breathing

77
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:38,299
so you're not so much in the control tower looking the breathing

78
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:45,740
but you're in your body you're in the boat

79
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,900
feeling the gentle movements

80
00:17:51,900 --> 00:18:00,000
of breathing very slight gentle rocking

81
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,600
the body boat as you breathe

82
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:54,600
and gently but determinately set your course your aim

83
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,860
on your breathing

84
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:26,700
experiencing the sensations in the body in the belly the chest or the nose

85
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:33,080
wherever it's easy for you experiencing those Sensations

86
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:41,539
almost from the inside of the sensations and intimacy

87
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:53,039
and as you settled as you sit here settling down into the

88
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:59,059
experience of breathing every time you exhale

89
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,260
letting go of your thoughts

90
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:12,260
and re-establish the aim the connection to your breathing

91
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:24,059
and guiding a boat piloting a boat through water the pilot is constantly making ever

92
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:31,580
small adjustments always attentive always present

93
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:38,120
heading for the harbor and be heading for the course

94
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,620
stay with your breathing

95
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:55,440
mind wanders off come back reminders wonders to the left come back

96
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:03,980
while I'm under wonders to the right to come back mine wanders up into the head

97
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:12,539
every time you exhale reset the course every time you inhale reset the course

98
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:17,240
on the breathing just breathing

99
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:35,899
relaxing the thinking mind the brain so you can settle in

100
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:42,440
to the journey of just being with a breath

101
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:53,720
and allow all our everything else that arises to wash right by

102
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:59,940
no need to get involved or react to whatever is happening

103
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:07,580
if you can just stay with a breathing let everything else Washed by

104
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:14,220
like a boat heading straight through the water letting the water just wash off the

105
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,000
sides of the boat

106
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:27,020
leaving awake as things are left behind

107
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:36,659
gently lovingly determinedly

108
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:43,399
hold your course steadily being with your breathing

109
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:24,179
every in-breath and out breath hold the course where the breathing

110
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:30,720
and letting your thoughts that have come up be sure to let them just wash right by

111
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:38,179
don't be involved in them just be involved with your breathing

112
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:36,799
give no thought no concern with the mind that wanders off in thought

113
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:43,559
as soon as you notice Let It wash through as soon as you notice Begin Again with

114
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:48,740
your breathing steadying yourself

115
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:53,299
on the breathing in and breathing out

116
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:07,140
if there are strong emotions that pull you away from the breathing

117
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:12,179
see if you can let those just wash by forever along they're there wave after

118
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:18,179
wave hold the course on the breathing

119
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:23,120
not being bothered by anything

120
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:34,200
who in the mind is equanimous who are not are not bothered by

121
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:41,280
all the water that walks washes by it's easier to have a steadiness of

122
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:47,700
purpose to just hold the course with what's important

123
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:53,240
not with attachment or aggression

124
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:58,640
but with an ease and a

125
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:03,839
unbotheredness

126
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:16,160
and whatever degree of concentration and equanimity that arises from meditation

127
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:24,980
it's one of the great things to turn that ability to hold a Steady Aim

128
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:33,200
and turn it towards having Good Will and care for others

129
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:40,079
to now arrive arouse the thoughts the intentions

130
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:47,480
and the wishes for the welfare and happiness of others

131
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:55,040
as steady gaze of care and kindness

132
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:00,960
as if you're sitting on a hill and a relaxed easy way under

133
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:07,079
an oak tree and you can gaze out across the world

134
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:13,880
and you have the Good Fortune to be able to

135
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:19,680
gaze with care kindness and

136
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,020
love for all beings

137
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:35,520
and to consider how today

138
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:43,400
you might express your steadiness of purpose

139
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:54,619
for the purpose of supporting others lightening their load

140
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:02,540
caring for them bringing joy and happiness

141
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:12,380
how is it that how you experience yourself in meditation

142
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:19,640
can bring in Equanimity and unbotheredness and ease

143
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,619
to meeting the challenges of this world

144
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:30,300
may it be that we come into this world that's so challenged

145
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:36,619
so the steadiness of care and love and generosity

146
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:43,760
may all beings be happy

147
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:52,460
may all beings be healthy and safe

148
00:38:52,800 --> 00:39:00,200
may all beings be free

149
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:37,859
so the topic for today is to continue the discussion from

150
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:45,720
yesterday so the general topic is equanimity and Equanimity is a form of care or love for

151
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:54,920
the world for others and um and to not be all bothered by

152
00:39:54,920 --> 00:40:01,380
what's going on with others and people and ourselves and be able to keep a kind of steadiness

153
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:08,880
of mind calmness or ease of mind so that our love is not agitated by the challenges

154
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:15,060
of this world the challenges of people and others what goes on and in particular as I've been saying is

155
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:23,160
the challenges so the mind doesn't get caught up in pursuing engaging doing doing trying to

156
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:29,160
fix all kinds of things that disturb our love and Equanimity getting too quickly

157
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:34,380
wanted to fix things and the other is not getting caught up

158
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:40,980
in repulsion pushing away and and not being able to stay present or

159
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:47,220
going away from what's going on closing down but to be able to stay open

160
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:54,480
and and wise without anxiously getting involved unnecessarily

161
00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:00,960
or inappropriately when we can't do anything when it's not appropriate for us to try to be involved

162
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:07,380
or fix or do something there's many reasons for that uh

163
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:13,140
why it's not appropriate to actually actively get involved one is that sometimes it's better to let people find

164
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:19,200
their own way and we can offer our support in terms of our presence and our appreciation and

165
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:27,599
our encouragement but if we do everything for other people then we don't let them grow strong

166
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:35,040
there's this beautiful story that went around some years ago and that of a person I don't know if it's

167
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:42,480
just made up or true but it's a person who comes across a cocoon with a butterfly is about to be

168
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,640
born and come out of and and the Butterfly is struggling to come out of

169
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:53,760
the Cocoon and the caring person thinks wants to help and so kind of pulls in

170
00:41:53,760 --> 00:42:01,380
some of the threads to loosen up the the space so the butterfly can come out and when the butterfly finally comes out

171
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:06,839
the butterfly falls to the ground and never flies and dies and what the caring

172
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:13,560
person doesn't know is that only in the struggle to get free of the Cocoon that

173
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:19,920
the butterfly lubricates its its wings enough to be able to fly properly

174
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:27,480
and so the struggle is needed for the butterfly and so one of the reasons not to get too

175
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:34,680
involved in other people's struggles is when when and only when for example when

176
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:40,800
it only but when they need to kind of be left alone to let them find their own

177
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:48,540
way and learn and develop and strengthen and if we do it for them they never grow they never face themselves and is

178
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:55,859
especially true spiritually um you know if someone fixes all our problems for us we'll never develop the

179
00:42:55,859 --> 00:43:03,200
insight and the capacity and the inner strength to address the problems for ourselves

180
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:10,319
um and so anyway there's many reasons to develop this and but one of the things that gets in the way

181
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:18,720
of staying equanimous and loving and and unagitated is for many people is a sense

182
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:24,960
of responsibility and certainly identify with this is one of my achilles heels has been maybe

183
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:31,200
still is a little bit the sense of being responsible for too many things responsible for other people how they

184
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:36,960
feel and needing to somehow get involved and um

185
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:43,020
and so in terms of uh allowing people the autonomy to choose to make their own

186
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:50,040
actions and choices and uh and not realizing is not up to us what choices

187
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:55,680
they make we can support them we can offer guidance and advice but ultimately

188
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:02,819
people make choices for themselves and to take responsibility for how people feel and how people the outcomes

189
00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:10,020
of people's lives too much is to get agitated as to you could lose the Equanimity and in some ways also lose

190
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:15,300
the clarity of of Love The Clarity of of

191
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:20,579
Good Will that can be there when uh responsibility kicks in in kind of a

192
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:26,400
unhealthy way so in order to have this maintain a kind

193
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:31,800
of equanimous care and love and Goodwill for some of us it's useful to look at

194
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:37,520
this topic of responsibility and in this regard I find it interesting

195
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:42,960
that this word English word responsibility has a wide range of

196
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:49,800
meanings that as far as I can tell is different in some other countries

197
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:55,319
I read once that one of the first people to study the Iroquois Erica Iroquois

198
00:44:55,319 --> 00:45:01,079
Nation found out that claimed that there was no word in that language for

199
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:06,839
responsibility but they seem to have a very successful and Noble civilization

200
00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:13,380
without the word responsibility the if you look in the poly dictionary

201
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:20,760
poly English dictionary there's a very very there's already a small handful two

202
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:25,800
three four words that the Englishmen who

203
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:32,400
made the dictionary over 100 years ago chose to add the word responsibility as

204
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:38,160
one of its meanings and but those words uh the main meetings meanings are things

205
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:43,980
like burden and uh and so you know his burden isn't

206
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:49,740
quite you know I think uh a satisfying definition for the English word responsibility

207
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:56,339
and so there's almost as if that word responsibility doesn't quite work in the Buddha in the languages of the Buddha

208
00:45:56,339 --> 00:46:03,660
and I speak Norwegian and in Norwegian the word for responsibility is

209
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:10,440
which means to answer it's like it's a cognitive the English word answer

210
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:16,560
and it's probably a closer in meaning to maybe the French or Italian words for

211
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:22,560
response so response I respond responder that then the English word

212
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:28,319
responsibility to in Norwegian the connotations of unspa means

213
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:35,040
um uh what you're what you have to answer for what you what you're accountable for

214
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:43,200
and um whereas the word uh there's a different word for obligation or Duty in the

215
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:50,280
region it's clicked and so the um the and so these are two different words

216
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:56,220
whereas in English it seems to me that the idea of obligation Duty and

217
00:46:56,220 --> 00:47:01,740
accountability are all kind of in the range of meanings of responsibility

218
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:08,280
so much so that responsibility often comes across as something we're obligated to do we have a responsibility

219
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:13,380
to do something whereas and uh in the Norwegian word

220
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:20,160
unspa is that we're accountable for what we do we have to answer for what we do

221
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:27,180
so if we take English word responsibility to mean that we're responsible for our actions

222
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:32,280
that's a Buddhist that's a kind of goes clearly along with Buddhist ways of

223
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:38,700
thinking that we're responsible for how we act and what we do the choices we make and

224
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:44,819
we're responsible for the outcome we're certainly responsible for making the choices and doing the ACT but we're

225
00:47:44,819 --> 00:47:52,260
responsible and we're accountable to the to to the outcome and so what is not in Buddhism is this

226
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:59,579
idea that we carry with us in an innate obligation and duty to become free to be

227
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:05,460
loving to be kind to be responsible for other people that responsibility is not

228
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:11,640
this weight that we carry with us in some ways Buddhist practice frees us from a certain understanding of

229
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:18,660
responsibility their sense of obligation and Duty as far as I can tell there's no sense no

230
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:26,099
there's nothing come from Buddhism teachings of the Buddha any sense of obligation in doing the spiritual

231
00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:31,440
practice in life there's no obligation to be loving there's no obligation to be

232
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:37,260
generous there's no obligation to be caring for other people it's not a duty

233
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:43,200
it is an opportunity it is a choice it is something we might want to do

234
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:49,619
but not because we're obligated to do it and the only reason we have obligation

235
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:55,440
in Buddhism is if we've made a promise about a commitment or if we have a

236
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:01,920
purpose that we want to fulfill then kind of I don't know if obligation is the right word but certain purposes

237
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:08,040
require certain things if you want to discover the benefits of

238
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:13,859
meditation and really dedicate your life to really live out the benefits of meditation

239
00:49:13,859 --> 00:49:20,760
um that requires maybe you could say we're obligated then but maybe I wouldn't but we requires

240
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:26,099
that we meditate and um so um

241
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:36,500
but this idea that uh Buddhism very much frees us from this sense of obligation and Duty in favor of being accountable

242
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:42,599
for the choices we make and uh and the actions we do we're we

243
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:47,640
have to answer for the consequences of them for ourselves as do other people

244
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:53,760
and this sense of freedom from this kind of obligatory responsibility

245
00:49:53,760 --> 00:50:02,040
means that we can enter into different situations kind of with a fresh mind with a clear mind ready to respond we

246
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:07,319
have an ability to respond ready to meet the situation as it is but without

247
00:50:07,319 --> 00:50:15,599
caring with us the kind of ideations and Notions and ideas of what we have to do and should

248
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:20,640
do that are often a trigger for reactivity for being upset that things

249
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:26,940
don't go along or that I'm not doing what I'm supposed to do I'm obligated to be a certain way in this situation

250
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:34,020
but to enter any any situation without obligation and then to respond as is

251
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:41,460
appropriate to meet it and see what the choices are it can help with this equanimity

252
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:48,960
it's easier than perhaps to love because then love is not burdened by Duty by

253
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:55,680
what that we have to be a certain way we have to respond a certain way we have to fix the situation

254
00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:03,540
and so we can just be there and figure out what's needed and so the Equanimity love of equanimity

255
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:11,460
the Equanimity Brahma viharas is often very valuable to be the first way in

256
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:18,480
which we meet the person first way in which we meet a situation it's a kind of the first way of

257
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:25,020
discovering and finding out what's there if we enter into a new situation or meet

258
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:31,500
a new person and we're just automatically being compassionate for them before we even

259
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:37,680
know them it's a little bit burdensome for them and certainly we're kind of activated

260
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:45,119
or if we're already feeling Joy before we know anything about them we might actually do them a disservice if someone

261
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:50,400
someone they loved just died and we just kind of already just jumping forth with

262
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:57,780
our appreciation how wonderful they are or if we just have too much good will for them before a chance for there to be

263
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:05,099
some real connection and knowledge and appreciate to see something and then we can appreciate also is kind of off

264
00:52:05,099 --> 00:52:12,660
so this ability to know what uh the equanimous love or non-reactive love

265
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:20,040
love that doesn't carry any responsibility and obligation with it but it's just there like an Open Door

266
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:25,559
that's there ready to meet whatever whoever comes through that door and then

267
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:30,720
respond accordingly so if some of you can be you know a

268
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:36,059
little bit like me with an Achilles heel of the responsibility that is obligation

269
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:42,240
or Duty um to really develop this uh Equanimity by

270
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:47,460
Mariah's it helps to kind of see that we do this and not be caught by it and and

271
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:52,800
let it just be water that washes by as you hold yourself steady in your love

272
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:58,920
and your care for the world don't be tripped up by obligation and

273
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:05,220
Duty even if other people expect that of you why should they

274
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:12,480
and why should we believe them that that's that that's that that's how it has to be it's possible to love and be generous

275
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:19,380
and kind and and um and have very rich and warm relationships without any sense

276
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:26,599
of Duty and obligation unless you've made promises

277
00:53:27,059 --> 00:53:32,640
so um I hope this is helpful and as I explore this topic of equanimity and

278
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:37,160
we'll continue tomorrow thank you
