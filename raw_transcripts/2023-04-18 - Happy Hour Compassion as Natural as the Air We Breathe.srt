41
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:03,180

42
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:11,220
um with uh with compassion with kindness so so that's the plan and let's uh let's

43
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:17,960
practice together so arriving

44
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,699
arriving in this moment in time

45
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:39,840
in our bodies and on the cushion or the chair relaxing

46
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,039
softening the body

47
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,919
and however the body is in this moment inviting

48
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:20,900
the body to soften to relax not pushing away any discomfort

49
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:29,840
but softening around it softening around it softening into it

50
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:41,539
and letting the breath be supportive in this softening

51
00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:03,800
and lending awareness enact and greet each breath in the body

52
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:14,478
the entirety of the breath the entirety of the out breath

53
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:23,960
really support us to land especially if we're feeling restless or distracted

54
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:31,020
connecting with the entirety of the breath not as assured

55
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,700
not as a grim duty but

56
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,640
but with care with kindness towards ourselves

57
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:37,680
and we allow can we invite kindness to be breathed in with each

58
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:44,820
breath breathed in and breathe out breathing in kindness breathing out

59
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:49,639
kindness breathing in kindness towards this body

60
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:59,120
breathing out kindness good will friendliness around this body

61
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:10,100
not so much as an effortful breathing in but letting it be breathed

62
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:18,060
imagining that the air around you is infused with kindness so there is no

63
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:23,279
other way there's no other way than to breathe in

64
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:30,360
Good Will kindness friendliness into this heart into this

65
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:39,079
body to these lungs nourishing ourselves with good will

66
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:46,380
letting good will find its way to every cell of this body it's already

67
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:52,700
available [Music] it's no work it's already here

68
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:02,160
it's also breathed out it's so natural As Natural as the breath itself

69
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,140
as breathing itself automatic

70
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:55,339
Maybe you experiment with greetings kindness that's being breathed in with a smile

71
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:03,540
or maybe a smile shows up because it's quite lovely to be breathing in kindness and Goodwill into

72
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:11,360
the body and feeling nourished by it there's a natural gladness that arises

73
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,839
foreign

74
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:56,160
and realizing that the conditions are like this right now whatever the conditions are in the body

75
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,459
in your mind in your heart that it is like this right now

76
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:07,260
and if there are any challenges present right now in the physical space or

77
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:12,899
or emotional space letting this kindness that you breathe

78
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:20,399
in that's being breathed in the good will friendliness

79
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:26,180
meat meat really hold Great Space around

80
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:30,440
whatever challenge there might be

81
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:47,100
and difficulty is met with kindness with good will this is compassion

82
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:54,420
meeting difficulty pain physical pain emotional challenges pain

83
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:59,899
with kindness with gentleness good wealth

84
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,980
is compassion for ourselves

85
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:18,380
so let kindness be breathed in again good will continue to be breathing

86
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,240
breathe out and meeting whatever is necessary in

87
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,660
this moment

88
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:39,620
and don't make breathing in and out kindness into a

89
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:44,880
hyperventilation or too much work let it be natural

90
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,919
it's just in the air around you it's very subtle very subtle

91
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,120
you're sitting in it

92
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:08,940
it's infusing your body your heart it's kindness holding whatever might be

93
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,480
challenging

94
00:21:54,659 --> 00:22:01,700
maybe you find that your body feels more relaxed or safer

95
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,000
more at ease maybe something releases some holy

96
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,679
releases in the heart or in the body

97
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:32,340
as you sit in this air imbued with Good Will kindness

98
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:39,179
gentleness as it's breathed in

99
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:43,340
and out naturally

100
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:41,360
nowhere to go nothing to do it's not a doing

101
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:48,000
this invitation not a doing

102
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:55,860
it's a non-doing it's a natural way of being let in Let It Be As Natural

103
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:59,900
as the breath happening on its own

104
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:15,020
infusion of Good Will kindness meeting whatever is arising

105
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:29,059
with meta and if it's a challenge it becomes compassion

106
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:59,299
as we turn to bring this meditation to a close

107
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:07,500
letting there be kindness

108
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:13,800
gentle appreciation or having showed up

109
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:18,138
as best as you were able to In This Moment

110
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:25,260
no need for judgment comparison and if any arise

111
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:33,980
let them be held in this air in the space of kindness

112
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:41,878
trusting we are planting seeds goodness kindness

113
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:50,220
to support ourselves support our loved ones all beings whose lives We Touch directly

114
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:56,960
and indirectly may all beings everywhere

115
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:07,520
be well be free including ourselves

116
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,369
[Music]

117
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:28,040
thank you friends thank you for your practice

118
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:31,380
ah

119
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:44,280
I love this gentle practice it's it's like sitting in a warm bath

120
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:50,520
breathing in air of kindness just the whole body can relax into it there's not

121
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:57,720
so much doing and I certainly feel happier and more

122
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:03,119
gentle and also more awake more alert [Music]

123
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:09,119
um so what we did was basically I invited

124
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:16,440
you to to work with kindness not as so much a doing but as natural as as breathing

125
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:23,220
breathing that kindness being breathed in kind of spring breathed out towards the body towards

126
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:30,140
others internally externally though our Focus really was ourselves

127
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:35,460
and then I asked you if there's there any challenges in the body or in the

128
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:42,300
mind let this kindness good will meet meet the difficulty the pain

129
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:51,420
and as many of you might already know when kindness when meta meets and holds

130
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:57,440
suffering and pain that is the expression of compassion compassion is

131
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,940
meta plus suffering so that it becomes

132
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:09,119
um that gets expressed as karuna as compassion so we're playing around with

133
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:16,320
that in this session in a very gentle um non-doing way just letting it be

134
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,960
letting the body rest in it and letting kindness good will

135
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:27,599
Infuse the body so so

136
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:35,820
as always as we after we practice on the cushion on our own with our eyes closed

137
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:42,060
we have an opportunity to bring the practice into a relational field into a

138
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:48,359
relational field can we now enter a space of kindness towards ourselves and

139
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:53,700
towards a couple of other practitioners with this gentle air of kindness as if

140
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:59,339
there is kindness in the zoom room um in in the bits and bytes in the

141
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:04,740
electronic in the as we breathe together and showing up with this kindness for

142
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:10,500
ourselves in this relational field then the invitation is if you want to share

143
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:16,020
anything about how this practice was for you if there were any aha moments or challenges

144
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:21,300
you are welcome too and you could also just

145
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:28,200
say pass and hold [Music] um compassionate kind presence for yourself

146
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:34,320
and others also the three of you in the room can

147
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:39,480
sit together in Silence the whole time or until somebody wants to share something

148
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:45,240
and let it Let Yourself speak from the heart let it be a counsel where you

149
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:51,240
speak from the heart you don't ask questions just share and you speak from your own heart and the next person if

150
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:57,300
they want they do that and then the next person will come back to you and they'll go around and round

151
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:04,320
um and um take care of yourselves take care of each other no directing just showing

152
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:09,960
up either with Silence with kindness or with words whatever you like to share

153
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:16,980
so I'm going to create the breakout rooms and it's quite a gift to be able

154
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:24,240
to to share the practice with with light-hearted I don't not just

155
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:31,859
like-minded but light-hearted um practitioners it's it's such a gift

156
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:37,140
so create the rooms and if you do say something let it be brief so other

157
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:43,680
people have a chance to to to join you okay take care of yourselves take care

158

Malaya am I saying your name right

166
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:19,800
yeah I want to say thank you so much um I feel like this meditation really

167
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:26,220
helps me because I've been experiencing some physical health problems lately where I have a lot of discomfort and

168
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:33,119
pain and then when I was meditating like I thought of like a flower and then I was

169
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:39,660
like oh I am also a flower and it looks like this is strange I was like I am

170
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:45,380
also flower and then I was like well I'm a flower because I have my own Beauty

171
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:51,660
and I'm growling because flowers grow and they blossom and they have their own

172
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:58,260
Seasons because I feel like I've been judging myself comparing to myself how I was before I started experiencing these

173
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:05,160
health problems so thank you oh wow

174

178
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:36,540

179
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:42,500

180
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:48,780

181

for sharing that how lovely yeah

184
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:09,020
Claire please

185
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:16,140
and your little pity because my computer's not working right but what I

186
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:22,319
really wanted to talk about was the difference between compassion and self-pity or the relationship uh because

187
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:29,940
I've I've had an extremely difficult life I really truly have but I spent a lot of it going into fits of self-pity

188
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:34,980
and not accomplishing very much because I felt so sorry for Claire little by

189
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:40,980
slowly I've been introduced to situations where the people around me had more

190
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:47,160
difficulties by far than I did I'm not going to tell all their stories but anyway I'm now working for an

191
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:54,720
organization that Fosters Independence for the disabled and it's a marvelous experience because

192
00:51:54,720 --> 00:52:02,059
it's forcing me to stop looking at all my woes and look at the people whose lives are much more difficult than mine

193
00:52:02,059 --> 00:52:09,300
and I am able to feel compassion for them but this practice tonight was perfect because it's exactly what I want

194
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:15,480
to keep working on um it's it's really it bring can bring so much joy when when you're trying to

195
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:21,720
do provide service for people who really needs it uh and not get wrapped up in

196
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:29,280
self yeah exactly it's a way of serving and also it's us right not them versus

197
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:35,819
us or their suffering is it's I could be suffering any more things can shift and

198
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:42,359
change it any moment and and we all have our seasons of Malaya beautifully

199
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:48,680
brought in we all have our Seasons we all go through challenging periods and none of us

200
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:55,200
every single human being will go through changes transitions challenges so it's

201
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:04,319
really us so thanks Claire thanks for bringing that sense of service and humility and and gladness and yeah thank

202
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:09,960
you and one question I'll I'll address is uh

203
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:17,940
one person has asked that um in as uh uh what how to handle when

204
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:24,780
in small groups uh people ask questions of one another especially not following

205
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:31,559
instructions and and um uh

206
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:39,420
um and um you know how to handle it so so it's perfectly okay to to ever so

207
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:45,059
kindly and gently and lovingly remind each other you know not not in a

208
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:51,900
policing way but like oh yeah we're not supposed to ask each other questions we're not supposed to give advice to one

209
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:58,980
another and we're not supposed to do that we're just supposed to share from our own experience so so feel free to to

210
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:04,319
to to um take your seat of compassionate

211
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:10,740
awareness and serve the community in this way oh yeah we're not supposed to that was part of the instructions it

212
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:17,400
could be you know very gentle or perhaps in a light or even humorous way but but

213
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:22,920
it is okay to do that it really is okay to do that because we are giving I am

214
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:30,180
inviting you to create the sense of safety for one another and not ask questions and not give advice right so I

215
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:36,920
hope that is helpful to everyone and especially for the person who asked this question in chat

216
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:42,359
Serena Serena thank you so much for giving me an

217
00:54:42,359 --> 00:54:49,079
opportunity to share uh I haven't shared for a long while now

218
00:54:49,079 --> 00:54:55,859
so um I have a question because well what happened in my

219
00:54:55,859 --> 00:55:05,339
meditation is I had this overwhelming feeling of Joy like that I kind of

220
00:55:05,339 --> 00:55:12,619
brought in from where I was earlier so I hardly kind of

221
00:55:12,619 --> 00:55:17,960
I hardly kind of was able to kind of tune into your

222
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:24,780
instructions because this overwhelming feeling of Joy was like you know in my

223
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:32,160
being so the best I was able to do was to just be with it and and be with the thoughts

224
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:38,880
that were associated with it so I'm just kind of wondering in terms of practice

225
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:44,220
whether that was skillful or not yeah yeah thank you for for bringing that in

226
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:49,380
and asking that and um you know what I'm hearing is that

227
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:54,420
there was a sense of overwhelming joy and and what you were doing is to be

228
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:59,819
with it is to to with to be with it to witness it to hold it and I also heard

229
00:55:59,819 --> 00:56:07,440
that there are maybe a lot of thinking was coming up if I heard you correctly to be with this not to not to get all

230
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:12,599
um and maybe the way to be with it is not to get taken away and and and go on

231
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:19,740
a journey of thinking and and not that but stay with the joy stay with the joy

232
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:27,000
but not with the thinking so what I would suggest is drop the story drop the story of the joy and the happiness and

233
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:33,180
this and that which might be looking forward to something or reminiscing about something drop all that and stay

234
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:38,760
with the physicality the sense of joy in your heart how does it feel in the body

235
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:43,800
in the mind um and be kind you know kindly as long

236
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:49,619
as you're being kind to whatever arises during PR during your meditation you're

237
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:55,440
doing it right so if Joy arises be with it with kindness if something painful

238
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:01,380
arises be with it with kindness if just the breath arises be with it with

239
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:06,780
kindness so that's what I would suggest that's uh the way to be with Eterna does

240
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:12,740
that help thank you so much yeah you are very welcome thank you
