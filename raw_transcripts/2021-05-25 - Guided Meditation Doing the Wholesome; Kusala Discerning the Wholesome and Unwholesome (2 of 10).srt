1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,400
greetings and welcome to our meditation time

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:17,920
together and into our reflections on the dharma

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,240
and one of the primary purposes of the dharma and reflecting on the dharma

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,920
is so that what is beneficial in us what is

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:37,920
wholesome can grow and

6
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:46,559
so for this meditation i would like to suggest something um maybe a maybe a kind of a thought

7
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,719
exercise but it's very much at the heart of the kind of teachings the buddha taught i

8
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:59,760
think and that is put aside

9
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,198
any idea you have of being good or bad

10
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:12,159
any thoughts you have about doing things right or doing things wrong

11
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,439
any thoughts you might have about that there is

12
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:23,360
you're supposed to get something or reach some place in meditation

13
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:30,000
and and instead stay in your in the present moment the

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,920
best you can and simply

15
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,720
avoid doing those things that feel like they

16
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,640
hurt you diminish you darken you

17
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:58,640
obscure your vision and uh and um

18
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:08,080
and and continue doing those things or do those things that uh it just seemed to to uplift you

19
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,120
or to bring out the best in you or to just feels like there's an inner

20
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,959
goodness to them continue doing those

21
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:26,400
but particular avoid doing anything that is has an ouch to it

22
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,840
and but sit still so to sit still

23
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,360
let your body be as still and quiet

24
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:44,480
and if you find that there's any movement of the mind

25
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,840
that seems somehow

26
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,760
it doesn't feel good for you it doesn't feels detrimental so there could be

27
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,519
fantasies that you go into that might feel pleasant but to really be attuned to them you can

28
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,879
feel us not so healthy to keep thinking that way

29
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:18,480
it's not wrong you're not bad to do that but simply oh this is not

30
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:25,680
there's an ouch to this there's a kind of diminishment to it and so so the criteria for the

31
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:33,840
meditation is to move towards the wholesome and away from the unwholesome

32
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:42,480
and and just very very simply and

33
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,760
it means that if you don't do this exercise well

34
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:54,799
if there's an ouch and saying that to yourself don't bother with that judgment that idea

35
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,959
if you find that you're thinking a lot you're probably there's some way in

36
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:11,200
which that has a little ouch and a little bit of a you know not quite the best for you

37
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:19,120
so if this exercise doesn't make much sense it's okay then you don't have to do it but

38
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:27,360
the idea is to stay very pragmatic to move towards that which is beneficial

39
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:34,720
brings happiness and well-being and to not do the activities of mind

40
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:43,520
that clearly are bringing more suffering

41
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,960
so to take this posture meditation posture

42
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:57,680
and to gently close your eyes and maybe you want to sway a little bit

43
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:06,000
side to side rock back and forth and and then to find a

44
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,240
midpoint to balance where you feel grounded

45
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,960
in your sitting posture [Music] where you feel connected to the chair

46
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:25,840
the floor

47
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,198
and then let your body come to stillness

48
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:44,400
not a forced stillness but maybe if there is a stillness that feels

49
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:52,800
nurturing or relieving or even enjoyable

50
00:05:52,800 --> 00:06:00,319
take a few moments to feel that maybe subtle well-being

51
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:07,840
of allowing yourself to be the body to be still

52
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,840
maybe a relief of not having to do a lot

53
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:21,840
relief of how the body can begin to unwind or relax

54
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,039
taking a few long slow deep breaths

55
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:39,599
and perhaps it feels good to then on the exhale to release and relax the body

56
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:50,319
perhaps as you relax parts of your body you can feel that the way you were tense

57
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:56,800
holding parts of your body well it wasn't a problem it doesn't have

58
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:04,560
the same wholesomeness or healthiness

59
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:17,840
of relaxing

60
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,800
and letting your breathing return to normal

61
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,840
and continue relaxing on the exhale

62
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,720
perhaps starting with relaxing softening the face

63
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:49,440
and if you're able to relax the muscles of your face maybe the idea of tightening them up

64
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,560
again doesn't feel

65
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:01,039
so wholesome or healthy or pleasant

66
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:13,840
but keeping it relaxed does

67
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,720
then to

68
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:27,840
soften relax your shoulders

69
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:41,839
maybe there's a really relaxing of the belly

70
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:49,920
sometimes a relaxed belly can feel a little uncomfortable

71
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:58,800
but maybe it's the kind of discomfort that leads in the right direction

72
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:09,839
there is a kind of goodness in some forms of discomfort

73
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:23,839
and then settling the attention on your breathing

74
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:44,079
gently maybe even lovingly steadying your attention on the

75
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,839
breathing

76
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:14,079
and then as you sit and meditate here be attentive to any

77
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,560
self-critical thoughts of do you think you're doing it right

78
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:29,120
whether you're doing it wrong being good or being bad

79
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:38,720
and those are not needed but rather notice the simple way

80
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:47,839
that some movements of the mind and some thoughts

81
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,800
can feel unhealthy or unwholesome

82
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,959
they don't lift you up

83
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:10,320
and other ways of being meditating on the breathing

84
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,839
are more

85
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:28,079
wholesome or healthy

86
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:35,279
as we meditate cultivate and nourish

87
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:41,920
that which is wholesome the kind of wholesomeness that supports

88
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,959
the mind to get quiet and settled

89
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:52,240
here in the present moment with your breathing

90
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,839
letting go of what is unwholesome

91
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,959
probably all unwholesome activities

92
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:11,839
go in the opposite direction to being settled and peaceful here

93
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,839
now

94
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,360
when the mind wanders off in thought

95
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,760
see if you can avoid any unwholesome judgments about that

96
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,440
maybe rather substitute it with wholesome ideas

97
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:45,440
of goodwill compassion wisdom

98
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,079
so that the way that you begin again with your breathing

99
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:59,839
that beginning again itself feels wholesome feels healthy

100
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,840
so

101
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,480
and then as we come to the end of the

102
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,520
sitting to consider

103
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:34,000
that when you act and speak and think

104
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,360
from the sources inside of you that are wholesome and healthy

105
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:52,159
they're the very top very same time that you are doing so for yourself

106
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,880
it is also wholesome and healthy for others

107
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:05,120
when we're interacting with them when we're come into contact with people

108
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,880
that's a wonderful

109
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:21,600
i want to say coincidence a wonderful coming together

110
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:27,200
that this movement towards wholesomeness

111
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:37,440
the benefits go inward and outward probably at the same time or sooner or

112
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:44,000
later the both directions

113
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,440
to the degree to which you this half an hour meditation

114
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:56,240
has calmed you or settled you or connected to you to

115
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:03,840
some maybe a way of being that feels

116
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:15,200
healthier or more wholesome or more connected than you were before

117
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:27,120
how is it that that way of being can also benefit others

118
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:33,440
how is it that as you go about your day if you stay close to this way you are

119
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:41,840
now if you stay close to being guided by what is wholesome

120
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:55,440
that you'll have wholesome relationships with others

121
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:02,559
and having wholesome relationships to others is a way of

122
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:09,840
growing the wholesomeness that's within within us

123
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,960
may we come to a deep understanding

124
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,600
of how we grow in wholesomeness

125
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,720
we benefit others and as we engage in wholesome ways

126
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:34,240
with others we benefit personally

127
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,760
so that when we wish well for others

128
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,039
it does benefit us

129
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,279
so at this end of this sitting may whatever benefit that's come from

130
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:58,480
this practice be dedicated

131
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,960
be inspired offering to contribute to the welfare and

132
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:11,518
happiness of others may all beings

133
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:19,840
be healthy in body mind and heart

134
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:28,559
may all beings experience the wholesome

135
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,840
in body mind and heart

136
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:42,880
may all beings find peace in recognizing

137
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:51,760
the goodness that's within them may all beings be happy

138
00:31:52,320 --> 00:32:01,840
may all beings be free

139
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:13,799
[Music]

140
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:27,039
so continuing on this topic of wholesome

141
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,080
and unwholesome

142
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,398
and it's such a central

143
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:46,880
orientation in the teachings of the buddha so much so that one of the

144
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,320
short pithy sayings from the early tradition

145
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:59,200
to kind of encapsulate the teachings of the buddha it goes like this

146
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:05,200
avoid doing what's harmful

147
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:13,279
cultivate what is wholesome purify the mind this

148
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:19,840
is the teachings of the buddha and it could be this they were for

149
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:25,279
harming it's translated many ways in english it could be wicked sometimes it's

150
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:30,640
translated as evil but it has to do with causing harm in the world

151
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,919
and it could be just said to be abandon what is unwholesome

152
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:43,200
don't do what's unwholesome cultivate the wholesome and purify the mind this is the

153
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:49,919
teachings of the buddha so this idea that that at the heart of

154
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:57,440
the buddhist practice is this distinction and dichotomy some people say duality

155
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:04,960
between two different directions to go and to make it pragmatic which it is

156
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:10,960
we could say what works and what doesn't work and if something works even if it

157
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:16,480
partially works in the right direction great let's do it and if it if it

158
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:23,040
doesn't work in the direction we want to go then don't do it and to be able to distinguish between

159
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:30,560
what works and what doesn't work what's helpful and what's not helpful is at the center of this you know

160
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:37,919
what mindfulness is about mindfulness is meant to place us in the center of our experience

161
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:45,599
so that we can make these pragmatic choices in this direction to illustrate a little

162
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:52,398
bit more um how important this is in the buddha's teachings

163
00:34:52,399 --> 00:35:00,160
i'm going to paraphrase now so my examples are not going to be quite as i said in the text but

164
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:08,079
that um um it's the buddha

165
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:14,160
as someone said to come to come to the buddha and say

166
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:21,440
do you teach that we should avoid all pleasure

167
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:28,839
and the buddha would answer no i teach that we should avoid pleasure which is

168
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:34,079
unwholesome but we should cultivate pleasure which is wholesome

169
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:41,680
do you say that we should always speak the truth no i say that we should speak the truth

170
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:47,119
when it's wholesome and beneficial to do so not when it's unwholesome and harmful to

171
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:52,880
do so do you say that we should always be

172
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:58,880
x why believe in this or that is it always one way and the buddha keeps

173
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:05,839
coming back and says no if it's wholesome we do it if it's not wholesome we don't do it

174
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:12,240
so this essentializing and absolutizing behavior beliefs ideas seems to be

175
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:17,280
something the buddha was very reluctant to do in fact there's a whole discourse in the

176
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:24,160
middle length discourses where the whole discourse is based on idea what should

177
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:30,400
be cultivated and what should not be cultivated and and they go through all these different

178
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:37,599
categories of what should be cultivated through actions through speech through mind and different categories

179
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:46,240
and and the answer always is we cultivate what is wholesome we abandon what is unwholesome

180
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:52,320
and the um and in discussing the wholesome

181
00:36:52,320 --> 00:37:00,800
the buddha says that these are qualities that lead to a sense of abundance they grow we thrive

182
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:09,359
there's a thriving with them there's a we want to take the wholesome and make them abundant and thriving and

183
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:16,240
increase them to grow very kind of dramatic language emphasizing the value and importance of

184
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:23,839
what is wholesome now i think in my early years of buddhist practice

185
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,440
especially when i was doing zen practice this kind of message was i think not

186
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:35,119
something that i understood or picked up from the teachings that i heard and was engaged

187
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:40,640
in in fact i kind of got the opposite not quite the opposite

188
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:45,839
but more like any attempt to try to cultivate intentionally or orient towards what

189
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:51,520
wholesome was somehow missing the boat that what we should do is just sit

190
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:57,599
in emptiness sit in as if we are buddha without trying to do

191
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:02,880
anything or make something happen and i kind of sat that way in zen and it

192
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,920
was very beneficial for me it's there's a whole zen thermology or

193
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,599
approach to life that where that's coherent and if you understand it it works really well

194
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:20,400
but i also felt that that's as time went along that it was also limiting if that was

195
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,760
all i did but rather sit meditate that way when it's

196
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:32,400
wholesome but not when it's unwholesome and so in this the in this making this

197
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:38,400
distinction between whole sun and wholesome we become our own teacher

198
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,760
uh and it isn't that we're supposed to go into the books to the manual and what should i do what

199
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:52,119
should i not do but where but we're using our own inner antenna our own

200
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:57,760
psychosomatic um apparatus for sensing and feeling and

201
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,960
knowing our own wisdom to recognize the impact

202
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:11,119
that our behavior has behavior and body speech and mind and if it is healthy

203
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:17,520
wholesome if it brings a sense of goodness if it brings joy and happiness well-being

204
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:23,359
um then yes do it develop that you're allowed to

205
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:29,040
develop that if it does the opposite abandon it avoid it

206
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:35,920
now another criticism that i would have had in my early years for this is it lends itself to selfishness it

207
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:42,560
lends itself to kind of pursuit of hedonic uh to uh you know just pleasure and

208
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:50,000
um and hedonism kind of i think that it doesn't when what we're

209
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,320
doing is practicing real mindfulness real careful attention really sensing and feeling what's

210
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:03,599
happening in here and what we'll feel what will recognize that if it's selfish uh if it's

211
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:10,319
hedonistic that that itself is unwholesome unhealthy and we can feel that we can feel the

212
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:15,359
impact it has that it actually debilitates it actually

213
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:22,160
deflates and undermines us it's uh not such a good thing to do

214
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:30,640
and so part of what this practice is about is starting to become a connoisseur of

215
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:36,079
the impact or of our behavior not whether it's good or bad in some

216
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:41,119
abstract way not that it's um right or wrong in some abstract way

217
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:47,839
but what we know from the inside out what we learned to recognize directly in almost like we feel the wholesomeness

218
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:54,880
neon wholesomeness we feel that the out should we feel the ah that's going in a good way

219
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:02,880
and the importance of doing that for oneself being one's own teacher this way is that there is no um the

220
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:10,800
divine authority in buddhism that's judging us there is no external source

221
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:17,839
for what is right and wrong it's all mediated here this

222
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:23,838
in our own psychophysical being can we really find

223
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:30,800
you know the wisdom the deep understanding for exactly how this works

224
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:39,839
and in this way early buddhism is a tremendous trust in the human being's capacity provided

225
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:45,760
they are have a heightened mindfulness heightened sensitivity maybe even a

226
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:53,359
heightened ability to be still and peaceful so we can really tune in to what happens

227
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:59,920
so when you do that you start feeling like when we're have hostility that

228
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:05,040
we're hurting ourselves when we're greedy we're hurting ourselves

229
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:10,319
when we're caught in delusion there's that very tightness and

230
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:17,200
contraction and being lost in delusion is a kind of feels also like something's

231
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:22,800
being lost here and the obscuring going on or

232
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:28,720
confusion and and to feel that oh look at that there it is and

233
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:34,160
sometimes the early warning sign that we're going in the wrong direction does not come from our

234
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:39,920
abstract ideas but rather from our body and in the felt sense the movement

235
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:45,280
of what's oh that's now it's um it looks like what's happened just now i feel

236
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:52,400
diminished contracted i feel drained a little bit i feel like there's a there's a tension building up

237
00:42:52,400 --> 00:43:00,079
and um and so when we look more closely is this wholesome or unwholesome healthy and unhealthy in terms of the

238
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:06,400
unwholesome the buddha described the unwholesome as

239
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:14,319
something which harms the very thing that is producing the unwholesome so and the

240
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:20,000
analogy he used was that of a some kind of reed some kind of plant nature in india

241
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:26,160
in india that when the fruit ripens the it takes all the nutrients from the

242
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:31,680
plant the rest of the plant and the plant dies and so the unwholesome is like that

243
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:36,720
that it takes the energy from the person in some kind of a way of being and

244
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:41,760
something gets diminished something even at times can even die if the unwholesome

245
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:49,040
thing we do is really dramatic um like we really harm someone in terrible ways

246
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:56,640
and so so in this way there's a possibility to

247
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:03,760
not get caught up in old ideas that we've inherited from our society our religions and all that about that

248
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:09,200
we're good or that we're bad that we're right or we're wrong rather

249
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:15,920
we just kind of lovingly care caringly evaluate look consider is this wholesome

250
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:22,480
or is it unwholesome is it helpful or not helpful does it lead to growth of wholesomeness

251
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:27,839
or diminishment of our wholesome qualities and what we're looking for in the path

252
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:33,920
to liberation is a growth in our wholesome qualities and we'll talk more about those over

253
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:39,200
these next couple of weeks and the diminishment of the unwholesome ones

254
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:46,079
and because on the path of liberation the unwholesome qualities agitate the mind obscure the mind and

255
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:52,079
heart it makes it very hard to be on the path of liberation the cultivation of the wholesome

256
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:59,200
qualities looking for what's more and more wholesome leads to a deep sense of

257
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:06,480
well-being and subtleness and peace that allows us to move into freedom

258
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,920
into liberation freedom from all unwholesomeness

259
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:19,680
so um so tomorrow i'll talk a little bit more specifically about the unwholesome

260
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:25,040
because in a sense we're supposed to become a connoisseur of the unwholesome

261
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:32,319
so we can recognize it and not be caught by it and so

262
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:38,960
in the meantime please study yourself and see what you know what you recognize

263
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:44,000
how you recognize this distinction between healthy and

264
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,440
unhealthy wholesome and unwholesome and what it means for you right now and maybe over these next

265
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:56,000
days you will maybe come to a more refined understanding of what

266
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,839
these concepts are so thank you
