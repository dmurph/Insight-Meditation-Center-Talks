1
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,039
so good day everyone hello

2
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,840
and we are gathering for this time of

3
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:32,078
meditation a time of mindfulness and a certain kind of intimacy or closeness to

4
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,680
our experience some people might say to ourselves

5
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,520
the so i'd like to begin with

6
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,640
these ideas that because

7
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:57,680
clinging and craving and grasping are all forms of desire

8
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,440
in buddhist circles sometimes desire has a bad reputation

9
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:13,200
because sometimes we have desires together with expectations or

10
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,400
a lot of ideas of success and failure

11
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:27,280
desires can be a connected to a lot of suffering

12
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,600
and therefore because of that connection it can have a bad reputation

13
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:40,720
and so sometimes because of this bad reputation buddhist practitioners will undervalue the importance and val

14
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,399
undervalue the importance of desire and maybe even haven't really learned

15
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:54,640
how to engage desire in a useful and even necessary way

16
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:02,000
and so desires can be present without clinging craving or grasping desires can be

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,280
present without the trap of expectations or the traps

18
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,080
that come along with ideas of success and failure

19
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:19,360
desires are are really essential on the buddhist path the buddhist path

20
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,800
of liberation and so if we keep kind of thinking we're not supposed to have any desires

21
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:31,200
then it's hard to engage in that path so how to have desires that are kind of

22
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,319
open-handed that are relaxed that are open that are

23
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:42,400
that set the direction in which we go but don't set an expectation of success

24
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,680
or failure or um it just

25
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:56,000
and how to have desires that in having the desires themselves it is a kind of liberation it's a kind

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,239
of freedom that's found there kind of ease and peacefulness that's found there

27
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:11,280
that's kind of the task is to discover how to hold desires

28
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,400
discover how to use them in ways that are freeing and beneficial for us and not harmful for us

29
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:26,400
so desires are wholesome skillful and

30
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,879
so the desi so when we meditate there's a desire to be present

31
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:39,680
the desire to be here and now a desire to to stay connected to the

32
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,040
breathing and have a continuity just breathing kind of like just staying with the breath

33
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:51,760
and let everything else kind of fall away to the side somewhat like a boat going through water

34
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:58,879
the water the boat doesn't stop because of the water by itself it is not blocked by the water

35
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:05,519
it moves through the water and the water gets washed to the side of the bow along the

36
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,560
hull and just again you leave the water behind in the wake of the boat

37
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:17,519
so the same thing we certain kinds of desires in meditation are meant not to

38
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,960
deny things or ignore things but there's a lot of things that the mind does

39
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:29,120
that we get caught in is simply not useful simply not beneficial or it's not for

40
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,520
our higher welfare and so it's nice just let those things fall off and so just staying the

41
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,720
desire to stay on the breath stay on the breath there's also the

42
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,080
desire to do so kindly to do so with friendliness

43
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:52,639
to be a kind meditator or a loving meditator or

44
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:59,600
one that's diligent one that maybe is resolved to do this desire strong desires resolve

45
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:05,199
but does so in a kind way in a loving way in a

46
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:12,560
friendly way too and it's of course it's hard to be kind or loving or

47
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:20,080
but even the desire to do so is a beautiful thing even if we can't do it the desire to do

48
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:26,240
it is can be that can be a beautiful desire it can be a wonderful oh i have this desire

49
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:34,000
and then to in a sense celebrate having the desire to be having loving kindness desire to be kind

50
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:42,080
and don't get too hung up the fact that you're not the desire can be nourishing and

51
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:48,560
supportive so desire so in this sitting

52
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:55,440
perhaps you can experiment explore how you can have a desire for meditation

53
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:02,560
or desires for meditation that help you to settle down get calmer quieter focused more

54
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:12,800
present here here so assuming a meditation posture

55
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:19,440
and closing your eyes if that's comfortable

56
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,840
for you

57
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,680
and then having a simple desire to relax

58
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,039
and to do so you can take a few long slow deep breaths

59
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:42,080
and on the exhale relax your body

60
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:50,160
if you're sitting upright don't lose the uprightness as you relax more like relax

61
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,160
around the uprightness

62
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:17,840
deep in breath and then a long exhale to settle in

63
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:30,080
and then letting your breathing return to normal

64
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,560
and to

65
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:44,000
also in a few exhales relaxing further

66
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,759
relaxing the muscles of the face

67
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,080
relaxing the shoulders

68
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:27,840
and relaxing the belly

69
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,959
and with as much gentleness as you can see if you can also relax your thinking

70
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:41,839
mind calming your thinking

71
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:55,839
quieting your thinking

72
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,399
and then to

73
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:29,760
settle your attention on the body breathing the body sensations

74
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,760
that come into play as you breathe

75
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:51,839
wherever it's easiest for you to do so

76
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:59,360
and gently but clearly to have desire

77
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:05,200
to be present here now the desire to

78
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,120
not wander often thought

79
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,839
a desire to be with your breathing

80
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:41,440
and a desire to do so with good will with kindness

81
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:48,480
maybe even with love and if you can't have goodness and

82
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:55,279
kindness and love i appreciate that is that if you have the sincere desire that that would be

83
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:01,839
good having that desire is enough

84
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:11,040
having that desire itself can be wholesome and supportive nourishing

85
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,120
as you stay breathing in and breathing

86
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,839
out

87
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,600
remembering the desire to be present

88
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:33,679
perhaps there's a way of having that desire which is simple

89
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:41,679
wholesome just feels good to have the desire

90
00:17:45,200 --> 00:18:01,840
desire to be present not lost in thought

91
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,840
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

92
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:45,440
is there a way that from this whatever calm or subtleness

93
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,640
that you have or whatever connection you have with yourself at

94
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:57,279
this point that you can turn your attention outward

95
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:02,320
for the simple desire

96
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:09,600
to have good will for others and if that a good will can arise

97
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,640
wonderful and if not simply having the desire for

98
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,799
it makes a difference

99
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,919
it can be beneficial for you

100
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:34,559
to turn your attention outward to the world of your community friends

101
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:45,840
family people who you read about in the news

102
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:55,120
and see if you can come out of your meditation

103
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,840
with the desire for their welfare

104
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:07,279
so there's a bridge between meditation and the world in which you live and that

105
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:13,840
bridge is your goodwill

106
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:19,360
may all beings be happy

107
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,720
may all beings be safe

108
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:31,760
may all beings be peaceful

109
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:41,840
and may all beings be free

110
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:49,760
and may i have the kind of good will for others then i can look for how to contribute to

111
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:55,520
that as a possibility in whatever way that's appropriate for

112
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:01,278
me or for you or for all of us

113
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:09,840
may we contribute to the welfare and happiness of this world

114
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,840
so

115
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:42,720
so then continuing on uh this topic of the meta suita the

116
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,840
discourse on lovingkindness attributed to the buddha we don't know

117
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:55,039
if really the buddha wrote it or composed it but that's the attribution of the tradition

118
00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:00,480
it's a beautiful little text a series of verses

119
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,480
that as i said yesterday is considered the foundational text for

120
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:12,159
loving-kindness practice or living but that the fundamental purpose of the

121
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:19,279
text is to reach the state of peace

122
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:26,240
liberation and freedom and that and that to do so it's important to

123
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:32,320
develop these different qualities and a lot of these can be seen as

124
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:38,799
expressions of the seven factor second factor of the eightfold path right intention

125
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:44,840
the right resolve and um which is said to be

126
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,840
renunciation

127
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:55,600
non-hostility or non-ill will

128
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:03,679
so renunciation non-ill will and non-cruelty non-violence

129
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:09,519
and um and this idea in the text where there is in the in the pali tradition where

130
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:16,399
there's a lot of these negative prefixes the not ill will then not cruelty

131
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:23,360
it's understood in the tradition that that encompasses not the opposite

132
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:30,720
it's not just the absence it involves the presence of the opposite and you could say why don't you say the opposite

133
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:38,880
and the reason is that the opposite of non-ill will could be a range of different attitudes

134
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:45,679
not just one and so by the when we let go of ill will then we are available

135
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:52,080
for the range and whatever is appropriate at the time sometimes it might be loving kindness sometimes compassion

136
00:32:52,080 --> 00:33:00,000
sometimes generosity sometimes it might be patience or or it might be

137
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,039
equanimity or it might be you know

138
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:10,320
different things and and so we're not limited just to one

139
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:15,440
however uh so in this um opening of the text we talked about yesterday

140
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:22,880
all of those can be seen as expressions of renunciation non-ill will and um

141
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,919
and non-cruelty um especially the first two

142
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:34,480
and uh so they're um uh gentle and not proud contented easily

143
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:42,000
supported living likely with few duties all about renunciation of a certain kind of healthy letting go wise

144
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,240
with senses calmed not arrogant without greed for supporters they should not do the least thing that

145
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,840
the wise would criticize so then the next one

146
00:33:53,840 --> 00:34:00,080
is uh this describes the in the um the intention the motivations the

147
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:07,600
aspiration of loving kindness it's the heart's wish that others be happy and here it's put

148
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:13,040
in the context of reaching the state of peace it's in the context of becoming liberated

149
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:20,240
oneself that one develops and cultivates this care and goodwill for others

150
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:28,320
that if the path of liberation is only about me myself and mine there's no liberation that

151
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:35,440
the way we close down and hold ourselves in check and gripped in our sense of self

152
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:41,919
when we're only focusing on our own practice and our own welfare uh actually limits the movement towards

153
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:46,960
freedom and so here we next next section of this

154
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:53,679
is now including a care for the others in the world a kind of relaxing of the barriers the

155
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:59,280
relaxing of the strong sense of separation and otherness and meanness and me against

156
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:06,000
you or it's all about me and what's good for me but now there's an

157
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,720
opening relaxing of that strong grip of self into

158
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:17,760
now in a relaxed open way having the good will go out and include

159
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:24,800
the welfare of others as well and and so the the goes on

160
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:32,079
and so it's those skilled and the good should be and then it all says all these

161
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:38,320
kind of ethical things and then it goes they should also reflect as follows they should

162
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:46,160
consider as follows may all be happy and secure may all beings be

163
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:51,599
happy at heart all living beings whether weak or strong

164
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:56,720
tall large medium or short tiny or big

165
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:04,960
seen or unseen near or distant born or to be born may they all

166
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:11,119
be happy so it's not just a simple good will to the people that you love

167
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:16,480
here it's a kind of a universal goodwill may all beings be happy and the

168
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:22,560
universality of it is not easy to come to but as we begin we begin with love

169
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:27,839
towards those that we care about those who is easy for and then the practice is to begin

170
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:34,720
expanding it what does it take to relax and open and and and be inclusive in our

171
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:40,400
good will so that we can genuinely have good will for the whole world

172
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:48,480
and part of the advantage of this in terms of the benefit of this in meditation practice is that this really frees up the

173
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:54,960
restrictions on the heart the constrictions of the heart the limitations we have by by keeping our

174
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:01,680
love bounded or in check there's something about opening up the windows of the heart

175
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:07,280
completely all the windows so that the radiance of the heart can be

176
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:13,200
in all directions not limited by anything an unlimited heart

177
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:19,839
this of course is a very large ideal and and so one of the things

178
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:26,160
that is very useful to consider is that we're talking here about

179
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:31,280
an intention and intentions don't necessarily mean that we feel loving

180
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:37,040
it means that we have the intention to do so we have the desire to be loving to have

181
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:43,920
good will and um and it would if the requirement is to feel that have an emotional

182
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:50,400
feeling of love that uh could limit uh and hinder a person from actually

183
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:56,880
practicing it or feeling you know feeling like they're doing the practice well

184
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:04,079
um it's enough to have the intention that's where it begins intention is considered a seed and you

185
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:09,920
plant that seed so something can begin to grow and over time something important will grow

186
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,280
within us exactly what that is for any one individual i don't want to say

187
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:21,359
for some it might be emotional for some it might be as has more cognitive quality to it and

188
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:26,480
comes with understanding and and ideas that

189
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:33,520
really are all encompassing and but it does involve a releasing

190
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:41,520
of clinging releasing of self preoccupation but it begins just by an

191
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:46,800
intention and so i think that it's very invaluable

192
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:53,920
to simply have the desire to have goodwill even if you don't have any goodwill you

193
00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:00,400
might want to consider whether it's a good idea to have it yes i would like to have it i'd like to have it someday i wish i

194
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:07,440
could do it and rather than berating oneself or diminishing the value of that because

195
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:13,200
it's just a desire and we can't actually have the good will the idea is to

196
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:21,119
celebrate to appreciate the desire is actually quite phenomenal this member desires intentions are

197
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:27,119
so important part of human life when we have wholesome desires it's good

198
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:33,280
to appreciate that especially if the alternative is unwholesome desires

199
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,640
and um and so the desire to have goodwill is enough in itself it's a beginning

200
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:44,800
and then to appreciate that and and then maybe give it voice and one of the ways that loving-kindness

201
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,800
practice is practiced is uh by in one's own mind maybe quietly

202
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:57,680
uh giving voice to it saying saying words that express it and there's something about giving voice

203
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:03,760
that is good for the heart some of you if you're driving a car or if you're alone sometime

204
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:09,040
you might try speaking out loud expressions of good will maybe very

205
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:15,280
personal expressions of it that you have for others or for all beings or to do it

206
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:22,800
with the classic phrases and or you do it from the um these phrases that

207
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:29,680
from this metasuta may all be happy and secure may all be happy

208
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:36,640
and safe may all beings be happy at heart and then

209
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:43,599
all is really emphasized here the all-encompassing natures in all directions no limitations to your

210
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:49,359
goodwill all living beings whether weak or strong

211
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:55,920
tall large medium or short tiny or big seen or unseen

212
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:02,800
near or distant born or to be born may they all be happy

213
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:10,079
and um and this is not just human beings i think tiny and big and all that

214
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:15,520
means the smallest little creatures to the largest seen and unseen doesn't just means the

215
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:21,359
people you don't see but even the bacteria the insects that are so small you don't see them

216
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:30,000
so this all-encompassing nature of this good will and so what what does it take to do that

217
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:36,560
so it takes intentionality it takes having some desire which cut with for which we have to

218
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:43,520
appreciate that desire has important role in our life and um and to learn how to be wise with desires

219
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:50,800
our desires are wholesome and beneficial so we don't succumb to the limitations of expectation and demand

220
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:56,960
and success success and failure that we don't um

221
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:05,359
hijack the desire with clinging and craving and grasping in you know compulsive

222
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:11,200
desire but just an open-handed uh free kind of

223
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:17,520
uh generosity of heart where we wish we wish well for people we

224
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:23,520
wish for their welfare it doesn't have to be publicly known so

225
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:28,560
some people are afraid to kind of have develop goodwill or have this intention because

226
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:36,079
if they people know about it they'll be taken advantage of or it's embarrassing or something it's awkward but this good will we're

227
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:41,119
cultivating doesn't have to be publicly known it can be your secret that you're really sitting there just

228
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:46,640
wishing that the people are angry with you or annoyed with you wishing for their welfare wishing they

229
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:52,400
can be happy and it might be wholesome enough

230
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:59,520
to wish their welfare and happiness because if they're happy they probably wouldn't be so mean to you

231
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:07,599
they'd be a lot better shape so these beautiful words may all

232
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:16,079
be happy and secure may all beings be happy at heart how can those

233
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:23,359
words be intentions or desires or aspirations

234
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:28,720
that live in you in a way that has integrity a way that

235
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:34,880
is really comes out of you and flows out of you and is valuable for you

236
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:40,960
one of the ways that the many ways to answer that question but one of the ways that comes out of

237
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:46,560
meditation is to have a non-claustrophobic mind

238
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:53,520
to have a mind that's not so busy with thoughts and other desires and ill wills and annoyances and fantasies

239
00:43:53,520 --> 00:44:01,440
there's no room for the quieter emotions the emotions of

240
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:08,560
goodwill of love and kindness so to live a calm life

241
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:15,680
can make room for frequent connection to the intention the desire for

242
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:21,040
good will so may you explore this this next day

243
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:27,839
maybe you may explore maybe by repeating to yourself and seeing what it uh what it brings up for you in your

244
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:34,240
heart and your mind and your body just repeat to you with yourself the phrase is may all

245
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:41,599
be happy and secure may all beings be happy at heart you don't have to even

246
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:46,800
feel any good will saying them but what happens to you if you make those a mantra for the day

247
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:52,160
just keep coming back to them and back to them and living with them what is it what do you learn about

248
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:58,480
yourself and what do you learn about your heart in doing so

249
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,319
so thank you and uh there's a copy of my translation of the metasuta

250
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:12,640
in um on the imc uh website on the home page and in the

251
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:18,720
bottom right hand corner there's a little section called what's new and in this section there's a little

252
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:24,880
line that says reflections from gil and there you'll find the discourse on loving kindness

253
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:33,838
um so thank you and then i look forward to continuing tomorrow
