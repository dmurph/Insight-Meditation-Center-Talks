1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:08,220
so good day we'll go ahead and get started nice to see everyone

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,320
those of you who are commenting so please

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:20,460
um settle in for our meditation together finding a posture for your sitting

4
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:27,720
we're standing or lying down and just allow yourself to

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,600
I'm into the internal awareness

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,879
how the body feels from the inside

7
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:46,399
perhaps closing your eyes in order to bring the attention more inward

8
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,180
and maybe taking a long slow deep breath

9
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:04,018
really feeling the lungs and on the exhale settling a little bit further just into

10
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,200
how you are this morning or day

11
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,600
softening the face

12
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:26,240
the eyes and the eye sockets allowing the jaw to release

13
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:40,159
softening down through the throat shoulder area

14
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,680
the arms and the hands

15
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:58,500
softening down into the Torso letting the feeling into the rib cage the front the

16
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:05,579
back the sides letting that feel relaxed

17
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,360
letting the belly be round

18
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:20,459
expansive

19
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:32,120
and down into the legs softening any bracing in the legs or the feet

20
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:41,000
so that we have this invitation of some flexibility in the body

21
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:56,940
sensing the contact points where you're sitting where your hands and maybe touching your

22
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,819
body if your lips are touching just simple

23
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:08,220
contact points and making sure those places aren't pressing

24
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:14,420
against each other rather just

25
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:21,019
resting Softly surface is touching Softly

26
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:33,360
I'm feeling the groundedness when you're sitting in this way

27
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:40,280
there's a connection to what you're sitting on stability

28
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:58,459
this week's meditations are exploring these qualities of the elements

29
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:04,799
as noted in Buddhist teachings and today we'll focus on the water

30
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:13,500
element the water element has two main qualities

31
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:21,359
wetness and cohesion so we can feel Water Element directly in

32
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:29,340
the mouth in the eyes if we're sweating there's moisture associated with the

33
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,520
body

34
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:39,800
touching into those places now

35
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:54,060
bring to mind now how the solidity of

36
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:59,660
Earth is softened by water

37
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:07,259
Earth with no water and easily becomes a powder like sand or dry soil

38
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:15,300
but when a little water is added then it binds together there's a coherence or a cohesion along

39
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,400
with the wetness of water

40
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:40,020
letting the soft moist feelings in the body

41
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:45,180
also bring a softness to the mind

42
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:54,000
maybe a unification the way water dissolves disparate things and unites

43
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,960
them in a solution

44
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:12,440
feeling a connection throughout the whole body

45
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,259
and feeling how the mind can naturally be aligned with the body

46
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:54,539
the attitude of softening and dissolving barriers

47
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:59,880
could relate to an emotional tone of

48
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:07,638
lightness given if humor or amusement

49
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:14,699
gentle gentle humor so in this meditation you're encouraged

50
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:19,819
to see the mind with lightness

51
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:26,340
perhaps simply smiling at the wandering mind

52
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:34,080
if it's wandering so connecting in with the breath the

53
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,620
body mindfulness

54
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,740
presence with how things are

55
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:12,240
setting the intention to simply stay with

56
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,638
things as they are stay connected

57
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:27,360
so there's a coherence and a cohesion between mind and body and heart

58
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,740
flow of experience

59
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:41,399
you may notice that there are various thoughts and

60
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:48,899
forces in the mind pulling away not wanting to flow along gently

61
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:56,279
or be Unified I'm reminded of Jack cornfield saying

62
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:01,440
that he named the various voices of his thoughts

63
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:09,959
he had names for the characters that appeared in his mind sometimes if one of them piped up

64
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:15,060
he would just bow internally and say thanks for your opinion

65
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,140
and move on

66
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:52,380
and as we settle in a bit of more we can let go of any remaining imagery

67
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:57,959
or words that we might be retaining and just

68
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:04,200
notice how experience as a flow a flow to it

69
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:10,800
and letting it flow along like a river swirling around you and passing on

70
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:17,279
passing through not getting stuck not solidifying

71
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,260
and also not wandering away

72
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:31,880
stream of experience just keeps flowing on if we let it

73
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:40,260
it's a bit like sitting on the riverbank stable where we are and letting it all

74
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:45,680
Flow by all through

75
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:54,800
just resting with that for a while now and so and

76
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,020
thank you

77
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:42,299
sometimes the river of experience as Eddies in it

78
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:52,158
and we can find ourselves swirling around and around in a little place that is not flowing on

79
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:57,980
and at that time we can smile at the mind

80
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:05,480
for its caughtness and that may gently

81
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:12,740
allow it to pass out into the current that flows again

82
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:29,658
oh

83
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,140
foreign

84
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:41,340
[Music] experience of

85
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:47,100
Body Sensations and impressions in the mind

86
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:52,200
when we open to that it creates a certain lightness

87
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:58,159
that's felt literally in the body

88
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:04,020
almost as if the body becomes transparent

89
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:09,480
or just simpler mind becomes

90
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,039
wider simpler

91
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:24,919
and there's a way that we can carry that sense forward into the day

92
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:33,299
experience flows along and changes off the cushion just as much as on

93
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:36,500
each moment different

94
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,720
and interaction a task that we're doing

95
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:52,220
the thought or emotion passing through as we sit with a cup of tea

96
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:59,820
always changing and flowing on and if we're open to

97
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:05,820
being with that movement letting it change letting it unfold

98
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:12,260
and bringing a certain acceptance and lightness to that

99
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,840
then we can offer that as a gift to the world

100
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:24,140
our willingness to just keep staying present even as things change

101
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:32,659
helps others to be less stuck less caught in fixity

102
00:28:32,659 --> 00:28:39,659
tension gripping feelings that we know also in ourselves

103
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:46,380
but the degree to which we can let those go can loosen a situation

104
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:51,720
can help a challenge or difficulty can pass more

105
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:57,120
easily or simply to be with the difficulty that

106
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:03,299
isn't passing and it can add

107
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:10,740
happiness and joy that's available in a situation

108
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:16,520
where is being stuck dampens those kinds of things

109
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:22,559
so through our practice we become a

110
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:28,860
gift in the form of openness and flow and ease

111
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:34,860
passing through like water poem

112
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:38,539
May that guide us today

113
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,028
[Music]

114
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:54,459
[Music]

115
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:18,720
so we have a different emotional flavor or tone each day of this week

116
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:25,940
based on the classical Indian rasa or savers

117
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:32,220
the Insight teacher Sylvia Borstein says that we need three things in our

118
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:37,679
practice gentleness precision and humor

119
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:43,260
so true so as we look at these flavors or

120
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:49,740
emotional tones um we can look back that Monday was love

121
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:56,399
and care which might relate to gentleness Tuesday was heroism and persistent

122
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:03,120
effort maybe the connection there to Clarity is Less Direct but it is true that we can't

123
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:10,320
see clearly if we don't make some effort to remain undistracted and to look carefully

124
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:18,020
so we have gentleness precision and humor so we've made it today today's flavor is humor

125
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:23,460
very helpful to have a sense of humor in our Dharma practice

126
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:28,580
it's even you know it's probably necessary for healing

127
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:38,520
in Dharma practice and you know especially mindfulness practice helps us to see through things if we

128
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:43,559
stick with it teasing things apart or breaking them open or differentiating

129
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:51,480
experience so that we can see different parts of it and not be fooled by the kind of solid

130
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:57,480
seeming picture that we saw at the beginning I think nearly everyone has this

131
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:05,460
experience even quite soon after starting practice and just more and more over the years where we start

132
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:11,539
with something that seems so solid so

133
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:18,980
bound up in certain ways and if we just look at it and keep turning it over

134
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:26,220
encountering it again and again it kind of breaks apart we see different pieces oh

135
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:32,039
it's not all one thing it's got these little parts so this is this process of seeing

136
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:39,020
through also called disenchantment in Buddhism nebida

137
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:46,620
that word doesn't always sound appealing but what it means is this way that we're

138
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:53,940
no longer Enchanted or Charmed into just seeing something a little bit illusory and

139
00:32:53,940 --> 00:33:01,320
often solid but instead we see pieces of it we see that it's empty we see

140
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:07,140
different aspects of it the spell is no longer cast on us

141
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:12,779
so disenchantment is a positive term in Buddhist practice

142
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:18,440
and once we have some experience with seeing through something

143
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:26,399
then we gain the ability to gently poke fun at some of the mind's tricks and

144
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:31,860
also some of the wider cultures traits you know we aren't so attached to things

145
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:37,080
being a certain way we know that they're differentiated we know also that they're

146
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:42,299
often created or constructed to be a certain way because we've seen

147
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:47,460
the process in the mind of constructing them how my mind just

148
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:53,100
produced that anger or that something else

149
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:59,640
so it's very freeing to see that to see that things are not so solid they

150
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:06,059
shift and change a lot of it we're making up and so then we can smile at the antics

151
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:12,320
of the mind at least sometimes this poor silly mind

152
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:18,780
do you feel that sometimes so you know just as a simple example we

153
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:24,118
don't control what thought will arrive next who knows what the mind's going to

154
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:31,080
toss up next Gill tells a story of walking one time he was walking to IMC

155
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:38,878
from his house and he just happened to walk by a pickup truck that had a big tarp over the back

156
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:45,300
of it not such an uncommon sight but um his mind produced the thought I

157
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:50,760
wonder if there's a body under that tarp and he thought what where did that come

158
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:55,980
from who knows you know who knows why the Mind said that

159
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:01,520
so we have I think numerous instances of this during the day where the Mind

160
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:07,680
produces some thought based on sensory input and we don't know where that came

161
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:13,920
from but it's kind of amusing if we're we're open to the amusing side of him

162
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,200
and this can even extend you know into areas that we would consider more

163
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:26,099
serious the spiritual realm or religious culture I'm thinking now about the uh

164
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:32,520
the Dalai Lama who of course has a very uh honored

165
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:41,339
position and so the result is that when he goes to teach somewhere there's a lot of Pomp and beautiful things and you

166
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:47,160
know high up seats and all of this and sometimes you can see him laughing at

167
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:52,619
that right um he he takes it lightly but in a

168
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:58,920
skillful way you know um he he very much takes seriously his

169
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:03,960
role as the bodhisattva of compassion for our world

170
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:12,599
um but he's not caught up in that in a sense and there's a certain way that the lightness contributes to his

171
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:19,740
um his gentleness his healing his love I remember him watching him Ascend up to

172
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:27,599
a high teaching seat on some something he was going to teach and of course it was very well padded right and so he got

173
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:33,660
up there and he realized oh this is soft what they put up here for me and he

174
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:40,560
kind of bounced on it for a moment like a child might bounce on a bed and um you

175
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:46,740
could see he was just amused and delighted um right there in the middle of giving you

176
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:51,839
know setting up for a serious teaching so you know that's that kind of um

177
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:56,880
skillful likeness comes from seeing the emptiness of the world seeing through

178
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:04,020
the constructions of what we're making and creating so there's a way that you know we can

179
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:11,599
develop that skill also and I think it's actually important for our practice to have that side

180
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:19,020
there's a prayer in the Adriana practice where one asks give me energy to see

181
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:25,460
through life's illusions it's a nice wish

182
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:33,420
and there's humor in the sutras also there's a wonderful story in a text called the udana about a monk named

183
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:39,660
Nanda and it seems that Nanda was discontent

184
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:45,839
with the monastic life and he told his comrades that he was planning to disrobe

185
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:52,440
and so they went and told the Buddha who summoned Nanda and the Buddha asked him

186
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:57,960
why he was discontent and he talked about a woman

187
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:05,040
he said on departing from home a sucking woman the loveliest in the land with her

188
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:12,540
hair half combed looked up at me and said may you return soon master and he

189
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:18,780
was so smitten with her that he he just couldn't be satisfied with the monastic life

190
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:24,060
so the Buddha doesn't try to reply to this directly instead he grabs Nanda by

191
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:30,480
the arm and he transports him up to one of the heaven Realms and there Nanda

192
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:38,760
sees Saka the ruler of the Davis being attended upon by the text says 500

193
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:43,920
pink-footed nymphs um apparently this is a reference by the

194
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,680
way to a practice a beautification practice in Ancient India where women

195
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:55,680
would Rouge their feet we think Rouge is just for the face but they put it on their feet

196
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:01,619
so 500 pink footed nymphs and the the Buddha asks Nanda which is Lovelier

197
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:08,220
these nymphs or the socking woman that he couldn't get over and he says oh the

198
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:15,180
nymphs and so the Buddha um promises Nanda 500 pink-footed nymphs

199
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:22,560
if he will stay as a monk living the holy life and he agrees so

200
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:27,720
um of course the other monks hear about this and they tease him incessantly and

201
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:32,820
they say the venerable Nanda is living the holy life for the sake of nymphs

202
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:38,520
and he becomes very embarrassed and ashamed by this and that is exactly what

203
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:43,920
prompts him to go practice rigorously the result of which is that he gains are

204
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:49,680
a hardship you know enlightenment so at that point he has a different view

205
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:56,520
of the world he has seen through all the constructions and all the antics of his

206
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:01,980
mind and he as an aura hunt he goes back to the Buddha and he says

207
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:08,060
um about those 500 nymphs never mind

208
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:13,320
so it's a great story I think it's clear it's clear to me at least that the

209
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:19,020
compilers of the poly Canon had some sense of humor so

210
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:24,660
um you know there are more subtle indications of humor also there's a asuta where the Buddha kind of jokes

211
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:30,480
with the monks um he says to them a little bit you can almost hear the kind of the tone he says

212
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:36,060
you may well acquire that possession that is permanent Everlasting

213
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:41,460
Eternal not subject to change and that might endure as long as eternity

214
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:48,420
but do you see any such possession and amongst all say no venerable sir and so

215
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:54,900
he Praises them saying that's true I don't see any such possession either and then he goes on and says you may

216
00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:02,579
well cling to that doctrine of self that would not arrive arouse sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair and

217
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:07,740
one who clings to it but do you see any such doctrine of self

218
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:13,140
no venerable sir he agrees so he you

219
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:18,839
know he seems to be gently teasing them and I think as we get more familiar with

220
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:28,820
the suit as we start to see places where there is subtle humor or irony or poking fun more of them than we might think

221
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:36,599
so you know how can we use this flavor of humor lightness Amusement in our

222
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:43,500
practice and we've already noted some but I'd like to add one more angle

223
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:49,200
so if there's something that we can't laugh about

224
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:55,020
most likely there is some identification there some kind of clinging some kind of

225
00:41:55,020 --> 00:42:02,940
identity usually so we can use this negative approach what we don't laugh about to highlight

226
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:08,760
where we're clinging and then maybe we can try to bring some lightness to it

227
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:15,240
you know what we don't find funny reveals where our identity is invested it's not that everything should be

228
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:21,420
humorous but if we can't find any lightness in some area it's worth

229
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:27,000
investigating to see if there's some sticking point there

230
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:33,780
and just as we heard in the super quote a moment ago the Buddha points out that the identification is a form of

231
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:40,800
suffering you know you might find that self you can cling to that won't bring sorrow but do you see such a self

232
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:46,680
no I don't know was a boxer before he

233
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:54,060
became a monk and even when he was a well-known teacher he retained some of that kind of

234
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:59,160
a belligerent air sometimes that could come across as Gruff or blunt to people

235
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:04,619
and sometimes people took offense at him because they thought that a spiritual

236
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:09,660
teacher should be kind and gentle in a certain in a particular way

237
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:15,060
and if anyone challenged his demeanor Bajan Buddha Dasa would Roar with

238
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:21,180
laughter and he would say oh that's just my personality so

239
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:27,060
you know there's a way that humor has an important place in our practice

240
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:32,760
in the right way in a skillful way it can be done unskillfully also but it's a

241
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:37,920
key component of Dharma practice and especially when we start seeing clearly

242
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:43,500
into all the strange habits that our mind is accumulated lightness really

243
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:51,420
helps so that is our flavor for today and I hope you might find some ways in your

244
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:57,000
day today to look with lightness or smile at something

245
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:04,700
that um that you could have gotten caught up in give it a try

246
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:07,640
be well
