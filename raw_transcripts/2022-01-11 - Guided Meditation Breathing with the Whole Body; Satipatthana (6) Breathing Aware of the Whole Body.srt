1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:08,080
so good day everyone nice to be here nice to be back at imc

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:15,200
it was nice to be at irc yesterday i hope you enjoyed it and um

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:21,760
and we're back at sati patana and this uh awareness practice of sati

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,000
patana foundations for awareness for mindfulness

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,079
begins with a foundation in your posture

6
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,920
and then it goes into breathing and

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,960
as we settle into the breathing the instructions are breathing in

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,120
experiencing the whole body breathing out experiencing the whole body

9
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,359
and and in doing so

10
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:04,239
and last time last friday i talked about doing it for the whole length of the inhale whole length of the out hail and

11
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,439
that's one one interpretation of this though whole bodies the whole body of the

12
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,560
in or through time of the experience of breathing so there's a real continuity through time

13
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,080
with just staying with the breath another interpretation is that it

14
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:27,680
actually involves experiencing the body as a whole and one way to do that

15
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,880
is to uh this little bit having uh using both

16
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,159
central vision and peripheral vision at the same time whereas the centers of the eye you can

17
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,079
have your central vision focused on something and have some sense of the what's around it through the peripheral

18
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:50,320
vision so the same thing with attention to the breathing there's a focus on the breathing

19
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,360
and that's a central focus and then the peripheral is just open and aware to the

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,520
rest of the body and that's a very interesting dynamic to have both kinds of attention operating

21
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,280
and it takes a little more engagement so that there's less space in the mind

22
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:14,080
to wander off in thought the variation that i like of that is that

23
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,160
especially works well i think if you feel your breathing in your body in your torso

24
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,239
is find the place in your torso where the first sensations of breathing arise

25
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,519
or maybe it's the place where you're centered most if you're aware mostly of the breathing in the belly it would be

26
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:37,280
there just there and then from that place

27
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:44,640
feel the expansion that happens the expansion of the torso the rib cage expands the belly expands perhaps

28
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,319
and the shoulders maybe lift slightly maybe the back ribcages also expand outwards

29
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:56,400
the space between the ribs opens up a little bit so this expansion but feel it almost

30
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,920
like a wave of expansion that goes out through the whole torso the whole body

31
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,560
that you easily experience and even you can imagine that it kind of spreads out beyond the body

32
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,400
and then and then in the exhale it all comes back

33
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,640
and there's this this rhythm of expanding and contracting with a breath where

34
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,760
somehow that feels like the breath kind of move all the places in the body that

35
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,599
the movement or breath touches you're kind of opening to all of it in the inhale

36
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:37,120
and then opening or kind of allowing yourself to ride the return

37
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,239
at the exhale and this kind of rhythm of going out and in

38
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:50,080
broadly through the whole body the whole body that you easily experience with each breath

39
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,200
and what's interesting to do it one very interesting things to happen can happen this way

40
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,640
one of them is if you're feeling some strong emotions or

41
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,319
moods like you feel anxiety or fear or sadness or happiness and

42
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,920
enthusiasm or something prioritize that rhythm of expansion and

43
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,919
contraction as if it goes through your mood your emotional state but

44
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:25,759
untroubled by it don't don't go don't get involved in your motion don't try to fix it or try to judge it

45
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:32,160
and just like matter of fact you're just kind of walking through the weather of the day and your weather's not bothering you and

46
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,280
you just keep walking you just kind of move through the sensations in your body

47
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:44,240
connected to how you're feeling the emotions and you just kind of massage it you work through it without any concern

48
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,639
about what it means or what you have to do or anything just kind of allowing it to be

49
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:57,040
there just moving that rhythm through it through it same thing with sometimes there's certain levels of discomfort and

50
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:03,440
pain same thing just kind of feel it as the expansion comes the whole

51
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,120
and then feel it as it you know as you go through it with the returning of the

52
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,400
exhale so breathing in expanding the tension to feel the whole

53
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,440
breath body the whole experience in the body and then

54
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:28,080
the breathing and then on the return i kind of follow that through the body as well so hopefully this is understandable

55
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,800
so uh taking a posture for

56
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:43,919
meditation and gently closing your eyes

57
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,879
and to begin the rhythm you could do it

58
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,680
intentionally and largely by taking some deep inhales

59
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,039
and conscious long exhales

60
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,240
and with bigger inhales maybe it's easier to feel all the places in the body

61
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,720
that move and expand as you breathe in

62
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:22,000
and you might even at the top of the inhale hold your breath for just a fraction of a moment

63
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,360
just long enough that you can feel

64
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,080
the pull the draw the desire to exhale

65
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,280
and then ride the exhale through your body feel the return the

66
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,479
contracting the pulling in all the way back to the place where

67
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,840
there's no more sensations of breathing out

68
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,560
breathing in deeply

69
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,120
exhaling fully

70
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:13,840
and then letting the breathing return to normal but continue with that rhythm

71
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,800
and now it's not as dramatic but it's still as you breathe in

72
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,800
feel it's almost like you're riding the expansion writing the movement of

73
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:34,400
filling throughout the torso

74
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:45,840
sometimes i think of it as that being a bird that's soaring and it catches the updraft

75
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,639
on the inhale

76
00:07:53,280 --> 00:08:01,360
and then it glides through the air on the down back to the ground on the exhale

77
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,759
and since we're still beginning here on the exhale you might also for next

78
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:20,080
three or four exhales relax whatever is being held or tight in your

79
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,639
body whatever is easy to relax

80
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:58,800
and partly what you're experiencing is the impact the influence

81
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,880
that breathing has on the body

82
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:11,920
allow yourself to be influenced by the breath allow yourself to

83
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,880
expand as you breathe in

84
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,160
and to feel the sensations of your body

85
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,279
allow yourself to release

86
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,480
on the exhale

87
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:43,399
and feel all the sensations of your body that come into play as you exhale

88
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:05,760
where the focus is on that rhythm of movement through your body

89
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:13,680
let that be the center so that you're not centered in your thinking

90
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:20,240
reacting and preferences also you're not centered in your

91
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:29,120
emotions but you're not ignoring them either if there's a mood or emotion

92
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,640
feel it in your body and let that rhythm stay with a rhythm

93
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,279
where the rhythm moves through

94
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,920
the physical sensations of how you feel

95
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:39,690
[Music]

96
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,619
[Music]

97
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:46,799
like the waves wash up on the sandy shore over and over again

98
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:55,159
without any concern with the sand or the

99
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,520
the weather or anything just keeps washing up and down

100
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:07,679
so see if you can ride the breathing

101
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:14,559
feeling your whole body as you breathe in whole body as you breathe out

102
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,600
in that rhythm of expansion and contraction

103
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,720
as if it's forever un untroubled

104
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:33,080
by anything that it moves through any way it feels

105
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,320
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

106
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,039
if you're feeling the inhales an expansion through the body

107
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:27,360
imagine that your care

108
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:33,279
continues as you expand out across the land

109
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,480
out across the world

110
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:45,960
as if your heart can be open and expansive and

111
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,799
touch all the places all the suffering in this world

112
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:02,159
and as you exhale you return deeply inside yourself

113
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,760
to touch the place where you care

114
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,880
where your compassion your love resides

115
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:21,600
your tenderness it's in that rhythm of breathing in and

116
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,720
breathing out expanding as you breathe in

117
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,200
expanding outwards to the whole world

118
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:40,559
as the inhale can coming back the sensations return

119
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:48,480
touching your place of care friendliness kindness

120
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,880
back and forth

121
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:14,640
and may this meditation we've done together serve for our ability

122
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,679
to care for this world to care for our friends our family our neighbors our

123
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:25,480
strangers to care for the whole world

124
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:34,880
so that maybe in some ways known and unknown intentional or unintentionally

125
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:42,320
we live for the welfare and happiness of all may all beings

126
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,600
be happy may all beings

127
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:55,440
be safe may all beings be peaceful

128
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:02,278
and may all beings everywhere be free

129
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:14,040

130
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:22,390
[Music]

131
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,840
so good day and

132
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,279
so we continue to explore and i hope you explore

133
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:30,559
uh your capacity for awareness for attention

134
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:37,200
and how the attention to breathing can be supportive and helpful

135
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,399
and one of the ways it's helpful is that the more you can

136
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:49,120
be connected to your breathing following the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out

137
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:55,440
the less mental energy attention is available

138
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:01,120
to feed thinking if all our attention energy mental

139
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,799
energy goes into thinking we reinforce it and if what we're thinking about is not helpful

140
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:12,799
it's maybe debilitating even that we're reinforcing that unhelpful kind of

141
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:19,360
trains of thoughts but if we pour our attention into the simplicity

142
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:26,640
of breathing then that is considered in buddhism to be very wholesome and helpful that leads to

143
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:33,679
all kinds of good states of mind some people might feel like their concerns what they have are so important

144
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:41,440
that they have to think them some people can't help because there's so much energy in thinking so that even if they

145
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:51,120
don't want to it's just like mind gets pulled into it so strongly but it helps maybe to consider that

146
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:57,039
that sometimes we have to retreat from certain challenges to get refreshed

147
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:03,200
to put ourselves in a good state of mind so that we can come back and address them better

148
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:10,720
that's one of the functions of meditation is not to withdraw from life and not be part of it but rather to

149
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,720
step away in a sense by closing your eyes and meditating not being involved in the usual thing

150
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:22,480
but more importantly to step away from the mind's preoccupation with things

151
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:28,960
long enough to get refreshed long enough then to return with a

152
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,080
better kind of inner eyesight better wisdom to how to address it

153
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:40,240
so the rhythm of breathing uh is a place so there's something about rhythms of things

154
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,760
that it's easier to kind of stay and follow like the rhythm of the waves

155
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,200
washing across the shore you some people just didn't watch it for a long time just watching it something

156
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:59,840
about it that you you wouldn't be if you're just a completely still lake and the water is not moving

157
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,880
it doesn't have the same kind of absorption in it as i do the movement

158
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:11,679
so like a flowing uh river for example it's possible to watch that for a long time or watching a fire in the fireplace

159
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:18,640
just watch all the patterns of moving and coming and going and appearing and disappearing

160
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:24,559
it's much more stressful if you just fixate your attention on a single point someplace

161
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:30,159
and then don't move it there's something about the eyes moving gently

162
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:36,960
and the mind moving gently kind of following something lightly without the word doing work and rather than

163
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:43,919
stress just kind of doesn't get very relaxed about it and so with the breathing the idea is to kind of find that place of

164
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:49,840
relaxed attention like you're watching the river flow by to watch the movements and the rhythm of

165
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:55,840
breathing in and breathing out and so if you're too focused on being concentrated

166
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,960
and bear down on it that's actually stressful but if

167
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,399
if you don't have enough attention on the breathing the mind will want to offer under often the thought

168
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:13,760
and the middle way between not having enough attention and having too much kind of tight attention

169
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:20,720
is a kind of alertness of the mind that's relaxed a kind of engagement with the breathing

170
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:26,159
that's more like a play or more like love

171
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,679
than it is like work and um so it does involve some kind of getting absorbed

172
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:37,919
getting involved in it settling in and that's one of the reasons why sometimes i give these images that go

173
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:43,760
along with it like today i get an image of um the bird soaring on the in-breath

174
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:50,320
and somehow the way you know the as a as the updraft of the inhale as the movements

175
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,440
of the body to go up um to expand occur if you imagine that

176
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:03,279
like your wings are catching that then maybe it's a little more compelling to kind of oh ride it

177
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:08,399
and then sliding down again with the exhale

178
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:16,240
that might give a kind of a sense of how to do this without a lot of work but stay really closely connected to it

179
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:23,039
um or the image i like a lot is that of also is that as i used also the waves washing up across the sandy

180
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:28,399
shore back and forth back and forth so i don't know if that works for all of

181
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:33,679
you but it's so something that works for me in terms of helping me kind

182
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:40,480
of find the right balance between not being tight or forceful in the attention

183
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,840
but also not to lax with it just right there and then

184
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:52,000
and it's it's with time it's self-reinforcing with time as more attention goes into

185
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:00,000
breathing and less into thinking it mind finds itself more and more easy to get absorbed to be present for it

186
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,320
now one of the things that can help also with the breathing is uh it is current instructions it's

187
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:13,440
not just the breathing but to ride the breath be with the breath and experience the whole body

188
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:20,320
we experience the whole breath body as the all the different ways in which the movement of breathing comes into play in

189
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:27,200
the body both both course the bigger ones like the movements of the chest perhaps or the diaphragm or the belly

190
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:33,599
but also more subtle like it could be the back rib cage if you're very sensitive you can feel

191
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:40,079
a little movements of the spine as you move maybe the upper spine can move and

192
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:47,520
you can sometimes i can feel it right down into my hip joint i can feel ever so slightly alternating sense of

193
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:54,638
pressure and release of pressure as i breathe in and breathing out the shoulders can move

194
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:00,160
so all these places in the body kind of and and so this expansion into that

195
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:05,599
breath body experience the sensations are breathing and as you beco as we're aware of all

196
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:11,280
that uh chances are sometimes that uh that's also a place where you

197
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:17,680
feel your emotions maybe you feel sadness in the area of the heart and so that's also that's in

198
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:23,200
the area of this expanding of the chest as you breathe and

199
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:30,640
and so include that as part of experiencing the whole body but explain included not as an emotion at this point

200
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:37,920
in the practice but as just more physical sensations it's almost like um

201
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,320
you know this is as the war as the waves wash across the sand maybe there's some

202
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:50,560
seaweed there that's on there and it washes around or a sand castle someone built and mostly washes around it and

203
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:56,720
it's kind of untroubled by it but just comes and goes and washes washes around it to the side of it and

204
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:03,359
slowly the sand castle dissolves so maybe some of the emotions difficult motions dissolve if we just kind of

205
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:08,480
let it rock let it move or that it will be washed over but the more important thing that it

206
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,760
dissolving is that to have the experience of feeling the this

207
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:20,079
physicality the sensations of emotions without being troubled by it without making a story about it

208
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:27,680
when we feel emotions as emotions many of us have ideas beliefs concerns identifications

209
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:33,760
with it that make it sometimes more complicated it needs to be and to just feel the emotions there's

210
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,680
the physicality of it in this rhythm of breathing in and breathing out

211
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:45,040
moving through you and just feeling back and forth back and forth

212
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:50,160
and no matter what happens not being concerned with what happens

213
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,200
with the emotions just be concerned about moving through it and back and

214
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:00,960
forth and and um you know maybe it's a little bit like um

215
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:06,800
um you know like i like the idea of you know petting a cat so that you're petty

216
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:12,720
you know whatever is going on the sensations the awareness moving through the body it's like just stroking the cat

217
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:19,040
stroking a cat and whether it's difficult or not and so what we're learning here is how

218
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:26,000
to be involved with breathing without getting pulled away into the world of the mind

219
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,320
and thoughts and ideas and concerns and as i've said i said before this is

220
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:39,200
not meant to be a denial or pushing away or dismissing of how we're feeling

221
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:45,839
but it is very respectful to feel the physicality of it without adding all the stuff on top of it

222
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:52,560
and also it's a way of becoming refreshed or create more clarity

223
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:58,800
so that we have a more useful way of being present for the challenges of our life

224
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:05,839
then sometimes the usual way we bring along so much baggage with us as we go along

225
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:12,079
so learning to breathe through experiences learning to breathe with experiences

226
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:17,839
is one of the great skills that can come from this practice and so whatever is happening breathe

227
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:24,320
with it breathe through it stay grounded in your breathing and learn how to breathe with it breathe through it and

228
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:30,000
you might find that you end up being more balanced that way

229
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,280
you might find that you become less reactive that way less tense that way

230
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:42,720
um just breathe with whatever's happening so um

231
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:51,040
so in this teachings of the buddha the buddha begins by emphasizing taking a

232
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:56,400
supportive meditation posture and establishing awareness with the

233
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,760
breathing so this is you know this this is where the the

234
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:07,839
the this is where we're anchored this is where we're going to be rooted for the meditation and the breathing of

235
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:13,440
course it's not easy to be rooted there but that's the understanding and then become aware of what breathing

236
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:20,320
feels like the sensations of breathing get more familiar with it and hang out with breathing and stay with it

237
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:26,000
and especially the rhythm of the breathing and then as you get settled into it

238
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,599
then as you breathe in feel the whole breath body feel the whole influence that has

239
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:37,760
the movements of breathing heaven the body and as you exhale feel the whole influence

240
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:43,119
and why i use the word influence is that um uh

241
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:49,520
is that to a is that we don't there's a lot of different ways in which breathing can affect us

242
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:57,520
uh not just it affects us the physical movements of the body but it can there's a kind of um

243
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:04,640
relaxation there's an opening there's softening there's there's all kinds of emotional also impacts that

244
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:12,000
good emotional impact that breathing can have and so just to have the sense of allowing yourself to be influenced by it

245
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,359
being open rather than being the one who's directing the show be the one who's receiving

246
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:25,599
the full experience of breathing in throughout the body the full experience of breathing out throughout the body

247
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:33,119
so i hope that this kind of encouragement around breathing and exploring it and

248
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:39,440
discovering it encourages you to take your time to become more familiar with your breathing

249
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:45,520
and and more familiar with the skill of breathing with things and what's happening breathing through and

250
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:52,079
breathing with the whole body staying connected there even sometimes when you're talking or engaged in work what

251
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:58,240
happens if you're breathing with that experience and even if you've meditated for a long

252
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:05,520
time i think there's always room to discover more and find greater value with breathing

253
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:11,280
so if this uh appeals to you you might spend the next 24 hours

254
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:18,000
more with this experience of breathing in experiencing the whole body

255
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:24,720
breathing out experience the body just really feeling that experience get familiar with it make it second nature

256
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:30,400
to be connected to it and discover all the things that open up

257
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,760
when uh you're with your body with your breathing that maybe it won't open up if

258
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,520
you just stay kind of locked into your mental concerns and thoughts

259
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:48,119
so thank you and i look forward to being here tomorrow

260
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,599
you
