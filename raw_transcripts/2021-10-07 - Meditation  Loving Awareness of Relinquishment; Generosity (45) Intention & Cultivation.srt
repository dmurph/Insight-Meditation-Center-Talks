6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:46,879
the inner dimensions and the outer dimensions of the practice of generosity

7
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,920
as a support for liberation and also as a support for

8
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,559
as a basis for compassion so generosity both as a basis for

9
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:05,680
compassion and liberation necessary the building blocks of both

10
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,840
and as we've been building these practices and exploring different

11
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:18,670
aspects today what we'll explore in the guided meditation

12
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:25,439
[Music] is the aspect of bringing mindfulness mindfulness to this

13
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:33,759
letting go to this part of component of generosity which is the release the letting go

14
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:42,159
and i'll say more about the different aspects and the dharma in terms of

15
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:48,720
bringing mindfulness and different ways of cultivation so

16
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,799

17
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,079
together so

18
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:08,280
landing [Music] landing in our chair landing in our cushion in our bodies

19
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,400
creating ourselves greeting ourselves greeting this body in this moment

20
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:33,760
noticing what it needs how can we be generous to ourselves in this moment

21
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:41,040
ah does generosity mean a shift in posture

22
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,720
maybe getting a shawl or a blanket

23
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:56,120
or landing with a deep breath in our sit bones

24
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,440
appreciating [Music] the sensations the feelings of

25
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,840
connection [Music] of her feet on the earth noticing

26
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,599
yes feet legs sit bones

27
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,440
connecting [Music] to the floor to the cushion

28
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,200
standings for the earth yes

29
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:50,319
appreciating [Music] the connection the holding the support

30
00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:01,840
same way that a newborn is cradled and held held supported

31
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:09,360
in the arms of a parent

32
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,799
we are held

33
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,479
held by the earth

34
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:39,120
appreciating the connection letting go letting go trusting [Music]

35
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,120
trusting that we are held gravity is not going to change its mind

36
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,800
letting go of the weight

37
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:57,280
of the body the limbs the muscles

38
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:04,479
trusting trusting the earth with its gravity holding connecting

39
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,880
ah

40
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:17,039
the delight of this heaviness

41
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,680
which also has an aspect of lightness

42
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,479
uplift

43
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,440
felt in our aspiration in our breath

44
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:43,759
our bodies supported connected grounded into the earth

45
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:57,669
and our breath filling [Music]

46
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,759
lightening every nook and cranny

47
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,400
now this body breathing in life

48
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:18,720
breathing in aliveness waking us up making each cell up

49
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,520
as if we were as if this body

50
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,319
were a beach ball

51
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:43,840
getting inflated more full or a pop-up doll

52
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,639
with each inhale exhale breathing life

53
00:06:52,639 --> 00:07:00,360
to all the areas that are contracted crinkly deflated

54
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,599
feeling this body come alive fill out from the inside

55
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:20,800
mindfully with loving kindness with loving awareness

56
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,599
with the breath

57
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,840
allowing it to happen on its own

58
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,080
there's no doing for you to do just notice that it's happening on its own

59
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,120
already with each breath

60
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,279
receiving each breath

61
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,519
with a little appreciation

62
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:09,200
lowering our center of gravity so we're not in our heads but the center of gravity of awareness

63
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:17,680
is low low in our lower abdomen our sit bones

64
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,040
not in the control tower of the head

65
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:33,879
as if your mind was in your belly

66
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,640
receiving the sensations the breath

67
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,360
and the belly

68
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,600
allowing mindfulness awareness awareness to be

69
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,560
spacious

70
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:28,839
loving awareness lovingly aware

71
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,320
let it be spacious as if we are sitting

72
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:51,680
as if we're sitting in this container this supportive container

73
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,639
spacious wide

74
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,880
gracious

75
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,720
the body can relax

76
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,920
the mind and heart can relax

77
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,720
into the spaciousness of awareness

78
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:40,399
whatever arises and passes

79
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:52,600
in this sphere of loving awareness

80
00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:00,399
it's known it gets known effortlessly

81
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,399
non-judgmentally

82
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:10,720
landing relaxing in this space of loving awareness with the body

83
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:18,639
if and when [Music] it is noticed

84
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,760
that there is an entanglement

85
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:31,839
that has arisen which is which is not helpful in this moment

86
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:39,279
knowing the entanglement non-judgmentally oh this this is what the mind is

87
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,079
resting on now

88
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,160
celebrating the moment of awareness

89
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:08,560
then as the mind inclines opens its

90
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,880
fist its hand to let go to relinquish

91
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,120
this movement of the mind letting go

92
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:35,600
bringing mindfulness even more awareness to what is present

93
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,480
the intention around it

94
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,959
how it is done the attitude of the mind

95
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:58,160
yesterday i invited you to notice if there was joy in letting go

96
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,600
notice if that's present or any other attitude

97
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,199
or intention in the mind

98
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:17,079
the moment surrounding this relinquishing letting go

99
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:31,279
and returning to rest in the spacious awareness

100
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:40,240
of all things including the breath and sensations coming and

101
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,240
going

102
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:30,679
is there anything any attitude that blocks sense of generosity to ourselves

103
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,400
generosity to the mind and heart

104
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,200
not to go looking for it

105
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:01,559
but if it presents itself to see see clearly

106
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,280
infusing this loving awareness

107
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,080
as if dropping a little drop of color

108
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:20,799
to your awareness the drop of color being the question

109
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:28,720
the curiosity what blocks generosity

110
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,919
to myself the heart and mind

111
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:41,840
generosity in the form of love compassion

112
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:50,280
or wisdom in the way of letting go relinquishing

113
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:04,640
if any there may not be anything revealing itself

114
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:12,440
relishing the peace and joy of this moment

115
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:49,640
can there be a sense of trust in the abundance in this heart and mind

116
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:43,600
and as we approach the end of the sitting together

117
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,600
inviting loving awareness

118
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:58,320
to hold to be aware of what's good

119
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:05,279
of the goodness that we have showed up

120
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:10,080
we've practiced as well as we were able to

121
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:16,480
not attaching to the outcome we did our best

122
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:22,640
if it could have been any different it would have been

123
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,840
given all the causes and conditions we have done our best

124
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:35,279
to trust and not judge it's for it to be

125
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:42,080
lesser of lesser value to appreciate the goodness

126
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:48,240
the beauty the merit generated

127
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:56,480
from our wholesome intention [Music] ah and from this sense of appreciation

128
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,440
gratitude

129
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:08,399
feeling the abundance of our hearts for this opportunity with this opportunity

130
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:13,039
to practice and share the goodness

131
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:19,279
freely generously

132
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:26,799
with all beings everywhere may all beings everywhere including

133
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:31,960
ourselves may we benefit

134
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:38,159
in ways unfathomable from the goodness

135
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:45,279
of our intentions and actions may all beings be free

136
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,799
may all beings be happy

137
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:12,880
thank you for your practice greetings dear sangha

138
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:19,039
so for today the fourth day of our exploration with

139
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,799
this beautiful and

140
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:30,480
important theme of practice generosity

141
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:36,720
not as a moralistic vow shall be generous but as a way as a

142
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:43,039
movement of the heart as a as a beautiful lovely gracious movement

143
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:47,840
of the heart towards ourselves and towards others

144
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:56,720
so so as i invited us to

145
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:02,799
at some point to bring interest loving interest

146
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:08,559
curiosity gentle curiosity to to the intention

147
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:13,840
and if there is a lack of generosity at any point in our practice

148
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:19,440
i wanted to today talk about um

149
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:25,440
some things that might block or not not support generosity or attitudes

150
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:33,519
or or our own judgments about it just to to bring awareness bring loving awareness

151
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:39,360
it's not a moralistic practice it's just to know it's a practice like anything else

152
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:44,640
the same way that with mindfulness we cultivate

153
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:51,120
awareness and we don't judge ourselves ouch bad you were bad you are not mindful it's not about that it's just oh

154
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,159
yeah mindfulness is lacking right now okay how can i support it

155
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:02,960
maybe i'll sit upright a little more maybe i breathe a little more deeply if i'm sleepy oh yeah that's how i can support

156
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:09,599
it so um it's a way of understanding understanding the system and how can we

157
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:15,040
support ourselves on the path to liberation how

158
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:20,800
how can we support ourselves for our hearts to be free it's just about that

159
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:26,158
and the moralistic should or judgment or judgment does not support

160
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,960
our hearts and freedom it it contracts it

161
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,800
so

162
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:47,960
one quote i wanted to share from the buddha which i find so inspiring

163
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:53,358
it's from itty wutaka 18 and

164
00:34:53,359 --> 00:35:00,400
the buddha says practitioners if people knew as i know

165
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:08,320
the fruits of sharing gifts they would not enjoy their use without sharing them

166
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:14,560
nor would the tame taint of stinginess obsess the heart

167
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:21,760
even if it were their last bite their last morsel of food they

168
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,359
would not enjoy its use without sharing it if there was someone else to share it

169
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:34,560
with so he's pointing to if people knew as i

170
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,960
know if people knew as i know

171
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:47,040
then they would not then they would not even if it was their last morsel of food

172
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:52,560
they would not enjoy its use without sharing it they would enjoy

173
00:35:52,560 --> 00:36:00,160
sharing it even more they would enjoy them more so even more if they shared it so and trusting the buddhist wisdom

174
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:06,320
and and also looking into our own experience um [Music]

175
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:11,920
that that generosity it frees our own heart it

176
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:17,280
frees our own heart it brings us joy it's it's a deep goodness that's really

177
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,880
the buddha here is inviting us if people knew as i know if people knew as i know

178
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:29,839
so come come see for yourself hey pasago come see for yourself come experience

179
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:38,240
for yourself so not just trusting the words of the buddha but come see for yourself explore it for yourself

180
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:45,920
and um similarly when they asked gandhi why do

181
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:51,119
you give so much why do you serve all these people

182
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:58,880
gandhi answered answered i don't give to anyone i do it all for myself

183
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:04,240
that's interesting right i do it all for myself which really points to again

184
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:10,960
similarly it points to these two quotes point to that the aim and the

185
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,160
fruit of generosity donna as a practice is twofold

186
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:21,440
it's we give to help and free others but we're

187
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:27,359
giving to help and free ourselves that's the beautiful dimension the twofold

188
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:34,720
dimension of ghana we're doing it to free ourselves so with this spirit with this setup then

189
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:42,160
now let's bring our awareness to to this process to the internal process

190
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:48,000
is there joy in giving as i was inviting you to to tune into that because there

191
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,320
can be joy there is joy in in generosity

192
00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:00,560
is there and uh and also to to notice if what happens in the body what happens in

193
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:06,880
the mind is there sometimes perhaps a sense of a lack that

194
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:12,480
there isn't enough um that the heart feels contracted

195
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:19,760
sometimes maybe you know in thinking about giving thinking about relinquishing

196
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:25,200
is there a sense of ease and openness and loving kindness and compassion in

197
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,560
the heart mind and body sometimes there might be sometimes maybe there's a feeling of

198
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:36,720
depletion weakness fear anger confusion the body and mind so being curious about

199
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:42,560
this all not be ashamed of it um just be a scientist of your own mind

200
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:48,720
what is going on what what is happening uh with with uh

201
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:54,160
generosity um what's happening in my mind what's happening in my body

202
00:38:54,160 --> 00:39:03,119
um are there are there stories do i have stories ideals some beliefs as to how it

203
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:08,560
should be how giving should be how it's supposed to be how it's not supposed to

204
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:15,280
be seeing both those stories as well as um

205
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:22,240
if there are seeing our own intentions and again here be generous with yourself when you're

206
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:29,040
seeing your own intentions because our intentions can be mixed and

207
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:35,520
it's okay it's perfectly okay just see just see there could be this beautiful

208
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:41,359
intention of oh yes i want i want you to be happy i'm i would like to give this

209
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:47,920
to you may you be well in some cases say we're giving a gift we're giving a big gift like oh i want

210
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:54,560
you to like me also or i want you to see me as generous or i want you to

211
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:00,560
to give me a bigger gift it's okay see those it's all right we're we're mixed

212
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:05,920
bags as human beings get to see get to see don't be ashamed

213
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:12,000
to see what comes up but get to know with mindfulness with loving

214
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,000
um awareness get to know get to know yourself

215
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:25,520
and trust and trust that generosity is a purifying practice over time

216
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:30,560
as you get to see the intentions as you get to see what is

217
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:37,599
arising in the heart and mind it gets purified it's a practice like anything else it's we're not supposed to be born

218
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:43,680
perfectly generous people it's it's it's it's a practice

219
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:50,720
and and a couple of practices to support

220
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:57,200
are this cultivation one is as i mentioned yesterday gratitude

221
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:03,200
supports gratitude supports generosity the more grateful we are the more we feel the

222
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:08,640
abundance of our life of our heart the more our hearts want to release let

223
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:16,000
go of everything let go of of grudges let's go of lack of generosity of spirit and

224
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,838
be more generous so cultivating gratitude cultivates generosity

225
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:28,720
also what cultivates generosity again as a way of letting go as a way of

226
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:34,480
freeing our hearts is is the practice it's said that

227
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:40,560
the more we practice generosity the more generous we become and the more generous we become the more we practice

228
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:47,040
generosity so it's a virtual cycle it is said that in the tibetan culture

229
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:52,400
there is this practice of you hold um you give a potato from one hand to the

230
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:58,319
other you give yourself a potato you know one hand gives something to the other ears you know you give something

231
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:03,760
so that you practice you know one hand practices letting go to the other and then

232
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:10,160
apparently as i've heard this practice then you practice with more and more precious objects you know one hand gives

233
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:17,280
it to the other so you get the sense of yes this is what to let go of this is what what it's like to let go and and

234
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,400
really feeling so similarly cultivating

235
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:29,920
um this this this relinquishment and tuning into the joy tuning into the ah

236
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:37,760
lightness that it brings and and tomorrow i'll talk more about given

237
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,960
that it's our last day and it's it's the culmination of

238
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:48,800
four days of practice i'd like to talk more tomorrow about the

239
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:55,599
practice of generosity as a liberative practice we talked more about we talked about it before but i

240
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:02,240
want to talk more about generosity and generosity of spirit etc tomorrow

241
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:07,680
one last thing i want to bring in today before we close

242
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:13,040
is another quote from the buddha from an 5 148

243
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:18,480
which is how a person of integrity gives a gift

244
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:23,920
and buddhist says there are these five are

245
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:29,280
a person of integrity's gift which five a

246
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:34,880
person of integrity gives a gift with a sense of conviction

247
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:41,920
so number one sense of conviction number two a person of integrity gives a

248
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:47,599
gift attentively person of integrity gives a gift in

249
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:52,880
season a person of integrity gifts gives a gift

250
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:59,280
with an empathetic heart with a loving heart

251
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:07,599
number five a person of integrity gives a gift without adversely affecting himself themselves or others

252
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:14,000
so the last one the person of integrity gives the gift without adversely affecting themselves or others and the

253
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:20,240
last one is important also um not giving too little not giving too

254
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:27,200
much so the act of giving of course mindfully it needs to be supportive of others

255
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:33,760
supportive of ourselves so generosity is goes both direction

256
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:39,680
it's not just about completely giving everything and feeling

257
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:47,280
as i mentioned feeling there's weakness depletion so it needs to really work both ways so the five again in case you

258
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,838
missed it sense of conviction

259
00:44:53,839 --> 00:45:00,400
attentively giving the gift attentively giving a gift that is in season yet the

260
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:06,319
person needs it it's not something you're trying to just get rid of it's it's appropriate it's a gift that's

261
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:13,920
appropriate giving the gift with a loving empathetic

262
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:20,160
gender empathetic loving heart heart with meta and finally

263
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:25,280
giving a gift without adversely affecting oneself and others

264
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:31,680
so thank you all for the gift of your attention and your practice

265
